In 2014, Range achieved some key milestones that I believe position the company well for the future. Range recorded record levels of production, reserves, revenue, net income, cash flow and cash flow per share in 2014. Thanks to continued cost structure improvements and steady production growth, despite declining realized prices, our cash flow and cash flow per share have increased. 
2015 is setting up to be a challenging year. Fortunately, we did several things in 2014 that will help us in 2015. With the redemption of our fixed rate 8% bonds with the proceeds from an equity offering, coupled with the cash proceeds we received from our Conger for Nora swap, we ended 2014 with less that than 2013. Debt per Mfce approved reserves was $0.30 at year-end 2014 compared to the prior year at $0.38. 
Last fall, we restructured and extended our senior bank facility for 5 years to 2019 and increased our borrowing base from $2 billion to $3 billion. We have no bonds maturing until 2020. 
We have continued with our capital and operating efficiencies. From 2014, we improved our operating efficiency by decreasing our unit cost, $0.35 or $0.10 -- 10% versus the prior year and expect continued improvement this year. Our capital efficiency improved as we continue to drill longer laterals, pump frac more stages per lateral and utilize improved targeting of lateral. We believe this trend will also continue into 2015. 
We currently have hedged approximately 65% of our projected 2015 natural gas production with the $4 floor and approximately 77% of our projected oil production with a $90.57 floor. 
On the natural gas liquids side, the Mariner East project is still projected to be on time with the startup in the third quarter of this year. When fully operational, even with the today's pricing, given Range specific contracts and the combined benefits from propane and ethane, this is projected to be approximately $90 million uplift as compared to selling the ethane as natural gas net of all transportation and processing fees. 
In 2014, we grew production 24%. We grew reserves, 26%, and we ended 2014 by testing our first Utica well in the Washington County at a rate of 59 million cubic feet per day, which we believe is a new record for any well in any horizon in the Appalachian Basin. 
As I previously mentioned, we accomplished a lot in 2014 that will help us into 2015. We also have recently taken additional steps to help drive our performance in 2015 and '16. We cut our 2015 capital budget to $870 million. This is approximately $700 million reduction from 2014. Given the quality of our assets and team, coupled with continuing improved capital efficiencies, we're targeting 20% growth for 2015 even with the reduced capital. 
Importantly, this growth occur sequentially throughout the year, which sets up Range well for 2016. 
We also made a tough decision to close our Oklahoma City office and operate our Mid-continent properties out of Forth Worth. Given that approximately 97% of our capital is currently targeted to Appalachia, we believe this is a right decision for the company, and it will lead to by the capital allocation for Range and improve integration of technology coupled with cost savings. 
Range is advantaged, given our core acreage position in the Marcellus. We have approximately 1.5 [ph] million net acres of stacked pay potential in Southwest and Northeast Pennsylvania that is prospective for Marcellus, Utica and Upper Devonian. Plus our acreage position is further advantaged in that we can selectively drill direct drilling capital towards the dry, wet or super-rich portions of the plant. 
Coupling this with our processing, pipeline takeaway capacity and unique NGL marketing agreements, Range is well positioned for 2015, 2016 and beyond. 
Gas demand is projected to increase in 2015 from coal plant retirements, gas exports for Mexico, and later this year, LNG exports. Given the large capital cuts from a large number of companies in our industry, which is resulting in a rapidly declining rig count and deferred completions. We may see a production response in oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids later this year. The combination of slowing supply growth, coupled with increasing demand, should help bring the markets closer in balance this year. 
I'll now turn the call over to Ray to discuss operations."

While we're focused on the headwinds that we face in 2015, when we pause to look back at 2014, 2014 was a record year across many aspects of our operations. We set records in production, reserves, cash flow and earnings along with significant improvements in cost structure and capital efficiency. 
We continue to see great results in well performance in both Southwest and Northeast Pennsylvania, and like Jeff said, we completed our first Washington County Utica well. While it's only a single well, based on the early results and all the previous data, we have approximately 400,000 net acres in what we believe could be the core of the dry Utica and gives Range another significant growth opportunity to add to our core positions in the Marcellus and Upper Devonian and Southwest Pennsylvania. 
In 2014, we also put together both halves of the Northfield and Virginia, given us control of operations and the early results were outstanding. We have the ability to significantly grow that asset and one of the best gas markets on the East Coast in the future. 
And in the Mid-Continent area, we saw continued confirmation of the geologic modeling in the Chat along the Nemaha Ridge, leading to some of the best well performance to date in that play. 
I'm also really proud of all of our employees for working all of 2014 without a lost time incident, safety, environmental protections and regulatory compliance our a core philosophy at Range, and I want to personally congratulate everyone across the company for a job well done in 2014. We had a great year, adding reserves at record low, drillbit, F&B cost, while decreasing the PUD percentage and the startup of Mariner East early propane was another significant step in our liquids marketing strategy in Appalachia, further positioning Range with unique and advantaged opportunities. 
Recognizing the challenging commodity price environment that Jeff described in his remarks, I know most of you today are primarily focused on our plans for '15. 
As we announced previously, we've set the capital budget at $870 million, which is 46% lower than our 2014 CapEx, and we've targeted year-over-year production growth of 20%. Nearly 95% of that budget is directed towards the Marcellus, with over 90% of those dollars directed to Southwest Pennsylvania. 85% of our total capital is directed to the drillbit for 2015 as we significantly decreased our planned spending on land, exploration and seismic. 
We're able to make these changes and still target 20% growth for several reasons. Let me walk you through just a few of them. Number one, we have an experienced team and great leadership with a proven track record of growing production and reserves consistently, with one of the lowest cost structures and one of the best plays in the industry. This has been our philosophy at Range for many years. Number two, most importantly, and one of my favorites sayings, the rock rules. And this has proven to be the case throughout history across many plays and through multiple commodity price cycles. It simply means that where you find the best reservoir quality, meaning the best rock, the economics are substantially better than noncore acres. And when a company can maintain a low-cost structure in the quorum [ph] play, that company can sustain its growth at attractive economics across the up-and-down cycles of commodity prices. 
Range has what we believe is a core position in the Marcellus, Upper Devonian and Utica, allowing us to focus capital in those areas with the best economics whether they are dry, wet or super-rich and continue to achieve production growth in 2015 and beyond. 
And number three, Range has had a consistent strategy of 20% to 25% growth at a low-cost structure for many years. This has allowed us to implement innovative, attractive and long-term marketing and midstream arrangements that positions us well for what we face going forward. It has allowed us to keep our balance sheet strong and maintain liquidity. This strategy has also allowed our operating teams to achieve continued improvements in well performance and operational efficiencies, while at the same time, lowering our cost structure, and we expect to continue to see those improvements going forward. 
So getting into some details about 2015, let me start with our Southern Marcellus shale division. For 2015, we're planning to turn to sales approximately 101 Marcellus wells, 35 dry, 40 wet, and 26 super-rich with average completed lateral length of over 6,000 feet with 30 stages. Well timing is expected to be similar to prior years and therefore, our production growth profile is also expected to be similar with sequential growth quarter-by-quarter throughout the year, given us momentum as we go into 2016. 
To help investors and forecasting Range's production growth, we've updated our presentation for each area in the Marcellus the specific type curves that are representative of the wells planned to be turned to sales rather than the wells planned to be drilled as we've previously shown. 
The 2015 type curves that you'll find in our updated presentation on the website correspond to how our wells are planned to be produced and support our expectation of 20% growth for 2015. As we've described many times in the past, it's our practice to focus on optimizing our gathering system based on managing our cost structure to provide the best overall project returns. This results in lower initial rates to sales and flatter declines as the gathering system is built out over time and new processing plants and compressors are installed. 
Actual performance as it pertains to the overall project is what matters, and in Southwest Pennsylvania in the current environment, we believe our well performance and returns are some of the best. 
Importantly, Range's EUR projection in each of the Marcellus areas has increased in 2015 compared to the prior year estimates. While total well cost has come down, again, illustrating the quality of our Marcellus acreage and the continued improvements in capital efficiency. 
In the past, we've made substantial enhancements to our completion designs, such as improved lateral targeting, RCS, enhanced proppant placement, greener additives, super frac and substantial reservoir modeling, both historical and predictive just to name a few. These enhancements have led to bigger EURs and lower costs year-after-year. We'll be continuing with that focus on innovation and technology going forward. And I believe we'll continue to see positive changes in 2015 and beyond. 
Illustrating a specific example of this, I'll call your attention to a new slide in our presentation, Slide #35, which follows up on a couple of wells that we talked about several quarters ago. We drilled 2 infill wells on an existing Marcellus pad that has been producing for over 2 years. By applying the new designs of better targeting, the initial sales of those new wells was significantly higher than the existing wells as we previously reported. After almost a year of production, the new wells, on average, have yielded 53% more than the original wells. And we should not forget that on a normalized basis, the new wells were $850,000 less per well. This example illustrates just one aspect of the capital efficiencies, improved well performance and resulting economics that we've demonstrated today and can expect to see in future years. 
I'll call your attention to Slides 8 and Slides 9 -- Slide #8 and Slide #9 in our updated presentation to point out efficiencies that we've achieved over the past several years. Mainly, in the Southwest Pennsylvania area since 2011 as compared to '15, we've seen a 114% increase from lateral length with a 57% reduction in total well cost per foot of lateral. 
For 2015, as compared to '14, we're planning 20% longer laterals with a 37% reduction in total well cost per foot of lateral. Even though our current 2015 plan turns to sales a few less wells as compared to last year, we're actually planning to pump about the same number of frac stages. This illustrates continued efficiency improvements resulting in lower cost, but also results in a consistent activity level, allowing us to continue to capture improved service and supply pricing. 
Looking at pricing and cost to supply chain. On an apples-to-apples basis, assuming no efficiency improvements, we now have a range in place that have reduced our estimated 2015 well cost by 23% to 25% as compared to December 2014 pricing. We've seen reductions in pricing across all services and supplies, and we believe we'll see more improvements if that activity continues to decrease across the industry. 
Let me point out, again, that we've embedded in our 2015 plan, well cost improvements from high grading our program, continued improvements and designs efficiencies in operations, and the reduction in service and supply cost that we currently have in hand. When you add all these together, you achieve the 37% decrease in total well cost per foot of lateral that I described earlier. If we see further reductions in service and supply pricing, our total well cost will decrease further. This, of course, combined with the diversity of our large core position in Southwest Pennsylvania, allows us to grow with good economics in 2015 whether it's dry, wet or super-rich. 
As a further update on the Utica, we're still planning to drill 2 more wells this year. We believe the total well cost for the second well will be around $13 million and will still include some additional science. It's still very early in the program, but I believe as time goes and we drill more wells, we could see the cost come down other 15% to 25%, as operational efficiencies and design improvements kick in. The plays with 11H [ph], which holds the record IP of 59 million a day is now producing at our designed constraints of 20 million a day. And albeit, very early, and with only a few weeks of production, the well is leading initial expectations. 
Just like I discussed earlier, current production facilities for these wells are designed to optimize the long-term flow and project economics. The first well will be produced to sales on an interruptible basis until this summer when new infrastructure is completed. The second well is planned to come online about that same time, and the third well is planned to be drilled later in the year. 
In the Northeast Pennsylvania on Slide 9, you can see that the lateral length has increased 100% since 2011, with a corresponding 63% decrease in total well cost per lateral foot. For 2015, as compared to '14, we're increasing lateral lengths by 18% [ph] with a 20% decrease in total well cost per foot of lateral. 
The team there had a great year, and we saw a 44% increase in our 90-day rates with a 37 -- with a 30% reduction in well cost, totally attributable to operational efficiencies and improved well designs that were implemented in 2014. We're planning a 1- to 2-rig program this year, resulting in about 14 wells to sales, and we expect those improvements that we saw in 2014 will continue. 
We've cut the CapEx in the Mid-Continent division to approximately $26 million, resulting in 8 [ph] Chat Wells, utilizing targets from the geologic model that has been developed over the past couple of years. As Jeff mentioned, we've made the difficult decision to close the Oklahoma City division office, and we're now operating properties, which is approximately 360,000 net acres and 80 million a day of production with our Fort Worth-based operations team. The field offices across Oklahoma and in the Texas Panhandle will now report to Fort Worth. 
In Nora, we have the distinct advantages of an asset where we either own the minerals or it's held by production combined with having a very flat decline and receiving some of the best gas prices in the country. 
Our plan for 2015 is simply to complete our inventory of wells drilled in late 2014 along with minimal maintenance capital, resulting in a total spend of about $15 [ph] million, with about 25 new wells turned the sales. 
In only a few short months, taken over operations, the team has implemented designs resulting in some of the best results we've seen in that field, and you can see some of those results from Slide 45 in the presentation. 
465,000 net acre position has a tremendous inventory of low-risk projects combined with exploration potential for the coming years. Again, this is an asset that we believe we can ramp a significant volumes with attractive economics in the future. 
In summary, our message today is that we have a great team with a proven track record. We have a large and consolidated position in the core of one the best plays in the world, and history has proven over and over, the rock rules. We continually improve our cost structures, setting us up well to continue to deliver economic growth in the current environment. Our plan of growing at 20% to 25% for many years has enabled us to plan and execute innovative and attractive marketing and midstream arrangements that position us well. We have the balance sheet strength and liquidity to support the operational plan. 
And finally, we have a plan for 20% growth in 2015 to create value by achieving growth consistently and sequentially quarter-by-quarter at attractive economics. All positions us [indiscernible]  
Now over to Roger."

The fourth quarter closed out an excellent financial year for Range. Revenue, cash flow and cash flow per share were all sequentially higher than the third quarter of this year and also, significantly higher than the fourth quarter of last ye",897,"Thanks, Ray. The fourth quarter closed out an excellent financial year for Range. Revenue, cash flow and cash flow per share were all sequentially higher than the third quarter of this year and also, significantly higher than the fourth quarter of last year, while total unit costs were lower. For all of 2014, we set record highs for revenue, EBITDAX, cash flow and cash flow per share. And while we understand that everyone is keenly focused on current commodity prices and 2015 budgets, we should not overlook of these record 2014 results as they properly positioned Range for a more challenging 2015. 
So starting with the income statement. The fourth quarter was much like prior quarters, where we offset lower oil, gas and NGL prices with higher production volumes and lower costs. Our net realized price per Mfce was 17% lower than the fourth quarter of last year, the production was 26% higher and unit costs were 11% lower. And that drove our strong quarterly performance. 
Reported net income was $284 million for the quarter, benefiting from a $341 million pretax mark-to-market gain on our hedge book. Fourth quarter earnings calculated using analyst methodology, which eliminates these noncash mark-to-market entries, was $65 million or $0.39 per fully diluted share. 
Cash flow for the fourth quarter was $273 million, 8% higher than last year, and cash flow per fully diluted share was $1.64. 
EBITDAX for the fourth quarter came in at $310 million, 5% higher than last year. Cash flow and cash flow per share for the full year 2014 was just over $1 billion or $6.33. EBITDAX for the full year was $1.2 billion, and 2014 was the first year that cash flow topped the 1 billion mark. As Rodney mentioned earlier, please reference the various reconciliation tables found on the Range website and earnings release for full reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to GAAP. 
On the expense side, all of our fourth quarter expense items came in at or below guidance, reflecting heightened focus upon cost as oil, gas ang NGL prices waned during quarter. A special mention is the continued decline in our DD&A rate. Our DD&A rate for the fourth quarter was $1.25 per Mfce, down $1 -- down from a $1.36 per Mfce last year and $1.46 per Mfce the year before that. The fourth quarter DD&A rate represents a 48% decline during the past 5 years from the peak rate of $2.41 in Mcfe back in 2009. We expect the DD&A rate to continue falling as we high grade our asset base and become even more capital efficient. 
While there are several non-material positive and negative nonrecurring items, passing through the income statement in the fourth quarter, there is one item that is highly nonrecurring. This item relates to the closing of our Oklahoma City office that Ray and Jeff mentioned and resulting $8 million accrual for severance cost. The office closing will reduce our total company-wide headcount by approximately 8%. 
There are other overhead cost associated with the office closing, besides severance. And the first quarter results will likely include an additional accrual of approximately $8 million to account for these costs. 
When the closure's completed, we expect an annual G&A reduction of approximately $15 million to $18 million or $0.04 per Mfce. And with these savings layered in, beginning in the second quarter of 2015. 
Flipping over to the balance sheet. The first number you may notice is that we ended the year 2014 with less debt than the end of 2013. Aggregate debt and leverage are both down from last year, even though we added 2.1 TCF of proved reserves and grew production by 26%. The steps taken mid-year in 2014 to reduce leverage and interest carry by calling our highest-cost notes has positioned us well for the current more challenging environment. 
Looking forward, our revised interim $70 million capital budget results in a very modest cash flow overspend, which is easily funded by our recently renewed bank facility. 
At year-end 2014, we had over $1 billion in liquidity available under our $2 billion commitment and over $2 billion in available liquidity under our $3 billion borrowing base. 
Another balance sheet number that you may notice is our retained earnings, topping the 1 billion mark for the first time. Considering that for 6 consecutive years, we have seen our realized price per Mfce come down. While cash flow and cash flow per share for the past 6 consecutive years has gone up, we view retained earnings growth as yet another indicator of our improving capital productivity, the quality of our assets, and our relentless focus on growth at low cost. Please reference our fourth quarter earnings release for detailed expense item guidance for the first quarter of 2015. 
The earnings release also contains summary details of our hedged positions on both commodities and basis for 2015, 2016 and 2017. Additionally, detailed hedge volumes and price information may be found on our website. 
To summarize, 2014 brought record high revenue, operating income, cash flow and cash flow per share with record low cash unit cost. The progress we made in 2014 places us on firm ground as we enter 2015. With additional capital efficiencies and cost reductions still to come, we are confident in our ability to continue to deliver consistent growth for many years. 
Jeff, back over to you."

The difference that when you look at those charge on Page -- Slides #8 and 9, what you've seen from 2011 to 2014 has pretty much been a factor of well design improvements, longer laterals, operational efficiencies and the capital efficiency that we've seen during that timeframe. We -- during -- from 2011 [ph] through 2014, we really have never seen service and supply chain cost reductions. So the difference in the slope of that line, if you want to look at it that way, going from '14 to '15, is the service -- or the supply chain side of the -- the pricing reductions that we're seeing. We're seeing discounts across all of the sectors, across all -- from drilling rigs all the way through every piece of it. And I think the jury still out on how much more that we'll see during the year, but I think it will depend on the activity across the industry. But certainly, with all of the capital reductions that we've seen across all of the different plays, we're taking advantage of those every opportunity we get. But that's the big difference. So that what I quoted in my remarks of the 37% reduction that we're seeing from 2014 for the planned average in 2015, is really a combination of well design improvements, operational efficiencies, like we've seen in the past. And we'll continue with all those innovations and then the other is new thing this year is really the difference in well cost from the supply chain side of things."

Overall, they're going to be in we're going to have higher EURs because we'll be drilling longer lateral. And we're also realizing the benefit of lower well cost. With that, this is the constraint situation, if you want to call it or restricted is really the result of success of the programs that we've had over the last several years. It's traditionally, you design systems to maximize the overall value of the whole project as opposed to individual well economics. So with that, we've kind of modeled everything from that standpoint. That's not to say we're not going to -- we're going to stop to not find improvements. We still think that they are going to be able to realize some improvements going forward in terms of looping lines, additional compression. We have a plan coming on scheduled to come on in 2060. We're also looking at improving the pipeline hydraulics that are out there. So we think with that, they're also going to be some improvements that hopefully we'll be able to see over the coming in 2015, '16 and beyond, but with that, we believe this is a great model to be able to get to the 20% growth that we have."

And we're updating that. We now have basically 5 years of production on those tests. And our original protections of about 80% of the 1,000-foot examples is still holding very true. What Slide 35, what the example I called out in our remarks this is show you not only a version of that, but it also shows you the improvement in well designs and operational efficiencies and just better targeting, all of those impacts basically showing the 2 new wells on a normalized per foot of lateral basis produced 53% more production over a year's timeframe than the original wells, which were only 2 years prior. So I think going forward, we have a mix of both of those cases. Now whether the spacing is 500-foot or 700-foot or 900 feet or what the ultimate space is going to be, I think when you look at our core position there In southwest Pennsylvania, it's very large and it's very diverse. We go from super-rich, all the way to dry. And I think as we develop over time, you're going to see some areas in the liquids I would think we're probably end up closer together there. And maybe not us close to dry are, but I don't think at this point time, we could say it's going to all be 500. Because I don't think that's going to be case. But certainly going to be a lot more infill well drilling and when we go back on those existing pads, what's -- it's really important that to point out the improvement in well performance that we're seeing, but you can't also -- you can't forget the decrease in well cost. When you're looking at $850,000 less per well, those economics are going to be outstanding going forward as we go back into redeveloped those areas to fill in the gathering system as we get more room. Gathering cost will come down in those areas, that's going to be some real upside for us going forward."

I think what you've seen us do is focus our capital on the Marcellus for we have a very strong returns, the ability to drill dry, wet and super-rich. So we get strong returns. We get good growth. It's also an area where there's infrastructure ability to grow it. There's contracts in place. We have to hold acreage. There's a lot different factors that blend into that decision to focus in the Marcellus. And I think if you step back and look at it, I would argue there are returns in the Marcellus are as good as any play, really in the U.S. today. So strong returns and yet, it's an area we need to drill to continue to hold acreage which we'll do. When you look at Nora, it's a totally different decision. It's all HBP. In fact, it's better than that mineral in that we own the minerals under the bulk of it. So it has strong returns, strong economics and good gas markets, but that's an area where we have the ability to ramp up when we're ready to do that. Great asset. I think we created a lot of value by putting it together. Again, it's all the strengths that Ray said. We put the 2 pieces together that creates value. We tried new technology. There are some great slides in the book that show what those new wells look like in the appendix. And we still get a premium to NYMEX. And we have the ability to grow and ramp that in probably one of the best, if not the best gas market in the U.S. In the Mid-Continent, the decision to slowdown there was given the returns that we have in other areas. We were putting like I said in my notes, approximately whatever number what 97% or so plus or minus of our capital in Appalachia. So we thought that the most efficient thing to do is to really operate those properties out of Fort Worth. There are significant G&A savings that Roger mentioned. Several million dollars a year in savings. We still think the properties have potential. It's a big footprint, stacked pay, a lot of that is controlled.

I think another key thing to think about too is to really think natural gas demands is going to improve with time as well. And I mentioned it in my notes early on with the macro environment on power plants kicking in the spring of this year, increased exports to Mexico and LNG starting up later this year. we think demand will be up 1 to 2 Bs this year.

Going forward, we think that there's release capacity markets we've already been involved in and getting relatively cheaper, inexpensive firm transport to layer in to the areas we want to get our markets to. Obviously, Slide 37 shows our main objective is to try to get as much of our volume out of Appalachia into other areas Midwest, Gulf Coast and Southeast. And in the future, we want to try to do that as well. We think with rig rates coming down, CapEx budgets being cut, volume -- projected volumes will be coming down and those companies that committed to firm transportation volumes will not be using all of that capacity. So we're going to take advantage of that and get into the release capacity markets and when needed, speak up for some of that release capacity. We're also in discussions with some of the midstream companies about adding layering in additional strategic firm transportation projects that would set our volumes and our needs again, getting the volumes out of the Appalachia base into other areas of the country where the basis is not been quite as volatile and we don't think it will be in the future."

And again, across those 3 things as well as up and down through the various horizons Marcellus, Utica and Upper Devonian. So we have some of ability to shift capital back and forth to try to drive further capital efficiency and better returns. So that's advantage of the portfolio and the size of the footprint that we have. And we'll do that with time. Obviously, as prices swing, as oil swing high to lower gas swings, high to lower NGLs, it's going to affect the economics and we'll do our best to capture the most optimum returns we can. Alan, do you want to answer that?"

But because the projects at the end of the day is what's most important. For the first half of this year, that first well is actually producing on an interruptible basis as we have room to kind of cram it in, so to speak. We are currently building a new pipeline segment that will take it directly to a big pipe essentially. That will be finished sometime this summer. And that is also corresponding with about the time we believe all of this is plus or minus a month at this point. But that's going to correspond with about the same time that the second well is ready for initial production. We will design those facilities for that second well to also limit it to about 20 million a day, but we do expect for the last half of the years that both those wells will be able to produce at their full rate, which is going to again, be limited to 20 million a day each. But with ago come online the summertime and produce the rest of the year kind of on an interruptible basis. And the third well, we'll drill later in the year. At this point, is to early to tell, we're in the planning process of permitting process, effective tax rate was mix year, but it will be somewhere around the end of the year or beginning of next year when the third well is ready. Second well, we think we can do it at about $13 million. It's still got some science in it. And again, I am fully expecting and I think our team is pretty pumped about what we see so far. And they think that we believe that as we go into that program that we can lower those costs and another 15% to 25% as we kick in well designs and different things that we learn going through these first couple of wells.

In 2014, Range achieved some key milestones that I believe position the company well for the future. Range reported record levels of production, reserves, revenue, net income, cash flow and cash flow per share in 2014. Thanks to continued cost structure improvements and steady production growth, despite declining realized prices, our cash flow and cash flow per share have increased. 
2015 is setting up to be a challenging year. Fortunately, we did several things in 2014 that will help us in 2015. With the redemption of our fixed rate 8% bonds with the proceeds from an equity offering, coupled with the cash proceeds we received from our Conger-for-Nora swap, we ended 2014 with less debt than 2013. Debt per mcfe of proved reserves was $0.30 at year-end 2014 compared to the prior year at $0.38. Last fall, we restructured and extended our senior bank facility for 5 years to 2019 and increased our borrowing base from $2 billion to $3 billion. We have no bonds maturing until 2020. 
We have continued with our capital and operating efficiencies. In 2014, we improved our operating efficiency by decreasing our unit cost $0.35 or $0.10 -- or 10% versus the prior year and expect continued improvement this year. Our capital efficiency improved as we continue to drill longer laterals, pump more frac stages per lateral and utilize improved targeting of the lateral. We believe this trend will also continue into 2015. 
We currently have hedged approximately 65% of our projected 2015 natural gas production with the $4 floor and approximately 77% of our projected oil production with a $90.57 floor. 
On the natural gas liquids side, the Mariner East project is still projected to be on time with the startup in the third quarter of this year. When fully operational, even with the today's pricing, given Range-specific contracts and the combined benefits from propane and ethane, this is projected to be approximately a $90 million uplift as compared to selling the ethane as natural gas, net of all transportation and processing fees. 
In 2014, we grew production 24%. We grew reserves 26%, and we ended 2014 by testing our first Utica well in Washington County at a rate of 59 million cubic feet per day, which we believe is a new record for any well in any horizon in the Appalachian Basin. 
As I previously mentioned, we accomplished a lot in 2014 that will help us in 2015. We also have recently taken additional steps to help drive our performance in 2015 and '16. We cut our 2015 capital budget to $870 million. This is approximately a $700 million reduction from 2014. Given the quality of our assets and team, coupled with continuing improved capital efficiencies, we're targeting 20% growth for 2015, even with the reduced capital. Importantly, this growth occurs sequentially throughout the year, which sets up Range well for 2016. 
We also made a tough decision to close our Oklahoma City office and operate our Midcontinent properties out of Forth Worth. Given that approximately 97% of our capital is currently targeted to Appalachia, we believe this is a right decision for the company, and it will lead to better capital allocation for Range and improve the integration of technology coupled with cost savings. 
Range is advantaged given our core acreage position in the Marcellus. We have approximately 1.5 million net acres of stacked pay potential in Southwest and Northeast Pennsylvania that is prospective for Marcellus, Utica and Upper Devonian. Plus our acreage position is further advantaged in that we can selectively drill -- direct drilling capital towards the dry, wet or super-rich portions of the play. Coupling this with our processing, pipeline takeaway capacity and unique NGL marketing agreements, Range is well positioned for 2015, 2016 and beyond. 
Gas demand is projected to increase in 2015 from coal plant retirements, gas exports in Mexico and later this year, LNG exports. Given the large capital cuts from a large number of companies in our industry, which is resulting in a rapidly declining rig count and deferred completions, we may see a production response in oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids later this year. The combination of slowing supply growth, coupled with increasing demand, should help bring the markets closer in balance this year. 
I'll now turn the call over to Ray to discuss operations."

While we're focused on the headwinds that we face in 2015, when we pause to look back at 2014, 2014 was a record year across many aspects of our operations. We set records in production, reserves, cash flow and earnings along with significant improvements in cost structure and capital efficiency. 
We continue to see great results and well performance in both Southwest and Northeast Pennsylvania, and like Jeff said, we completed our first Washington County Utica well. While it's only a single well, based on the early results and all the previous data, we have approximately 400,000 net acres in what we believe could be the core of the dry Utica and gives Range another significant growth opportunity to add to our core positions in the Marcellus and Upper Devonian in Southwest Pennsylvania. 
In 2014, we also put together both halves of the Nora field in Virginia, giving us control of operations, and the early results were outstanding. We have the ability to significantly grow that asset in one of the best gas markets on the East Coast in the future. 
And in the Midcontinent area, we saw continued confirmation of the geologic modeling in the Chat play along the Nemaha Ridge, leading to some of the best well performance to date in that play. 
I'm also really proud of all of our employees for working all of 2014 without a lost time incident. Safety, environmental protections and regulatory compliance are our core philosophy at Range, and I want to personally congratulate everyone across the company for a job well done in 2014. We had a great year, adding reserves at record low, drill bit, F&D cost while decreasing the PUD percentage. And the startup of Mariner East early propane was another significant step in our liquids marketing strategy in Appalachia, further positioning Range with unique and advantaged opportunities. 
Recognizing the challenging commodity price environment that Jeff described in his remarks, I know most of you today are primarily focused on our plans for '15. As we announced previously, we've set the capital budget at $870 million, which is 46% lower than our 2014 CapEx, and with targeted year-over-year production growth of 20%. Nearly 95% of that budget is directed towards the Marcellus, with over 90% of those dollars directed to Southwest Pennsylvania. 85% of our total capital is directed to the drill bit for 2015 as we significantly decreased our planned spending on land, exploration and seismic. 
We're able to make these changes and still target 20% growth for several reasons. Let me walk you through just a few of them. Number one, we have an experienced team and great leadership with a proven track record of growing production and reserves consistently, with one of the lowest cost structures and one of the best plays in the industry. This has been our philosophy at Range for many years. Number two, most importantly and one of my favorites sayings, the rock rules. And this has proven to be the case throughout history across many plays and through multiple commodity price cycles. It simply means that where you find the best reservoir quality, meaning the best rock, the economics are substantially better than non-core acres. And when a company can maintain a low cost structure in the core of a play, that company can sustain its growth at attractive economics across the up-and-down cycles of commodity prices. 
Range has what we believe is a core position in the Marcellus, Upper Devonian and Utica, allowing us to focus capital in those areas with the best economics, whether they are dry, wet or super-rich, and continue to achieve production growth in 2015 and beyond. 
And number three, Range has had a consistent strategy of 20% to 25% growth at a low cost structure for many years. This has allowed us to implement innovative, attractive and long-term marketing and midstream arrangements that position us well for what we face going forward. It has allowed us to keep our balance sheet strong and maintain liquidity. This strategy has also allowed our operating teams to achieve continued improvements in well performance and operational efficiencies while, at the same time, lowering our cost structure. And we expect to continue to see those improvements going forward. 
So getting into some details about 2015, let me start with our Southern Marcellus shale division. For 2015, we're planning to turn to sales approximately 101 Marcellus wells, 35 dry, 40 wet, and 26 super-rich, with average completed lateral length of over 6,000 feet with 30 stages. Well timing is expected to be similar to prior years, and therefore, our production growth profile is also expected to be similar, with sequential growth quarter by quarter throughout the year, giving us momentum as we go into 2016. 
To help investors in forecasting Range's production growth, we've updated our presentation for each area in the Marcellus for specific type curves that are representative of the wells planned to be turned to sales rather than the wells planned to be drilled as we've previously shown. The 2015 type curves that you'll find in our updated presentation on the website correspond to how our wells are planned to be produced and support our expectation of 20% growth for 2015. As we've described many times in the past, it's our practice to focus on optimizing our gathering system based on managing our cost structure to provide the best overall project returns. This results in lower initial rates to sales and flatter declines as the gathering system is built out over time and new processing plants and compressors are installed. 
Actual performance as it pertains to the overall project is what matters, and in Southwest Pennsylvania, in the current environment, we believe our well performance and returns are some of the best. 
Importantly, Range's EUR projection in each of the Marcellus areas has increased in 2015 compared to the prior year estimates. While total well cost has come down, again, illustrating the quality of our Marcellus acreage and the continued improvements in capital efficiency. 
In the past, we've made substantial enhancements to our completion designs such as improved lateral targeting, RCS, enhanced proppant placement, greener additives, super surfactants and substantial reservoir modeling, both historical and predictive, just to name a few. These enhancements have led to bigger EURs and lower costs year after year. We'll be continuing with that focus on innovation and new technology going forward, and I believe we'll continue to see positive changes in 2015 and beyond. 
Illustrating a specific example of this, I'll call your attention to a new slide in our presentation, Slide #35, which follows up on a couple of wells that we talked about several quarters ago. We drilled 2 infill wells on an existing Marcellus pad that had been producing for over 2 years. By applying the new designs with better targeting, the initial sales of those new wells was significantly higher than the existing wells, as we previously reported. After almost a year of production, the new wells, on average, have yielded 53% more than the original wells. And we should not forget that on a normalized basis, the new wells were $850,000 less per well. This example illustrates just one aspect of the capital efficiencies, improved well performance and resulting economics that we've demonstrated today and can expect to see in future years. 
I'll call your attention to Slide 8 and Slide -- Slide #8 and Slide #9 in our updated presentation to point out efficiencies that we've achieved over the past several years. Mainly in the Southwest Pennsylvania area, since 2011 as compared to '15, we've seen a 114% increase in lateral length with a 57% reduction in total well cost per foot of lateral. For 2015 as compared to '14, we're planning 20% longer laterals with a 37% reduction in total well cost per foot of lateral. Even though our current 2015 plan turns to sales a few less wells as compared to last year, we're actually planning to pump about the same number of frac stages. This illustrates continued efficiency improvements resulting in lower cost but also results in a consistent activity level, allowing us to continue to capture improved service and supply pricing. 
Looking at pricing across the supply chain. On an apples-to-apples basis, assuming no efficiency improvements, we now have arrangements in place that have reduced our estimated 2015 well cost by 23% to 25% as compared to December of 2014 pricing. We've seen reductions in pricing across all services and supplies, and we believe we'll see more improvements if the activity continues to decrease across the industry. 
Let me point out again that we've embedded in our 2015 plan well cost improvements from high-grading our program, continued improvements in designs, efficiencies in operations and the reduction in service and supply cost that we currently have in hand. When you add all these together, you achieve the 37% decrease in total well cost per foot of lateral that I described earlier. If we see further reductions in service and supply pricing, our total well cost will decrease further. This, of course, combined with the diversity of our large core position in Southwest Pennsylvania, allows us to grow with good economics in 2015, whether it's dry, wet or super-rich. 
As a further update on the Utica, we're still planning to drill 2 more wells this year. We believe the total well cost for the second well will be around $13 million and will still include some additional science. It's still very early in the program, but I believe as time goes on and we drill more wells, we could see the costs come down another 15% to 25% as operational efficiencies and design improvements kick in. The plays [indiscernible], which holds the record IP of 59 million a day, is now producing at our designed constraints of 20 million a day. And albeit very early and with only a few weeks of production, the well is meeting initial expectations. 
Just like I discussed earlier, current production facilities for these wells are designed to optimize the long-term flow and project economics. The first well will be produced to sales on an interruptible basis until this summer, when new infrastructure is completed. The second well is planned to come online about that same time, and the third well is planned to be drilled later in the year. 
In Northeast Pennsylvania on Slide 9, you can see that the lateral length has increased 100% since 2011, with a corresponding 63% decrease in total well cost per lateral foot. For 2015 as compared to '14, we're increasing lateral lengths by 18% with a 20% decrease in total well cost per foot of lateral. 
The team there had a great year, and we saw a 44% increase in our 90-day rates, with a 37% -- with a 30% reduction in well cost totally attributable to operational efficiencies and improved well designs that were implemented in 2014. We're planning a 1- to 2-rig program this year, resulting in about 14 wells to sales, and we expect those improvements that we saw in 2014 will continue. 
We've cut the CapEx in the Midcontinent division to approximately $26 million, resulting in 8 Chat wells utilizing targets from the geologic model that has been developed over the past couple of years. As Jeff mentioned, we've made the difficult decision to close the Oklahoma City division office, and we'll now operate the properties, which is approximately 360,000 net acres and 80 million a day of production, with our Fort Worth-based operations team. The field offices across Oklahoma and in the Texas Panhandle will now report to Fort Worth. 
In Nora, we have the distinct advantages of an asset where we either own the minerals or it's held by production combined with having a very flat decline and receiving some of the best gas prices in the country. Our plan for 2015 is simply to complete our inventory of wells drilled in late 2014, along with minimal maintenance capital, resulting in a total spend of about $15 million, with about 25 new wells turned to sales. In only a few short months since taking over the operations, the team has implemented designs and techniques, resulting in some of the best results we've seen in that field, and you can see some of those results on Slide 45 in the presentation. The 465,000 net acre position has a tremendous inventory of low-risk projects combined with exploration potential for the coming years. Again, this is an asset that we believe we can ramp to significant volumes with attractive economics in the future. 
In summary, our message today is that we have a great team with a proven track record. We have a large and consolidated position in the core of one the best plays in the world, and history has proven, over and over, the rock rules. We continually improve our cost structures, setting us up well to continue to deliver economic growth in the current environment. Our plan of growing at 20% to 25% for many years has enabled us to plan and execute innovative and attractive marketing and midstream arrangements that position us well. We have the balance sheet strength and liquidity to support the operational plan. And finally, we have a plan for 20% growth in 2015 that creates value by achieving growth consistently and sequentially quarter by quarter at attractive economics, all positioning us for growth into 2016 and forward as commodity prices improve.
Now over to Roger."
93030,281963845,770006,"Range Resources Corporation, Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 25, 2015",2015-02-25,"Earnings Calls","Range Resources Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Ray. The fourth quarter closed out an excellent financial year for Range. Revenue, cash flow and cash flow per share were all sequentially higher than the third quarter of this year and also significantly higher than the fourth quarter of last yea",894,"Thanks, Ray. The fourth quarter closed out an excellent financial year for Range. Revenue, cash flow and cash flow per share were all sequentially higher than the third quarter of this year and also significantly higher than the fourth quarter of last year, while total unit costs were lower. For all of 2014, we set record highs for revenue, EBITDAX, cash flow and cash flow per share. And while we understand that everyone is keenly focused on current commodity prices and 2015 budgets, we should not overlook these record 2014 results as they properly position Range for a more challenging 2015. 
So starting with the income statement. The fourth quarter was much like prior quarters, where we offset lower oil, gas and NGL prices with higher production volumes and lower costs. Our net realized price per mcfe was 17% lower than the fourth quarter of last year. Production was 26% higher, and unit costs were 11% lower. And that drove our strong quarterly performance. 
Reported net income was $284 million for the quarter, benefiting from a $341 million pretax mark-to-market gain on our hedge book. Fourth quarter earnings calculated using analyst methodology, which eliminates these noncash mark-to-market entries, was $65 million or $0.39 per fully diluted share. 
Cash flow for the fourth quarter was $273 million, 8% higher than last year, and cash flow per fully diluted share was $1.64. 
EBITDAX for the fourth quarter came in at $310 million, 5% higher than last year. Cash flow and cash flow per share for the full year 2014 was just over $1 billion or $6.33 a share. EBITDAX for the full year was $1.2 billion, and 2014 was the first year that cash flow topped the $1 billion mark. As Rodney mentioned earlier, please reference the various reconciliation tables found on the Range website and earnings release for full reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to GAAP. 
On the expense side, all of our fourth quarter expense items came in at or below guidance, reflecting heightened focus upon costs as oil, gas and NGL prices waned during quarter. A special mention is the continued decline in our DD&A rate. Our DD&A rate for the fourth quarter was $1.25 per mcfe, down from a $1.36 per mcfe last year and $1.46 per mcfe the year before that. The fourth quarter DD&A rate represents a 48% decline during the past 5 years from the peak rate of $2.41 an mcfe back in 2009. We expect the DD&A rate to continue falling as we high-grade our asset base and become even more capital efficient. 
While there are several nonmaterial positive and negative nonrecurring items passing through the income statement in the fourth quarter, there is one item that is highly nonrecurring. This item relates to the closing of our Oklahoma City office that Ray and Jeff mentioned and the resulting $8 million accrual for severance costs. The office closing will reduce our total company-wide headcount by approximately 8%. There are other overhead costs associated with the office closing besides severance, and the first quarter results will likely include an additional accrual of approximately $8 million to account for these costs. When the closure is completed, we expect an annual G&A reduction of approximately $15 million to $18 million or $0.04 per mcfe, with these savings layered in beginning in the second quarter of 2015. 
Flipping over to the balance sheet. The first number you may notice is that we ended the year 2014 with less debt than the end of 2013. Aggregate debt and leverage are both down from last year, even though we added 2.1 Tcf of proved reserves and grew production by 26%. The steps taken midyear in 2014 to reduce leverage and interest carry by calling our highest-cost notes has positioned us well for the current, more challenging environment.  Looking forward, our revised interim $70 million capital budget results in a very modest cash flow overspend, which is easily funded by our recently renewed bank facility. At year-end 2014, we had over $1 billion in liquidity available under our $2 billion commitment and over $2 billion in available liquidity under our $3 billion borrowing base. 
Another balance sheet number that you may notice is our retained earnings topping the $1 billion mark for the first time. Considering that for 6 consecutive years, we have seen our realized price per mcfe come down while cash flow and cash flow per share for the past 6 consecutive years has gone up, we view retained earnings growth as yet another indicator of our improving capital productivity, the quality of our assets and our relentless focus on growth at low cost. Please reference our fourth quarter earnings release for detailed expense item guidance for the first quarter of 2015. 
The earnings release also contains summary details of our hedge positions on both commodities and basis for 2015, 2016 and 2017. Additionally, detailed hedge volumes and price information may be found on our website. 
To summarize, 2014 brought record high revenue, operating income, cash flow and cash flow per share with record low cash unit costs. The progress we made in 2014 places us on firm ground as we enter 2015. With additional capital efficiencies and cost reductions still to come, we are confident in our ability to continue to deliver consistent growth for many years. 
Jeff, back over to you."

The difference that -- when you look at those charts on Page -- Slides #8 and 9, what you've seen from 2011 to 2014 has pretty much been a factor of well design improvements, longer laterals, operational efficiencies and the capital efficiency that we've seen during that time frame. During -- from 2011 through 2014, we really have never seen service and supply chain cost reductions. So the difference in the slope of that line, if you want to look at it that way, going from '14 to '15 is the service -- or the supply chain side of the -- the pricing reductions that we're seeing. We're seeing discounts across all of the sectors, across all -- from drilling rigs all the way through every piece of it. And I think the jury's still out on how much more of that we'll see during the year, but I think it will depend on the activity across the industry. But certainly, with all of the capital reductions that we've seen across all the different plays, we're taking advantage of those every opportunity we get. But that's the big difference. So what I quoted in my remarks of the 37% reduction that we're seeing from 2014 for the planned average in 2015 is really a combination of well design improvements, operational efficiencies, like we've seen in the past. And we'll continue with all of those innovations. And then the other is -- the new thing this year is really the difference in well costs from the supply chain side of things."

With that, I think we covered a couple of those things that really talked about -- we were trying to make the forecast easier for people to model, one. Two, I think at the end of the day, what it looks -- what you're saying is well EURs on a normalized basis are exactly the same as what they were before. Overall, they're going to be -- we're going to have higher EURs because of the fact we'll be drilling longer laterals. And we're also realizing the benefit of lower well costs. With that, this is the constrained situation, if you want to call it, or restricted is really the result of success of the drilling programs that we've had over the last several years. It's -- traditionally, you design systems to maximize the overall value of the whole project as opposed to individual well economics. So with that, we've kind of modeled everything from that standpoint. That's not to say we're not going to -- we're going to stop to -- not find improvements. We still think that they are going to be able to realize some improvements going forward in terms of looping lines, additional compression. We have a plant coming on -- scheduled to come on in 2016. We are also looking at improving the pipeline hydraulics that are out there. So we think with that, there are also going to be some improvements that, hopefully, we'll be able to see over the coming -- in 2015, '16 and beyond. But with that, we believe this is a great model to be able to get to the 20% growth that we have."

And we're updating that. We now have basically 5 years of production on those tests. And our original projections of about 80% of the 1,000-foot examples is still holding very true. Slide 35, what the example I called out in my remarks does is show you not only a version of that, but it also shows you the improvement in well designs and operational efficiencies and just better targeting. All of those impacts basically showing the 2 new wells on a normalized per foot of lateral basis produced 53% more production over a year's time frame than the original wells, which were only 2 years prior. So I think going forward, we have a mix of both of those cases. Now whether the spacing is 500-foot or 700-foot or 900 feet or what the ultimate space is going to be, I think when you look at our core position there in Southwest Pennsylvania, it's very large and it's very diverse. We go from super-rich all the way to dry. And I think as we develop over time, you're going to see some areas in the liquids, I would think, will probably end up -- wells closer together there. And maybe not as close in the dry area, but I don't think at this point in time, we could say it's going to all be 500s because I don't think that's going to be the case. But there's certainly going to be a lot more infill well drilling. And when we go back on those existing pads, what's -- it's really important to point out the improvement in well performance that we're seeing, but you can't -- also, you can't forget the decrease in well costs. When you're looking at $850,000 less per well, those economics are going to be outstanding going forward as we go back in and redevelop those areas to fill in the gathering system as we get more room. Gathering costs will come down in those areas. That's going to be some real upside for us going forward."

Let me start, and I would imagine you'll hear from 2 or 3 more other than me. I think what you've seen us do is focus our capital on the Marcellus, where we have very strong returns, the ability to drill dry, wet and super-rich. So we get -- and we get strong returns. We get good growth. It's also an area where there's infrastructure ability to grow it. There's contracts in place. We have to hold acreage. There's a lot of different factors that blend into that decision to focus in the Marcellus. And I think if you step back and look at it, I would argue that our returns in the Marcellus are as good as any play, really, in the U.S. today. So strong returns, and yet it's an area we need to drill to continue to hold acreage, which we'll do. When you look at Nora, it's a totally different decision. It's all HBP. In fact, it's better than that. We own the minerals under the bulk of it. So it has strong returns, strong economics and good gas markets, but that's an area we have the ability to ramp up when we're ready to do that. Great asset. I think we created a lot of value by putting it together. Again, it's all the strengths that Ray said. We put the 2 pieces together that creates value. We tried new technology. There are some great slides in the book that show what those new wells look like in the appendix. And we still get a premium to NYMEX there. And then we have the ability to grow and ramp that in probably one of the best, if not the best, gas market in the U.S. In the Midcontinent, the decision to slow down there was given the returns that we have in the other areas. We were putting, like I said in my notes, approximately, whatever the number was, 97% or so, plus or minus, of our capital in Appalachia. So we thought that the most efficient thing to do is to really operate those properties out of Fort Worth. There's significant G&A savings that Roger mentioned, several million dollars a year in savings. We still think the properties have potential. It's a big footprint, stacked pay. A lot of that is controlled. Let me switch gears a little bit and just talk abstract -- in the abstract. You talked about would we -- when you look at asset sales, clearly, over the last several years, [indiscernible] almost $3 billion worth of properties. So if we ever get to the point when we think those assets are worth more to somebody else than us -- and clearly, we've done that multiple times.

Well, there's probably 3 things that affected or influenced fourth quarter NGL realizations or improvements. One, you got to realize or remember that Range has a POP processing arrangement with MarkWest. So as prices come down, the fee we're paying MarkWest comes down, which improves our realizations. October, November market saw a little bit colder temperatures, saw demand for propane. Heating demand for propane increased, so propane prices improved a little bit. And approximately half our NGL barrel is ethane, and 80% of it -- of our ethane is currently tied to natural gas index. As we sell on our Mariner West project, all of the ethane is sold on a gas equivalent, and some of the ethane on ATEX is sold at a gas equivalent price. So that's why you saw the realizations improve in fourth quarter."

I think one thing we've had for a number of years now is a long-range plan, so we have a very integrated process when we look at that production profile that we expect and well integrated with Chad and the marketing team in terms of the amount of firm transportation that we need to hit those targets. And it's not just on the gas side but on the liquid side as well. We do have -- so we have a good planned capital efficiencies. Like we said, we'll continue to improve. I think you'll see us move out to longer laterals, more frac stages, better -- all those types of technologies that help on that side, so our capital efficiency should improve. I think another key thing to think about, too, is to really think natural gas demand is going to improve with time as well. And I mentioned it in my notes early on with the mass retirements on power plants kicking in in the spring of this year, increased exports to Mexico and LNG starting up later this year, we think demand will be up 1 to 2 Bs this year. And then we think for every year thereafter, demand increases 3 to 4 Bcf per year. And there's a slide in our book that points that out, taking out where we think the incremental gas demand could be 20 Bcf by 2020, so we think there's going to be a lot of gas demand. And gas is going to be a good place to be, and we're in the highest quality in the quarter, the highest-quality, best gas play out there with the ability to drill wet, dry and super-rich as well as Marcellus, Utica and Upper Devonian."

So getting to where we are today, the firm transport capacity we have through 2018 has been a very thoughtful, methodical process, meeting with our drilling teams and understanding what our volumes are going to be up through 2018 and beyond. And when you look at Slide 37 in our presentation, it shows regionally, where that firm transportation is and what we deem is relatively cheap firm transportation costs. That dovetails or fits real well with our projected volumes. Going forward, we think that there's release capacity markets we've already been involved in and getting, again, relatively cheaper, inexpensive firm transport to layer in to the areas we want to get our markets to. Obviously, Slide 37 shows our main objective is to try to get as much of our volume out of Appalachia into other areas, Midwest, Gulf Coast and Southeast. And in the future, we want to try to do that as well. We think that with rig rates coming down, CapEx budgets being cut, volume -- projected volumes will be coming down, and those companies that committed to firm transportation volumes will not be using all of that capacity. So we're going to take advantage of that and get into the release capacity markets and, when needed, speak up for some of that release capacity. We're also in discussions with some of the midstream companies about adding or layering in additional strategic firm transportation projects that would fit our volumes and our needs, again, getting the volumes out of the Appalachia Basin to other areas of the country where the basis has not been quite as volatile and we don't think it will be in the future."

The operational efficiencies, design improvements the new technologies, all those things that we've done over the past 4 years are going to continue going into '15. And so when you add those together, that's where you achieve that big change that you're seeing from '14 to '15, which is a bigger decrease than the slope of that line had been previously. Adding those 2 together gets you a 37% decrease on a per-foot basis. We haven't put that on a total well cost basis just because all the lateral lengths are different, and it's just too difficult to talk about it from that standpoint.

We're excited about the Utica. The first well, it's only been online a few weeks. We purposely designed the production facilities to basically limit that well at 20 million a day because, again, we tend to focus at Range on the long-term project economics and not initial production rates or anything like that because the projects, at the end of the day, is what's most important. For the first half of this year, that first well is actually producing on an uninterruptible basis as we have room to kind of cram it in, so to speak. We are currently building a new pipeline segment that will take it directly to the big pipe, essentially. That will be finished sometime this summer. And that is also corresponding with about the time we believe -- and all of this is plus or minus a month at this point. But that's going to correspond with about the same time that the second well is ready for initial production. We will design those facilities for that second well to also limit it to about 20 million a day, but we do expect, for the last half of the years, that both those wells will be able to produce at their full rate, which is going to, again, be limited to 20 million a day each. But we think they'll come online this summertime and produce the rest of the year kind of on an uninterruptible basis. And the third well, we'll drill later in the year. At this point, it's too early to tell, we're kind of in the planning process and permitting process, to know if it will actually produce this year or not, but it will be somewhere around the end of the year or beginning of next year when the third well is ready. Second well, we think we can do at about $13 million. It's still got some science in it. And again, I am fully expecting -- and I think our team is pretty pumped about what we see so far. And they think that -- we believe that as we go into that program, that we can lower those costs an another 15% to 25% as we kick in well designs and different things that we learned going through these first couple of wells.

There's enough production history now to prove up some of the things on pressure and the reservoir parameters that we were looking at. So the Utica is a lot different than the Marcellus. We won't have to be stepping out and delineating acreage like we did in the early days of the Marcellus. This is going to be more of a manufacturing-type process. We'll actually be able just to put wells on existing pads, with existing infrastructure and start layering those wells in over time. We generally like to see -- I mean, we'll update you quarter by quarter as we see the production from these wells, just like we did in the early days of the Marcellus.

2015 is setting up to be a challenging year. Fortunately, we did several things in 2014 that will help us in 2015. With the redemption of our fixed rate 8% bonds, with the proceeds from an equity offering, coupled with the cash proceeds we received from our Conger-for-Nora swap, we ended 2014 with less debt than 2013. Debt per mcfe of proved reserves was $0.30 at year-end 2014 compared to the prior year at $0.38. Last fall, we restructured and extended our senior bank facility for 5 years to 2019 and increased our borrowing base from $2 billion to $3 billion. We have no bonds maturing until 2020. 
We have continued with our capital and operating efficiencies. In 2014, we improved our operating efficiency by decreasing our unit cost $0.35 or $0.10 -- or 10% versus the prior year and expect continued improvement this year. Our capital efficiency improved as we continue to drill longer laterals, pump more frac stages per lateral and utilize improved targeting of the lateral. We believe this trend will also continue into 2015. 
We currently have hedged approximately 65% of our projected 2015 natural gas production with a $4 floor and approximately 77% of our projected oil production with a $90.57 floor. 
On the natural gas liquids side, the Mariner East project is still projected to be on time with the startup in the third quarter of this year. When fully operational, even with today's pricing, given Range-specific contracts and the combined benefits from propane and ethane, this is projected to be approximately a $90 million uplift as compared to selling the ethane as natural gas, net of all transportation and processing fees. 
In 2014, we grew production 24%. We grew reserves 26%, and we ended 2014 by testing our first Utica well in Washington County at a rate of 59 million cubic feet per day, which we believe is a new record for any well in any horizon in the Appalachian Basin. 
As I previously mentioned, we accomplished a lot in 2014 that will help us in 2015. We also have recently taken additional steps to help drive our performance in 2015 and '16. We cut our 2015 capital budget to $870 million. This is approximately a $700 million reduction from 2014. Given the quality of our assets and team, coupled with continuing improved capital efficiencies, we're targeting 20% growth for 2015, even with the reduced capital. Importantly, this growth occurs sequentially throughout the year, which sets up Range well for 2016. 
We also made a tough decision to close our Oklahoma City office and operate our Midcontinent properties out of Fort Worth. Given that approximately 97% of our capital is currently targeted to Appalachia, we believe this is a right decision for the company, and it will lead to better capital allocation for Range and improved integration of technology, coupled with cost savings. 
Range is advantaged given our core acreage position in the Marcellus. We have approximately 1.5 million net acres of stacked pay potential in Southwest and Northeast Pennsylvania that is prospective for Marcellus, Utica and Upper Devonian. Plus our acreage position is further advantaged in that we can selectively drill -- direct drilling capital towards the dry, wet or super-rich portions of the play. Coupling this with our processing, pipeline takeaway capacity and unique NGL marketing agreements, Range is well positioned for 2015, 2016 and beyond. 
Gas demand is projected to increase in 2015 from coal plant retirements, gas exports to Mexico and later this year, LNG exports. Given the large capital cuts from a large number of companies in our industry, which is resulting in a rapidly declining rig count and deferred completions, we may see a production response in oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids later this year. The combination of slowing supply growth, coupled with increasing demand, should help bring the markets closer in balance this year. 
I'll now turn the call over to Ray to discuss operations."

While we're focused on the headwinds that we face in 2015, when we pause to look back at 2014, 2014 was a record year across many aspects of our operations. We set records in production, reserves, cash flow and earnings, along with significa",2256,"Thanks, Jeff. While we're focused on the headwinds that we face in 2015, when we pause to look back at 2014, 2014 was a record year across many aspects of our operations. We set records in production, reserves, cash flow and earnings, along with significant improvements in cost structure and capital efficiency. 
We continue to see great results in well performance in both Southwest and Northeast Pennsylvania, and like Jeff said, we completed our first Washington County Utica well. While it's only a single well, based on the early results and all the previous data, we have approximately 400,000 net acres of what we believe could be the core of the dry Utica and gives Range another significant growth opportunity to add to our core positions in the Marcellus and Upper Devonian in Southwest Pennsylvania. 
In 2014, we also put together both halves of the Nora field in Virginia, giving us control of operations, and the early results were outstanding. We have the ability to significantly grow that asset in one of the best gas markets on the East Coast in the future. 
And in the Midcontinent area, we saw continued confirmation of the geologic modeling in the Chat play along the Nemaha Ridge, leading to some of the best well performance to date in that play. 
I'm also really proud of all of our employees for working all of 2014 without a lost time incident. Safety, environmental protections and regulatory compliance are our core philosophy at Range, and I want to personally congratulate everyone across the company for a job well done in 2014. We had a great year, adding reserves at record low drill bit, F&D cost, while decreasing the PUD percentage. And the startup of Mariner East early propane was another significant step in our liquids marketing strategy in Appalachia, further positioning Range with unique and advantaged opportunities. 
Recognizing the challenging commodity price environment that Jeff described in his remarks, I know most of you today are primarily focused on our plans for '15. As we announced previously, we've set the capital budget at $870 million, which is 46% lower than our 2014 CapEx, and we've targeted year-over-year production growth of 20%. Nearly 95% of that budget is directed towards the Marcellus, with over 90% of those dollars directed to Southwest Pennsylvania. 85% of our total capital is directed to the drill bit for 2015, as we significantly decreased our planned spending on land, exploration and seismic. 
We're able to make these changes and still target 20% growth for several reasons. Let me walk you through just a few of them. Number one, we have an experienced team and great leadership with a proven track record of growing production and reserves consistently, with one of the lowest cost structures and one of the best plays in the industry. This has been our philosophy at Range for many years. Number two, most importantly and one of my favorite sayings, the rock rules. And this has proven to be the case throughout history across many plays and through multiple commodity price cycles. It simply means that where you find the best reservoir quality, meaning the best rock, the economics are substantially better than non-core acres. And when a company can maintain a low cost structure in the core of a play, that company can sustain its growth at attractive economics across the up-and-down cycles of commodity prices. 
Range has what we believe is a core position in the Marcellus, Upper Devonian and Utica, allowing us to focus capital in those areas with the best economics, whether they are dry, wet or super-rich, and continue to achieve production growth in 2015 and beyond. 
And number three, Range has had a consistent strategy of 20% to 25% growth at a low cost structure for many years. This has allowed us to implement innovative, attractive and long-term marketing and midstream arrangements that position us well for what we face going forward. It has allowed us to keep our balance sheet strong and maintain liquidity. This strategy has also allowed our operating teams to achieve continued improvements in well performance and operational efficiencies, while at the same time lowering our cost structure. And we expect to continue to see those improvements going forward. 
So getting into some details about 2015, let me start with our Southern Marcellus shale division. For 2015, we're planning to turn to sales approximately 101 Marcellus wells, 35 dry, 40 wet, and 26 super-rich, with average completed lateral length of over 6,000 feet with 30 stages. Well timing is expected to be similar to prior years, and therefore, our production growth profile is also expected to be similar, with sequential growth quarter by quarter throughout the year, giving us momentum as we go into 2016. 
To help investors in forecasting Range's production growth, we've updated our presentation for each area in the Marcellus with specific type curves that are representative of the wells planned to be turned to sales rather than the wells planned to be drilled as we've previously shown. The 2015 type curves that you'll find in our updated presentation on the website correspond to how our wells are planned to be produced and support our expectation of 20% growth for 2015. As we've described many times in the past, it's our practice to focus on optimizing our gathering system based on managing our cost structure to provide the best overall project returns. This results in lower initial rates to sales and flatter declines as the gathering system is built out over time and new processing plants and compressors are installed. 
Actual performance as it pertains to the overall project is what matters, and in Southwest Pennsylvania, in the current environment, we believe our well performance and returns are some of the best. 
Importantly, Range's EUR projection in each of the Marcellus areas has increased in 2015 compared to the prior year estimates, while total well costs have come down. Again, illustrating the quality of our Marcellus acreage and the continued improvements in capital efficiency. 
In the past, we've made substantial enhancements to our completion designs such as improved lateral targeting, RCS, enhanced proppant placement, greener additives, super surfactants and substantial reservoir modeling, both historical and predictive, just to name a few. These enhancements have led to bigger EURs and lower costs year after year. We'll be continuing with that focus on innovation and new technology going forward, and I believe we'll continue to see positive changes in 2015 and beyond. 
Illustrating a specific example of this, I'll call your attention to a new slide in our presentation, Slide #35, which follows up on a couple of wells that we talked about several quarters ago. We drilled 2 infill wells on an existing Marcellus pad that had been producing for over 2 years. By applying the new designs with better targeting, the initial sales of those new wells was significantly higher than the existing wells, as we previously reported. After almost a year of production, the new wells, on average, have yielded 53% more than the original wells. And we should not forget that on a normalized basis, the new wells were $850,000 less per well. This example illustrates just one aspect of the capital efficiencies, improved well performance and resulting economics that we've demonstrated to date and can expect to see in future years. 
I'll call your attention to Slide 8 and Slide -- Slide #8 and Slide #9 in our updated presentation to point out efficiencies that we've achieved over the past several years. Mainly in the Southwest Pennsylvania area, since 2011 as compared to '15, we've seen a 114% increase in lateral length with a 57% reduction in total well cost per foot of lateral. For 2015 as compared to '14, we're planning 20% longer laterals with a 37% reduction in total well cost per foot of lateral. Even though our current 2015 plan turns to sales a few less wells as compared to last year, we're actually planning to pump about the same number of frac stages. This illustrates continued efficiency improvements resulting in lower cost, but also results in a consistent activity level, allowing us to continue to capture improved service and supply pricing. 
Looking at pricing across the supply chain. On an apples-to-apples basis, assuming no efficiency improvements, we now have arrangements in place that have reduced our estimated 2015 well cost by 23% to 25% as compared to December 2014 pricing. We've seen reductions in pricing across all services and supplies, and we believe we'll see more improvements if activity continues to decrease across the industry. 
Let me point out again that we've embedded in our 2015 plan well cost improvements from high-grading our program, continued improvements in designs, efficiencies in operations and the reduction in service and supply cost that we currently have in hand. When you add all these together, you achieve the 37% decrease in total well cost per foot of lateral that I described earlier. If we see further reductions in service and supply pricing, our total well cost will decrease further. This, of course, combined with the diversity of our large core position in Southwest Pennsylvania, allows us to grow with good economics in 2015, whether it's dry, wet or super-rich. 
As a further update on the Utica, we're still planning to drill 2 more wells this year. We believe the total well cost for the second well will be around $13 million and will still include some additional science. It's still very early in the program, but I believe as time goes on and we drill more wells, we could see the costs come down another 15% to 25% as operational efficiencies and design improvements kick in. The Claysville 11H, which holds the record IP of 59 million a day, is now producing at our designed constraints of 20 million a day. And albeit very early and with only a few weeks of production, the well is meeting initial expectations. 
Just like I discussed earlier, current production facilities for these wells are designed to optimize the long-term flow and project economics. The first well will be produced to sales on an interruptible basis until this summer, when new infrastructure is completed. The second well is planned to come online about that same time, and the third well is planned to be drilled later in the year. 
In Northeast Pennsylvania on Slide 9, you can see that the lateral length has increased 100% since 2011, with a corresponding 63% decrease in total well cost per lateral foot. For 2015 as compared to '14, we're increasing lateral lengths by 18% with a 20% decrease in total well cost per foot of lateral. 
The team there had a great year, and we saw a 44% increase in our 90-day rates, with a 37% -- with a 30% reduction in well cost totally attributable to operational efficiencies and improved well designs that were implemented in 2014. We're planning a 1- to 2-rig program this year, resulting in about 14 wells to sales, and we expect those improvements that we saw in 2014 will continue. 
We've cut the CapEx in the Midcontinent division to approximately $26 million, resulting in 8 Chat wells, utilizing targets from the geologic model that has been developed over the past couple of years. As Jeff mentioned, we've made the difficult decision to close the Oklahoma City division office, and we'll now operate the properties, which is approximately 360,000 net acres and 80 million a day of production, with our Fort Worth-based operations team. The field offices across Oklahoma and in the Texas Panhandle will now report to Fort Worth. 
In Nora, we have the distinct advantages of an asset where we either own the minerals or it's held by production, combined with having a very flat decline and receiving some of the best gas prices in the country. Our plan for 2015 is simply to complete our inventory of wells drilled in late 2014, along with minimal maintenance capital, resulting in a total spend of about $15 million, with about 25 new wells turned to sales. In only a few short months since taking over the operations, the team has implemented designs and techniques resulting in some of the best results we've seen in that field, and you can see some of those results on Slide 45 in the presentation. The 465,000 net acre position has a tremendous inventory of low-risk projects, combined with exploration potential for the coming years. Again, this is an asset that we believe we can ramp to significant volumes with attractive economics in the future. 
In summary, our message today is that we have a great team with a proven track record. We have a large and consolidated position in the core of one the best plays in the world, and history has proven, over and over, the rock rules. We continually improved our cost structure, setting us up well to continue to deliver economic growth in the current environment. Our plan of growing at 20% to 25% for many years has enabled us to plan and execute innovative and attractive marketing and midstream arrangements that position us well. We have the balance sheet strength and liquidity to support the operational plan. And finally, we have a plan for 20% growth in 2015 that creates value by achieving growth consistently and sequentially quarter by quarter at attractive economics, all positioning us for growth into 2016 and forward as commodity prices improve.
Now over to Roger."

The fourth quarter closed out an excellent financial year for Range. Revenue, cash flow and cash flow per share were all sequentially higher than the third quarter of this year and also significantly higher than the fourth quarter of last yea",895,"Thanks, Ray. The fourth quarter closed out an excellent financial year for Range. Revenue, cash flow and cash flow per share were all sequentially higher than the third quarter of this year and also significantly higher than the fourth quarter of last year, while total unit costs were lower. For all of 2014, we set record highs for revenue, EBITDAX, cash flow and cash flow per share. And while we understand that everyone is keenly focused on current commodity prices and 2015 budgets, we should not overlook these record 2014 results, as they properly position Range for a more challenging 2015. 
So starting with the income statement. The fourth quarter was much like prior quarters, where we offset lower oil, gas and NGL prices with higher production volumes and lower costs. Our net realized price per mcfe was 17% lower than the fourth quarter of last year, but production was 26% higher and unit costs were 11% lower. And that drove our strong quarterly performance. 
Reported net income was $284 million for the quarter, benefiting from a $341 million pretax mark-to-market gain on our hedge book. Fourth quarter earnings calculated using analyst methodology, which eliminates these noncash mark-to-market entries, was $65 million or $0.39 per fully diluted share. 
Cash flow for the fourth quarter was $273 million, 8% higher than last year, and cash flow per fully diluted share was $1.64. 
EBITDAX for the fourth quarter came in at $310 million, 5% higher than last year. Cash flow and cash flow per share for the full year 2014 was just over $1 billion or $6.33 a share. EBITDAX for the full year was $1.2 billion, and 2014 was the first year that cash flow topped the $1 billion mark. As Rodney mentioned earlier, please reference the various reconciliation tables found on the Range website and earnings release for full reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to GAAP. 
On the expense side, all of our fourth quarter expense items came in at or below guidance, reflecting heightened focus upon costs as oil, gas and NGL prices waned during the quarter. A special mention is the continued decline in our DD&A rate. Our DD&A rate for the fourth quarter was $1.25 per mcfe, down from a $1.36 per mcfe last year and $1.46 per mcfe the year before that. The fourth quarter DD&A rate represents a 48% decline during the past 5 years, from the peak rate of $2.41 an mcfe back in 2009. We expect the DD&A rate to continue falling as we high-grade our asset base and become even more capital efficient. 
While there are several nonmaterial positive and negative nonrecurring items passing through the income statement in the fourth quarter, there is one item that is highly nonrecurring. This item relates to the closing of our Oklahoma City office that Ray and Jeff mentioned and the resulting $8 million accrual for severance costs. The office closing will reduce our total company-wide headcount by approximately 8%. There are other overhead costs associated with the office closing besides severance, and the first quarter results will likely include an additional accrual of approximately $8 million to account for these costs. When the closure is completed, we expect an annual G&A reduction of approximately $15 million to $18 million or $0.04 per mcfe, with these savings layered in beginning in the second quarter of 2015. 
Flipping over to the balance sheet. The first number you may notice is that we ended the year 2014 with less debt than the end of 2013. Aggregate debt and leverage are both down from last year, even though we added 2.1 Tcf of proved reserves and grew production by 26%. The steps taken midyear in 2014 to reduce leverage and interest carry by calling our highest-cost notes has positioned us well for the current, more challenging environment.  Looking forward, our revised $870 million capital budget results in a very modest cash flow overspend, which is easily funded by our recently renewed bank facility. At year-end 2014, we had over $1 billion in liquidity available under our $2 billion commitment and over $2 billion in available liquidity under our $3 billion borrowing base. 
Another balance sheet number that you may notice is our retained earnings topping the $1 billion mark for the first time. Considering that for 6 consecutive years, we have seen our realized price per mcfe come down, while cash flow and cash flow per share for the past 6 consecutive years has gone up, we view retained earnings growth as yet another indicator of our improving capital productivity, the quality of our assets and our relentless focus on growth at low cost. Please reference our fourth quarter earnings release for detailed expense item guidance for the first quarter of 2015. 
The earnings release also contains summary details of our hedge positions on both commodities and basis for 2015, 2016 and 2017. Additionally, detailed hedge volumes and price information may be found on our website. 
To summarize, 2014 brought record high revenue, operating income, cash flow and cash flow per share, with record low cash unit costs. The progress we made in 2014 places us on firm ground as we enter 2015. With additional capital efficiencies and cost reductions still to come, we are confident in our ability to continue to deliver consistent growth for many years. 
Jeff, back over to you."

During -- from 2011 through 2014, we really have never seen service and supply chain cost reductions. So the difference in the slope of that line, if you want to look at it that way, going from '14 to '15 is the service -- or the supply chain side of the -- the pricing reductions that we're seeing. We're seeing discounts across all of the sectors, across all -- from drilling rigs all the way through every piece of it. And I think the jury's still out on how much more of that we'll see during the year, but I think it will depend on the activity across the industry. But certainly, with all of the capital reductions that we've seen across all the different plays, we're taking advantage of those every opportunity we get. But that's the big difference. So what I quoted in my remarks of the 37% reduction that we're seeing from 2014 for the planned average in 2015 is really a combination of well design improvements, operational efficiencies, like we've seen in the past. And we'll continue with all of those innovations. And then the other is -- the new thing this year is really the difference in well costs from the supply chain side of things."

Two, I think at the end of the day, what it looks -- what you're seeing is well EURs on a per normalized basis are exactly the same as what they were before. Overall, they're going to be -- we're going to have higher EURs because of the fact we'll be drilling longer laterals. And we're also realizing the benefit of lower well costs. With that, this is the constrained situation, if you want to call it, or restricted, is really the result of the success of the drilling programs that we've had over the last several years. It's -- traditionally, you design systems to maximize the overall value of the whole project as opposed to individual well economics. So with that, we've kind of modeled everything from that standpoint. That's not to say we're not going to -- we're going to stop to -- not find improvements. We still think that they are going to be able to realize some improvements going forward in terms of looping lines, additional compression. We have a plant coming on -- scheduled to come on in 2016. We are also looking at improving the pipeline hydraulics that are out there. So we think with that, there are also going to be some improvements that, hopefully, we'll be able to see over the coming -- in 2015, '16 and beyond. But with that, we believe this is a great model to be able to get to the 20% growth that we have."

Slide 35, what the example I called out in my remarks does is show you not only a version of that, but it also shows you the improvement in well designs and operational efficiencies and just better targeting. All of those impacts basically showing the 2 new wells on a normalized per foot of lateral basis produced 53% more production over a year's time frame than the original wells, which were only 2 years prior. So I think going forward, we have a mix of both of those cases. Now whether the spacing is 500-foot or 700-foot or 900 feet or what the ultimate space is going to be, I think when you look at our core position there in Southwest Pennsylvania, it's very large and it's very diverse. We go from super-rich all the way to dry. And I think as we develop over time, you're going to see some areas in the liquids, I would think, we'll probably end up with wells closer together there. And maybe not as close in the dry area, but I don't think at this point in time, we could say it's going to all be 500s, because I don't think that's going to be the case. But there's certainly going to be a lot more infill well drilling. And when we go back on those existing pads, what's -- it's really important to point out the improvement in well performance that we're seeing, but you can't -- also, you can't forget the decrease in well costs. When you're looking at $850,000 less per well, those economics are going to be outstanding going forward as we go back in and redevelop those areas to fill in the gathering system as we get more room. Gathering costs will come down in those areas. That's going to be some real upside for us going forward."

Let me start, and I would imagine you'll hear from 2 or 3 more other than me. I think what you've seen us do is focus our capital on the Marcellus, where we have very strong returns, the ability to drill dry, wet and super-rich. So we get -- and we get strong returns. We get good growth. It's also an area where there's infrastructure, ability to grow it. There's contracts in place. We have to hold acreage. There's a lot of different factors that blend into that decision to focus in the Marcellus. And I think if you step back and look at it, I would argue that our returns in the Marcellus are as good as any play, really, in the U.S. today. So strong returns, and yes, it's an area we need to drill to continue to hold acreage, which we'll do. When you look at Nora, it's a totally different decision. It's all HBP. In fact, it's better than that in that we own the minerals under the bulk of it. So it has strong returns, strong economics and good gas markets, but that's an area we have the ability to ramp up when we're ready to do that. Great asset. I think we created a lot of value by putting it together. Again, it's all the strengths that Ray said. We put the 2 pieces together that creates value. We tried new technology. There are some great slides in the book that show what those new wells look like in the appendix. And we still get a premium to NYMEX there. And then we have the ability to grow and ramp that in probably one of the best, if not the best, gas market in the U.S. In the Midcontinent, the decision to slow down there was, given the returns that we have in the other areas, we were putting, like I said in my notes, approximately, whatever the number was, 97% or so, plus or minus, of our capital in Appalachia. So we thought that the most efficient thing to do is to really operate those properties out of Fort Worth. There's significant G&A savings that Roger mentioned, several million dollars a year in savings. We still think the properties have potential. It's a big footprint, stacked pay. A lot of that is controlled. Let me switch gears a little bit and just talk abstract -- in the abstract. You talked about would we -- when you look at asset sales, clearly, over the last several years, we've sold almost $3 billion worth of properties. So if we ever get to the point when we think those assets are worth more to somebody else than us, and clearly, we've done that multiple times. And to be honest with you, it's early in the morning, and I don't remember all the other questions, so I'll turn it over to Ray or Roger."

I think you'll see us move out to longer laterals, more frac stages, better -- all those types of technologies that help on that side, so our capital efficiency should improve. I think another key thing to think about, too, is we really think natural gas demand is going to improve with time as well. And I mentioned it in my notes early on, with the mass retirements on power plants kicking in, in the spring of this year, increased exports to Mexico and LNG starting up later this year, we think demand will be up 1 to 2 Bs this year. And then we think for every year thereafter, demand increases 3 to 4 Bcf per year. And there's a slide in our book that points that out, peaking at where we think incremental gas demand could be 20 Bcf by 2020.

And when you look at Slide 37 in our presentation, it shows regionally, where that firm transportation is and what we deem is relatively cheap firm transportation costs. That dovetails or fits real well with our projected volumes. Going forward, we think that there's release capacity markets we've already been involved in and getting, again, relatively cheaper, inexpensive firm transport to layer in to the areas we want to get our markets to. Obviously, Slide 37 shows our main objective is to try to get as much of our volume out of Appalachia into other areas, Midwest, Gulf Coast and Southeast. And in the future, we want to try to do that as well. We think that with rig rates coming down, CapEx budgets being cut, volume -- projected volumes will be coming down, and those companies that committed to firm transportation volumes will not be using all of that capacity. So we're going to take advantage of that and get into the release capacity markets, and when needed, speak up for some of that release capacity. We're also in discussions with some of the midstream companies about adding, layering in, additional strategic firm transportation projects that would fit our volumes and our needs.

We purposely designed the production facilities to basically limit that well at 20 million a day because, again, we tend to focus at Range on the long-term project economics and not initial production rates or anything like that, because the projects, at the end of the day, is what's most important. For the first half of this year, that first well is actually producing on an interruptible basis as we have room to kind of cram it in, so to speak. We are currently building a new pipeline segment that will take it directly to the big pipe, essentially. That will be finished sometime this summer. And that is also corresponding with about the time we believe -- and all of this is plus or minus a month at this point, but that's going to correspond with about the same time that the second well is ready for initial production. We will design those facilities for that second well to also limit it to about 20 million a day, but we do expect, for the last half of the years, that both those wells will be able to produce at their full rate, which is going to, again, be limited to 20 million a day each. But we think they'll come online this summertime and produce the rest of the year kind of on an uninterruptible basis. And the third well, we'll drill later in the year. At this point, it's too early to tell, we're kind of in the planning process and permitting process, to know if it will actually produce this year or not, but it will be somewhere around the end of the year or beginning of next year when the third well is ready. Second well, we think we can do at about $13 million. It's still got some science in it. And again, I am fully expecting -- and I think our team is pretty pumped about what we see so far. And they think that -- we believe that as we go into that program, that we can lower those costs in another 15% to 25% as we kick in well designs and different things that we learned going through these first couple of wells.

We won't have to be stepping out and delineating acreage like we did in the early days of the Marcellus. This is going to be more of a manufacturing-type process. We'll actually be able just to put wells on existing pads, with existing infrastructure and start layering those wells in over time. We generally like to see -- I mean, we'll update you quarter by quarter as we see the production from these wells, just like we did in the early days of the Marcellus.

I'm going to begin my remarks with some macro comments about our industry and then focus specifically on Range. Starting with the macro, as you all know, U.S. gas supply has increased ahead of demand causing low gas prices in most of the U.S. and negative basis differentials in the Appalachian basin. We believe that over the last year, the U.S. gas market typically has been oversupplied by about 2 Bcf to 4 Bcf per day; however, we see positive things happening on both the demand and supply sides of the equation. On the demand side, I believe that most people would agree that additional natural gas demand is coming and coming in a very meaningful way. In our presentation on our website on Page 19, we have a projection on natural gas demand with time. The good news is that gas demand is expected to increase about 2 Bcf per day this year as projected 2015 increase in gas demand is driven by the conversion of coal-fired power generation to gas, increased industrial demand, plant exports of gas to Mexico and LNG exports from the Gulf Coast coming online.
For 2016 through '20, natural gas demand is projected to increase by about 3 Bcf to 4 Bcf per day each and every year. It shows about 20 Bcf per day of incremental natural gas demand by 2020. There are multiple other reports that project natural gas demand with time in the report we references consistent with our internal work and within the range of other reports that I've seen. The other side of the equation is the supply-side. The supply can be broken into 2 pieces, natural gas associated with oil wells and natural gas from gas wells. We believe that prior to recent oil rig count reduction, there was approximately 16 Bcf per day of natural gas being produced associated with oil production. That's almost equivalent of the Marcellus and Utica combined. Of the 16 Bcf per day of natural gas production associated with oil, about 8 Bcf per day is estimated to be associated with shale oil and conventional oil place. For the first time in a long while, oil is $90 to $100 per barrel, is roughly half that. The industries response has been cut to 2015 capital programs to about 40% to 50% of the 2014 budget. Given these reductions so far, the oil rig count is down about 56% and appear to be going further. Given that moving oil through oil rock is harder than moving gas through oil rock, the first year decline of unconventional resource oil wells are much cheaper than gas wells and typically are in the 70% to 90% Range. Given the continuing steep drop in the rig count and typically steep first year declines of those oil wells, I believe that we will see production response in the second half of this year. Some are predicting that we will see before then and they may be correct. Not only will this will help on the gas supply side, but since about 40% of all NGLs are derived from natural gas associated with oil production, it will help with the NGL supply as well. The other big piece of the supply equation is in Marcellus and Utica. Even in these place, operators that typically cut their 2015 capital spending plans by about 40% to 50% versus 2014. The rig counts for both of these plays are down by about 42% and 44%, respectively. By late summer, some are forecasting that the rig count in the Marcellus and Utica maybe down to about half of what it was last year. Cutting capital spending and cutting the rig count will affect production. In addition, the infrastructure is significantly constrained in the far northeast portion of Pennsylvania. One pushback I get from this argument, is that when the gas count in the second half of 2008 and beyond, production response was unaffected and kept going up into the right. I believe that it's different this time for multiple reasons. Back in 2008 timeframe, there were still vertical rigs and oil and gas. The operators dropped their vertical rigs first and those rigs were not driving production. It was a horizontal base that was going so. Today there are no vertical drilling the Marcellus or Utica, so decrease in the rig count should have an impact. The second thing that happened is the lateral back in 2008 and early on were short, maybe 3,000 feet or less. As operators dropped towards horizontal rigs, they drilled longer and longer laterals with some operators now consistently drilling 8,000 to 10,000-foot laterals. In addition, the number of frac stage increased and the spacing between stages decrease and same concentration went up. All of this led the higher production. I believe that today, operators who have consistently been drilling 8,000 to 10,000-foot laterals will produce cost space and high sand concentration are in the later innings of the game. Combining their coming growing natural gas demand with the probable response on the supply-side, the outlook for supply and demand coming in to balance and improving natural gas prices are on the horizon. In addition, given the significant infrastructure buildout underway in Appalachia coupled with multiple companies moving their gas out of the basin and improved demand outlook, we believe the basis differentials in Appalachia should narrow and improve. Therefore, I believe pricing should get better later this year and going into 2016. Range is well-positioned for this upcoming event. We have the largest position in the core portion of the Marcellus, Utica and an Upper Devonian. This is an area where all 3 horizons are stacked on top of each other. It's also the area where there is an option either dry acreage. In total, we have about 1.6 million net acres of stacked pay potential. About 900,000 acres are dry and about 700,000 net acres are wet. We have some ability to move our drilling between these areas and horizons. 
Looking at the economics, which pricing on Page 17, although the economics for the wet is good, currently the dry well economics are better. For 2015, we've moved more our planned drilling into the dry area. The other key on the same page is the date in the second row, which speaks to the quality of the acreage. Range's EUR per thousand foot of lateral are best in the southwest portion of the play, and when considering the total Marcellus play, the second only to Cabot. It's interesting to note that Range is in Cabot's lateral are both about 6,000 feet, which is less than most everyone else in the play. Both companies EUR aer tops in the play, which speaks to the quality of the rock. One upside to Range, is that we only drilled a small number of our potential location, and as a continue to drill longer laterals with time, our capital and operating efficiencies should continue to improve, given that we are in the earlier innings of the game.
Utica could be another enhancement to our capital efficiencies and returns. On Slide 14 of our presentation, there are 2 new bullets that we added to this slide. We along with multiple other Utica operators, are members of the consortium for the Utica. We our well and contributed the data to the consortium. Utica well we drilled in Washington County, Pennsylvania, was calculated to have the highest gas in place of any of the analyzed wells Ohio, West Virginia or Pennsylvania. It also has a highest reservoir pressure of any horizontal Utica well drilled and some of the best permeability in the play. This combination of high gas in place, high pressure and high permeability for the Utica, led the Range testing the Claysville's Sportsman's Club well at 59 million cubic feet per day, which is a record 24-hour rate for new well in the Utica or in the Marcellus. About 2 weeks prior to Range announcing this test published a summary of the top 10 shale plays in any play at any time. If our well had been included in the study, it would have been the number 1 well. More importantly, this was has been for 20 million cubic feet per day on an basis for about 12 weeks and has produced about 1.2 Bcf so far. Its extremely early in its life but the performance of is encouraging. As I mentioned previously, on a stack pay basis, we have about 900,000 net acres of dry is potential to drill and about 700,000 net acres to wet gas potential. I have seen some analyst paying all Appalachia NGLs the with same brush and value them all the same. Fortunately, for Range, that's not true. There are 2 key items to consider. The first is a richness of the gas and the second is the sales contract the NGL are sold under. Because we have the richest gas in the basin, and what appear to be more favorable contracts and others, we receive a significant revenue uplift from our NGL as shown on Page 18 of our presentation. Our peers might say their stay in the gas stream  and if their gas is leaner and if the contracts are not as favorable, maybe they should. For Range, we continue to build on our portfolio of agreements for all products, which spreads the market risk of our products across multiple pricing structures, multiple outlets and with multiple counterparties. 
For 2015, the strategy serving us well, and more than 80% of our Range's ethane is tied of gas or oil-linked indices rather than Mont Belvieu. When  Mariner East comes online in the third quarter, Range will be further advantaged as a producer exporting NGL products outside North America. In addition, our propane will be transported more efficiently on pipe rather than trucks and rail adding approximately $50 million to cash flow annually just on propane transport savings. Going forward, as we continue to grow in size and scale, we will have the opportunity to find new markets and I expect our teams will continue to find innovative ways to maximize cash flow. I'll now turn the call over to Roger."

Despite a colder than average winter, the first quarter of 2015 did not follow this pattern. The price for mcfe is 28% lower than last year's first quarter. However, 26% higher production and 15% lower unit cost, combined to generate $423 million in first quarter revenue from natural gas, oil and NGL sales including cash derivative. This topline figure was only 10% below last year's first quarter, despite the headwind from 28% lower prices. The operating and administrative expense story for the first quarter is an exceptionally good one effectively bearing the brunt of much of the decline in prices. As I mentioned earlier, the winter-weather of each year usually brings higher expenses as our field cope with the challenges of an often brutally cold operating environment in Appalachia. This year was even colder than normal, but our operating team really delivered. Not only do we be all of our unit cost guidance figures, direct operating expense was lower than last year on an absolute basis as well. The same applies in the G&A expense and interest expense during the first quarter. All below unit cost guidance and all below last year on an absolute dollar basis. Cash flow for the first quarter was $207 million and EBITDAX for the quarter came in at $244 million. Cash flow per fully diluted share was $1.44. This figures were 21%, 20% and 23%, respectively, lower than last year due to realized prices. 
First quarter book net income was $28 million and earnings calculated using methodology was $31 million, generating earnings of $0.19 per fully diluted share.
The non-GAAP measures that I just mentioned including EBITDAX and analyst earnings are fully reconciled for the GAAP numbers in various supplemental tables, which may be found on the Range website under the Investors tab. 
Looking forward to the second quarter, please reference our first quarter 2015 earnings press release for detailed expense item guidance. 
Now turning to the balance sheet, our first quarter trailing 12-month debt to EBITDAX ratio was 2.9x roughly equal to last year's figure of 2.8x, and below the 3x bigger from the year before. Despite lower realized prices, our first quarter leverage is essentially the same as prior years. Range added additional natural gas, oil and NGL hedges during the first quarter, for the remainder of 2015 as well as additional hedge volumes for 2016 and 2017. Details of these additional hedges may be found in earnings release, 10-Q and the Investors tab on our website. 
The first quarter of 2015 reflecs the impact of lower year-over-year prices for all of our products; however, the quarter also reflects an appropriate response for this environment by the company. Strong production growth, significant reductions in cost on both the unit an absolute basis, additional hedges and continually improving capital efficiencies regarding some of the best well results in our history. Ray, over to you."

Number one, we have a large and high-quality position that is a low risk and repeatable. Having stacked pay potential of 1.6 million acres in the core of the highest hydrocarbon in place in the Appalachian basin opens many doors for us in the market. And historically, throughout this business, the rock rules, and our results indicate that we captured some of the best rock in North America. Number two, our team continues to lead the way in innovation, while delivering great well performance and capital efficiency. And believe our track record over the past several years supports that. And number three, we have product diversity with large positions in both liquids-rich and dry gas, coupled with our first mover advantage, low-cost transportation and favorable sales contract, this gives Range a unique and significant competitive advantage. Execution is the key in 2015 and we are on track with our planned $870 million CapEx budget and to achieve our targeted annual growth of 20%, maintaining our low cost structure and continuing to improve well performance is a core focus at Range. And even though Range is already one of the lowest cost operators, our cost metrics continue to improve. As Roger pointed out, our cost structure is improving on both an absolute and unit basis. Our operating teams are continuing to find ways of increasing efficiencies, enhancing our well designs and lowering cost, while achieving better and better well performance, all allowing us to get 20% growth from a bigger base with $700 million less capital than last year. 
For the first quarter, our production averaged 1.328 Bcf equivalent per day with 33% liquid and represented 4% growth over the fourth quarter of '14 and 26% growth compared to the first quarter of '14. Our growth profile for the next 3 quarters shows production be more heavily weighted to the third and fourth quarters, just as it has been in the past and it should set us up well for momentum going into 2016. Guidance for the second quarter is 1.345 Bcf equivalent per day with approximately 30% liquids. 
In southwest Pennsylvania, on the drilling side, Range is an excellent position regarding the terms on our drilling rigs. We're presently a well on well contracts on 6 of our 9 rigs. Of the 3 rigs that aren't well to well, all contract terms will expire within the next 4 months. This has allowed us to capture significant reductions in day rate and other services along with providing us flexibility in shifting rigs and capabilities around to optimize our fleet. We believe this gives our operating team a huge competitive advantage in driving down costs, introducing new technologies and improving the overall performance of the fleet. 
On the completion side of our operations, the team pumped over a thousand stages in the first quarter averaging over 6.5 stages per day. That's 84% more stages in the quarter and 43% more stages per day than the same quarter last year, with 2 versus 1.6 last year. In March, they set a new record of 424 stages for the month with a new one-day record of 23 stages. I want to offer my to the team for an outstanding job. These types of games promote high utilization rates for our service providers allowing us to work together with them to achieve some of the lowest cost and best value services in the industry. This operational gains also shorten the time between capital being spent and the realization of production revenues, translating to better use of our capital and quicker returns at the bottom line. It simply allows us to do more, do it quicker and do it for less cost. And will allow us to grow more efficiently in 2016 as these improvements continue. 
Late in the first quarter, we brought online a new southwest Pennsylvania dry area pad with the first well going to sales at 31.3 million a day with the lateral length of 796 feet with 41 stages. We have been flowing this well now for 20 days at an average rate of 21.4 million a day. And there is still 2 more wells on the pad to be brought online in the second quarter. And just last week, we brought online a new well in our wet area with an 8668-foot lateral completed with 45 stages and it produced the sales for 24 hours at 43.4 million cubic feet equivalent per day, that's 90 million gas, 520 barrels of condensate and over 3,500 barrels of NGL. We believe this well has now set the record for the highest 24-hour production rate through sales in the entire Marcellus play. As a quick reminder, I want to make 3 important points. Number one, the production rates that we report, whether they are initial sales, 30-day averages or production reported over any length of time have been and will always be reported at actual conditions as constrained by the production facilities and the gathering system. Number two, the wells on the pad tend to come online at staggered times, very rarely are we able to bring more than 1 or 2 wells to sales of the same pad at the same time, as we simply don't design the system to handle those high and short-term initial rates. While we've demonstrated over the years, is this is the most cost-effective way to manage the compression and gathering system for the long-term. 
And number three, while these are outstanding and record-setting initial sales rates, they are not appreciably different from what our  team forecasted that these well would produce. In other words, wells like these will build into our model and production forecast, and I believe of her team is one of the best out there in understanding the rock and getting the most out of it. Initial sales rates only tell part of the story. What's really important is how these wells perform over time. 
Just about a year ago, we announced a record 5-well pad in our super-rich area that came online with the average of 28.6 million cubic feet equivalent per day or 4,773 Boe per day with 65% liquids, and they had an average lateral length of 6,635 feet and 34 stages. The record well in that pad that we announced a year ago, and still the record liquids-rich well in the basin, meaning well that have more than 60% liquids was $38.1 million per day from 7,065-foot laterals with 36 pages. As of the end of March this year, that pad has produced 10.6 Bcf equivalent, which is 5.7 Bcf of gas, 223,000 barrels of condensate and 831,400 barrels of NGL. I believe, if you look at that pad on an absolute or normalized basis, it's among the top performers in the region. Also, about 6 months ago, in the southwest Pennsylvania dry area, we announced a pad with 3 wells that had an average -- 30-day average rate of $17.4 million a day per well, averaging 5364-foot laterals and 28 stages. As of the end of March, those 3 wells have produced over 6.1 Bcf with the largest well at 2.6 Bcf. Again, in the dry gas area, we believe these wells are clearly among the top performers in southwest Pennsylvania. In addition to the quality of the rock, we believe these examples of long-term performance also illustrate the diversity and highlight our ability to manage long-term sustainable growth at very attractive economics, whether it's dry or liquids-rich gas. 
As Jeff referred to in his remarks, our first Utica well in Washington County, Pennsylvania, has now been online since late January, constrained at a design maximum rate of $20 million a day and has produced 1.2 Bcf of gas thus far. Albeit early, the well is meeting all our original expectation. It's producing on an uninterruptible basis, meaning it's up and down and not at a constant rate. And before anyone asks, it's still too early to make any prediction. The second well, which is in opposing lateral on the same pad is being drilled and is still on target to be ready for sale this summer, which is about the same time that our permanent facilities will be ready. And the third well is still on schedule to be drilled later this year. Costs for the second well are still targeted to be approximately $13 million growth, which still includes some and as we get a few more wells under our belt, we believe those costs could come down another 15% to 25%. We expect that the Utica will be different from the early years of our Marcellus play and that it can be drilled on a true development mode right from the beginning. Most all our Utica are expected to be drilled on Marcellus pads making use of the existing infrastructure. Step-out wells won't be necessary, since we have deeper penetrations, lots of offset wells and 3D seismic over most of the area. Essentially, we can drill the wells like a efficient manufacturing process. The Utica infrastructure will be easy, as it's dry gas and we have existing right-of-ways, in which we can lay additional pipes. Considering that early results indicate that we have 400,000 net acres of core dry gas Utica potential under our Marcellus position in southwest Pennsylvania, we believe this play gives us another attractive option for significant growth in value creation going forward. Our team is working on options to begin the Utica drilling program as early as next year if the market conditions support. 
Shifting to Northeast Pennsylvania, our team continues to lower-cost and bring online really impressive wells, and we expect to continue the year with 1 to 2 Of note, our most significant well in the quarter had an initial rate to sales of 26.1 million a day with a 30-day average rate of 21 million a day and a 60-day rate of 19 million a day. The well is completed with a 5514-foot lateral and 28 stages, for a total well cost of approximately $5 million. And we expect an EUR of over 3.3 Bcf per thousand foot of lateral. Following on our top well in the same area that we announced about a year ago, the initial 30-day rate to sales on that well is 25.1 million a day and it produced over 4 Bcf in 12 months. Again, in this area, we are also seeing significant operational gains, along with up to 25% lower cost. Like the super-rich wet, dry, Upper Devonian and Utica in southwest Pennsylvania, this area offers yet another highly attractive area for long-term and sustainable growth. 
Like Jeff said, in his remarks, 2015 is a challenging year for commodity prices, but I'm happy to report that Range is continuing to work safely, improve our operational efficiency, lower our cost structure and at the same time continue to improve our well performance. I also want to note that we have relate to all of our employees that a time budget does not mean cutting. In fact, despite current market conditions, we've increased our focus on environmental compliance and safety. Safeguarding the environment and our employees along with our contractors and the communities where we live and work, is a core philosophy at Range. When you think about the fact that we had our best operating efficiency gains today combined with some of the best well results to date, this quarter again demonstrates our ability to grow value at the bottom line more and more efficiently. As I've often said, the rock rules, and we believe we've captured a large position with stack pay potential and the best rock in the basin coupled. With an experienced team, we been able to achieve these results and have a consistent track record of brother with lower and lower cost, and we believe we are still in the early innings of the ballgame as we continue to drill longer laterals, implement improved completion designs and improve operational efficiency. We still haven't drilled our best well yet. Now back to Jeff."

It's a good question. It's was actually a pretty easy conversation. As evident by the fact that all 29 banks unanimously approved the change, and on our part a 51% vote, no bank chose to be carried, they all stepped up to do right thing and we're very pleased and proud of them doing that. So the reason is that the covenant really no longer fits. We redid our bank facility in the fourth quarter of last year, and in that process, we went to an annual bond base determination. Lot of folks really did not pick up on that. But it was pretty big changes and save a lot of money, as also manage our affairs better over the long-term. But when the banks do the determination, they basically take all your cash flow until your next review date and toss it out. So, in our case, when you went to a full 1-year redetermination, they took essentially over a year of our cash flow out through April of the next year, which encompasses a lot of hedges and everything. So you can see, with the $3 billion-plus bond base that they approved, we are real pleased that that ratified our liquidity and our position. The bond base is -- because that's their primary tool to manage leverage. And the reason is pretty simple, it's a forward-looking test. It's basically a coverage test. So the best way to work your growth is to be looking up the windshield and the break in through accordingly. And that's why the banks rely on that test first and foremost. The debt to EBITDAX covenant, that's a rearview mirror test. So it's really not as to managing leverage over time. In our case, the covenant was kind of no harm, no fault covenant. We were never anywhere close to that ratio. Never intended to be any close to that ratio. But looking at after getting through the restructuring process, we just decided that an interest coverage test was more appropriate. We rely on the annual bond base determination to work with our banks to keep leverage where it needs to be, and that rearview mirror test just didn't make sense for us anymore. And the banks agree with this and we make the swap. And it just removes the source of potential concern from investors that may not have an in-depth knowledge of the process."

We don't have -- while we do have a lot of units formed, we don't really have a lot of limits on the lateral length that we can dig going forward. So we do expect to continue to significantly increase lateral lengths by year going forward. And I think eventually, you will see our average up there in 8,000 to 9,000-foot range. And, of course, every area will have a different optimal lateral length depending on liquids as pressures and all the different things, because remember we have engaged position there in southwest Pennsylvania. So the Marcellus is not the Marcellus old -- it's not the same all across that property. We have super-rich, wet, dry. We have thicker areas, high-pressure areas, a little bit deeper areas.

So that's already reflected in the prices we show in our financials. What's starts up, 20,000 additional barrels of ethane will be going to market certain going to international markets price at a Brent crude sliding scale formula, which will again improve our cash flow. We focus more on improving our cash flow than we do our per unit metrics. So that's an important point we try to make in our slides on 37, 38 and 39 on our slide deck. What's Mariner East is in service and flowing in later this year, we going forward our LRP forecast, we don't need anymore ethane projects to meet spec. We can grow our production under the LRP up to as much as 3 Bcf a day. So we don't need anymore projects. Mariner East will also help in propane service because we can float 20,000 barrels a day in load ships at a very high rate ones that in service. And Jeff referenced, our gas contracts as reflected in our slide deck we show what our transport capacity projects are in later this year, we have our Gas City project came in online, which takes 200,000 a day of firm capacity over to the Midwest, where we get much better pricing. It's the indexes over the very stable. And then later in 2016 and 2017, we have other firm transport capacity projects coming online, which again will take our gas away from the Appalachian basin to more stable of indexes and help improve our cash flow."

Those numbers were built into our plan this year, but it's also important to realize that all those savings didn't kick- in January 1. They really kick-in towards the end of the first quarter, and then they start flowing through the rest of the year. So I think you'll see the CapEx will come down quarter-over-quarter, because we tend to -- we have more rigs running at the first part of year than we were at the last part of year.

And that was an exact case that you just described, where we went into a well, a pad that had 5 wells on it that were 2 years old, had been online for 2 years and we put 2 new wells sort of in between the laterals. And there are really 3 things we wanted to test. We wanted to test how much less would the well cost, drilling them on since all the existing infrastructure roads, pads, water, gathering system and all that sort of things was already there. Number two, did the new wells interfere with older wells. And then number three, how much better would the new wells be with the new completion take -- newer completion technology. And number one, the wells were $850,000 a piece cheaper. And we think that number could even be higher as we begin to do more of this as we go forward. Number two, there was no impact to the older wells, which I think is very significant, and I think you've read a lot about our competitors that are in non-core areas. They have not been able to do that, where they have seen big hits on offsetting wells. And then, third thing, the wells produced 53% more production than the first year as compared to the older wells that had I think early on the piece were 4x higher. So clearly, we see that as unbelievable upside going forward, because we clearly have a lot of those pads already out there. Some of them as much as 8 or 9, 10 years old on those. So I think that going forward, you're going to see us probably in about 2017, '18 as we get into our further plans down the road were bigger and bigger percentage of our wells each year will be going back on to those existing pads. We see that as a huge step change in both well cost, efficiencies and well performance and then in also in gathering system cost. Because your gathering system is already there, already been mostly paid for. So essentially those wells will produce at a much lower gathering fee. So we see that as big potential going forward. There is not really any of those wells planned at this year as we are still trying to really optimize our program to try to get to wells, the final HBP work done that we need to get done, the infrastructure buildouts that we're still doing over this year and next year.

And one thing I want to correct you, those aren't just monster wells or monster pads, is that both are well pads and we just haven't been able to turn the other wells on the but we expect to actually pretty similar results from other wells on the pad. Part of our long-term goal that the team works on, sometimes 3, 5 and 7 years in advance, is looking at the gathering system and we have very intricate models of the gathering system. We are working with MarkWest on deliverability at any given point, compressor stations, upgrades, process and plant and so forth. So all of this has been built into that plant, and we don't have a choke management program as a gimmick or a pad or anything like that to manage the wells. We're simply trying to produce those wells of what we believe is the optimum performance that will generate the best economics for the project at the end of the day. It's a long-term lookay that we take at it. Initial production rates are great. They are fun to talk about. It's kind of yardstick to compare wells, and these in a case like these 2 monster pads, you had a lot of facilities there for maybe 3 wells or 5 wells, depending on how many wells were on each pad. And what you end up doing is, bring one-on-one wells on and just let it produce through the facilities that all 5 wells might use to see what is capable of. And actuality will probably choke that well back and then start opening up the other wells and try to get them online. They will all be produced on con trained conditions for quite a while in that case. But that's the way we designed it going forward. And we think that keeps our cost structure down. It's better planning with MarkWest, which allows them to get their cost structure down, which in gets lower gathering fees. And again, we're really focused on the years ahead and watching that gathering fee falloff as we go back in and fill in on these areas, we think that's the most efficient way to develop this project long-term. Because again, we've only touched a very small portion of the total number of locations that we can drill going forward just in the Marcellus. On the Utica and places like that, the other stack pay potential, we've got a long ways to go in that also. As for as the Utica well, when we get the permanent facilities online in the middle of the summer, those wells will be put online and they will be uninterruptible. In other words, will they be able to hold them at a constant rate, and this production facilities are designed to limit those wells at 20 million a day. And again that's not necessarily for any sort of choke management or anything that we're worried about on that end of it as much as it is trying to optimize the cost for those facilities in that gathering system that we're putting in place."

I'm going to begin my remarks with some macro comments about our industry and then focus specifically on Range. Starting with the macro, as you all know, U.S. gas supply has increased ahead of demand causing low gas prices in most of",1735,"Thank you, Rodney. I'm going to begin my remarks with some macro comments about our industry and then focus specifically on Range. 
Starting with the macro, as you all know, U.S. gas supply has increased ahead of demand causing low gas prices in most of the U.S. and negative basis differentials in the Appalachian basin. We believe that over the last year, the U.S. gas market typically has been oversupplied by about 2 Bcf to 4 Bcf per day. However, we see positive things that are happening on both the demand and supply sides of the equation. On the demand side, I believe that most people would agree that additional natural gas demand is coming and coming in a very meaningful way. 
In our presentation on our website on Page 19, we have a projection on natural gas demand with time. The good news is that gas demand is expected to increase about 2 Bcf per day this year. This projected 2015 increase in gas demand as driven by the conversion of coal-fired power generation to gas, increased industrial demand, plant exports of gas to Mexico and LNG exports from the Gulf Coast coming online.
For 2016 through '20, natural gas demand is projected to increase by about 3 Bcf to 4 Bcf per day each and every year. It shows about 20 Bcf per day of incremental natural gas demand by 2020. There are multiple other reports that project natural gas demand with time in the report we reference as consistent with our internal work and within the range of other reports that I've seen. 
The other side of the equation is the supply side. The supply side can be broken into 2 pieces: natural gas associated with oil wells and natural gas from gas wells. We believe that prior to the recent oil rig count reduction, there was approximately 16 Bcf per day of natural gas being produced associated with oil production. That's almost the equivalent of the Marcellus and Utica combined. Of the 16 Bcf per day of natural gas production associated with oil, about 8 Bcf per day is estimated to be associated with shale oil and unconventional oil plays. 
For the first time in a long while, oil isn't $90 to $100 per barrel, it's roughly half that. The industry's response has been to cut to 2015 capital programs to about 40% to 50% of their 2014 budgets. Given these reductions so far, the oil rig count is down about 56% and appears to be going further. Given that moving oil through low permeability rock is harder than moving gas through low permeability rock, the first year declines of unconventional resource oil wells are much steeper than gas wells and typically are in the 70% to 90% range. Given the continuing steep drop in the rig count and typically steep first year declines of those oil wells, I believe that we'll see a production response in the second half of this year. Some are predicting that we'll see it before then and they may be correct. Not only will this will help on the gas supply side, but since about 40% of all NGLs are derived from natural gas associated with oil production, it will help with the NGL supply as well. 
The other big piece of the supply equation is in Marcellus and Utica. Even in these plays, operators that typically cut their 2015 capital spending plans by about 40% to 50% versus 2014. The rig counts for both of these plays are down by about 42% and 44%, respectively. By late summer, some are forecasting that the rig count in the Marcellus and Utica maybe down to about half of what it was last year. Cutting capital spending and cutting the rig count will affect production. In addition, the infrastructure is significantly constrained in the far Northeast portion of Pennsylvania. One pushback I get from this argument is that when the gas rig count plummeted in the second half of 2008 and beyond, the production response was unaffected and it kept going up into the right. I believe that it's different this time for multiple reasons. Back in 2008 timeframe, there were still vertical rigs drilling for gas. The operators dropped their vertical rigs first, and those rigs were not driving production. It was the horizontal rigs that were doing so. Today, there are no vertical drilling the Marcellus or Utica, so decreasing the rig count should have an impact. 
The second thing that happened is the lateral lengths back in 2008 and early on were short, maybe 3,000 feet or less. As operators dropped to horizontal rigs, they drilled longer and longer laterals with some operators now consistently drilling 8,000 to 10,000-foot laterals. In addition, the number of frac stages increased and the spacing between stages decreased and same concentrations went up. All of this led to higher production. I believe that today, operators who have consistently been drilling 8,000 to 10,000-foot laterals would reduce cluster spacing and high sand concentrations are in the later innings of the game. 
Combining the coming growing natural gas demand with the probable response on the supply side, the outlook for supply and demand coming in to balance and improving natural gas prices are on the horizon. In addition, given the significant infrastructure build-out underway in Appalachia, coupled with multiple companies moving their gas out of the basin and improved demand outlook, we believe the basis differentials in Appalachia should narrow and improve. Therefore, I believe pricing should get better later this year and on into 2016. Range is well-positioned for this upcoming event. We have the largest position in the core portion of the Marcellus, Utica and Upper Devonian. This is the area where all 3 horizons are stacked on top of each other. It's also the area where there's an option to drill either wet or dry acreage. In total, we have about 1.6 million net acres of stacked pay potential. About 900,000 acres are dry and about 700,000 net acres are wet. We have some ability to move our drilling between these areas and horizons. 
Looking at the economics with strip pricing on Page 17, although the economics for the wet wells are good, currently the dry well economics are better. For 2015, we've moved more of our planned drilling into the dry area. 
The other key on the same page is the date in the second row, which speaks to the quality of the acreage. Range's EURs per thousand foot of lateral are best in the southwest portion of the play. And when considering the total Marcellus play, they're second only to Cabot. It's interesting to note that Range's and Cabot's lateral lengths are both about 6,000 feet, which is less than most everyone else in the play. Both companies EURs are tops in the play, which speaks to the quality of the rock. One upside for Range is that we only drilled a small number of our potential locations. And as we continue to drill longer laterals with time, our capital and operating efficiencies should continue to improve given that we are in the earlier innings of the game.
Utica could be another enhancement to our capital efficiencies and returns. On Slide 14 of our presentation, there are 2 new bullets that we added to this slide. We, along with multiple other Utica operators, are members of the consortium for the Utica. We record our well and contributed the data to the consortium. The Utica well we drilled in Washington County, Pennsylvania, was calculated to have the highest gas in place of any of the analyzed consortium wells in Ohio, West Virginia or Pennsylvania. It also has a highest reservoir pressure of any horizontal Utica well drilled and some of the best permeability in the play. This combination of high gas in place, high pressure and high permeability for the Utica led the Range testing to Claysville Sportsmen's Club well at 59 million cubic feet per day, which is a record 24-hour rate for any well in the Utica or in the Marcellus. About 2 weeks prior to Range announcing this test rate, [indiscernible] published a summary of the top 10 shale wells in any play at any time. If our well had been included in the study, it would have been the #1 well. More importantly, this was -- been online at 20 million cubic feet per day on an interruptible basis for about 12 weeks and has produced about 1.2 Bcf so far. Its extremely early in its life but the performance so far is encouraging. 
As I mentioned previously, on a stack-pay basis, we have about 900,000 net acres of dry gas potential to drill and about 700,000 net acres of wet gas potential. I've seen some analysts paying all Appalachia NGLs the with same brush and value them all the same. Fortunately for Range, that's not true. There are 2 key items to consider: The first is a richness of the gas and the second is the sales contracts, the NGL they're sold under. Because we have the richest gas in the basin and what appear to be more favorable contracts than others, we receive a significant revenue uplift from our NGLs as shown on Page 18 of our presentation. Our peers might say their ethane should stay in the gas stream. And if their gas is leaner and if their contracts are not as favorable, maybe they should. 
For Range, we continue to build on our portfolio of agreements for all products, which spreads the market risk of our products across multiple pricing structures, multiple outlets and with multiple counter-parties. For 2015, the strategy is serving us well as more than 80% of our Range's ethane is tied to gas or oil-linked indices rather than Mont Belvieu. When  Mariner East comes online in the third quarter, Range will be further advantaged as a producer exporting NGL products outside North America. In addition, our propane will be transported more efficiently on pipe rather than trucks and rail adding approximately $50 million to cash flow annually just on propane transport savings. 
Going forward, as we continue to grow in size and scale, we'll have the opportunity to find new markets, and I expect our teams will continue to find innovative ways to maximize cash flow. I'll now turn the call over to Roger."

Winter weather usually brings higher oil, natural gas and NGL prices paired with higher operating costs. Despite a colder than average winter, the first quarter of 2015 did not follow this pattern. Realized price for mcfe is 28% lower t",503,"Thank you, Jeff. Winter weather usually brings higher oil, natural gas and NGL prices paired with higher operating costs. Despite a colder than average winter, the first quarter of 2015 did not follow this pattern. 
Realized price for mcfe is 28% lower than last year's first quarter. However, 26% higher production and 15% lower unit cost combined to generate $423 million in first quarter revenue from natural gas, oil and NGL sales including cash-settled derivatives. This top line figure was only 10% below last year's first quarter, despite the headwind from 28% lower prices. The operating and administrative expense story for the first quarter is an exceptionally good one effectively bearing the brunt of much of the decline in prices. 
As I mentioned earlier, the winter weather of each year usually brings higher expenses as our field professionals cope with the challenges of an often brutally cold operating environment in Appalachia. This year was even colder than normal, but our operating teams really delivered. Not only did we beat all of our unit cost guidance figures, direct operating expense was lower than last year on an absolute basis as well. 
The same applies the G&A expense and interest expense during the first quarter, all below unit cost guidance and all below last year on an absolute dollar basis. Cash flow for the first quarter was $207 million and EBITDAX for the quarter came in at $244 million. Cash flow per fully diluted share was $1.24. These figures were 21%, 20% and 23%, respectively, lower than last year due to realized prices. First quarter book net income was $28 million, and earnings calculated using analyst methodology was $31 million, generating earnings of $0.19 per fully diluted share.
The non-GAAP measures that I just mentioned, including EBITDAX and analyst earnings, are fully reconciled to the GAAP numbers in various supplemental tables, which may be found on the Range website under the Investors tab. 
Looking forward to the second quarter, please reference our first quarter 2015 earnings press release for detailed expense item guidance. 
Now turning to the balance sheet, our first quarter trailing 12-month debt-to-EBITDAX ratio was 2.9x, roughly equal to last year's figure of 2.8x and below the 3x figure from the year before. Despite lower realized prices, our first quarter leverage is essentially the same as prior years. Range added additional natural gas, oil and NGL hedges during the first quarter for the remainder of 2015 as well as additional hedge volumes for 2016 and 2017. Details of these additional hedges may be found in the earnings release, the 10-Q and the Investors tab on our website. 
The first quarter of 2015 reflects the impact of lower year-over-year prices for all of our products. However, the quarter also reflects an appropriate response for this environment by the company. Strong production growth, significant reductions in cost on both the unit and absolute basis, additional hedges and continually improving capital efficiency regarding some of the best well results in our history. 
Ray, over to you."

At Range, we believe there are 3 key facts that differentiate us from our peers: Number one, we have a large and high-quality position that is low risk and repeatable. Having stack-pay potential of 1.6 million acres in the core of the highe",2036,"Thanks, Roger. At Range, we believe there are 3 key facts that differentiate us from our peers: Number one, we have a large and high-quality position that is low risk and repeatable. Having stack-pay potential of 1.6 million acres in the core of the highest hydrocarbon in place in the Appalachian basin opens many doors for us in the market. And historically, throughout this business, the rock rules. And our results indicate we've captured some of the best rock in North America. 
Number two, our team continues to lead the way in innovation while delivering great well performance and capital efficiency. And we believe our track record over the past several years supports that. And number three, we have product diversity with large positions in both liquids rich and dry gas. Coupled with our first mover advantage, low-cost transportation and favorable sales contract, this gives Range a unique and significant competitive advantage. Execution is the key in 2015, and we're on track with our planned $870 million CapEx budget and to achieve our targeted annual growth of 20%. Maintaining our low-cost structure and continuing to improve well performance is a core focus at Range. And even though Range is already one of the lowest cost operators, our cost metrics continue to improve. As Roger pointed out, our cost structure is improving on both an absolute and unit basis. Our operating teams are continuing to find ways of increasing efficiencies, enhancing our well designs and lowering cost, while achieving better and better well performance, all allowing us to get 20% growth from a bigger base with $700 million less capital than last year. 
For the first quarter, our production averaged 1.328 Bcf equivalent per day with 33% liquid and represented 4% growth over the fourth quarter '14 and 26% growth compared to the first quarter of '14. Our growth profile for the next 3 quarters shows production being more heavily weighted to the third and fourth quarters, just as it has been in the past. And it should set us up well with momentum going into 2016. Guidance for the second quarter is 1.345 Bcf equivalent per day with approximately 30% liquids. 
In Southwest Pennsylvania on the drilling side, Range is in an excellent position regarding the terms on our drilling rigs. We're presently on well-to-well contracts on 6 of our 9 rigs. Of the 3 rigs that aren't well to well, all contract terms will expire within the next 4 months. This has allowed us to capture significant reductions in day rate and other services along with providing us flexibility in shifting rigs and capabilities around to optimize our fleet. We believe this gives our operating team a huge competitive advantage in driving down costs, introducing new technologies and improving the overall performance of the fleet. 
On the completion side of our operations, the team pumped over a thousand stages in the first quarter averaging over 6.5 stages per day. That's 84% more stages in the quarter and 43% more stages per day than the same quarter last year with 2 crews versus 1.6 crews last year. In March, they set a new record of 424 stages for the month with a new one-day record of 23 stages. I want to offer my congratulations to the team for an outstanding job. These types of games promote high utilization rates for our service providers allowing us to work together with them to achieve some of the lowest cost and best value services in the industry. These operational gains also shorten the time between capital being spent and the realization of production revenues, translating to better use of our capital and quicker returns at the bottom line. It simply allows us to do more, do it quicker and do it for less cost and will allow us to grow more efficiently in 2016 as these improvements continue. 
Late in the first quarter, we brought online a new Southwest Pennsylvania dry area pad with the first well going to sales at 31.3 million a day with a lateral length of 796 feet with 41 stages. We've been flowing this well now for 20 days at an average rate of 21.4 million a day. And there's still 2 more wells on the pad to be brought online in the second quarter. 
And just last week, we brought online a new well in our wet area with an 8,668 foot lateral completed with 45 stages. And it produced the sales for 24 hours at 43.4 million cubic feet equivalent per day. That's 19 million gas, 520 barrels of condensate and over 3,500 barrels of NGL. We believe this well has now set the record for the highest 24-hour production rate through sales in the entire Marcellus play. 
As a quick reminder, I want to make 3 important points. Number one, the production rates that we report, whether they're initial sales, 30-day averages or production reported over any length of time have been and will always be reported at actual conditions as constrained by the production facilities and the gathering system. Number two, the wells on the pad tend to come online at staggered times, very rarely are we able to bring more than 1 or 2 wells to sales off the same pad at the same time as we simply don't design a  system to handle those high and short-term initial rates. What we've demonstrated over the years is this is the most cost-effective way to manage the compression and gathering system for the long term. 
And number three, while these are outstanding and record-setting initial sales rates, they are not appreciably different from what our team forecasted that these well would produce. In other words, wells like these were built into our model and production forecast, and I believe our team is one of the best out there in understanding the rock and getting the most out of it. The initial sales rates only tell part of the story. What's really important is how these wells perform over time. 
Just about a year ago, we announced a record 5-well pad in our super-rich area that came online with  a total average of 28.6 million cubic equivalent per day or 4,773 Boe per day with 65% liquids. And they had an average lateral length of 6,635 feet and 34 stages. The record well in that pad that we announced a year ago and still the record liquids-rich well in the basin, meaning wells that have more than 60% liquids was $38.1 million a day from a 7,065 foot lateral with 36 stages. 
As of the end of March this year, that pad has produced 10.6 Bcf equivalent, which is 5.7 Bcf of gas, 223,000 barrels of condensate and 831,400 barrels of NGL. I believe if you look at that pad on an absolute or normalized basis, it's among the top performers in the region. Also, about 6 months ago, in the Southwest Pennsylvania dry area, we announced a pad with 3 wells that had an average, 30-day average rate of $17.4 million a day per well, averaging 5,364 foot laterals in 28 stages. As of the end of March, those 3 wells have produced over 6.1 Bcf with the largest well at 2.6 Bcf. Again, in the dry gas area, we believe these wells are clearly among the top performers in Southwest Pennsylvania. 
In addition to the quality of the rock, we believe these examples of long-term performance also illustrate the diversity and highlight our ability to manage long-term sustainable growth at very attractive economics whether it's dry or liquids-rich gas. 
As Jeff referred to in his remarks, our first Utica well in Washington County, Pennsylvania, has now been online since late January, constrained at a design maximum rate of $20 million a day and has produced 1.2 Bcf of gas thus far. Albeit early, the well is meeting all our original expectation. It's producing on an interruptible basis, meaning it's up and down and not at a constant rate. And before anyone asks, it's still too early to make an EUR prediction. 
The second well, which is in opposing lateral on the same pad, is being drilled and is still on target to be ready for sale this summer, which is about the same time that our permanent facilities will be ready. And the third well is still on schedule to be drilled later this year. Costs for the second well are still targeted to be approximately $13 million growth, which still includes some science [ph]. And as we get a few more wells under our belt, we believe those costs could come down another 15% to 25%. We expect that the Utica will be different from the early years of our Marcellus play and that it can be drilled on a true development mode right from the beginning. Most all our Utica wells are expected to be drilled on Marcellus pads making use of the existing infrastructure. 
Step-out wells won't be necessary, since we have deeper penetrations, lots of offset wells and 3D seismic over most of the area. Essentially, we can drill the wells like a very efficient manufacturing process. The Utica infrastructure will be easy, as it's dry gas. And we have existing right-of-ways in which we can lay additional pipes. Considering that early results indicate we have 400,000 net acres of core dry gas Utica potential under our Marcellus position in Southwest Pennsylvania, we believe this play gives us another attractive option for significant growth in value creation going forward. Our team is working on options to begin a Utica drilling program as early as next year if the market conditions support. 
Shifting to Northeast Pennsylvania, our team continues to lower cost and bring online really impressive wells. And we expect to continue the year with 1 to 2 drilling rigs. Of note, our most significant well in the quarter had an initial rate to sales of 26.1 million a day with a 30-day average rate of 21 million a day and a 60-day rate of 19 million a day. The well is completed with a 5,514 foot lateral and 28 stages for a total well cost of approximately $5 million. And we expect an EUR of over 3.3 Bcf per thousand foot of lateral. Following up on our top well in the same area that we announced about a year ago, the initial 30-day rate to sales on that well was 25.1 million a day, and it produced over 4 Bcf in 12 months. Again, in this area, we're also seeing significant operational gains, along with up to 25% lower cost. Like the super rich wet, dry, Upper Devonian and Utica in Southwest Pennsylvania, this area offers yet another highly attractive area for long-term and sustainable growth. 
Like Jeff said, in his remarks, 2015 is a challenging year for commodity prices, but I'm happy to report that Range is continuing to work safely, improve our operational efficiency, lower our cost structure, and at the same time, continue to improve our well performance. 
I also want to note that we have relayed to all of our employees that a tightened budget does not mean cutting corners. In fact, despite current market conditions, we've increased our focus on environmental compliance and safety. Safeguarding the environment and our employees, along with our contractors and the communities where we live and work, is a core philosophy at Range. When you think about the fact that we had our best operating efficiency gains today, combined with some of the best well results to date, this quarter again demonstrates our ability to grow value at the bottom line more and more efficiently. As I've often said, the rock rules. And we believe we've captured a large position with stack-pay potential and the best rock in the basin. Coupled with an experienced team, we've been able to achieve these results and have a consistent track record of growth with lower and lower cost. And we believe we're still in the early innings of the ballgame as we continue to drill longer laterals, implement improved completion designs and improve operational efficiencies. We still haven't drilled our best well yet. Now back to Jeff."

As evident by the fact that all 29 banks unanimously approved the change. And on our part, a 51% vote, no bank chose to be carried. They all stepped up, do the right thing. And we're very pleased and proud of them for doing that. So the reason is that the covenant really no longer fits. We redid our bank facility in the fourth quarter of last year. And in that process, we went to an annual Borrowing Base determination. A lot of folks really didn't pick up on that. But it was pretty big changes, saved us a lot of money. It helps us manage our affairs better over the long term. But when the banks do the Borrowing Base determination, they basically take all your cash flow until your next review date and toss it out. So, in our case, when you went to a full 1 year redetermination, they took essentially over a year of our cash flow out through April of the next year, which encompasses a lot of our hedges and everything. So you can see, with the $3 billion-plus Borrowing Base that they approved, we're real pleased that, that ratified our liquidity and our position. The Borrowing Base is -- because that's their primary tool to manage leverage. And the reason is pretty simple, it's a forward-looking test. It's basically a PV-9 coverage test. So the best way to work your growth is to be looking out the windshield and work in the break and throttle accordingly. And that's why the banks rely on that test first and foremost. The debt-to-EBITDAX covenant, that's a rearview mirror test. So it's really not as applicable to managing leverage over time. In our case, the covenant was kind of a no-harm-no-foul covenant. We're never anywhere close to that ratio, never intended to be anywhere close to that ratio. But looking at it after getting through the restructuring process, we just decided that an interest coverage test was more appropriate. We rely on the annual Borrowing Base determination to work with our banks to keep leverage where it needs to be. And that rearview mirror test just didn't make sense for us anymore. And the banks agreed with this, and we made the swap. And it just removes the source of potential concern from investors that may not have an in-depth knowledge of the process."

We have what we more commonly refer to inside the company as relationships. We've had, for instance, frac-ed the majority of our completion work in Southwest PA, really for almost -- since 2007. So that long-term relationship allows us to work with them on key performance indicators that help us work more efficiently, and then we're able to arrive at pricing, kind of based on the market and utilization that allows us to do things that a lot of our competitors can't do. And that consistent strategy over the years has allowed us to innovate with a lot of things like new manifolds that our teams designed and new line of systems to protect the pads. And all those sort of things that have allowed us to go forward. So we don't really technically have any long-term frac contracts. And that was one of the things that allowed us, like on the drilling rig side, to take advantage of a what we were seeing happening back in December and January, work with our supply-side vendors and suppliers to create prices where they could still work and we could still continue on with some pretty significant savings.

We don't have -- while we do have a lot of units formed, we don't really have a lot of limits on the lateral length that we can do going forward. So we do expect to continue to significantly increase lateral lengths by year going forward. And I think eventually, you will see our average up there in 8,000 to 9,000-foot range. And of course, every area will have a different optimal at-lateral length depending on liquids and -- as well pressures and all the different things. Because remember, we have a huge position there in Southwest Pennsylvania. So the Marcellus is not the Marcellus  -- it's not the same all across that property. We have super rich, wet, dry. We have thicker areas, high-pressure areas, a little bit deeper areas. So all of those wells will be designed differently. But we do expect to get significantly longer each year.

And if you were to think about it from a standpoint, longer is certainly better because economies of scale kick in and so for -- so longer laterals do get cheaper on a per foot basis. And we have seen well performance hold rock steady. And in fact, I think these 2 wells will probably end up having some of the highest performance on a per thousand foot basis of any of the wells in the area. So we do see good improvements going forward. And the third point I want to make is we really did forecast -- our team is getting really good at understanding this rock. And I think our track record supports that. But they were forecasting rates pretty close to these in our model. So that's part of what was a significant point in allowing us to reach 20% growth this year to $700 million less capital. That's what we've been saying for many years is our capital efficiency is going to flow through as we drill longer laterals, and our team gets better at getting more out of the rock.

They really kick in towards the end of the first quarter, and then they start flowing through the rest of the year.

And that was an exact case that you just described where we went into a well, a pad that had 5 wells on it that were 2 years old, had been online for 2 years. And we put 2 new wells sort of in between the laterals. And there are really 3 things we wanted to test. We wanted to test how much less would the wells cost, drilling them on since all the existing infrastructure roads, pads, water, gathering system and all that sort of thing was already there. Number two, did the new wells interfere with the older wells? And then number three, how much better would the new wells be with the new completion, newer completion technology. And number one, the wells were $850,000 a piece cheaper. And we think that number could even be higher as we begin to do more of this as we go forward. Number two, there was no impact to the older wells, which I think is very significant. And I think you've read a lot about our competitors that are in noncore areas. They have not been able to do that, where they've seen big hits on their offsetting wells. And then third thing, the wells produced 53% more production than the first year as compared to the older wells that had -- I think early on, the eyepiece were 4x higher. So clearly, we see that as unbelievable upside going forward, because we clearly have a lot of those pads already out there, some of them as much as 8 or 9, 10 years old on those. So I think that going forward, you're going to see us probably in about 2017, '18 as we get into our further plans down the road where a bigger and bigger percentage of our wells each year will be going back on to those existing pads. We see that as a huge step change in both well cost, efficiencies and well performance and then in also in gathering system cost. Because your gathering system's already there, already been mostly paid for. So essentially, those wells will produce at a much lower gathering fee. So we see that as big potential going forward. There's not really any of those wells planned at this year as we're still trying to really optimize our program to try to get the wells, the final HBP work done that we need to get done, the infrastructure buildouts that we're still doing over this year and next year.

Part of our long-term goal that the team works on, sometimes 3, 5 and 7 years in advance, is looking at the gathering system. And we have very intricate models of the gathering system. We're working with MarkWest on deliverability at any given point, compressor stations, upgrades, process and plant and so forth. So all of this has been built into that plan. And we don't have a choke management program as a gimmick or a pad or anything like that to manage the wells. We're simply trying to produce those wells of what we believe is the optimum performance that will generate the best economics for the project at the end of the day. It's a long-term look that we take at it. Initial production rates are great. They're fun to talk about. It's kind of a yardstick to compare wells. And these -- in a case like these 2 monster pads, you had a lot of facilities there for maybe 3 wells or 5 wells, depending on how many wells were on each pad. And what you end up doing is bring one of the wells on and just let it produce through the facilities that all 5 wells might use to see what it's capable of. And actuality, we'll probably choke that well back and then start opening up the other wells and try to get them online. They'll all be produced or constrained conditions for quite a while in that case. But that's the way we designed it going forward. And we think that keeps our cost structure down. It's better planning with MarkWest, which allows them to get their cost structure down, which in turn gets lower gathering fees. And again, we're really focused on the years ahead and watching that gathering fee fall off as we go back in and fill in on these areas. We think that's the most efficient way to develop this project long term. Because again, we've only touched a very small portion of the total number of locations that we can drill going forward just in the Marcellus, on the Utica and places like that. The other stack-pay potential, we've got a long ways to go on that also. As for as the Utica well, when we get the permanent facilities online in the middle of the summer, those wells will be put online, and they will be uninterruptible. In other words, we'll be able to hold them at a constant rate. And these production facilities are designed to limit those wells at 20 million a day. And again, that's not necessarily for any sort of choke management or anything that we're worried about on that end of it as much as it is trying to optimize the cost for those facilities in that gathering system that we're putting in play."

And we request that 75 years plus of infrastructure was built right through this area. And we were able to tap into all of that. We were first movers in the play. And working with MarkWest, we've been able to put a huge system of interleaks and placed there for the wet gas. I think what a lot of people forget is there's clearly also a lot of dry gas lines in that system as there's a lot of residue gas that comes off the plant, a lot of meter taps into the different pipelines, Tennessee and Columbia and lining in and so forth. So we have all of that together growing over time. And then the third piece, the third cornerstone of it is the market and have an actual customers on the other end to use the product. And that's also been a core philosophy of ours for years is to cultivate, not only the firm transportation and the actual infrastructure to get there, but also the consumers on the other end to use that. So in part of our plan that the team is currently working on today, to put an effective Utica development program together, which could begin as early as next year depending on market conditions.

I'm going to begin my remarks with some macro comments about our industry and then focus specifically on Range. Starting with the macro, as you all know, U.S. gas supply has increased ahead of demand causing low gas prices in most of",1735,"Thank you, Rodney. I'm going to begin my remarks with some macro comments about our industry and then focus specifically on Range. 
Starting with the macro, as you all know, U.S. gas supply has increased ahead of demand causing low gas prices in most of the U.S. and negative basis differentials in the Appalachian basin. We believe that over the last year, the U.S. gas market typically has been oversupplied by about 2 Bcf to 4 Bcf per day. However, we see positive things that are happening on both the demand and supply sides of the equation. On the demand side, I believe that most people would agree that additional natural gas demand is coming and coming in a very meaningful way. 
In our presentation on our website on Page 19, we have a projection on natural gas demand with time. The good news is that gas demand is expected to increase about 2 Bcf per day this year. This projected 2015 increase in gas demand as driven by the conversion of coal-fired power generation to gas, increased industrial demand, plant exports of gas to Mexico and LNG exports from the Gulf Coast coming online.
For 2016 through '20, natural gas demand is projected to increase by about 3 Bcf to 4 Bcf per day each and every year. It shows about 20 Bcf per day of incremental natural gas demand by 2020. There are multiple other reports that project natural gas demand with time in the report we reference as consistent with our internal work and within the range of other reports that I've seen. 
The other side of the equation is the supply side. The supply side can be broken into 2 pieces: natural gas associated with oil wells and natural gas from gas wells. We believe that prior to the recent oil rig count reduction, there was approximately 16 Bcf per day of natural gas being produced associated with oil production. That's almost the equivalent of the Marcellus and Utica combined. Of the 16 Bcf per day of natural gas production associated with oil, about 8 Bcf per day is estimated to be associated with shale oil or unconventional oil plays. 
For the first time in a long while, oil isn't $90 to $100 per barrel, it's roughly half that. The industry's response has been to cut their 2015 capital programs to about 40% to 50% of their 2014 budgets. Given these reductions so far, the oil rig count is down about 56% and appears to be going further. Given that moving oil through low permeability rock is harder than moving gas through low permeability rock, the first year declines of unconventional resource oil wells are much steeper than gas wells and typically are in the 70% to 90% range. Given the continuing steep drop in the rig count and typically steep first year declines of those oil wells, I believe that we'll see a production response in the second half of this year. Some are predicting that we'll see it before then and they may be correct. Not only will this help on the gas supply side, but since about 40% of all NGLs are derived from natural gas associated with oil production, it will help with the NGL supply as well. 
The other big piece of the supply equation is in Marcellus and Utica. Even in these plays, operators have typically cut their 2015 capital spending plans by about 40% to 50% versus 2014. The rig counts for both of these plays are down by about 42% and 44%, respectively. By late summer, some are forecasting that the rig count in the Marcellus and Utica may be down to about half of what it was last year. Cutting capital spending and cutting the rig count will affect production. In addition, the infrastructure is significantly constrained in the far Northeast portion of Pennsylvania. One pushback I get from this argument is that when the gas rig count plummeted in the second half of 2008 and beyond, the production response was unaffected and it kept going up into the right. I believe that it's different this time for multiple reasons. Back in 2008 timeframe, there were still vertical rigs drilling for gas. The operators dropped their vertical rigs first, and those rigs were not driving production. It was the horizontal rigs that were doing so. Today, there are no vertical rigs drilling the Marcellus or Utica, so decreasing the rig count should have an impact. 
The second thing that happened is the lateral lengths back in 2008 and early on were short, maybe 3,000 feet or less. As operators dropped horizontal rigs, they drilled longer and longer laterals with some operators now consistently drilling 8,000 to 10,000-foot laterals. In addition, the number of frac stages increased and the spacing between stages decreased and same concentrations went up. All of this led to higher production. I believe that today, operators who have consistently been drilling 8,000 to 10,000-foot laterals with reduced cluster spacing and high sand concentrations are in the later innings of the game. 
Combining the coming growing natural gas demand with the probable response on the supply side, the outlook for supply and demand coming in to balance and improving natural gas prices are on the horizon. In addition, given the significant infrastructure build-out underway in Appalachia, coupled with multiple companies moving their gas out of the basin and improved demand outlook, we believe the basis differentials in Appalachia should narrow and improve. Therefore, I believe pricing should get better later this year and on into 2016. Range is well-positioned for this upcoming event. We have the largest position in the core portion of the Marcellus, Utica and Upper Devonian. This is the area where all 3 horizons are stacked on top of each other. It's also the area where there's an option to drill either wet or dry acreage. In total, we have about 1.6 million net acres of stacked pay potential. About 900,000 acres are dry and about 700,000 net acres are wet. We have some ability to move our drilling between these areas and horizons. 
Looking at the economics with strip pricing on Page 17, although the economics for the wet wells are good, currently the dry well economics are better. For 2015, we've moved more of our planned drilling into the dry area. 
The other key on the same page is the date in the second row, which speaks to the quality of the acreage. Range's EURs per thousand foot of lateral are best in the southwest portion of the play. And when considering the total Marcellus play, they're second only to Cabot. It's interesting to note that Range's and Cabot's lateral lengths are both about 6,000 feet, which is less than most everyone else in the play. Both companies EURs are tops in the play, which speaks to the quality of the rock. One upside for Range is that we only drilled a small number of our potential locations. And as we continue to drill longer laterals with time, our capital and operating efficiencies should continue to improve given that we are in the earlier innings of the game.
Utica could be another enhancement to our capital efficiencies and returns. On Slide 14 of our presentation, there are 2 new bullets that we added to this slide. We, along with multiple other Utica operators, are members of the consortium for the Utica. We record our well and contributed the data to the consortium. The Utica well we drilled in Washington County, Pennsylvania, was calculated to have the highest gas in place of any of the analyzed consortium wells in Ohio, West Virginia or Pennsylvania. It also has the highest reservoir pressure of any horizontal Utica well drilled and some of the best permeability in the play. This combination of high gas in place, high pressure and high permeability for the Utica led the Range testing to Claysville Sportsmen's Club well at 59 million cubic feet per day, which is a record 24-hour rate for any well in the Utica or in the Marcellus. About 2 weeks prior to Range announcing this test rate, Hart published a summary of the top 10 shale wells in any play at any time. If our well had been included in the study, it would have been the #1 well. More importantly, this was -- been online at 20 million cubic feet per day on an interruptible basis for about 12 weeks and has produced about 1.2 Bcf so far. It's extremely early in its life but the performance so far is encouraging. 
As I mentioned previously, on a stack-pay basis, we have about 900,000 net acres of dry gas potential to drill and about 700,000 net acres of wet gas potential. I've seen some analysts paint all Appalachian NGLs with the same brush and value them all the same. Fortunately for Range, that's not true. There are 2 key items to consider: The first is a richness of the gas and the second is the sales contracts, the NGL they're sold under. Because we have the richest gas in the basin and what appear to be more favorable contracts than others, we receive a significant revenue uplift from our NGLs as shown on Page 18 of our presentation. Our peers might say their ethane should stay in the gas stream. And if their gas is leaner and if their contracts are not as favorable, maybe they should. 
For Range, we continue to build on our portfolio of agreements for all products, which spreads the market risk of our products across multiple pricing structures, multiple outlets and with multiple counter-parties. For 2015, the strategy is serving us well as more than 80% of our Range's ethane is tied to gas or oil-linked indices rather than Mont Belvieu. When Mariner East comes online in the third quarter, Range will be further advantaged as a producer exporting NGL products outside North America. In addition, our propane will be transported more efficiently on pipe rather than trucks and rail adding approximately $50 million to cash flow annually just on propane transport savings. 
Going forward, as we continue to grow in size and scale, we'll have the opportunity to find new markets, and I expect our teams will continue to find innovative ways to maximize cash flow. I'll now turn the call over to Roger."

Despite a colder than average winter, the first quarter of 2015 did not follow this pattern. 
Realized price for mcfe is 28% lower than last year's first quarter. However, 26% higher production and 15% lower unit cost combined to generate $423 million in first quarter revenue from natural gas, oil and NGL sales including cash-settled derivatives. This top line figure was only 10% below last year's first quarter, despite the headwind from 28% lower prices. The operating and administrative expense story for the first quarter is an exceptionally good one effectively bearing the brunt of much of the decline in prices. 
As I mentioned earlier, the winter weather of each year usually brings higher expenses as our field professionals cope with the challenges of an often brutally cold operating environment in Appalachia. This year was even colder than normal, but our operating teams really delivered. Not only did we beat all of our unit cost guidance figures, direct operating expense was lower than last year on an absolute basis as well. 
The same applies to G&A expense and interest expense during the first quarter, all below unit cost guidance and all below last year on an absolute dollar basis. Cash flow for the first quarter was $207 million and EBITDAX for the quarter came in at $244 million. Cash flow per fully diluted share was $1.24. These figures were 21%, 20% and 23%, respectively, lower than last year due to realized prices. First quarter book net income was $28 million, and earnings calculated using analyst methodology was $31 million, generating earnings of $0.19 per fully diluted share.
The non-GAAP measures that I just mentioned, including EBITDAX and analyst earnings, are fully reconciled to the GAAP numbers in various supplemental tables, which may be found on the Range website under the Investors tab. 
Looking forward to the second quarter, please reference our first quarter 2015 earnings press release for detailed expense item guidance. 
Now turning to the balance sheet, our first quarter trailing 12-month debt-to-EBITDAX ratio was 2.9x, roughly equal to last year's figure of 2.8x and below the 3x figure from the year before. Despite lower realized prices, our first quarter leverage is essentially the same as prior years. Range added additional natural gas, oil and NGL hedges during the first quarter for the remainder of 2015 as well as additional hedge volumes for 2016 and 2017. Details of these additional hedges may be found in the earnings release, the 10-Q and the Investors tab on our website. 
The first quarter of 2015 reflects the impact of lower year-over-year prices for all of our products. However, the quarter also reflects an appropriate response to this environment by the company: strong production growth, significant reductions in cost on both the unit and absolute basis, additional hedges and continually improving capital efficiency regarding some of the best well results in our history. 
Ray, over to you."

At Range, we believe there are 3 key facts that differentiate us from our peers: Number one, we have a large and high-quality position that is low risk and repeatable. Having stack-pay potential of 1.6 million acres in the core of the highest hydrocarbon in place in the Appalachian basin opens many doors for us in the market. And historically, throughout this business, the rock rules. And our results indicate we've captured some of the best rock in North America. 
Number two, our team continues to lead the way in innovation while delivering great well performance and capital efficiency. And we believe our track record over the past several years supports that. And number three, we have product diversity with large positions in both liquids rich and dry gas. Coupled with our first mover advantage, low-cost transportation and favorable sales contract, this gives Range a unique and significant competitive advantage. Execution is the key in 2015, and we're on track with our planned $870 million CapEx budget and to achieve our targeted annual growth of 20%. Maintaining our low-cost structure and continuing to improve well performance is a core focus at Range. And even though Range is already one of the lowest cost operators, our cost metrics continue to improve. As Roger pointed out, our cost structure is improving on both an absolute and unit basis. Our operating teams are continuing to find ways of increasing efficiencies, enhancing our well designs and lowering cost, while achieving better and better well performance, all allowing us to get 20% growth from a bigger base with $700 million less capital than last year. 
For the first quarter, our production averaged 1.328 Bcf equivalent per day with 33% liquids and represented 4% growth over the fourth quarter of '14 and 26% growth compared to the first quarter of '14. Our growth profile for the next 3 quarters shows production being more heavily weighted to the third and fourth quarters, just as it has been in the past. And it should set us up well with momentum going into 2016. Guidance for the second quarter is 1.345 Bcf equivalent per day with approximately 30% liquids. 
In Southwest Pennsylvania on the drilling side, Range is in an excellent position regarding the terms on our drilling rigs. We're presently on well-to-well contracts on 6 of our 9 rigs. Of the 3 rigs that aren't well to well, all contract terms will expire within the next 4 months. This has allowed us to capture significant reductions in day rate and other services along with providing us flexibility in shifting rigs and capabilities around to optimize our fleet. We believe this gives our operating team a huge competitive advantage in driving down costs, introducing new technologies and improving the overall performance of the fleet. 
On the completion side of our operations, the team pumped over a thousand stages in the first quarter averaging over 6.5 stages per day. That's 84% more stages in the quarter and 43% more stages per day than the same quarter last year with 2 crews versus 1.6 crews last year. In March, they set a new record of 424 stages for the month with a new one-day record of 23 stages. I want to offer my congratulations to the team for an outstanding job. These types of games promote high utilization rates for our service providers allowing us to work together with them to achieve some of the lowest cost and best value services in the industry. These operational gains also shorten the time between capital being spent and the realization of production revenues, translating to better use of our capital and quicker returns at the bottom line. It simply allows us to do more, do it quicker and do it for less cost and will allow us to grow more efficiently in 2016 as these improvements continue. 
Late in the first quarter, we brought online a new Southwest Pennsylvania dry area pad with the first well going to sales at 31.3 million a day with a lateral length of 7,906 feet with 41 stages. We've been flowing this well now for 20 days at an average rate of 21.4 million a day. And there's still 2 more wells on the pad to be brought online in the second quarter. 
And just last week, we brought online a new well in our wet area with an 8,668 foot lateral completed with 45 stages. And it produced the sales for 24 hours at 43.4 million cubic feet equivalent per day. That's 19 million gas, 520 barrels of condensate and over 3,500 barrels of NGL. We believe this well has now set the record for the highest 24-hour production rate through sales in the entire Marcellus play. 
As a quick reminder, I want to make 3 important points. Number one, the production rates that we report, whether they're initial sales, 30-day averages or production reported over any length of time have been and will always be reported at actual conditions as constrained by the production facilities and the gathering system. Number two, the wells on the pad tend to come online at staggered times, very rarely are we able to bring more than 1 or 2 wells to sales off the same pad at the same time as we simply don't design a system to handle those high and short-term initial rates. What we've demonstrated over the years is this is the most cost-effective way to manage the compression and gathering system for the long term. 
And number three, while these are outstanding and record-setting initial sales rates, they are not appreciably different from what our team forecasted that these wells would produce. In other words, wells like these were built into our model and production forecast, and I believe our team is one of the best out there in understanding the rock and getting the most out of it. The initial sales rates only tell part of the story. What's really important is how these wells perform over time. 
Just about a year ago, we announced a record 5-well pad in our super-rich area that came online with a per well average of 28.6 million cubic feet equivalent per day or 4,773 Boe per day with 65% liquids. And they had an average lateral length of 6,635 feet and 34 stages. The record well in that pad that we announced a year ago and still the record liquids-rich well in the basin, meaning wells that have more than 60% liquids was $38.1 million a day from a 7,065 foot lateral with 36 stages. 
As of the end of March this year, that pad has produced 10.6 Bcf equivalent, which is 5.7 Bcf of gas, 223,000 barrels of condensate and 831,400 barrels of NGL. I believe if you look at that pad on an absolute or normalized basis, it's among the top performers in the region. Also, about 6 months ago, in the Southwest Pennsylvania dry area, we announced a pad with 3 wells that had an average -- 30-day average rate of $17.4 million a day per well, averaging 5,364 foot laterals in 28 stages. As of the end of March, those 3 wells have produced over 6.1 Bcf with the largest well at 2.6 Bcf. Again, in the dry gas area, we believe these wells are clearly among the top performers in Southwest Pennsylvania. 
In addition to the quality of the rock, we believe these examples of long-term performance also illustrate the diversity and highlight our ability to manage long-term sustainable growth at very attractive economics whether it's dry or liquids-rich gas. 
As Jeff referred to in his remarks, our first Utica well in Washington County, Pennsylvania, has now been online since late January, constrained at a designed maximum rate of $20 million a day and has produced 1.2 Bcf of gas thus far. Albeit early, the well is meeting all our original expectations. It's producing on an interruptible basis, meaning it's up and down and not at a constant rate. And before anyone asks, it's still too early to make an EUR prediction. 
The second well, which is an opposing lateral on the same pad, is being drilled and is still on target to be ready for sale this summer, which is about the same time that our permanent facilities will be ready. And the third well is still on schedule to be drilled later this year. Costs for the second well are still targeted to be approximately $13 million gross, which still includes some science [ph]. And as we get a few more wells under our belt, we believe those costs could come down another 15% to 25%. We expect that the Utica will be different from the early years of our Marcellus play and that it can be drilled on a true development mode right from the beginning. Most all our Utica wells are expected to be drilled on Marcellus pads making use of the existing infrastructure. 
Step-out wells won't be necessary, since we have deeper penetrations, lots of offset wells and 3D seismic over most of the area. Essentially, we can drill the wells like a very efficient manufacturing process. The Utica infrastructure will be easy, as it's dry gas. And we have existing right-of-ways in which we can lay additional pipes. Considering that early results indicate we have 400,000 net acres of core dry gas Utica potential under our Marcellus position in Southwest Pennsylvania, we believe this play gives us another attractive option for significant growth in value creation going forward. Our team is working on options to begin a Utica drilling program as early as next year if the market conditions support. 
Shifting to Northeast Pennsylvania, our team continues to lower cost and bring online really impressive wells. And we expect to continue the year with 1 to 2 drilling rigs. Of note, our most significant well in the quarter had an initial rate to sales of 26.1 million a day with a 30-day average rate of 21 million a day and a 60-day rate of 19 million a day. The well is completed with a 5,514 foot lateral and 28 stages for a total well cost of approximately $5 million. And we expect an EUR of over 3.3 Bcf per thousand foot of lateral. Following up on our top well in the same area that we announced about a year ago, the initial 30-day rate to sales on that well was 25.1 million a day, and it produced over 4 Bcf in 12 months. Again, in this area, we're also seeing significant operational gains, along with up to 25% lower cost. Like the super rich, wet, dry, Upper Devonian and Utica in Southwest Pennsylvania, this area offers yet another highly attractive area for long-term and sustainable growth. 
Like Jeff said in his remarks, 2015 is a challenging year for commodity prices, but I'm happy to report that Range is continuing to work safely, improve our operational efficiency, lower our cost structure, and at the same time, continue to improve our well performance. 
I also want to note that we have relayed to all of our employees that a tightened budget does not mean cutting corners. In fact, despite current market conditions, we've increased our focus on environmental compliance and safety. Safeguarding the environment and our employees, along with our contractors and the communities where we live and work, is a core philosophy at Range. When you think about the fact that we had our best operating efficiency gains today, combined with some of the best well results to date, this quarter again demonstrates our ability to grow value at the bottom line more and more efficiently. As I've often said, the rock rules. And we believe we've captured a large position with stack-pay potential and the best rock in the basin. Coupled with an experienced team, we've been able to achieve these results and have a consistent track record of growth with lower and lower cost. And we believe we're still in the early innings of the ballgame as we continue to drill longer laterals, implement improved completion designs and improve operational efficiencies. We still haven't drilled our best well yet. Now back to Jeff."

As evident by the fact that all 29 banks unanimously approved the change. And on our part, a 51% vote, no bank chose to be carried. They all stepped up, doing the right thing. And we're very pleased and proud of them for doing that. So the reason is that the covenant really no longer fits. We redid our bank facility in the fourth quarter of last year. And in that process, we went to an annual Borrowing Base determination. A lot of folks really didn't pick up on that. But it was pretty big changes, saved us a lot of money. It helps us manage our affairs better over the long term. But when the banks do the Borrowing Base determination, they basically take all your cash flow until your next review date and toss it out. So in our case, when you went to a full 1 year redetermination, they took essentially over a year of our cash flow out through April of the next year, which encompasses a lot of our hedges and everything. So you can see, with the $3 billion-plus Borrowing Base that they approved, we're real pleased that, that ratified our liquidity and our position. The Borrowing Base is -- because that's their primary tool to manage leverage. And the reason is pretty simple, it's a forward-looking test. It's basically a PV-9 coverage test. So the best way to work your growth is to be looking out the windshield and working the brake and throttle accordingly. And that's why the banks rely on that test first and foremost. The debt-to-EBITDAX covenant, that's a rearview mirror test. So it's really not as applicable to managing leverage over time. So in our case, the covenant was kind of a no-harm-no-foul covenant. We're never anywhere close to that ratio, never intended to be anywhere close to that ratio. But looking at it after getting through the restructuring process, we just decided that an interest coverage test was more appropriate. We rely on the annual Borrowing Base determination to work with our banks to keep leverage where it needs to be. And that rearview mirror test just didn't make sense for us anymore. And the banks agreed with us, and we made the swap. And it just removes a source of potential concern from investors that may not have an in-depth knowledge of the process."

So we do expect to continue to significantly increase lateral lengths by year going forward. And I think eventually, you'll see our average up there in the 8,000 to 9,000-foot range. And of course, every area will have a different optimal at-lateral length depending on liquids and as [ph] well pressures and all the different things. Because remember, we have a huge position there in Southwest Pennsylvania. So the Marcellus is not the Marcellus  -- it's not the same all across that property. We have super rich, wet, dry.

And then later in 2016 and 2017, we have other firm transport capacity projects coming online, which again will take our gas away from the Appalachian basin to more stable of indexes and help improve our cash flow."

I'll switch it over to Ray to talk more about where the capital is going later in the year. Just one thing I wanted to highlight, there was a big working capital swing in the first quarter. So over $100 million of the incremental debt and spending was due to working capital. So there's a delta between the cost and current schedule and the cash flow. So please go through the queue or give our guys a call. They can walk you through that.

And I talked a lot about that on the first call that if you looked at a well in Southwest Pennsylvania, the lion's share of our CapEx is gone. And if you looked at a well in February compared to December, on apples-to-apples basis, we're seeing 23% to 25% less total well cost as a result of service cost reductions. Those numbers were built into our plan this year, but it's also important to realize that all those savings didn't kick in on January 1. They really kick in towards the end of the first quarter, and then they start flowing through the rest of the year. So I think you'll see the CapEx will come down quarter-over-quarter because we tend to -- we have more rigs running at the first part of the year than we will at the last part of the year. And that's pretty, pretty much the same that it's been every year. So I don't see that as a whole lot different, but hopefully, that's a little more color on how that comes together."

Does that maybe argue for going back to existing wells and doing optimized completions or refrac on those existing wells, just given that they'd be even lower cost and probably generate with 50% uplift of production versus what you've done before, maybe even a better rate of return than drilling original wells?"

And that was an exact case that you just described where we went into a well, a pad that had 5 wells on it that were 2 years old, had been online for 2 years and we put 2 new wells sort of in between the laterals. And there were really 3 things we wanted to test. We wanted to test how much less would the wells cost, drilling them on since all the existing infrastructure roads, pads, water, gathering system and all that sort of thing was already there. Number two, did the new wells interfere with the older wells? And then number three, how much better would the new wells be with the new completion -- newer completion technology. And number one, the wells were $850,000 a piece cheaper. And we think that number could even be higher as we begin to do more of this as we go forward. Number two, there was no impact to the older wells, which I think is very significant. And I think you've read a lot about our competitors that are in noncore areas. They have not been able to do that, where they've seen big hits on their offsetting wells. And then third thing, the wells produced 53% more production than the first year as compared to the older wells that had -- I think early on, the eyepiece were 4x higher. So clearly, we see that as unbelievable upside going forward, because we clearly have a lot of those pads already out there, some of them as much as 8 or 9, 10 years old on those. So I think that going forward, you're going to see us probably in about 2017, '18 as we get into our further plans down the road where a bigger and bigger percentage of our wells each year will be going back on to those existing pads. We see that as a huge step change in both well cost, efficiencies and well performance and then in -- also in gathering system cost. Because your gathering system's already there, already been mostly paid for. So essentially, those wells will produce at a much lower gathering fee. So we see that as big potential going forward. There's not really any of those wells planned at this year as we're still trying to really optimize our program to try to get the wells, the final HBP work done that we need to get done, the infrastructure buildouts that we're still doing over this year and next year.

And one thing I want to correct you on, those aren't just monster wells, they're monster pads. Because they both are multi-well pads, and we just simply hadn't been able to turn the other wells on yet. But we expect actually pretty similar results from other wells on the pad. Part of our long-term goal that the team works on, sometimes 3, 5 and 7 years in advance, is looking at the gathering system. And we have very intricate models of the gathering system. We're working with MarkWest on deliverability at any given point, compressor stations, upgrades, process and plant and so forth. So all of this has been built into that plan. And we don't have a choke management program as a gimmick or a fad or anything like that to manage the wells. We're simply trying to produce those wells of what we believe is the optimum performance that will generate the best economics for the project at the end of the day. It's a long-term look that we take at it. Initial production rates are great. They're fun to talk about. It's kind of a yardstick to compare wells. And these -- in a case like these 2 monster pads, you had a lot of facilities there for maybe 3 wells or 5 wells, depending on how many wells were on each pad. And what you end up doing is bring one well on and just let it produce through the facilities that all 5 wells might use to see what it's capable of. In actuality, we'll probably choke that well back and then start opening up the other wells and try to get them online. They'll all be produced or constrained conditions for quite a while in that case. But that's the way we designed it going forward. And we think that keeps our cost structure down. It's better planning with MarkWest, which allows them to keep their cost structure down, which in turn gets us lower gathering fees. And again, we're really focused on the years ahead and watching that gathering fee fall off as we go back in and fill in on these areas. We think that's the most efficient way to develop this project long term. Because again, we've only touched a very small portion of the total number of locations that we can drill going forward just in the Marcellus. On the Utica and places like that, the other stack-pay potential, we've got a long ways to go on that also. As for as the Utica well, when we get the permanent facilities online in the middle of the summer, those wells will be put online, and they will be uninterruptible. In other words, we'll be able to hold them at a constant rate. And these production facilities are designed to limit those wells at 20 million a day. And again, that's not necessarily for any sort of choke management or anything that we're worried about on that end of it as much as it is trying to optimize the cost for those facilities in that gathering system that we're putting in play."

And we request that 75 years plus of infrastructure was built right through this area. And we were able to tap into all of that. We were first movers in the play. And working with MarkWest, we've been able to put a huge system of interleaks and placed there for the wet gas. I think what a lot of people forget is there's clearly also a lot of dry gas lines in that system as there's a lot of residue gas that comes off the plant, a lot of meter taps into the different pipelines, Tennessee and Columbia and Line N [ph] and so forth. So we have all of that together growing over time. And then the third piece, the third cornerstone of it is the market and having actual customers on the other end to use the product.

Appalachian natural gas differentials have widened as the base in a week's take of expansions in a more balanced regional supply and demand fixture. In addition, from NGL netbacks have been weakened Appalachian particularly propane as regional supplies outstrip summer demand. In the face of these current pricing issues, we remain focused on things that will improve our netbacks in the near term and things that will make Range successful in the long run. We're focused on executing our plan and driving down costs in the field and at the corporate level, while operating safely. The good news is that we put some arrangements in place years ago that will come to fruition later this year, which should make some of this pricing pain short lived for Range. For the second half of 2015, there are 2 projects that will benefit Range specifically. The first Is Specter's Uniontown to Gas City project. Range is an anchor shipper on this project and has approximately 200 million per day of capacity. The first leg of the project is anticipated to commence on August 1st, and the second and final leg is projected to start up on September 1st. This will move about 200 million per day growth or about 170 million pretty net of our production from the local Appalachian and 2 markets, the premium Midwest markets. Under current strip pricing, this should increase our realized price by approximately $1 on this production. For the next 12 months, we've locked in a significant portion of the price uplift by hedging the basins. The uplift from this project is expected to have a significant impact on our Southwest Marcellus realized pricing for future periods. The 170 million per day net capacity would equate to 28% of our average Southwest Marcellus gas production in the second quarter. 
The second project, which we expect to be very impactful for us Mariner East I. Range has 40,000 barrels per day of capacity on Mariner East I and is the anchor shipper on this project as well. The capacity is for 20,000 barrels of ethane and 20,000 barrels per day of propane. We'll also have access to 80% of 1 million barrel of propane storage market. [indiscernible] is projecting Mariner East 1 want to start up in late September with commissioning completed a few weeks thereafter. Mariner East 1 will locked in our Appalachian propane transport cost and result in significant transportation savings. That will also enable us to choose between Northeast markets and international markets depending on demand and pricing. When Mariner East 1 is fully up and running, this project, in combination with Mariner West and 8X, is anticipated to result in about a $90 million increase to our net cash flow on an annualized basis without counting the potential propane price uplift opportunities. 
The marketing team has not only put in place good projects for the second half of 2015, but also looking forward into 2016 and '17, there are other projects that should benefit Range. Range is an anchor shipper and has 150 million per day growth of capacity on Specter's gulf market expansion project. Start-up is targeted for the fourth quarter of 2016 and this will move 128 million per day net of Range's gas to the Gulf Coast. ROVER Phase I is also planned to start-up in the fourth quarter of 2016. 
In addition, at the end of 2017, Range's participated in several pipeline expansion projects that will allow Range to move an additional 900 million per day of Range's gas to the Gulf Coast, Midwest and Canadian markets. On a macro basis, good things are happening inside the Appalachian Basin. The overall rig count for the Marcellus is down 55% from its peak. Total Marcellus production has been flat to declining since the beginning of the year based on pipelines flows. The Utica rig count has dropped 66% from its peak. In addition, the drop in rigs, the remaining rigs are moving out of the wet gas and liquids-rich portion of the Utica, which should help rebalance the oversupply of liquids in the basin. Given the steep decline so most of these Utica liquids wells, the rebalance should happen sooner rather than later. With that drop in rig count by 2/3, coupled with the lack of hedges for '16 and beyond by most companies, and with lower strip pricing for '16, the Utica rig count will probably stay low for a while, which will help on the supply side. 
Good things are also happening outside of the Appalachian Basin. Looking across the U.S., the old rig count is down about 60%. There's a lot of associated natural gas with oil and the associated gas now accounts for a significant portion of total U.S. gas production. For flow data, it appears that gas from some of the key oil basins may have peaked in April. Since the associated gas is very rich, about 40% of oil NGLs come from this source. Therefore, the NGLs from this source should follow the trend in associated gas. 
On the demand side, LNG gas exports from the U.S. are still on target to begin in the fourth quarter of this year and ramp with time. Natural gas continues to take market share from coal and I believe that this trend will continue given that natural gas is much friendlier fuel from an environmental perspective in coal. In addition, natural gas exports to Mexico, industrial demand for gas and natural gas for transportation directly at CNG or indirectly as electricity, are projected to grow with time. We believe these supply and demand side forces are working together to rebalance market sooner than was pretty priced into the strip. Consequently, we believe that as supply and demand equalize, the natural gas will move up. Equally important as the infrastructure within the Appalachian Basin builds out, the basis should narrow with time. In combination, this should result in better netbacks for Range. 
In a commodity business, it's important to be a low-cost and have scale. On Slide 4 of our IR presentation, we've included a new slide from Wood Mackenzie. According to their work on the Marcellus, Range not only has the largest resource base, we have the lowest breakeven costs. In addition, we have the upside of potentially 400,000 net acres of dry Utica gas beneath our Marcellus acreage. Coupling this resource base with our capital discipline and diversified portfolio marketing arrangements, which gives us multiple options of our competitors do not have, Range's position to great value as we move forward into unexpected better market that balances supply, demand and infrastructure. I'll now turn the call over to Roger."

The second quarter traditionally brings the mildest weather of the year, which tends to amplify the pricing impact of a supply surplus. This year's mild second quarter occurred against the unusual backdrop of seasonal market surpluses for all of our energy commodities, oil, natural gas and NGLs. Fortunately, as Jeff discussed, better days are ahead and in the meantime, our results are supported by significant cost reductions and a strong hedge position. 
Quarterly financial performance since 2008 has been a tug-of-war between low-cost production growth and realized price, with the help of consistent and significant unit cost reductions during this time frame, more often than not at Range, growth at low-cost has won the contest. Production growth of 24% and 11% lower unit cost in the second quarter, however, were no match for a 38% year-over-year reduction in realized price. Despite significantly higher production, revenue from natural gas, oil and NGL sales, including cash flow derivatives, was $383 million, 15% below last year. Second quarter cash flow was $161 million, and EBITDAX for the quarter came in at $203 million. Cash flow per fully diluted share was $0.97. Year-to-date second quarter cash flow totaled $367 million, while year-to-date EBITDAX was $446 million. GAAP net income for the second quarter was a loss of $119 million, non-GAAP earnings, calculated using popular analyst methodology, was $2.3 million or $0.01 per fully diluted share. 
The second quarter was another good one on the expense-reduction side, with direct operating production, taxes, expiration, G&A and interest expense totals all coming in below last year on both a unit cost basis and absolute dollar basis. The only expense item that slightly exceed quarterly guidance was interest expense as the second quarter included 1 month of negative interest carry from our issuance of $750 million and 4 7/8% 10-year senior notes. We issued these notes in favorable market conditions several months ago well before next month's redemption of our callable 6 3/4 nets [ph]. Second quarter cash unit costs were reduced by $0.25 per Mcfe and total unit costs were reduced by $0.36 per Mcfe from last year. At current realized prices, these are very meaningful reductions. We believe additional unit cost reductions are possible as we become even more efficient with both our operating and capital expenditures. Third quarter specific line item expense guidance may be found in our second quarter earnings press release. The big news over on the balance sheet was a $750 million issuance of 10-year senior notes. At May issuance, the 4 7/8% notes represent of the lowest yield of any noninvestment grade energy and power sector issuer of any maturity in 2015. Many thanks to the institutions on this call who helped make this possible to the transaction demonstrates a creditworthiness of our company and the quality of our long-life, low-cost, high-return assets. 
Lower prices and the front-end loaded nature of our capital budget in 2015 pushed our leverage a bit higher in the second quarter with second quarter trailing 12-month net EBITDAX ratio coming in at 3.3x. I should mention that this leverage ratio is charted territory for Range, as we have been over 3x on several occasions over the years. Even though we no longer had a debt to EBITDAX loan covenant and our next annual borrowing base determination isn't until May of next year, our stand on leverage has not changed. When leverage exceeds 3x, we will begin working on ways to bring it down. It would be premature to discuss the specific things we are working on right now, but as Range has sold over $3 billion in assets over the past 10 years, this is the first option we consider to reduce leverage. Range added new hedges for 2015 and '16 across all commodities during the second quarter. The details of which may be found in the earnings press release and the Range website. 
As Jeff mentioned, the second quarter was a challenging one. However, Range's structure operationally and financially to handle this kind of adversity. Our low-cost structure, high-return projects, long life assets, strong balance sheet, plentiful liquidity and consistent performances history provide welcome stability and the means to navigate through these tough times. Until times are better, we will continue to drive down costs, high-grade our portfolio and prudently allocate capital. Ray, over to you."

During times like these, it's critical to have a great team, quality asset, size and scale, a strong balance sheet and a low-cost structure. Range has all of that, but we also have the unique ability to drill on high-quality core areas of dry, we or super-rich with the operational flexibility to reallocate capital when needed and maintain capital discipline. During the first half of this year, we've clearly exercised those abilities and change the way of the land, and I'll walk you through some of those changes now. 
Of course, the first step happened at the beginning of the year when we adjusted our 2015 plan by cutting CapEx by 45% or $700 million less as compared to last year, while still delivering 20% production growth, and we're still on track to execute that plan. Another step we took was to allocate more of our capital to dry gas drilling in Southwest PA due to the challenges we saw coming in the NGL market. The dry gas economics were substantially better. In Southwest PA, our normal year-end inventory of wells ready for completion would normally be in the Range of 20 to 30 wells. Our current forecast is that we should have between 50 and 60 wells in inventory and about half of those wells are expected to be in the dry gas area. Of course, it's very preliminary and those numbers will likely change, but those wells can be brought online in 2016 with less capital since we're only looking at the completion cost rather than the total well cost. In addition, we've increased the number of wells being turned to sales in 2015 as we now expect an additional 16 Marcellus wells to be turned in line at the very end of '15 rather than early next year, all of this allowing us to start 2016 with good momentum into the historically better winter pricing environment. With our new contracts and low-cost transportation, we will be positioned well to start off next year, while maintaining the capital discipline. Our capital spending was front-end loaded this year with the spending approximately 2/3 of our capital budget during the first 2 quarters. In January, we had 15 rigs running. Currently, we have 10 rigs running, and we expect to average 7 rigs in the third quarter going down to 6 in the fourth quarter. We'll also be tapering off frac crews in the second half of this year. So as you can see, our CapEx spend will be substantially less during the second half of the year and I want to reiterate that we remain committed to meet our planned $870 million budget. We beat production guidance for the second quarter and came in at 1.373 Bcf equivalent per day, largely driven by better-than-expected performance in the dry gas area of Southwest Pennsylvania. For the third quarter, we're setting guidance at the 1.39 to 1.4 Bcf equivalent per day with approximately 28% liquids and are still on track to deliver 20% production growth for the year. The Mariner East 1 project has been delayed from the original expectation of the July start-up, and we forecast that the project coming online late in the quarter with full operations during the fourth quarter. 
Like Roger pointed out in his remarks, our costs are consistently improving on both an absolute and unit basis. Corporate LOE per Mcfe is down 20% for the quarter as compared to last year and G&A per Mcfe is down 21%. We've demonstrated discipline and a continued focus on costs. Reacting to the current environment, we had to make some tough decisions in closing our Oklahoma City division office and making substantial personnel cuts in our legacy fields in Pennsylvania. Those decisions resulted in layoffs of approximately 11% of our workforce. Those decisions were not made lightly, but in this environment, tough decisions like these become necessary. 
We've updated Marcellus economics on Page 16 in our presentation to reflect the current pricing and differentials. We left the well cost and type curves unchanged in order to get an apples-to-apples comparison. As you can see, our economics are so good and all cases by the dry area economics have improved supporting our decision to direct more of our capital towards dry gas and Southwest PA. The improved economics in the dry area are driven primarily by the improvement in basis differentials, coupled with our transportation contracts going forward. In the Marcellus, we'll continue to upgrade our completion designs by optimizing profit loading, sizes and concentrations, along with reduced state spacing across our very large and diverse acreage position in Southwest PA. For example, state sizes today range from GBP 200,000 of profit per stage up to GBP 500,000 per stage depending on the area and the particular reservoir characteristics in that area. Well performance this year is on target and I'll point out a couple of examples of recent performance. In the wet area, we brought online a 5 wellpad averaging 28.2 million cubic feet equivalent per day per well and this will rate to sales with a 7-day average rate to sales of 20.8 million a day per well under constrained conditions. Those wells average to 5,204-foot laterals with 27 stages per well. In the dry area of Southwest Pennsylvania, we had a 2 wellpad come online with an average initial rates to sales of 34.2 million a day per well under constrained conditions. The average 90-day rate is 20 million a day per well. Those wells average 9,074-foot laterals with 45 stages and assumed over 1.8 Bcf each well in 90 days. 
Expanding on that area where these 2 wells are located, we have a total of 6 offset wells with up to a year of production history. The average June production at 90 days to sales under facility and gathering system constraints was 1.5 Bcf per each well. These were shorter laterals averaging 5,064 feet with 26 stages. Our EUR in this area is currently 3 Bcf per 1,000 foot with some of the older wells over 3.2 Bcf per 1,000 foot. Putting this area on par with some of the best production in the basin. We believe our dry gas area in Southwest PA will be very prolific and is clearly exceeding our expectations thus far this year. In Southwest Pennsylvania, we completed 52% more stages in the first half of this year's compared to last year. Our stage count per day improved by 20% for the first quarter and by 30% for the first half of the year. Highlighting the second quarter, we averaged 6.3 stages a day per frac group, which we believe is the best of the basin. As we front-end loaded a lot of activity this year, our total stages and stage counts per day are expected to be less during the last half of this year. 
On the drilling side, during the second quarter, we saw a 13% decrease in days, while drilling 21% longer laterals as compared to last year. To put that in perspective, based on recent data, we would estimate drilling an 8,500-foot lateral well in less [ph] than 18 days. These efficiencies have been critical in helping us delivered 20% growth this year with 45% less, and were far from done as these improvements will keep on coming. Other than having a great operating team, a critical factor in achieving these operational and well performance gains, gains is being in the core of the play. As I've often said, the rock rules. We list the normalized EUR and cost results of our Marcellus areas in a table in our earnings release. Achieving results comparable to these are very difficult when you're not in the core. When you combine these results with our lower transportation costs and all the great work our team has done in securing better markets, it drives what we believe to be one of the best capital efficiencies in the industry. Operational gains, coupled with further service cost reductions, have helped to reduce our overall well cost significantly. When comparing the first half of 2015 with the second half of 2014, we're seeing total well cost reductions on an apples-to-apples basis of up to 25% or more, and we're continuing to see cost come down on things like steel, along with other goods and prices and services. 
Like I said on the last call, Range did not have any long-term drilling or service contracts and therefore, our operating teams had and still have, a tremendous competitive advantage in optimizing our service-provider relationships. Coupled with our operating practices, we can achieve attractive pricing while our service providers maintain high utilization rates and within reasonable margins. Over the long term, we expect that this will differentiate Range versus our peers as we believe that our well-planned, discipline and growing operations, have allowed us to attract some of the most favorable service pricing in the basin. Our Washington County PA Utica well is still producing into our system on an interruptible and constrained basis. And it's still too early to make any reasonable estimates of ultimate performance. We're finishing up the completion on our second well and expect that both wells will be online in the permanent new, dry gas infrastructure over the next couple of months. You can see some of these have second well in our earnings release. I expect that we'll be able to give more information on well performance after both wells have been online consistently for a few months. And we still expect to spud our third well before year-end and it will be completed in 2016. 
Our Forth Worth operations team, which now also runs our Midcontinent Division in addition to our northern Marcellus division, is doing a great job focusing on cost, while delivering great well results. In Northeast PA, we just drilled and set pipe on the well for $284 per laterals foot as compared to $394 per foot estimated for 2015. That's a 28% reduction in cost from what we originally planned. Since that team has taken over the midcontinent assets in a very short time, and we've just a few wells under their belts, they reduced the total completed well cost in the play by over 31% to approximately $2.2 million per well with the last few wells, and the initial production from those wells is consistent with our expectations. 
Our Southern Appalachian team is also doing great and while they have a very limited capital budget this year, they're continuing to bring online some of the best coal bed methane wells we've seen in 25 years. Utilizing the new high rates frac technique, the recent CBM wells are 60% better than their average offsets with significantly better economics. Although Range's operational tempo has been high, employee safety remains a top priority. Employee and management commitment to safety has resulted in Range having no recordable injuries thus far in 2015 and 0 hours of lost time in the last 18 months. We are really proud of all of our operating teams for working safely and being good stewards in the communities where we live and work. Like I said in the beginning, times are indeed tough and every penny really counts. Maintaining capital discipline and a low cost structure are extremely important. I'm proud to say that we believe we have a deeper, more diverse and better inventory than anyone in the basin, with minimal of type curve risk at one of the lowest-cost structures with one of the best capital efficiencies, great capital discipline and one of the best teams in the industry. Now back to Jeff."

Typically, we work that really hard, presented to our board in December, and then after their approval, announced in January. But let me give you a lot of thoughts around it but hopefully we'll put some sideboards around that and give you a lot of color. I'd like to start by talking about this year, 2015. In this year, we're getting a 20% growth with $870 million of CapEx, and we feel good about those numbers, and that's where we'll end up. And if you look at that I think versus any of our peers, I think we're ahead of the class. Our dollars go further than almost any operator where if I believe, one of the most if not the most, capital-efficient company out there. 
So we'll start with '15. If you look into '16, I think our pricing gets better. The netbacks will get better. One, we'll have a full year Mariner East in 2016 and we're -- again, we have the lion's share of Mariner East. We're the only producer that has capacity on it. We have 40,000 barrels per day on it. So our netback pricing for NGL should get significantly better for ethane, for propane, et cetera. Also, we'll have a full year at Uniontown to Gas City, which is a big uplift and one that's really significant portion of our production in the Southwest. It's initially $1 uplift and that $0.75 to $1 range hedge not a lot of that in. So should get sequentially better in '16. And, as I mentioned, on my call notes, those other projects in '16 like Specter's, Gulf Marekt expansion and the ROVER Phase I. And as each of those projects occurs in supply and demand inside the basin equal out a little bit, basin should contract. So I think we're one of the most capital-efficient companies in terms of growth, plus given our unique portfolio of marketing contracts, I think our netbacks improve next year. But I think a really important slide that I'd like to refer everyone to is Slide 8 on our website. And it's a slide that shows what our production growth has been with time plotted against the dollars, the capital, for incremental Mcfe of production. And if you look at that you can see consistently really for the last 5 years, our capital efficiencies gotten better. If you hone in just on 2015 versus '14, and you look at the blue line on the graph, we're getting 20% growth, but the blue line, our capital -- our costs are down literally 50%, [indiscernible] dollars per increment of capital of 50% less in '15 than they were in '14. Through a combination better completion, better targeting or service cost and I really applaud Ray and the entire operations team. If you would ask me at any point in time, this time last year where would we have been? I wouldn't have predicted we would have been able to reduce that by 50%, but it speaks to the quantity of the team in the rock and our position. So when you -- 20% growth in '15 for $870 million CapEx is, I think, outstanding, next year we get better pricing, but I don't think our efficiency is going to 0 in 2016. I think -- I'm not saying we're going to [indiscernible] 50% off, but I think that you'll see significant improvement and capital efficiency when you look at '16 versus '15 if we're sitting in at this time next year. So I think that's really important. And that efficiency will come from again our laterals this year average about 6,000 feet with x stages that's in our work. You'll see us, I think, continued to migrate towards longer laterals with more stages and all those types of things plus we'll have a full year worth of service contract, benefit that we didn't have this year's. So I think all that speaks to better performance in '16 than in '15. I think there's a couple of other ways to look at it as well. Ray mentioned we're going to be carrying in almost double the number of wells in the '16 that we normally would in a typical year. So almost 50 to 60 what's instead of 20 to 30. So the drilling costs are in this year -- the completion just the completion cost during next year so it's going to be really capital-efficient growth with that. And I think if you look at it versus our competitors, if you look at our fourth quarter '15 exit rate versus fourth quarter '14, we should be growing roughly 15%, fourth quarter '15 over '14. So we've had that continual ramp-up in growth. We're going to be entering '16 with good growth versus a lot of our peers. We'll be flat over that same time frame and reflects some of them will be down. So I thank all those things are important and again, hopefully get you some things to think about in terms of high you might model '16. What I want to be premature again, what I predicted we would have at 50% off of our capital efficiency and grown 20% for 870. I wouldn't have, but I predict Ryan and the team will also step up again the time for '16, and you'll see a good improvement in those numbers. But I can also tell you we'll look hard as we go throughout the year, with oil and gas prices are in '16, we'll look very hard at the returns we just recently updated, the economics and returns of all of our areas where we're spending money in the book and we'll continue to do that. We will be very prudent with our balance sheet and we'll be sensitive to that. And given that, I think, we're in good shape for '16, kind of a long answer but an important question."

Let me take a swing at it. I'll answer some of that, how we've answered this question before.

I'll answer some of that, how we've answered this question before. When you take our anticipated 1015 production times our F&D costs, and you can pick any F&D, it's in the Appendix of the book on any of our key players. You end up with maintenance capital of replays our reserves of around $200 million to $220 million. So I think that's 1 book end for you to think about. The other book end, of course, is what Jeff just mentioned that in 2015, we've gotten 20% growth at 8 70, with anticipated additional efficiencies going into 2016 for a lot of the reasons that were just mentioned. So I think you can look at those as to 2 book ends and another thing I would add is just that something a lot of folks forget about is it we really have, if not the highest R.P. ratios, one of the highest RV ratios out there, particularly of a shale producer and especially, if you just look at the proved developed producing reserves in that ratio. So we have a much shallower decline, which means it's a lot easier to replace production. So I know I'm not getting to the exact number, but like Jeff said, we don't have any -- a micrometer for 2016 right now. But I think Oakley that'll have you with book and the answer."

It's interesting over that time frame for the most part prior to the last year people have challenged us why don't we grow faster, and we always stuck to our guns and what we thought was reasonable and prudent plan. if you looked at this year, it's very interesting. Again, we want to be reasonable and prudent where prices were, we cut $700 million out and at that point, where we're not even targeting growth. We were just saying how capital efficiency could we beat and 20% fell out of that and it happened to be kind of in line with 20% to 25%. But there's really nothing magical. That's just the quality of the team and the rock. And again, if you would ask me to run the team on Page 8 not 50% off of our capital efficiency from '15 versus '14. I wouldn't have said that last year. They did went above and beyond, which, again, speaks to the quality of the rock and the team. We'll approach '16 and '17 and beyond in that same fashion."

But like Jeff and Roger has pointed out really, I think at this point it's just too early to know how we're going to allocate those rigs to potentially Utica wells in '16 or not.

Customers are coming online, we'll have to look at all of those in to see how that rolls out when we present our budget to the board in December.

I guess, just thinking about that and the high rates of the wells and the added midstream infrastructure or the takeaway from the pads, what -- how does that sort of color your view, or is it assume it's a low capital items that may kick in overtime?

We're getting some phenomenal right, now some of the strongest returns we have were in the dry Marcellus, but the take away for the dry Marcellus could be used at some point for dry Utica. And it's all that stuff of kind of stacks back together, the wells were drilling are off of existing Marcellus had with Marcellus roads, the same team we've already paid for the acreage. It's already held by the Marcellus. So it's kind of an option.

The service cost have clearly come down a lot this year. And like I said in my prepared remarks at the beginning of the call, on an apples-to-apples basis, when you look at what we've seen the first half of this year compared to the second half of last year and you just pick Southwest PA, for instance, some areas are more, some are less, but just pick Southwest PA, we're 25% or more less total well cost. And that's a range of all sorts of things, less cost for the drilling rigs, service -- frac cost coming down, directional drillers, all that sort of thing. And we are still seeing some of those prices come down because like Jeff said, in is remarks at the beginning, the rig counts are down in the Utica by 66%, they're down in Marcellus by over 50% I think close to 55% now. The other basins are seeing the same kind of things. So there's a lot of competition out there. The service providers are having to really pick the people they want to work for and really having to hammer down all their suppliers so you're seeing this continual bump down of lower cost going all the way down into things like steel and province and bargain for, All those sort of chemicals and everything else are getting cheaper. So I think it would be pretty aggressive, probably too aggressive do think that we're going to see as much of a decrease as we've seen so far. But I do think we'll see more as all of this tries to settle out that some level of cost and activity. I think because of other kind of well-planned and disciplined approach and the way we try to really focus on utilization of the frac cruise, and so forth that gives us the lead up, and the fact that we didn't have any long-term contracts, was a big advantage of the team. I think it still a big advantage of the team. We're much more believe are philosophically and long-term relationships rather than long-term contracts because we really try to make it a win-win relationship with our service providers, and when you -- I think we're leaving put in the that allowed us as a company touch on some of the best pricing and some of the knowest well cost and all that translates into the best capital efficiency I think in the basin. So that's our philosophy going forward. I think the other thing you'll see going into '16 is will have a full year of these price reductions, which will really help our capital efficiency. So I don't know -- will probably still see the greases urinary, but the fact that we'll be able to apply what we've seen thus far to the full year is really was going to help us next year plus the fact that we have a bigger inventory, we got better contracts, we've got Mariner East up and running probably got specter, who city we've got ROVER and Gulf expansion, non-late next year, although things that we've been talking about on the call are we going to help set '16 a very, very well."

Appalachian natural gas differentials have widened as the basin awaits takeaway expansions and a more balanced regional supply and demand picture. In addition, NGL netbacks have been weak in Appalachia, particularly propane, as regional supply has outstripped summer demand. In the face of these current pricing issues, we remain focused on things that will improve our netbacks in the near term and things that will make Range successful in the long run. We're focused on executing our plan and driving down cost in the field and at the corporate level while operating safely.
The good news is that we put some arrangements in place years ago that will come to fruition later this year, which should make some of this pricing pain short lived for Range. For the second half of 2015, there are 2 projects that will benefit Range specifically. The first is Spectra's Uniontown to Gas City project. Range is an anchor shipper on this project and has approximately 200 million per day of capacity. The first leg of the project is anticipated to commence on August 1, and the second and final leg is projected to start up on September 1. This will move about 200 million per day gross or about 170 million per day net of our production from the local Appalachian M2 markets to premium Midwest markets. Under current strip pricing, this should increase our realized price by approximately $1 on this production. For the next 12 months, we've locked in a significant portion of the price uplift by hedging the basis. The uplift from this project is expected to have a significant impact on our Southwest Marcellus realized pricing for future periods. The 170 million per day net capacity would equate to 28% of our average Southwest Marcellus gas production in the second quarter.
The second project, which we expect to be very impactful for us, is Mariner East I. Range has 40,000 barrels per day of capacity on Mariner East I and is the anchor shipper on this project as well. The capacity is for 20,000 barrels of ethane and 20,000 barrels per day of propane. We'll also have access to 80% of a 1 million barrel propane storage cavern at Marcus Hook. Sunoco is projecting Mariner East I to start up in late September, with commissioning completed a few weeks thereafter. Mariner East I will lock in our Appalachian propane transport cost and result in significant transportation savings. That will also enable us to choose between northeast markets and international markets depending on demand and pricing. When Mariner East I is fully up and running, this project, in combination with Mariner West and ATEX, is anticipated to result in about a $90 million increase to our net cash flow on an annualized basis without counting the potential propane price uplift opportunity.
The marketing team has not only put in place good projects for the second half of 2015, but also looking forward into 2016 and '17, there are other projects that should benefit Range. Range is an anchor shipper and has a 150 million per day gross of capacity on Spectra's Gulf Markets Expansion Project. Startup is targeted for the fourth quarter of 2016, and this will move 128 million per day net of Range's gas to the Gulf Coast. Rover Phase 1 is also planned to start up in the fourth quarter of 2016.
In addition, at the end of 2017, Range has participated in several pipeline expansion projects that will allow Range to move an additional 900 million per day of Range's gas to the Gulf Coast, Midwest and Canadian markets.
On a macro basis, good things are happening inside the Appalachian Basin. The overall rig count for the Marcellus is down 55% from its peak. Total Marcellus production has been flat to declining since the beginning of the year based on pipeline flows. The Utica rig count has dropped 66% from its peak. In addition to dropping rigs, the remaining rigs are moving out of the wet gas and liquids-rich portion of the Utica, which should help rebalance the oversupply of liquids in the basin. Given the steep declines of most of these Utica liquids wells, the rebalance should happen sooner rather than later. With the drop in Utica rig count by 2/3, coupled with the lack of hedges for '16 and beyond by most companies and with lower strip pricing for '16, the Utica rig count will probably stay low for a while, which will help on the supply side.
Good things are also happening outside of the Appalachian Basin. Looking across the U.S., the oil rig count is down about 60%. There's a lot of associated natural gas with oil and the associated gas now accounts for a significant portion of total U.S. gas production. Per flow data, it appears that the gas from some of the key oil basins may have peaked in April. Since the associated gas is very rich, about 40% of oil NGLs come from this source. Therefore, the NGLs from this source should follow the trend in associated gas.
On the demand side, LNG gas exports from the U.S. are still on target to begin in the fourth quarter of this year and ramp with time. Natural gas continues to take market share from coal, and I believe that this trend will continue given that natural gas is much friendlier fuel from an environmental perspective than coal. In addition, natural gas exports to Mexico, industrial demand for gas and natural gas for transportation directly with CNG or indirectly as electricity are projected to grow with time. We believe these supply and demand side forces are working together to rebalance the market sooner than was currently priced into the strip. Consequently, we believe that as supply and demand equalize, the natural gas will move up. Equally important, as the infrastructure within the Appalachian Basin builds out, the basis should narrow with time. In combination, this should result in better netbacks for Range.
In a commodity business, it's important to be low cost and have scale. On Slide 4 of our IR presentation, we've included a new slide from Wood Mackenzie. According to their work on the Marcellus, Range not only has the largest resource base, we have the lowest breakeven cost. In addition, we have the upside of potentially 400,000 net acres of dry Utica gas beneath our Marcellus acreage. Coupling this resource base with our capital discipline and diversified portfolio marketing arrangements, which gives us multiple options that our competitors do not have, Range is positioned to create value as we move forward into an expected better market that balances supply, demand and infrastructure.
I'll now turn the call over to Roger."

The second quarter traditionally brings the mildest weather of the year, which tends to amplify the pricing impact of a supply surplus. This year's mild second quarter occurred against the unusual backdrop of seasonal market surpluses for all of our energy commodities: oil, natural gas and NGLs. Fortunately, as Jeff discussed, better days are ahead and in the meantime, our results are supported by significant cost reductions and a strong hedge position.
Quarterly financial performance since 2008 has been a tug-of-war between low-cost production growth and realized price. With the help of consistent and significant unit cost reductions during this time frame, more often than not at Range, growth at low cost has won the contest. Production growth of 24% and 11% lower unit cost in the second quarter, however, were no match for a 38% year-over-year reduction in realized price. Despite significantly higher production, revenue from natural gas, oil and NGL sales, including cash-settled derivatives, was $383 million, 15% below last year. Second quarter cash flow was $161 million, and EBITDAX for the quarter came in at $203 million. Cash flow per fully diluted share was $0.97. Year-to-date second quarter cash flow totaled $367 million, while year-to-date EBITDAX was $446 million. GAAP net income for the second quarter was a loss of $119 million. Non-GAAP earnings, calculated using popular analyst methodology, was $2.3 million or $0.01 per fully diluted share.
The second quarter was another good one on the expense reduction side, with direct operating, production, taxes, expiration, G&A and interest expense totals all coming in below last year on both a unit cost basis and absolute dollar basis. The only expense item to slightly exceed quarterly guidance was interest expense as the second quarter included 1 month of negative interest carry from our issuance of $750 million in 4 7/8% 10-year senior notes. We issued these notes in favorable market conditions several months ago well before next month's redemption of our callable 6 3/4% notes.
Second quarter cash unit costs were reduced by $0.25 per Mcfe and total unit costs were reduced by $0.36 per Mcfe from last year. At current realized prices, these are very meaningful reductions. We believe additional unit cost reductions are possible as we become even more efficient with both our operating and capital expenditures.
Third quarter specific line item expense guidance may be found in our second quarter earnings press release. The big news over on the balance sheet was a $750 million issuance of 10-year senior notes. That May issuance, the 4 7/8% notes, represented the lowest yield of any noninvestment grade energy and power sector issuer of any maturity in 2015. Many thanks to the institutions on this call who helped make this possible as the transaction demonstrates the creditworthiness of our company and the quality of our long-life, low-cost, high-return assets.
Lower prices and the front-end loaded nature of our capital budget in 2015 pushed our leverage a bit higher in the second quarter with second quarter trailing 12 month debt-to-EBITDAX ratio coming in at 3.3x. I should mention that this leverage ratio is charted territory for Range, as we have been over 3x on several occasions over the years. Even though we no longer have a debt-to-EBITDAX loan covenant and our next annual borrowing base determination isn't until May of next year, our stance on leverage has not changed. When leverage exceeds 3x, we will begin working on ways to bring it down. It would be premature to discuss the specific things we are working on right now, but as Range has sold over $3 billion in assets over the past 10 years, this is the first option we consider to reduce leverage. Range added new hedges for 2015 and '16 across all commodities during the second quarter. The details of which may be found in the earnings press release and the Range website.
As Jeff mentioned, the second quarter was a challenging one. However, Range is structured operationally and financially to handle this kind of adversity. Our low-cost structure, high-return projects, long-life assets, strong balance sheet, plentiful liquidity and consistent performance history provide welcome stability and the means to navigate through these tough times. Until times are better, we will continue to drive down cost, high-grade our portfolio and prudently allocate capital.
Ray, over to you."

During times like these, it's critical to have a great team, quality asset, size and scale, a strong balance sheet and a low-cost structure. Range has all of that, but we also have the unique ability to drill on high-quality core areas of dry, wet or super-rich with the operational flexibility to reallocate capital when needed and maintain capital discipline. During the first half of this year, we've clearly exercised those abilities and changed the lay of the land, and I'll walk you through some of those changes now.
Of course, the first step happened at the beginning of the year when we adjusted our 2015 plan by cutting CapEx by 45% or $700 million less as compared to last year, while still delivering 20% production growth, and we're still on track to execute that plan. Another step we took was to allocate more of our capital to dry gas drilling in Southwest PA due to the challenges we saw coming in the NGL market. The dry gas economics were substantially better. In Southwest PA, our normal year-end inventory of wells ready for completion would normally be in the range of 20 to 30 wells. Our current forecast is that we should have between 50 and 60 wells in inventory and about half of those wells are expected to be in the dry gas area. Of course, it's very preliminary and those numbers will likely change, but those wells can be brought online in 2016 with less capital since we're only looking at the completion cost rather than the total well cost. In addition, we've increased the number of wells being turned to sales in 2015, as we now expect an additional 16 Marcellus wells to be turned-in-line at the very end of '15 rather than early next year, all of this allowing us to start 2016 with good momentum into the historically better winter pricing environment.
With our new contracts and low-cost transportation, we will be positioned well to start off next year while maintaining good capital discipline. Our capital spending was front-end loaded this year with us spending approximately 2/3 of our capital budget during the first 2 quarters. In January, we had 15 rigs running. Currently, we have 10 rigs running. And we expect to average 7 rigs in the third quarter, going down to 6 in the fourth quarter. We'll also be tapering off frac crews in the second half of this year. So as you can see, our CapEx spend will be substantially less during the second half of the year, and I want to reiterate that we remain committed to meet our planned $870 million budget.
We beat production guidance for the second quarter and came in at 1.373 Bcf equivalent per day, largely driven by better-than-expected performance in the dry gas area of Southwest Pennsylvania. For the third quarter, we're setting guidance at 1.39 to 1.4 Bcf equivalent per day with approximately 28% liquids and are still on track to deliver 20% production growth for the year.
The Mariner East I project has been delayed from the original expectation of a July startup, and we forecast the project coming online late in the quarter with full operations during the fourth quarter.
Like Roger pointed out in his remarks, our costs are consistently improving on both an absolute and unit basis. Corporate LOE per Mcfe is down 20% for the quarter as compared to last year and G&A per Mcfe is down 21%. We've demonstrated discipline and a continued focus on cost. Reacting to the current environment, we had to make some tough decisions in closing our Oklahoma City division office and making substantial personnel cuts in our legacy fields in Pennsylvania. Those decisions resulted in layoffs of approximately 11% of our workforce. Those decisions were not made lightly, but in this environment, tough decisions like these become necessary.
We've updated our Marcellus economics on Page 16 in our presentation to reflect the current pricing and differentials. We left the well cost and type curves unchanged in order to get an apples-to-apples comparison. As you can see, our economics are still good in all cases, but the dry area economics have improved, supporting our decision to direct more of our capital towards dry gas in Southwest PA. The improved economics in the dry area are driven primarily by the improvement in basis differentials, coupled with our transportation contracts going forward.
In the Marcellus, we've continued to upgrade our completion designs by optimizing proppant loading, sizes and concentrations, along with reduced stage spacing across our very large and diverse acreage position in Southwest PA. For example, stage sizes today range from 200,000 pounds of proppant per stage up to 500,000 pounds per stage depending on the area and the particular reservoir characteristics in that area.
Well performance this year is on target, and I'll point out a couple of examples of recent performance. In the wet area, we brought online a 5-well pad averaging 28.2 million cubic feet equivalent per day per well initial rate to sales, with a 7-day average rate to sales of 20.8 million a day per well under constrained conditions. Those wells averaged 5,204-foot laterals with 27 stages per well. In the dry area of Southwest Pennsylvania, we had a 2-well pad come online with an average initial rate to sales of 34.2 million a day per well under constrained conditions. The average 90-day rate is 20 million a day per well. Those wells averaged 9,074-foot laterals with 45 stages and have cumed over 1.8 Bcf each well in 90 days.
Expanding on that area where these 2 wells are located, we have a total of 6 offset wells with up to a year of production history. The average cume production at 90 days to sales under facility and gathering system constraints was 1.5 Bcf per each well. These were shorter laterals averaging 5,064 feet with 26 stages. Our EUR in this area is currently 3 Bcf per 1,000 foot, with some of the older wells over 3.2 Bcf per 1,000 foot, putting this area on par with some of the best production in the basin. We believe our dry gas area in Southwest PA will be very prolific and is clearly exceeding our expectations thus far this year.
In Southwest Pennsylvania, we completed 52% more stages in the first half of this year compared to last year. Our stage count per day improved by 20% for the first quarter and by 30% for the first half of the year. Highlighting the second quarter, we averaged 6.3 stages a day per frac crew, which we believe is the best in the basin. As we front-end loaded a lot of the activity this year, our total stages and stage counts per day are expected to be less during the last half of this year.
On the drilling side, during the second quarter, we saw a 13% decrease in days while drilling 21% longer laterals as compared to last year. To put that in perspective, based on recent data, we would estimate drilling an 8,500-foot lateral well in less than 18 days. These efficiencies have been critical in helping us deliver 20% growth this year with 45% less capital, and we're far from done as these improvements will keep on coming. Other than having a great operating team, a critical factor in achieving these operational and well performance gains is being in the core of the play. As I've often said, the rock rules. We list the normalized EUR and cost results of our Marcellus areas in a table in our earnings release. Achieving results comparable to these are very difficult when you're not in the core. When you combine these results with our lower transportation cost and all the great work our team has done in securing better markets, it drives what we believe to be one of the best capital efficiencies in the industry. Operational gains, coupled with further service cost reductions, have helped to reduce our overall well cost significantly. When comparing the first half of 2015 with the second half of 2014, we're seeing total well cost reductions on an apples-to-apples basis of up to 25% or more, and we're continuing to see cost come down on things like steel, along with other goods and prices -- services.
Like I said on the last call, Range did not have any long-term drilling or service contracts and therefore, our operating teams had and still have a tremendous competitive advantage in optimizing our service provider relationships. Coupled with our operating practices, we can achieve attractive pricing while our service providers maintain high utilization rates and reasonable margins. Over the long term, we expect that this will differentiate Range versus our peers as we believe our well-planned, disciplined and growing operations have allowed us to attract some of the most favorable service pricing in the basin. Our Washington County PA Utica well is still producing into our wet system on an interruptible and constrained basis. And it's still too early to make any reasonable estimates of ultimate performance. We're finishing up the completion on our second well and expect that both wells will be online in the permanent, new dry gas infrastructure over the next couple of months. You can see some of the info on that second well in our earnings release. I expect that we'll be able to give more information on well performance after both wells have been online consistently for a few months. And we still expect to spud our third well before year-end and it will be completed in 2016.
Our Fort Worth operations team, which now also runs our Midcontinent Division in addition to our Northern Marcellus Division, is doing a great job focusing on cost while delivering great well results. In Northeast PA, we just drilled and set pipe on the well for $284 per lateral foot as compared to $394 per foot estimated for 2015. That's a 28% reduction in cost from what we originally planned. Since that team has taken over the Midcontinent assets in a very short time and with just a few wells under their belt, they've reduced the total completed well cost in the Nemaha/Chat play by over 31% to approximately $2.2 million per well with the last few wells, and the initial production from those wells is consistent with our expectations.
Our Southern Appalachia Nora team is also doing great. And while they have a very limited capital budget this year, they're continuing to bring online some of the best coal bed methane wells we've seen in 25 years. Utilizing the new high rate frac technique, the recent CBM wells are 60% better than their average offsets with significantly better economics.
Although Range's operational tempo has been high, employee safety remains a top priority. Employee and management commitment to safety has resulted in Range having no OSHA recordable injuries thus far in 2015 and 0 hours of lost time in the last 18 months. We are really proud of all of our operating teams for working safely and being good stewards in the communities where we live and work.
Like I said in the beginning, times are indeed tough and every penny really counts. Maintaining capital discipline and a low-cost structure are extremely important. I'm proud to say that we believe we have a deeper, more diverse and better inventory than anyone in the basin, with minimal type curve risk at one of the lowest-cost structures, with one of the best capital efficiencies, great capital discipline and one of the best teams in the industry.
Now back to Jeff."

Typically, we work that really hard, presented to our board in December, and then after their approval, announced in January. But let me give you a lot of thoughts around it that hopefully will put some sideboards around it and give you a lot of color. I'd like to start by talking about this year, 2015. In this year, we're getting a 20% growth with $870 million of CapEx. And we feel good about those numbers. And that's where we'll end up. And if you look at that, I think, versus any of our peers, I think we're ahead of the class. Our dollars go further than almost any operator. We're, I believe, one of the most, if not the most, capital-efficient company out there.
So we'll start with '15. If you look into '16, I think our pricing gets better. The netbacks will get better. One, we'll have a full year of Mariner East in 2016 and we're -- again, we have the lion's share of Mariner East. We're the only producer that has capacity on it. We have 40,000 barrels per day on it. So our netback pricing for our NGLs should get significantly better for ethane, for propane, et cetera. Also, we'll have a full year of Uniontown to Gas City, which is a big uplift, and one that's really significant portion of our production in the Southwest. It's at initially $1 uplift. And that $0.75 to $1 range, we've hedged and locked a lot of that in. So our netbacks should get significantly better in '16. And as I mentioned on my call notes, there's other projects coming on in '16 like Spectra's Gulf Markets Expansion and Rover Phase 1. And as each of those projects occurs and the supply and demand inside the basin equal out a little bit, basis should contract. So I think we're one of the most capital-efficient companies in terms of growth, plus given our unique portfolio of marketing contracts, I think our netbacks improve next year. But I think a really important slide that I'd like to refer everyone to is Slide 8 on our website. And it's a slide that shows what our production growth has been over time plotted against the dollars of capital per incremental Mcfe of production. And if you look at that, you can see consistently really for the last 5 years, our capital efficiency has gotten better. If you hone in just on 2015 versus '14, and you look at the blue line on the graph, we're getting 20% growth, but the blue line, our capital -- our costs are down literally 50% in dollars per incremental capital or 50% less in '15 than they were in '14, through a combination better completion, better targeting, lower service cost. And I really applaud Ray and the entire operations team. If you would ask me at any point in time, this time last year where would we have been? I wouldn't have predicted we would have been able to reduce that by 50%, but it speaks to the quantity of the team, in the rock and our position. So when you -- 20% growth in '15 for $870 million CapEx is, I think, outstanding. Next year, we get better pricing, but I don't think our efficiencies go to 0 in 2016. I think -- I'm not saying we're going to knock 50% off, but I think that you'll see significant improvement in capital efficiency when you look at '16 versus '15 if we're sitting here at this time next year. So I think that's really important. And that efficiency will come from, again, our laterals this year average about 6,000 feet with x stages that's in our work. You'll see us, I think, continue to migrate towards longer laterals with more stages and all those types of things, plus we'll have a full year's worth of service contract benefit that we didn't have this year. So I think all of that speaks to better performance in '16 than in '15. I think there's a couple of other ways to look at it as well. Ray mentioned we're going to be carrying in almost double the number of wells into '16 that we normally would in a typical year. So almost 50 to 60 wells instead of 20 to 30. So the drilling costs are in this year. The completion, just the completion cost during next year. So that's going to be really capital-efficient growth with that. And I think if you look at us versus our competitors, if you look at our fourth quarter '15 exit rate versus fourth quarter '14, we should be growing roughly 15% fourth quarter '15 over '14. So we've had that continual ramp-up in growth. So we're going to be entering '16 with good growth versus a lot of our peers who will be flat over that same time frame. In fact, some of them will be down. So I think all those things are important. And again, hopefully, give you some things to think about in terms of how you might model '16. Wouldn't want to be premature again. Would I have predicted we would have knocked 50% off of our capital efficiency and grown 20% for $870 million? I wouldn't have, but I predict Ray and the team will also step up again big time for '16, and you'll see a good improvement in those numbers. But I can also tell you, we'll look hard as we go throughout the year at what oil and gas prices are in '16. We'll look very hard at the returns. We just recently updated the economics and returns of all of our areas where we're spending money in the book. And we'll continue to do that. We will be very prudent with our balance sheet, and we'll be sensitive to that. And given that, I think we're in good shape for '16. Kind of a long answer, but an important question."

I'll answer some of that, how we've answered this question before. When you take our anticipated 2015 production times our F&D cost -- and you can pick any F&D cost, it's in the Appendix of the book on any of our key plays -- you end up with a maintenance capital to replace our reserves of around $200 million to $220 million. So I think that's one bookend for you, for folks to think about. The other bookend, of course, is what Jeff just mentioned that in 2015, we've gotten 20% growth at $870 million, with anticipated additional efficiencies going into 2016 for a lot of the reasons that were just mentioned. So I think you can look at those as 2 bookends. Another thing I would add is just that something a lot of folks forget about is, we really have, if not the highest R/P ratios, one of the highest R/P ratios out there, particularly of a shale producer and especially if you look at just the proved developed producing reserves in that ratio. So we have a much shallower decline, which means it's a lot easier to replace production. So I know I'm not getting to the exact number, but like Jeff said, we don't have a micrometer for 2016 right now. But I think that -- hopefully, that will help you with bookending the answer."

And I've always -- and I'm sure you've heard it and all the people in one-on-ones. And to drive home the point, I take silly examples. If gas is $0.05, we're not going to grow at 20%. Or if gas is going to be $10 flat, we'll grow higher than 25%. But that's been kind of reasonable target. It's interesting over that time frame for the most part prior to the last year people have challenged us, why don't we grow faster? And we always stuck to our guns on what we thought was a reasonable and a prudent plan. If you look at this year, it's very interesting. Again, we want to be reasonable and prudent where prices were, we cut $700 million out. And at that point, we weren't even targeting growth. We were just saying, how capital efficient could we be? The 20% fell out of that and it happened to be kind of in line with 20% to 25%, but there was really nothing magical. That's just the quality of the team and the rock. And again, if you would ask me, could Ray and the team on Page 8 knock 50% off of our capital efficiency from '15 versus '14, I wouldn't have said that last year. They did -- went above and beyond, which, again, speaks to the quality of the rock and the team. We'll approach '16 and '17 and beyond in that same fashion."

And one of the things I'll point out, when you couple that with some of the recent wells that have been announced around us, it really proves up our math that we've had in the book for over a year now, and I think it really helps delineate our 400,000-acre position, which is the biggest position out there.

I completely understand why you want to test the potential. I guess, just thinking about that and the high rates of the wells and the added midstream infrastructure or the takeaway from the pads, what -- how does that sort of color your view or is it -- I assume it's a low-capital item that may kick in over time. And related to that, CONSOL reported a very strong well test in Westmoreland, which is kind of in and around your acreage. Any reactions to that?

So -- and again, it's -- being stacked pay is important. We're getting some phenomena right now. Some of the strongest returns we have are in the dry Marcellus, but the take away for the dry Marcellus could be used at some point for dry Utica. And all that stuff of kind of stacks together, the wells we're drilling are off of existing Marcellus pads and with Marcellus roads, the same team. We've already paid for the acreage. It's already held by the Marcellus. So it's kind of an option. So we'll stay focused on the Marcellus, but to the extent we learn more about the Utica and to the extent the Utica economics ultimately compete with the Marcellus, then you may see us allocate some capital there in a very disciplined way in order to maximize our returns and to -- as we go forward."

So hopefully, that's enough clarity into what that looks like. And again, don't forget spectra. It's August 1 of this year. So that's like next week, the 200 million a day.

The service cost have clearly come down a lot this year. And like I said in my prepared remarks at the beginning of the call, on an apples-to-apples basis, when you look at what we've seen the first half of this year compared to the second half of last year and you just pick Southwest PA, for instance, some areas are more, some are less, but just pick Southwest PA, we're 25% or more less total well cost. And that's a range of all sorts of things, less cost for the drilling rig -- frac cost coming down, directional drillers, all that sort of thing. And we are still seeing some of those prices come down because, like Jeff said, in is remarks at the beginning, the rig counts are down in the Utica by 66%. They're down in the Marcellus by, what, over 50%. I think close to 55% now. The other basins are seeing the same kind of things. So there's a lot of competition out there. The service providers are having to really pick the people they want to work for and really having to hammer down on their suppliers. So you're seeing this continual bump down of lower cost going all the way down into things like steel and proppants and guar gum for friction reducing. And all those sort of chemicals and everything else are getting cheaper. So I think it would be pretty aggressive, probably too aggressive do think that we're going to see as much of a decrease as we've seen so far. But I do think we'll see more as all of this tries to settle out at some level of cost and activity. I think because of our kind of well-planned and disciplined approach and the way we try to really focus on utilization of the frac crews and so forth that gives us a leg up. And the fact that we didn't have any long-term contracts was a big advantage of the team. I think it's still a big advantage to the team. We're much more a believer philosophically in long-term relationships rather than long-term contracts because we really try to make it a win-win relationship with our service providers. And when you -- I think we're living proof of the fact that, that's allowed us as a company to attract some of the best pricing and some of the lowest well cost. And all that translates into the best capital efficiency, I think, in the basin. So that's our philosophy going forward. I think the other thing you'll see going into '16 is we'll a full year of these price reductions, which will really help our capital efficiency. So I don't know that -- we'll probably still see some decreases here and there, but the fact that we'll be able to apply what we've seen thus far to a full year is really what's going to help us next year, plus the fact that we have a bigger inventory. We got better contracts. We got Mariner East up and running. We got Spectra's Uniontown to Gas City. We got Rover and the Gulf expansion coming on late next year. All of those things that we've been talking about on the call are really going to help set '16 up very, very well."

Appalachian natural gas differentials have widened as the basin awaits takeaway expansions and a more balanced regional supply and demand picture. In addition, NGL netbacks have been weak in Appalachia, particularly propane, as regional supply has outstripped summer demand. In the face of these current pricing issues, we remain focused on things that will improve our netbacks in the near term and things that will make Range successful in the long run. We're focused on executing our plan and driving down costs in the field and at the corporate level while operating safely.
The good news is that we put some arrangements in place years ago that will come to fruition later this year, which should make some of this pricing pain short-lived for Range. For the second half of 2015, there are 2 projects that will benefit Range specifically. The first is Spectra's Uniontown to Gas City project. Range is an anchor shipper on this project and has approximately 200 million per day of capacity. The first leg of the project is anticipated to commence on August 1, and the second and final leg is projected to start up on September 1. This will move about 200 million per day gross or about 170 million per day net of our production from the local Appalachian M2 markets to premium Midwest markets. Under current strip pricing, this should increase our realized price by approximately $1 on this production. For the next 12 months, we've locked in a significant portion of the price uplift by hedging the basis. The uplift from this project is expected to have a significant impact on our Southwest Marcellus realized pricing for future periods. The 170 million per day net capacity would equate to 28% of our average Southwest Marcellus gas production in the second quarter.
The second project, which we expect to be very impactful for us, is Mariner East I. Range has 40,000 barrels per day of capacity on Mariner East I and is the anchor shipper on this project as well. The capacity is for 20,000 barrels of ethane and 20,000 barrels per day of propane. We'll also have access to 80% of a 1 million barrel propane storage cavern at Marcus Hook. Sunoco is projecting Mariner East I to start up in late September, with commissioning completed a few weeks thereafter. Mariner East I will lock in our Appalachian propane transport costs and result in significant transportation savings. That will also enable us to choose between Northeast markets and international markets depending on demand and pricing. When Mariner East I is fully up and running, this project, in combination with Mariner West and ATEX, is anticipated to result in about a $90 million increase to our net cash flow on an annualized basis, without counting the potential propane price uplift opportunity.
The marketing team has not only put in place good projects for the second half of 2015, but also looking forward into 2016 and '17, there are other projects that should benefit Range. Range is an anchor shipper and has a 150 million per day gross of capacity on Spectra's Gulf Markets Expansion Project. Startup is targeted for the fourth quarter of 2016, and this will move 128 million per day net of Range's gas to the Gulf Coast. Rover Phase 1 is also planned to start up in the fourth quarter of 2016.
In addition, at the end of 2017, Range has participated in several pipeline expansion projects that will allow Range to move an additional 900 million per day of Range's gas to the Gulf Coast, Midwest and Canadian markets.
On a macro basis, good things are happening inside the Appalachian Basin. The overall rig count for the Marcellus is down 55% from its peak. Total Marcellus production has been flat to declining since the beginning of the year based on pipeline flows. The Utica rig count has dropped 66% from its peak. In addition to dropping rigs, the remaining rigs are moving out of the wet gas and liquids-rich portion of the Utica, which should help rebalance the oversupply of liquids in the basin. Given the steep declines of most of these Utica liquids wells, the rebalance should happen sooner rather than later. With the drop in Utica rig count by 2/3, coupled with the lack of hedges for '16 and beyond by most companies, and with lower strip pricing for '16, the Utica rig count will probably stay low for a while, which will help on the supply side.
Good things are also happening outside of the Appalachian Basin. Looking across the U.S., the oil rig count is down about 60%. There's a lot of associated natural gas with oil and the associated gas now accounts for a significant portion of total U.S. gas production. Per flow data, it appears that the gas from some of the key oil basins may have peaked in April. Since the associated gas is very rich, about 40% of all NGLs come from this source. Therefore, the NGLs from this source should follow the trend in associated gas.
On the demand side, LNG gas exports from the U.S. are still on target to begin in the fourth quarter of this year and ramp with time. Natural gas continues to take market share from coal, and I believe that this trend will continue, given that natural gas is much friendlier fuel from an environmental perspective than coal. In addition, natural gas exports to Mexico, industrial demand for gas and natural gas for transportation directly as CNG or indirectly as electricity are projected to grow with time. We believe these supply and demand side forces are working together to rebalance the market sooner than was currently priced into the strip. Consequently, we believe that as supply and demand equalize, the natural gas will move up. Equally important, as the infrastructure within the Appalachian Basin builds out, the basis should narrow with time. In combination, this should result in better netbacks for Range.
In a commodity business, it's important to be low cost and have scale. On Slide 4 of our IR presentation, we've included a new slide from Wood Mackenzie. According to their work on the Marcellus, Range not only has the largest resource base, we have the lowest breakeven cost. In addition, we have the upside of potentially 400,000 net acres of dry Utica gas beneath our Marcellus acreage. Coupling this resource base with our capital discipline and diversified portfolio of marketing arrangements, which gives us multiple options that our competitors do not have, Range is positioned to create value as we move forward into an expected better market that balances supply, demand and infrastructure.
I'll now turn the call over to Roger."

The second quarter traditionally brings the mildest weather of the year, which tends to amplify the pricing impact of a supply surplus. This year's mild second quarter occurred against the unusual backdrop of seasonal market surpluses for all of our energy commodities: oil, natural gas and NGLs. Fortunately, as Jeff discussed, better days are ahead and in the meantime, our results are supported by significant cost reductions and a strong hedge position.
Quarterly financial performance since 2008 has been a tug-of-war between low-cost production growth and realized price. With the help of consistent and significant unit cost reductions during this time frame, more often than not at Range, growth at low cost has won the contest. Production growth of 24% and 11% lower unit costs in the second quarter, however, were no match for a 38% year-over-year reduction in realized price. Despite significantly higher production, revenue from natural gas, oil and NGL sales, including cash-settled derivatives, was $383 million, 15% below last year. Second quarter cash flow was $161 million, and EBITDAX for the quarter came in at $203 million. Cash flow per fully diluted share was $0.97. Year-to-date second quarter cash flow totaled $367 million, while year-to-date EBITDAX was $446 million. GAAP net income for the second quarter was a loss of $119 million. Non-GAAP earnings, calculated using popular analyst methodology, was $2.3 million or $0.01 per fully diluted share.
The second quarter was another good one on the expense reduction side, with direct operating, production, taxes, expiration, G&A and interest expense totals all coming in below last year on both a unit cost basis and absolute dollar basis. The only expense item to slightly exceed quarterly guidance was interest expense, as the second quarter included 1 month of negative interest carry from our issuance of $750 million in 4 7/8% 10-year senior notes. We issued these notes in favorable market conditions several months ago, well before next month's redemption of our callable 6 3/4% notes.
Second quarter cash unit costs were reduced by $0.25 per Mcfe and total unit costs were reduced by $0.36 per Mcfe from last year. At current realized prices, these are very meaningful reductions. We believe additional unit cost reductions are possible as we've become even more efficient with both our operating and capital expenditures.
Third quarter specific line item expense guidance may be found in our second quarter earnings press release. The big news over on the balance sheet was a $750 million issuance of 10-year senior notes. At May issuance, the 4 7/8% notes, represented the lowest yield of any noninvestment grade energy and power sector issuer of any maturity in 2015. Many thanks to the institutions on this call who helped make this possible as the transaction demonstrates the creditworthiness of our company and the quality of our long-life, low-cost, high-return assets.
Lower prices and the front-end-loaded nature of our capital budget in 2015 pushed our leverage a bit higher in the second quarter, with second quarter trailing 12 month debt-to-EBITDAX ratio coming in at 3.3x. I should mention that this leverage ratio is charted territory for Range, as we have been over 3x on several occasions over the years. Even though we no longer have a debt-to-EBITDAX loan covenant and our next annual borrowing base determination isn't until May of next year, our stance on leverage has not changed. When leverage exceeds 3x, we will begin working on ways to bring it down. It would be premature to discuss the specific things we are working on right now, but as Range has sold over $3 billion in assets over the past 10 years, this is the first option we consider to reduce leverage. Range added new hedges for 2015 and '16 across all commodities during the second quarter, the details of which may be found in the earnings press release and the Range website.
As Jeff mentioned, the second quarter was a challenging one. However, Range is structured operationally and financially to handle this kind of adversity. Our low-cost structure, high-return projects, long-life assets, strong balance sheet, plentiful liquidity and consistent performance history provide welcome stability and the means to navigate through these tough times. Until times are better, we will continue to drive down costs, high-grade our portfolio and prudently allocate capital.
Ray, over to you."

During times like these, it's critical to have a great team, quality asset, size and scale, a strong balance sheet and a low cost structure. Range has all of that, but we also have the unique ability to drill on high-quality core areas of dry, wet or super-rich, with the operational flexibility to reallocate capital when needed and maintain capital discipline. During the first half of this year, we've clearly exercised those abilities and changed the lay of the land, and I'll walk you through some of those changes now.
Of course, the first step happened at the beginning of the year, when we adjusted our 2015 plan by cutting CapEx by 45% or $700 million less as compared to last year, while still delivering 20% production growth, and we're still on track to execute that plan. Another step we took was to allocate more of our capital to dry gas drilling in Southwest PA due to the challenges we saw coming in the NGL market. The dry gas economics were substantially better. In Southwest PA, our normal year-end inventory of wells ready for completion would normally be in the range of 20 to 30 wells. Our current forecast is that we should have between 50 and 60 wells in inventory and about half of those wells are expected to be in the dry gas area. Of course, it's very preliminary and those numbers will likely change, but those wells can be brought online in 2016 with less capital since we're only looking at the completion cost rather than the total well cost. In addition, we've increased the number of wells being turned to sales in 2015, as we now expect an additional 16 Marcellus wells to be turned-in-line at the very end of '15 rather than early next year, all of this allowing us to start 2016 with good momentum into the historically better winter pricing environment.
With our new contracts and low-cost transportation, we will be positioned well to start off next year while maintaining good capital discipline. Our capital spending was front-end loaded this year with us spending approximately 2/3 of our capital budget during the first 2 quarters. In January, we had 15 rigs running. Currently, we have 10 rigs running. And we expect to average 7 rigs in the third quarter, going down to 6 in the fourth quarter. We'll also be tapering off frac crews in the second half of this year. So as you can see, our CapEx spend will be substantially less during the second half of the year, and I want to reiterate that we remain committed to meet our planned $870 million budget.
We beat production guidance for the second quarter and came in at 1.373 Bcf equivalent per day, largely driven by better-than-expected performance in the dry gas area of Southwest Pennsylvania. For the third quarter, we're setting guidance at 1.39 to 1.4 Bcf equivalent per day with approximately 28% liquids and are still on track to deliver 20% production growth for the year.
The Mariner East I project has been delayed from the original expectation of a July startup, and we forecast the project coming online late in the quarter with full operations during the fourth quarter.
Like Roger pointed out in his remarks, our costs are consistently improving on both an absolute and unit basis. Corporate LOE per Mcfe is down 20% for the quarter as compared to last year, and G&A per Mcfe is down 21%. We've demonstrated discipline and a continued focus on cost. Reacting to the current environment, we had to make some tough decisions in closing our Oklahoma City division office and making substantial personnel cuts in our legacy fields in Pennsylvania. Those decisions resulted in layoffs of approximately 11% of our workforce. Those decisions were not made lightly, but in this environment, tough decisions like these become necessary.
We've updated our Marcellus economics on Page 16 in our presentation to reflect the current pricing and differentials. We left the well cost and type curves unchanged in order to get an apples-to-apples comparison. As you can see, our economics are still good in all cases, but the dry area economics have improved, supporting our decision to direct more of our capital towards dry gas in Southwest PA. The improved economics in the dry area are driven primarily by the improvement in basis differentials, coupled with our transportation contracts going forward.
In the Marcellus, we've continued to upgrade our completion designs by optimizing proppant loading, sizes and concentrations, along with reduced stage spacing across our very large and diverse acreage position in Southwest PA. For example, stage sizes today range from 200,000 pounds of proppant per stage up to 500,000 pounds per stage depending on the area and the particular reservoir characteristics in that area.
Well performance this year is on target, and I'll point out a couple of examples of recent performance. In the wet area, we brought online a 5-well pad averaging 28.2 million cubic feet equivalent per day per well initial rate to sales, with a 7-day average rate to sales of 20.8 million a day per well under constrained conditions. Those wells averaged 5,204-foot laterals with 27 stages per well. In the dry area of Southwest Pennsylvania, we had a 2-well pad come online with an average initial rate to sales of 34.2 million a day per well under constrained conditions. The average 90-day rate is 20 million a day per well. Those wells averaged 9,074-foot laterals with 45 stages and have cumed over 1.8 Bcf each well in 90 days.
Expanding on that area where these 2 wells are located, we have a total of 6 offset wells with up to a year of production history. The average cume production at 90 days to sales under facility and gathering system constraints was 1.5 Bcf per each well. These were shorter laterals, averaging 5,064 feet with 26 stages. Our EUR in this area is currently 3 Bcf per 1,000 foot, with some of the older wells over 3.2 Bcf per 1,000 foot, putting this area on par with some of the best production in the basin. We believe our dry gas area in Southwest PA will be very prolific and is clearly exceeding our expectations thus far this year.
In Southwest Pennsylvania, we completed 52% more stages in the first half of this year as compared to last year. Our stage count per day improved by 20% for the first quarter and by 30% for the first half of the year. Highlighting the second quarter, we averaged 6.3 stages a day per frac crew, which we believe is the best in the basin. As we front-end loaded a lot of the activity this year, our total stages and stage counts per day are expected to be less during the last half of this year.
On the drilling side, during the second quarter, we saw a 13% decrease in days while drilling 21% longer laterals as compared to last year. To put that in perspective, based on recent data, we would estimate drilling an 8,500-foot lateral well in less than 18 days. These efficiencies have been critical in helping us deliver 20% growth this year with 45% less capital, and we're far from done as these improvements will keep on coming. Other than having a great operating team, a critical factor in achieving these operational and well performance gains is being in the core of the play. As I've often said, the rock rules. We list the normalized EUR and cost results of our Marcellus areas in a table in our earnings release. Achieving results comparable to these are very difficult when you're not in the core. When you combine these results with our lower transportation costs and all the great work our team has done in securing better markets, it drives what we believe to be one of the best capital efficiencies in the industry. Operational gains, coupled with further service cost reductions, have helped to reduce our overall well cost significantly. When comparing the first half of 2015 with the second half of 2014, we're seeing total well cost reductions on an apples-to-apples basis of up to 25% or more, and we're continuing to see costs come down on things like steel, along with other goods and prices -- services.
Like I said on the last call, Range did not have any long-term drilling or service contracts and, therefore, our operating teams had and still have a tremendous competitive advantage in optimizing our service provider relationships. Coupled with our operating practices, we can achieve attractive pricing while our service providers maintain high utilization rates and reasonable margins. Over the long term, we expect that this will differentiate Range versus our peers as we believe our well-planned, disciplined and growing operations have allowed us to attract some of the most favorable service pricing in the basin. Our Washington County, PA Utica well is still producing into our wet system on an interruptible and constrained basis. And it's still too early to make any reasonable estimates of ultimate performance. We're finishing up the completion on our second well and expect that both wells will be online in the permanent, new dry gas infrastructure over the next couple of months. You can see some of the details on that second well in our earnings release. I expect that we'll be able to give more information on well performance after both wells have been online consistently for a few months. And we still expect to spud our third well before year-end and it will be completed in 2016.
Our Fort Worth operations team, which now also runs our Midcontinent Division in addition to our Northern Marcellus Division, is doing a great job focusing on cost while delivering great well results. In Northeast PA, we just drilled and set pipe on the well for $284 per lateral foot as compared to $394 per foot estimated for 2015. That's a 28% reduction in cost from what we originally planned. Since that team has taken over the Midcontinent assets in a very short time and with just a few wells under their belt, they've reduced the total completed well cost in the Nemaha/Chat play by over 31% to approximately $2.2 million per well with the last few wells, and the initial production from those wells is consistent with our expectations.
Our Southern Appalachia Nora team is also doing great. And while they have a very limited capital budget this year, they're continuing to bring online some of the best coal bed methane wells we've seen in 25 years. Utilizing the new high-rate frac technique, the recent CBM wells are 60% better than their average offsets with significantly better economics.
Although Range's operational tempo has been high, employee safety remains a top priority. Employee and management commitment to safety has resulted in Range having no OSHA recordable injuries thus far in 2015 and 0 hours of lost time in the last 18 months. We are really proud of all of our operating teams for working safely and being good stewards in the communities where we live and work.
Like I said in the beginning, times are indeed tough and every penny really counts. Maintaining capital discipline and a low cost structure are extremely important. I'm proud to say that we believe we have a deeper, more diverse and better inventory than anyone in the basin, with minimal type curve risk at one of the lowest cost structures, with one of the best capital efficiencies, great capital discipline and one of the best teams in the industry.
Now back to Jeff."

And I'll start by saying it is early. Typically, we work that really hard, present it to our board in December, and then after their approval, announce it in January. But let me give you a lot of thoughts around it",1022,"Yes, let me -- that's a great question. And I'll start by saying it is early. Typically, we work that really hard, present it to our board in December, and then after their approval, announce it in January. But let me give you a lot of thoughts around it that hopefully will put some sideboards around it and give you a lot of color. I'd like to start by talking about this year, 2015. In this year, we're getting a 20% growth, with $870 million of CapEx. And we feel good about those numbers. And that's where we'll end up. And if you look at that, I think, versus any of our peers, I think we're ahead of the class. Our dollars go further than almost any operator. We're, I believe, one of the most, if not the most, capital-efficient company out there.
So we'll start with '15. If you look into '16, I think our pricing gets better. The netbacks will get better. One, we'll have a full year of Mariner East in 2016 and we're -- again, we have the lion's share of Mariner East. We're the only producer that has capacity on it. We have 40,000 barrels per day on it. So our netback pricing for our NGLs should get significantly better for ethane, for propane, et cetera. Also, we'll have a full year of Uniontown to Gas City, which is a big uplift, and one that's really significant portion of our production in the Southwest. It's initially $1 uplift. And that $0.75 to $1 range, we've hedged and locked a lot of that in. So our netbacks should get significantly better in '16. And as I mentioned on my call notes, there's other projects that come on in '16, like Spectra's Gulf Markets Expansion and Rover Phase 1. And as each of those projects occurs and the supply and demand inside the basin equal out a little bit, basis should contract. So I think we're one of the most capital-efficient companies in terms of growth, plus given our unique portfolio of marketing contracts, I think our netbacks improve next year. But I think a really important slide that I'd like to refer everyone to is Slide 8 on our website. And it's a slide that shows what our production growth has been with time plotted against the dollars of capital per incremental Mcfe of production. And if you look at that, you can see consistently really for the last 5 years, our capital efficiency has gotten better. If you hone in just on 2015 versus '14, and you look at the blue line on the graph, we're getting 20% growth, but the blue line, our capital -- our costs are down literally 50% in dollars per incremental capital or 50% less in '15 than they were in '14, through a combination of better completion, better targeting, lower service cost. And I really applaud Ray and the entire operations team. If you would have asked me at any point in time, this time last year where would we have been, I wouldn't have predicted we would have been able to reduce that by 50%, but it speaks to the quantity of the team, in the rock and our position. So when you -- 20% growth in '15 for $870 million CapEx is, I think, outstanding. Next year, we get better pricing, but I don't think our efficiencies go to 0 in 2016. I think -- I'm not saying we're going to knock 50% off, but I think that you'll see significant improvement in capital efficiency when you look at '16 versus '15 if we're sitting here at this time next year. So I think that's really important. And that efficiency will come from, again, where our laterals this year average about 6,000 feet with x stages that's in our work , you'll see us, I think, continue to migrate towards longer laterals with more stages and all those types of things, plus we'll have a full year's worth of service contract benefit that we didn't have this year. So I think all of that speaks to better performance in '16 than in '15. I think there's a couple of other ways to look at it as well. Ray mentioned we're going to be carrying in almost double the number of wells into '16 that we normally would in a typical year. So almost 50 to 60 wells instead of 20 to 30. So the drilling costs are in this year. The completion, just the completion costs, are in next year. So that's going to be really capital-efficient growth with that. And I think if you look at us versus our competitors, if you look at our fourth quarter '15 exit rate versus fourth quarter '14, we should be growing roughly 15% fourth quarter '15 over '14. So we've had that continual ramp-up in growth. So we're going to be entering '16 with good growth versus a lot of our peers, who will be flat over that same time frame. In fact, some of them will be down. So I think all those things are important and, again, hopefully, give you some things to think about in terms of how you might model '16. Wouldn't want to be premature. Again, would I have predicted we would have knocked 50% off of our capital efficiency and grown 20% for $870 million? I wouldn't have, but I predict Ray and the team will also step up again big time for '16, and you'll see a good improvement in those numbers. But I can also tell you, we'll look hard as we go throughout the year at what oil and gas prices are in '16. We'll look very hard at the returns. We just recently updated the economics and returns of all of our areas where we're spending money in the book. And we'll continue to do that. We will be very prudent with our balance sheet, and we'll be sensitive to that. And given that, I think we're in good shape for '16. Kind of a long answer, but an important question."

Just like on Page 8, you've seen year after year after year with better contracts, better netbacks. So carrying a big inventory in, exiting the year high with improved capital efficiencies, I think, again, in terms of growth for the dollar spend, if we aren't at the ahead of the class, I think we'll be near the head of the class, with some of the best contracts there. And actually on Page 8, our IR team has looked at all of our competitors and looked at every single company in the basin and out, peers out of the basin, and based on our work, I think we're -- if we aren't 1, we're 2, but I think we're actually 1.

Typically, capital budgets are always a little bit front-end loaded, but just taking that run rate and running straight through 2016, I don't think is a good way to look at it, because we'll probably ramp activity up a little bit in the first half of next -- or the first quarter for sure into that better pricing environment and so forth, as we always try to do.

I'll answer some of that, how we've answered this question before. When you take our anticipated 2015 production times our F&D costs -- and you can pick any F&D cost that's in the Appendix of the book on any of our key plays -- you end up with a maintenance capital to replace our reserves of around $200 million to $220 million. So I think that's one bookend for you, for folks to think about. The other bookend, of course, is what Jeff just mentioned that in 2015, we've gotten 20% growth at $870 million, with anticipated additional efficiencies going into 2016 for a lot of the reasons that were just mentioned. So I think you can look at those as 2 bookends. Another thing I would add is just that something a lot of folks forget about is, we really have, if not the highest R/P ratios, one of the highest R/P ratios out there, particularly of a shale producer and especially if you look at just the proved developed producing reserves in that ratio. So we have a much shallower decline, which means it's a lot easier to replace production. So I know I'm not getting to the exact number, but like Jeff said, we don't have a micrometer for 2016 right now. But I think that -- hopefully, that will help you with bookending the answer."

In other words, the shoring of the balance sheet, the strength of the balance sheet and so on as opposed to growing the top line. And just from a strategic point of view, how are you guys reconciling that? Why not wait a year and then push the growth once things sort themselves out from a commodity standpoint?"

And I've always -- and I'm sure you've heard it and all the people in one-on-ones. And to drive home the point, I take silly examples. If gas is $0.05, we're not going to grow at 20%. Or if gas is going to be $10 flat, we'll grow higher than 25%. But that's been kind of a reasonable target. It's interesting over that time frame for the most part prior to the last year people have challenged us, why don't we grow faster? And we always stuck to our guns of what we thought was a reasonable and a prudent plan. If you look at this year, it's very interesting. Again, we want to be reasonable and prudent. Where prices were, we cut $700 million out. And at that point, we weren't even targeting growth. We were just saying, how capital efficient could we be? The 20% fell out of that and it happened to be kind of in line with 20% to 25%, but there was really nothing magical. That's just the quality of the team and the rock. And again, if you would ask me, could Ray and the team on Page 8 knock 50% off of our capital efficiency from '15 versus '14, I wouldn't have said that last year.

That's where we're focused and that's where -- 95% of our capital is going into that. It's important, we think, to drill a few wells, and we picked 3, to give us a feel for what the Utica could be. Plus, like Ray said, it's encouraging with the well in Westmoreland County and the EQT well. Actually, you can see it on our website. I think they're still up there. Bill Zagorski did a presentation with SunTrust that's much more detailed in terms of the Utica. And you can see where those wells are and how they delineate our acreage and help derisk our acreage. So -- and again, it's -- being stacked pay is important. We're getting some phenomenal -- right now, some of the strongest returns we have are in the dry Marcellus, but the take away for the dry Marcellus could be used at some point for dry Utica. And as all that stuff of kind of stacks together, the wells we're drilling are off of existing Marcellus pads and with Marcellus roads. It's the same team. We've already paid for the acreage. It's already held by the Marcellus. So it's kind of an option. So we'll stay focused on the Marcellus, but to the extent we learn more about the Utica and to the extent the Utica economics ultimately compete with the Marcellus, then you may see us allocate some capital there in a very disciplined way in order to maximize our returns and to -- as we go forward."

The service costs have clearly come down a lot this year. And like I said in my prepared remarks at the beginning of the call, on an apples-to-apples basis, when you look at what we've seen the first half of this year compared to the second half of last year and you just pick Southwest PA, for instance, some areas are more, some are less, but just pick Southwest PA, we're 25% or more less total well cost. And that's a range of all sorts of things, less cost for the drilling rig -- frac costs coming down, directional drillers, all that sort of thing. And we are still seeing some of those prices come down because, like Jeff said in his remarks at the beginning, the rig counts are down in the Utica by 66%. They're down in the Marcellus by, what, over 50%. I think close to 55% now. The other basins are seeing the same kind of things. So there's a lot of competition out there. The service providers are having to really pick the people they want to work for and really having to hammer down on their suppliers. So you're seeing this continual bump down of lower costs going all the way down into things like steel and proppants and guar gum for friction reducing. And all those sort of chemicals and everything else are getting cheaper. So I think it would be pretty aggressive, probably too aggressive do think that we're going to see as much of a decrease as we've seen so far. But I do think we'll see more as all of this tries to settle out at some level of constant activity. I think because of our kind of well-planned and disciplined approach and the way we try to really focus on utilization of the frac crews and so forth that gives us a leg up. And the fact that we didn't have any long-term contracts was a big advantage to the team. I think it's still a big advantage to the team. We're much more a believer philosophically in long-term relationships rather than long-term contracts because we really try to make it a win-win relationship with our service providers. And when you -- I think we're living proof of the fact that, that's allowed us as a company to attract some of the best pricing and some of the lowest well cost. And all that translates into the best capital efficiency, I think, in the basin. So that's our philosophy going forward. I think the other thing you'll see going into '16 is we'll a full year of these price reductions, which will really help our capital efficiency. So I don't know that -- we'll probably still see some decreases here and there, but the fact that we'll be able to apply what we've seen thus far to a full year is really what's going to help us next year, plus the fact that we have a bigger inventory. We got better contracts. We got Mariner East up and running. We got Spectra's Uniontown to Gas City. We got Rover and the Gulf expansion coming on late next year. All of those things that we've been talking about on the call are really going to help set '16 up very, very well."

The good news for Range is that we have 2 significant marketing events that are projected to commence in the second half of the year, which are Spectra's Uniontown to Gas City project and Mariner East I.

In essence, this gives us a portfolio within our portfolio.

It will come as no surprise anyone on this call, when I say that the third quarter was difficult. In the commodity business you go through the cycle. Those of us who have how seen a few of these cycles recall what they feel like, difficult decisions that must be made, but ultimately the companies with the right assets and strategy will emerge for it. And Range team has navigated these cycles before, and has the company that consistently create value for its shareholders over time. You've all heard these tenants before, but they bare repeating when we get distracted by minute-by-minute price updates. We believe value is created year-after-year, by having a large position in the of low cost play, a great team that consistently and faithfully executes the business plan and a strong simple balance sheet. 
Going a little deeper in each of these points. First, Range has the largest position in the lowest cost play in North America. There is also a tremendous additional potential upside in form of the Utica, down-spacing in the Marcellus, the Upper Devonian, extending laterals and having size and scale. This resource has been captured and is largely held by production, which allows Range to be disciplined in its activity levels. 
Second, the team that consistently executes. For over a decade, the Range team has grown production at almost a 20% compound annual growth rate. This was accomplished despite periods of declining prices and high service cost. This team pioneered the Marcellus and helped bring technical innovations into the mainstream, for example, water recycling and reduced cost per spacing. 
Marketing has been another area of solid execution with the history of first, including our first in obtaining takeaway capacity and the upcoming exports of ethane and propane out of markets I believe, that you'll see more first from Range. 
Third, the balance sheet is the foundation enabled the company to execute its strategy. Range has prudently managed it's balance sheet in a consistent manner from many years. As an operating strategy-driven company, we focus first on rigorous capital allocation that of our shareholders money. That has focused Range on building one of the best drilling inventories in the business. It has also led us to share non-core assets totaling north of $3 billion over the past 10 years. 
Liquidity and financial flexibility are important, and we developed this just as we do our drilling inventory. We are well-positioned with the carefully structured bank credit facility with ample liquidity and a long term debt portfolio with staggered maturities. In addition, we continue to make progress on our non-core asset sales, and we expect to announce one or more asset sales and close them by the end of this year. We will use the proceeds to pay down debt, further strengthening our balance sheet. 
Turning to the third quarter, another 3 months of strong operating performance drove 20% growth in production. Our relentless focus on cost and efficiency yielded a 12% reduction in our unit cost over the prior year quarter. This came against a continued backdrop of weak product prices, which more than offset lower cost. The good news is that 2 other projects, which I mentioned last quarter, should help with fourth quarter pricing netbacks. Spectra's Uniontown to gas city project became fully operational on September 1. This transportation allows us to move about 170 million per day net from local to Appalachian index to Midwest markets. The net effect has increased our netback price by more than a dollar on this volume, and we expect to see a continued uplift of $0.75 to a $1 for the fourth quarter. The other project I mentioned in our last orderly called was Mariner East I. Our understanding is that Mariner East I will be fully operational by the end of this year. When operational, this project should result in a significant uplift on our ethane and propane pricing netbacks. We are the only producer of that has capacity on this project and we have 40,000 barrels per day comprised of half ethane and half propane. We expect a $90 million uplift in our net cash flow on an annualized basis when combining the net effects from Mariner East, Mariner West and ATEX. 
For 2016, we have projected bookings for capital spending of $550 million to $890 million. Both cases give us good growth within our near cash flow depending on the price forecast used. We believe that if you look at the capital we're spending in 2015 for the growth we're achieving, we have the most capital efficient growth on a corporate basis versus any of our peers in the Appalachian or in any other basin. We believe in 2016, our capital efficiency will also be at or near the top of the peers. I'll now turn the call over to Ray."

During the first three quarters of this year, we've demonstrated capital discipline, we've increased operational efficiency, we further lowered our cost structure and continue to meet our production targets while staying within our $870 mill",1673,"Thanks, Jeff. During the first three quarters of this year, we've demonstrated capital discipline, we've increased operational efficiency, we further lowered our cost structure and continue to meet our production targets while staying within our $870 million capital budget. Third quarter production was better-than-expected at 1.445 Bcf equivalent per day, again largely driven by improved performance in the dry gas area of Southwest Pennsylvania, and we're still on track to deliver approximately 20% year-over-year production growth. Our Marcellus growth is forecasted to be ready 26% year-over-year. With our reduced capital spending in the fourth quarter and Mariner East starting up lighter than originally planned, our fourth quarter production is expected to average about 1.42 Bcf equivalent per day. Our latest communications with Sonoco indicate that the Mariner East startup should occur in the next month with 4 commercial operations for propane and ethane by the end of the year. Thinking ahead about the bookings for next year's plan, we expect that our production growth profile in 2016 to be consistent with previous years, importantly, our 2016 exit rate being higher than this year's exit rate, again setting is up for growth in 2017. 
Our cost metrics are consistently improving on both on absolutely and on a per unit basis. Corporate LOE per mcfe for the quarter was down 21% as compared to last year and G&A per Mcfe is down 26%. We've made additional progress in operating efficiencies and reducing capital cost. I'll start with some highlights from Southwest Pennsylvania where more of oru capital is being invested. To give you an idea of just how much progress we've made in drilling cost for the last 2 months, August and September, our average lateral has increased by 38% over the average for 2014. Despite drilling 38% longer laterals, our drilling cost per barrel has actually declined by 10%. We recently finished to file well pad at 45% less cost per foot as compared to 2014. This was all accomplished by a combination of service cost reductions, the application of improved drilling technology and improved drilling efficiencies. 
On the completion side, we've achieved a 44% increase and frac stages per day as compared to last year. Three recent pads totaling 427 frac stages achieved an average between 8 and 10 stages per day. Combined with service cost reductions, we've seen completion cost drop by more than 34% compared to this time last year. We believe that these efficiencies can continue to improve going forward. We also believe that this is not the case for everyone. This is a distinct advantage for Range on two fronts, both the capital efficiency side and the operational side. Today, we have some of the best recoveries for lateral combined with one of the lowest total well cost per foot for lateral, generating some of the best economics in the basin. Of course, this is largely driven by our team and our large scale stack pay and high-quality acreage position in Southwest Pennsylvania. One of the most important factors in improving capital efficiencies, is drilling longer laterals. Our average lateral length this year is about 6,000 feet and we expect to see closer to 7,000 feet next year, and still growing longer after that. Most of our competitors in the basin are already drilling long lateral and will not see the same gains and efficiency going forward. Therefore, we seeing an advantage with our capital efficiency increasing steadily in the future as we go forward with longer and longer lateral. The other distinct advantage is our operating efficiency. For example, we know that we frac more stages per day and have less downtime on our completion than any operator in the basin. Service providers know this and benefit with better utilization rates on one of our locations. This generates a win-win situation for both us and the service company, resulting in Range receiving some of the best pricing in the basin, while the service companies maintain their margins. Importantly, we're also continuing to see outstanding well performance. Recently, we brought online a new well pad in the dry area of Southwest Pennsylvania. The wells are producing under constrained conditions into a high-pressure system with an average, initial sales rate per well off 26 million a day. The 5 wells averaged 8200 foot laterals with 42 stages. I also want to emphasize that the total well cost, including facilities, was less than $900 per foot. Now that we have more production history, I would also like to update you on the 5 well pad in the wet area that we reported on earlier this year. The average initial sales rate of the 5 wells was 18 million cubic feet equivalent per day under constrained conditions and had a 120-day average of $8.5 million a day. The average EUR per thousand foot for the 5 wells on the pad is 4 Bcf equivalent per thousand foot, and those wells averaged 5700-foot laterals completed with 30 stages. The total well cost for these wells including facilities, was less than $1,000 per foot, again, emphasizing class leading cost with 4 Bcfe per 1000-foot, which was one of the best recoveries in the entire basin. Again, the rock rules. Both our dry and liquids-rich wells in Marcellus and Southwest Pennsylvania continue to deliver outstanding results and are real testament to our operations and technical teams. As we continue to drill longer laterals, we expect to see even better performance. Our first 2 Utica wells in Washington County, Pennsylvania are now producing into the new dry gas pipeline. And we're currently drilling the third well on a nearby pad expected to complete that well early next year. Our modeling for the first well, which is based on extensive reservoir measurements and production history, puts the EUR in the range of 15 Bcf from a 5400-foot lateral with 32 stages. On a normalized basis, that's approximately 2.8 Bcf per thousand foot of lateral and is in the top tier of Utica wells to date. Again, looking at all the production data from across the entire Utica play, our first well appears to be in the top 10 performers on both an absolute and a per thousand foot basis, and the second well is better. 
Remember, the first two wells are apposing laterals off the same pad, but the completions were different. The first level is completed with 400,000 pounds of per stage or approximately 24,000 pounds per foot; and the second well was completed with 500,000 pounds per stage or a little over 3,000 pounds per foot. Both wells incorporated sand 30 50 propping, and were similar in pressure as you would expect being direct apposing On the second well, we also utilized a choke management program designed to manage the near well drawdown. The second well is currently to sales at approximately $13 million a day. It's been in line of very short time, but early indications suggest, it we will be better than the first. It was of 5,200 foot lateral, also completed with 32 stages. As we evaluate these two wells and continue to develop our modeling, we will let the data and the modeling guide us and optimize in the completion design for our third well. The third well is for a total completed well cost of $15.9 million for 6500-foot lateral. This includes facilities, diagnostics, additional science and new technology -- technology namely managed pressured drilling equipment, allowing us to keep drilling under the large pressures slings that have been seen by us and others in Southwest Pennsylvania. We believe as time goes on and we get more of these wells under our belt, that we'll see between 20% and 30% reduction in total well cost resulting from technology advancements and operational efficiencies combined with improving well performance. We have 400,000 net acres of what we believe is dry Utica. Early well drilled by us and our offset competitors in Southwest Pennsylvania are promising and certainly helped to up and the Range acreage position. But those 5-or-so wells have only limited production history today. We plan to gather data from the offset activity combined with our wells, and while we focus on the Marcellus in the near term, just like the super-rich, wet and dry Marcellus and Upper Devonian, our Utica play could be another complementary large-scale and low-risk option in our portfolio with good economics for dry gas growth. Activity in Northeast Pennsylvania and in our mid-continent divisions slowed dramatically in the third quarter and today, both areas have finished their capital spend for the year. For our team, which now operates both areas has done an excellent job of lowering cost and focusing on optimizing production and revenue. 
Our Southern Appalachian team in Nora is also finished for the year with it's capital spending. They continue to bring online some of the best methane wells we've seen in years. That over the past 30 years, 4 of the top 5 wells are the new design and 11 of the top 30 wells are wells that we've drilled and completed since taking over full operational control over the properties in 2014. Utilizing a new and larger size frac technique, the wells are 75% better than their average offsets with significantly better economics. And again, this area has some of the best gas pricing in the Eastern U.S., it's large scale, low-risk and has very low 
In protection, regulatory compliance and safety and having positive relationships in the communities where we live and work remain top priorities in our operations. The Southwest Pennsylvania, we had no reportable spills in the third quarter and we'll work hard to repeat that success going forward. and management commitment to safety has resulted in Range having only 1 reportable injury thus far in 2015, and 0 hours of lost time in the last 21 months. We are really proud of all our operating teams for working safety, protecting the environment and being good in the communities where we live and work. Now over to Roger."

Financially, the third quarter of 2015 was much like the second quarter with significantly lower realized prices across all commodities set against significantly lower cost and consistent capital efficient growth. Year-over-year production",559,"Thank you, Ray. Financially, the third quarter of 2015 was much like the second quarter with significantly lower realized prices across all commodities set against significantly lower cost and consistent capital efficient growth. Year-over-year production growth for the quarter was 20%, and all-in realized prices were down by 36% from the third quarter of last year. We continue to improve our already low cost structure by reducing cash unit cost by $0.23 for last year, a 12% decrease. All of our individual unit cost categories were at or below guidance, with another quarter of most expense categories coming in below last year on an absolute dollar basis as well. Fourth quarter line item expense guidance may be found in the third quarter earnings press release. Revenue from natural gas, oil and NGL sales including cash settled derivatives was $390 million for the third quarter, a $7 million increase from the second quarter of this year, but $73 million below last year's third quarter.  EBITDAX for the third quarter was $209 million and [Audio Gap] cash flow was $169 million or $1.01 per fully diluted share. Year-to-date third quarter EBITDAX was $656 million and year-to-date cash flow totals $536 million. Net loss on a GAAP basis for the third quarter was $301 million, driven primarily by $502 million of pretax property impairments with some of our legacy areas in Northwest Pennsylvania and oil properties in Northern Oklahoma. The properties impaired are non-core assets. Year-to-date, less than 3% of total company production came from these impaired assets. Non-GAAP earnings reflecting common methodology, which removes many noncash and nonrecurring items was $5.5 million or $0.03 per fully diluted share. Both non-GAAP earnings and cash per share for the quarter were higher than the second quarter and above consensus. NYMEX strip oil prices were 16.5% lower at September 30 than June 30, and strip gas prices were 10% lower. The fact that revenue, cash flow, EBITDAX and adjusted revenues were all higher in the third quarter this year than second quarter, speaks to responsiveness of the company to the current industry environment through continued cost cuttings and capital-efficient growth. 
Turning to the balance sheet, this most significant improvement completed during the quarter was the redemption of our old 6-3/4% notes. Listeners may recall that we issued $750 million of 4-7/8% notes during the second quarter, effectively replacing our 6-3/4% notes, which are not callable until the third quarter. Having used the bank credit facility to bridge the two transactions, we redeemed the 6-3/4 notes in August using the bank credit facility. The refinancing reduces our corporate weighted average bond interest rates by 42 basis points, generating just under $11 million of annual interest expenses savings. Also, the redemption of our 6-3/4 notes replaces our earliest bond maturity in the year 2021. We remain well hedged in 2016 with the floor gas price of $3.42 mcf on over half are anticipated in 2016 gas production. Hedging activity during the third quarter, summarized in the earnings release in Range website, consisted of several new oil hedges and some natural gas basis swaps. All in all, a challenging but solid quarter, with higher revenue, production, cash flow and lower cost sequentially from the second quarter. In the fourth quarter we look forward to continue year-over-year growth, cost focus and balance sheet improvement. Jeff, over to you."

If you look on our website on Slide 11, it lays out the economics for the Marcellus. And the good news for us is, our wells, we have rights, so we hold everything basically, the Marcellus, the Utica, and Upper Devonian and every horizon up and down the well bore. So what we know is, we're encouraged by our first and second Utica wells and wells in and around this. And we think, just like we've been saying for a long time, that the dry core -- the best part of the dry core of the Utica, we believe will be down in Southwest Pennsylvania, and we hold a big chunk of it, a few other operators do too. But the good part for us, is its stagged on top. It's right below the Marcellus. So we're encouraged by the Utica. We drilled our two wells. As Ray said, we're drilling the third and we will complete it next year. When you look at our plan for next year, our focus is going to be really on the Marcellus. We think with those 3 wells coupled with the activity in and around us, it will give us a really good handle on what the Utica ultimately is, and we're by what it could be. But what we know is, we have 10 years worth of production history and thousands of wells that really our position. So that's the low risk piece. And again on Slide 16, when you look at our Marcellus wells right now, the EUR per thousand foot average for this year, 2.5 to 3, and Ray said are better pad is high as 4 Bcf per 1,000 foot. Coupled with cost that range down there, you're looking at about $9,00,000 to a $1 million per thousand foot. Or maybe said a little more simply, our Marcellus wells down there are basically 17 or almost 18 Bcf wells that cost roughly $6 million. So we view it as complementary development. We're going -- we can speak for Range, we're going to put our capital where we're getting the most -- the best returns and the best capital efficiency coupled with the lower lowest risk. So we're excited and by what the Utica could be, but in short run, you're going to see our focus be totally on the Marcellus. And we think that our wells and the other wells that will be drilled in and around us, that will help delineate our Utica position, but we won't be spending a lot of dollars on We will put them into strong Return Marcellus Wells that we have. Kind of a long winded answer, but hopefully that addressed your question."

What our prices are going to be and how much you are going to spend. And on the lower end of the bookings, you're really not overspending at all if not understanding. So in that case, like I said, the EBITDAX is up third quarter versus second. So if your EBITDAX is increasing, you're not overspending, then your leverage is improving even without any asset sales. So when I look at the balance sheet, I don't lose any sleep over the balance sheet. It's in great shape. As I mentioned, our earliest debt maturities in 2021, we've got billions of liquidity. Our interest coverage for the third quarter 6.1x. So very pleased with the balance sheet. And again, you're not taking my word for it, both the rating agencies just ratified in the last 2 weeks, Range's credit ratings that's not the case for many other companies out there. And you look at where our bonds trade, very tight spread to treasuries. Our 2025 are trading below 400, that's kind of investment-grade land. So couldn't be happier with our current balance sheet and looking forward to managing that leverage as we go forward."

And that's the combination of new projects starting up for us that result in better netbacks and pricing on the natural gas side as well as seasonality. Coupled with that, we think with Mariner East fully up and running, those real low propane are quarters that we had, we probably seen the low there as well with Mariner East enabling 1 lower transportation cost, and therefore better netbacks. But also the opportunity potentially for better pricing by having the optionality of either selling in the Northeast markets when they better being able to export in a much more efficient way."

There is only in Southwest Pennsylvania about 5-or-so wells that have any history at all. I think, ours is clearly our first well about 9 months now. The wells after that, I think about the longest well after that, is maybe getting close to 90 days. And then after that, well some of them haven't really even been to sales yet. And so this is really, really early on. But we feel pretty confident in our well. We've got 9 months of production history. We've built some very extensive reservoir modeling. They have 3D, information in the reservoir. They have 3D modeling of the fracs that we performed on the well. We've done a lot of research and diagnostic. When we look across the entire play including the in Ohio, it's one of the top 10 wells as it stands today on an absolute basis and on a per thousand foot basis. So we're really pleased with it. And all we can say today is, first well has about 60 days. And clearly, is way too early to start talking about second well, I'm sorry, may have said the first well. The first well has about 9 months, second well has about 60 days. And clearly, it's too early to talk about an EUR for it. But we can say with some confidence that it is better than the first well. So clearly, we're really pleased with our first two wells. The offset wells, I have talked great wells, there is no question about it. But I think they are really, really, early. And we're going to -- I think this play is going to need some more time. Our third well will complete sometime early next year. And look at that. But this was a different kind of play. It's a that we're really targeting. It's a It's not a shale. It clearly the fault and the fracturing networks play a role in this. So I think there's a lot yet to be determining about how this play develops. And while it looks very promising to us and we're exciting that it can be a very complementary play, and something that we can do. It's number level we can push going down the road if we want to build some dry gas growth. But like Jeff said earlier, I think at this point, we're going to sit back, we're going to watch these 3 wells. We are going to watch the offset activities that's around us, because the other important thing, I didn't mention about the 5 wells in Pennsylvania, theyy basically ring our acres. They outline our positions, which is really great. So we're going to sit back and watch all of that. And then I think as we go into 2017, I think we'll have much better idea how we see that development plan going forward."

If you look at our map on Page 15 in the presentation, and we've got some maps further back in the presentation. And if you look at gas in place, these maps are about there for some time. There is a lot of penetration. There is a lot of offset activity. There's, of course, tons and hundreds and hundreds of wells. in the Ohio that have all gone together to put this map. And I think it's pretty consistent against through all of our peers in Southwest PA and in Ohio, that everybody agrees with the map. About the best gas and plays numbers that you see around the 100 Bcf. Now there might be some isolated areas that are closer to 150 Bcf per square mile. If you look at the Marcellus, it's about the same if not higher in some case. So I think it is what it is. Rock rules. I don't know that being a versus the shale would have any bearing on how much gas in place it has, is going to be more things like total organic carbon content, not and pressure plays a big role, and overburden stresses and determine how it drills and all those things play big, big roles in on how these wells produce and how they basically develop going forward. So I think the Point Pleasant, which is what we're all targeting, is a carbonate, it's not a shale. And the shales, you tend to have some component of gas from that are present there. Clearly, there may be a little bit of that in the Point Pleasant, but we're way, way dearly, we clearly don't understand it. It does in the Point Pleasant. That this data comes from Core Lab consortiums that we are all participating in, where we donate and then we all share in the analysis and the data, that the Point Pleasant does have some pressured depended perm challenges. So that's why you're hearing about choke management program and the managing near well bore pressure drawdowns and so forth. And I think every operator is handling that a little bit different. But I think as time goes on, we're all zero in on what the best way to approach that is and go forward. But I think you still cant get past what mother nature put there. And in fact the rock rules, and what we all know at this point is, the Bcf per square model is what it is. And I think how you go about getting that out is going to be the key going forward."

It will come as no surprise to anyone on this call when I say that the third quarter was difficult. In a commodity business, you go through cycles. Those of us who have seen a few of these cycles recall what they feel like, the difficult decisions that must be made. But ultimately, the companies with the right assets and strategy will emerge better for it. 
The Range team has navigated these cycles before and has designed the company to consistently create value for its shareholders over time. You've all heard these tenets before, but they bear repeating when we get distracted by minute-by-minute price updates. We believe value is created year-after-year by having a large position in the core of low-cost play, a great team that consistently and faithfully executes the business plan and a strong simple balance sheet. 
Going a little deeper into each of these points. First, Range has the largest position in the lowest cost play in North America. There's also a tremendous additional potential upside in form of the Utica, down-spacing in the Marcellus, the Upper Devonian, extending laterals and having size and scale. This resource has been captured and is largely held by production, which allows Range to be disciplined in its activity levels. 
Second, a team that consistently executes. For over a decade, the Range team has grown production at almost a 20% compounded annual growth rate. This was accomplished despite periods of declining prices and high service costs. This team pioneered the Marcellus and helped bring technical innovations into the mainstream, for example, water recycling and reduced cluster spacing. Marketing has been another area of solid execution with the history of firsts, including our first in obtaining takeaway capacity and the upcoming exports of ethane and propane out of market [indiscernible]. I believe that you'll see more firsts from Range. 
Third, the balance sheet as the foundation, enable the company to execute its strategy. Range has prudently managed its balance sheet in a consistent manner for many years. As an operating strategy-driven company, we focus first on rigorous capital allocation to be good storage of our shareholders' money. That has focused Range on building one of the best drilling inventories in the business. It has also led us to shed noncore assets totaling north of $3 billion over the last 10 years. 
Liquidity and financial flexibility are important, and we developed this just as we do our drilling inventory. We are well positioned with a carefully structured bank credit facility with ample liquidity and a long-term debt portfolio with staggered maturities. In addition, we continue to make progress on our noncore asset sales, and we expect to announce one or more asset sales and close them by the end of this year. We will use the proceeds to pay down debt, further strengthening our balance sheet. 
Turning to the third quarter. Another 3 months of strong operating performance drove 20% growth in production. Our relentless focus on cost and efficiency yielded a 12% reduction in our unit cost over the prior year quarter. This came against a continued backdrop of weak product prices, which more than offset lower costs. The good news is that 2 other projects, which I mentioned last quarter, should help with fourth quarter pricing netbacks. 
Spectra's Uniontown to Gas City project became fully operational on September 1. This transportation allows us to move about 170 million per day net from local and to Appalachian index to Midwest markets. The net effect is it has increased our netback price by more than $1 on this volume, and we expect that we'll see a continued uplift of $0.75 to $1 for the fourth quarter. 
The other project I mentioned during our last quarter call was Mariner East I. Our understanding is that Mariner East I will be fully operational by the end of this year. When operational, this project should result in a significant uplift on our ethane and propane pricing netbacks. We are the only producer that has capacity on this project, and we have 40,000 barrels per day comprised of half ethane and half propane. We expect a $90 million uplift in our net cash flow on an annualized basis when combining the net effects from Mariner East, Mariner West and ATEX. 
For 2016, we have projected book ends for capital spending of $550 million to $890 million. Both cases give us good growth within or near cash flow, depending on the price forecast used. We believe that if you look at the capital we're spending in 2015 for the growth we're achieving, we have the most capital-efficient growth on a corporate basis versus any of our peers in the Appalachian or in any other basin. We believe in 2016, our capital efficiency will also be at or near the top of the peers. 
I'll now turn the call over to Ray."

During the first 3 quarters of this year, we've demonstrated capital discipline, we've increased operational efficiency, we further lowered our cost structure and continued to meet our production targets while staying within our $870 million",1699,"Thanks, Jeff. During the first 3 quarters of this year, we've demonstrated capital discipline, we've increased operational efficiency, we further lowered our cost structure and continued to meet our production targets while staying within our $870 million capital budget. 
Third quarter production was better-than-expected at 1.445 Bcf equivalent per day, again largely driven by improved performance in the dry gas area at Southwest Pennsylvania, and we're still on track to deliver approximately 20% year-over-year production growth. Our Marcellus growth is forecasted to be 26% year-over-year. With our reduced capital spending in the fourth quarter and Mariner East starting up lighter than originally planned, our fourth quarter production is expected to average about 1.42 Bcf equivalent per day. 
Our latest communications with Sonoco indicate that the Mariner East startup should occur in the next month with full commercial operations for propane and ethane by the end of the year. Thinking ahead about the book ends for next year's plan, we expect that our production growth profile in 2016 to be consistent with previous years, importantly, our 2016 exit rate being higher than this year's exit rate, again setting us up for growth in 2017. 
Our cost metrics are consistently improving on both an absolutely and on a per-unit basis. Corporate LOE per Mcfe for the quarter was down 21% as compared to last year, and G&A per Mcfe is down 26%. We've made additional progress in operating efficiencies and reducing capital cost. 
I'll start with some highlights from Southwest Pennsylvania, where more of our capital is being invested. To give you an idea of just how much progress we've made in drilling cost, for the last 2 months, August and September, our average lateral length has increased by 38% over the average for 2014. Despite drilling 38% longer laterals, our drilling cost per well have actually declined by 10%. We recently finished a 5-well pad at 45% less cost per foot as compared to 2014. This was all accomplished by a combination of service cost reductions, the application of improved drilling technology and improved drilling efficiencies. On the completion side, we've achieved a 44% increase in frac stages per day as compared to last year. Three recent pads totaling 427 frac stages achieved an average between 8 and 10 stages per day. Combined with service cost reductions, we've seen completion cost drop by more than 34% compared to this time last year. 
We believe that these efficiencies can continue to improve going forward. We also believe that this is not the case for everyone. It's a distinct advantage for Range on 2 fronts, both on the capital efficiency side and the operational side. Today, we have some of the best recoveries per foot of lateral, combined with one of the lowest total well cost per foot of lateral, generating some of the best economics in the basin. Of course, this is largely driven by our team and our large-scale stacked pay and high-quality acreage position in Southwest Pennsylvania. 
One of the most important factors in improving capital efficiency is drilling longer laterals. Our average lateral length this year is about 6,000 feet, and we expect to see it closer to 7,000 feet next year and still growing longer after that. Most of our competitors in the basin are already drilling long laterals and will not see the same gains and efficiency going forward. Therefore, we see an advantage with our capital efficiency increasing steadily in the future as we go forward with longer and longer laterals.
The other distinct advantage is our operating efficiency. For example, we know that we frac more stages per day and have less downtime on our completions than any operator in the basin. Service providers know this and benefit with better utilization rates when they're on one of our locations. This generates a win-win situation for both us and the service company, resulting in Range receiving some of the best pricing in the basin while the service companies maintain their margins. 
Importantly, we're also continuing to see outstanding well performance. Recently, we brought online a new 5-well pad in the dry area of Southwest Pennsylvania. The wells are producing under constrained conditions into a high-pressure gathering system with an average initial sales rate per well of over 26 million a day. The 5 wells averaged 8,200 foot laterals with 42 stages. I also want to emphasize that the total well cost, including facilities, was less than $900 per foot. 
Now that we have more production history, I would also like to update you on the 5-well pad in the wet area that we reported on earlier this year. The average initial sales rate of the 5 wells was 18 million cubic feet equivalent per day under constrained conditions and had a 120-day average of 8.5 million a day. The average EUR per thousand foot for the 5 wells on the pad is 4 Bcf equivalent per thousand foot, and those wells averaged 5,700 foot laterals completed with 30 stages. The total well cost for these wells including facilities was less than $1,000 per foot, again, emphasizing class-leading cost with 4 Bcfe per 1,000-foot, which is one of the best recoveries in the entire basin. 
Again, the rock rules. Both our dry and liquids-rich wells in the Marcellus and Southwest Pennsylvania continue to deliver outstanding results and are a real testament to our operations and technical teams. As we continue to drill longer laterals, we expect to see even better performance. 
Our first 2 Utica wells in Washington County, Pennsylvania are now producing into the new dry gas pipeline, and we're currently drilling the third well on a nearby pad, expected to complete that well early next year. Our reservoir modeling for the first well, which is based on extensive reservoir measurements and production history, puts the EUR in the range of 15 Bcf from a 5,400-foot lateral with 32 stages. On a normalized basis, that's approximately 2.8 Bcf per thousand foot of lateral and is in the top tier of Utica wells to date. Again, looking at all the production data from across the entire Utica play, our first well appears to be in the top 10 performers on both an absolute and a per-thousand-foot basis, and the second well is better. 
Remember, the first two wells are opposing laterals off the same pad, but the completions were different. The first well was completed with 400,000 pounds of proppant per stage or approximately 24,000 pounds per foot, and the second well was completed with 500,000 pounds per stage or a little over 3,000 pounds per foot. Both wells incorporated 100 mesh sand and 30/50 ceramic proppant and were similar in reservoir pressure as you would expect being direct opposing offsets. 
On the second well, we also utilized a choke management program designed to manage the near-wellbore drawdown. The second well is currently flowing to sales at approximately 13 million a day. It's been online a very short time, but early indications suggest it we will be better than the first. It was a 5,200 foot lateral, also completed with 32 stages. 
As we evaluate these two wells and continue to develop our reservoir modeling, we will let the data and the modeling guide us in optimizing the completion design for our third well. The third well is a FEED for a total completed well cost of $15.9 million for a 6,500-foot lateral. This includes facilities, diagnostics, additional science and new technology, technology namely managed pressured drilling equipment, allowing us to keep drilling under the large pressures slings that have been seen by us and others in Southwest Pennsylvania. We believe as time goes on and we get more of these wells under our belt, that we'll see between 20% and 30% reductions in total well cost resulting from technology advancements and operational efficiencies, combined with improving well performance. 
We have 400,000 net acres of what we believe is core dry Utica. Early wells drilled by us and our offset competitors in Southwest Pennsylvania are promising and certainly helped to prove up and delineate the Range acreage position, but those 5-or-so wells have only limited production history today. We plan to gather data from the offset activity, combined with our wells, and while we focus on the Marcellus in the near term, just like the super-rich, wet and dry Marcellus and Upper Devonian, our Utica play could be another complementary large-scale and low-risk option in our portfolio with good economics for dry gas growth. 
Activity in Northeast Pennsylvania and in our Midcontinent division slowed dramatically in the third quarter, and today, both areas have finished their capital spend for the year. For our team, which now operates both areas, has done an excellent job of lowering cost and focusing on optimizing production and revenue. 
Our Southern Appalachian team in Nora is also finished for the year with its capital spending. They're continuing to bring online some of the best coal-bed methane wells we've seen in years. In fact, over the past 30 years, 4 of the top 5 wells are the new design and 11 of the top 30 wells are wells that we have drilled and completed since taking over full operational control of the properties in 2014. Utilizing a new high-rate and larger-size frac technique, the recent CBM wells are 75% better than their average offsets with significantly better economics. And again, this area has some of the best gas pricing in the Eastern U.S. It's large scale, low risk and has very low declines.
Environmental protection, regulatory compliance, employee safety and having positive relationships in the communities where we live and work remain top priorities in our operations. In Southwest Pennsylvania, we had no reportable spills in the third quarter, and we'll work hard to repeat that success going forward. Employee and management commitment to safety has resulted in Range having only one OSHA recordable injury thus far in 2015 and 0 hours of lost time in the last 21 months. We are really proud of all of our operating teams for working safely, protecting the environment and being good stewards in the communities where we live and work. 
Now over to Roger."

Financially, the third quarter of 2015 was much like the second quarter with significantly lower realized prices across all commodities set against significantly lower cost and consistent capital efficient growth. Year-over-year production",568,"Thank you, Ray. Financially, the third quarter of 2015 was much like the second quarter with significantly lower realized prices across all commodities set against significantly lower cost and consistent capital efficient growth. Year-over-year production growth for the quarter was 20%, and all-in realized prices were down by 36% from the third quarter of last year. 
We continue to improve our already low cost structure by reducing cash unit cost by $0.23 from last year, a 12% decrease. All of our individual unit cost categories were at or below guidance with another quarter of most expense categories coming in below last year on an absolute dollar basis as well. Fourth quarter line item expense guidance may be found in the third quarter earnings press release. 
Revenue from natural gas, oil and NGL sales, including cash-settled derivatives, was $390 million for the third quarter, a $7 million increase from the second quarter of this year, but $73 million below last year's third quarter. EBITDAX for the third quarter was $209 million, and third quarter cash flow was $169 million or $1.01 per fully diluted share. Year-to-date third quarter EBITDAX was $656 million, and year-to-date cash flow totals $536 million. 
Net loss on a GAAP basis for the third quarter was $301 million, driven primarily by $502 million of pretax proved property impairments from some of our legacy shallow gas areas in Northwest Pennsylvania and oil properties in Northern Oklahoma. The properties impaired are noncore assets. Year-to-date, less than 3% of total company production came from these impaired assets. 
Non-GAAP earnings, reflected in common analyst methodology, which removes many noncash and nonrecurring items, was $5.5 million or $0.03 per fully diluted share. Both non-GAAP earnings and cash flow per share for the quarter were higher than the second quarter and above analyst consensus. 
NYMEX strip oil prices were 16.5% lower at September 30 than June 30 as strip gas prices were 10% lower. The fact that revenue, cash flow, EBITDAX and adjusted earnings were all higher in the third quarter this year than the second quarter speaks to the responsiveness of the company to the current industry environment through continued cost cutting and capital-efficient growth. 
Turning to the balance sheet. The most significant improvement completed during the third quarter was the redemption of our old 6¾% notes. Listeners may recall that we issued $750 million of 4 7/8% notes during the second quarter, effectively replacing our 6¾% notes, which were not callable until the third quarter. Having used the bank credit facility to bridge the 2 transactions, we redeemed the 6¾% notes in August using the bank credit facility. The refinancing reduces our corporate weighted average bond interest rate by 42 basis points, generating just under $11 million of annual interest expenses savings. Also, the redemption of our 6¾% notes places our earliest bond maturity in the year 2021. 
We remain well hedged in 2016 with floor gas price of $3.42 of Mcf on over half our anticipated 2016 gas production. Hedging activity during the third quarter, summarized in the earnings release in Range website, consisted of several new oil hedges and some natural gas basis swaps. 
All in all, a challenging but solid quarter with higher revenue, production, cash flow and lower cost sequentially from the second quarter. In the fourth quarter, we look forward to continued year-over-year growth, cost focus and balance sheet improvement.

If you look on our website on Slide 11, it lays out the economics for the Marcellus. And the good news for us is, our wells, we have all depth rights so we hold everything, basically, the Marcellus, the Utica, and Upper Devonian and every horizon up and down the wellbore. So what we know is we're encouraged by our first and second Utica wells and the wells in and around this, and we think, just like we've been saying for a long time, that the dry core -- the best part of the dry core of the Utica, we believe, will be down in Southwest Pennsylvania. And there's -- we hold a big chunk of it. A few other operators do too. But the good part for us is it's stacked on top. It's right below the Marcellus. So we're encouraged by the Utica. We drilled our 2 wells. As Ray said, we're drilling the third and we'll complete it next year. When you look at our plan for next year, our focus is going to be really on the Marcellus. We think with those 3 wells, coupled with the activity in and around us, it'll give us a really good handle on what the Utica ultimately is, and we're encouraged by what it could be. But what we know is we have 10 years' worth of production history and thousands of wells that delineate, really, our position. So that's the low risk piece. And again, on Slide 16, when you look at our Marcellus wells right now, the EURs per thousand foot average for this year, 2.5 to 3, and Ray said our better pad is as high as 4 Bcf per 1,000 foot. Coupled with costs that range down there, you're looking at about $900,000 to a $1 million per thousand foot or to maybe said a little more simply, our Marcellus wells down there are basically 17, almost 18 Bcf wells that cost roughly $6 million. So we view it as complementary development. We're going -- we can speak for Range. We're going to put our capital where we're getting the most -- the best returns and the best capital efficiency, coupled with the lowest risk. So we're excited and encouraged by what the Utica could be. But in the short run, you're going to see our focus be totally on the Marcellus. And we think with our wells and the other wells that'll be drilled in and around us, that'll help delineate our Utica position, but we won't be spending a lot of dollars on science. We will put them into the strong-return Marcellus wells that we have. Kind of a long-winded answer, but Matt, hopefully, that addressed your question."

We may drop an air rig or something like that, but we have -- we literally watched that to the $0.01 today. So we're absolutely confident that we'll end up there. And I think what they've laid down in the press release is exactly what we're going to bring online. And that plan has been in place literally from the first and second quarter of the year. We went into it knowing that that's how it would turn out. And again, production -- yes, let me add more thing. And again, our production profile, we don't expect to be -- going forward from -- starting next year, we expect the growth profile in 2016, wherever we end up in the book ends, will be pretty consistent with quarter-over-quarter growth, just like we've seen in previous years. So we don't feel like we're sacrificing anything, and the first quarter is going to be big. I think there's going to be -- you're going to see us add a couple of more frac crews in the first quarter, probably pick up a rig, all those things that we do every year when we start out a brand-new budget year."

So -- and I look at the balance sheet, I don't lose any sleep over the balance sheet. It's in great shape. As I mentioned, our earliest debt maturity is in 2021. We've got billions in liquidity. Our interest coverage for third quarter, 6.1x, so very pleased with the balance sheet. And again, you're not taking my word for it. Both the rating agencies just ratified in the last 2 weeks Range's credit rating. That's not the case for many other companies out there.

Coupled with that, we think with Mariner East being fully up and running, those real low propane, our quarters that we had, we've probably seen the low there as well with Mariner East enabling, one, lower transportation cost and, therefore, better netbacks, but also the opportunity potentially for better pricing by having the optionality of either selling in the Northeast markets when they're good or being able to export in a much more efficient way."

There's only in Southwest Pennsylvania about 5-or-so wells that have any history at all. I think ours is -- clearly, our first well is about 9 months now. The wells after that, I think about the longest well after that is maybe getting close to 90 days. And then after that, most -- some of them haven't really even been to sales yet, and so this is really, really early on. But we feel pretty confident in our well. We've got 9 months of production history. We've built some very extensive reservoir modelings. They have 3D information in the reservoir. They have 3D modeling in the fracs that we performed on the well. We've done a lot of research and diagnostics. When we look across the entire play, including the stuff in Ohio, it's one of the top 10 wells as it stands today on an absolute basis and on a per 1,000-foot basis. So we're really pleased with it. And all we can say today is the first well has about 60 days, and clearly, it's way too early to start talking about the second well. I'm sorry, I may have said the first well. First well has about 9 months. Second well has about 60 days. And clearly, it's too early to talk about an EUR for it. But we can say with some confidence that it is better than the first well. So clearly, we're really pleased with our first 2 wells. The offset wells, hats off to EQT and CNX, great wells. There's no question about it. But I think they're really, really, early. And we're going to -- I think this play is going to need some more time. Our third well will complete sometime early next year and look at that. But this is a different kind of play. It's a Point Pleasant that we're really targeting. It's a carbonate. It's not a shale. It's clearly the faults and the fracture networks play a role in this. So I think there's a lot yet to be determined about how this play develops. And while it looks very promising to us and we're excited that it can be a very complementary play and something that we can do, it's a -- another lever we can push going down the road if we want to build some dry gas growth, but like Jeff said earlier, I think at this point, we're going to sit back, we're going to watch these 3 wells, we're going to watch the offset activities that surround us. Because the other important thing that I didn't mention about the 5 wells in Pennsylvania is they basically ring our acreage there. They outline our positions, which is really great. So we're going to sit back and watch all of that. And then I think as we go into 2017, I think we'll have much better idea how we see that development plan going forward."

Let me start by qualifying that. I'm a frac guy. If you look at our map on Page 15 in the presentation, and we've got some maps further back in the presentation, and you look at gas in plays, these maps have been out there for some time. There's a lot of penetration. There's a lot of offset activity. There's, of course, tons and hundreds and hundreds of wells in Ohio that have all gone together to put this map. And I think it's pretty consistent against through all of our peers in Southwest PA and in Ohio, that everybody agrees with the map. About the best gas and plays numbers that you see around the 100 Bcf, now there might be some isolated areas that are closer to 150 Bcf per square mile. If you look at the Marcellus, it's about the same, if not higher in some case. So I think it is what it is. The rock rules. I don't know that being a carbonate versus a shale would have any bearing on how much gas in place it has. It's going to be more things like total organic carbon content and vitrinite reflectance and permeability and porosity and pressure plays a big role and overburdened stresses and determine how it drills and how it fracs, all those things play big, big roles in how these wells produce and how they basically develop going forward. So I think the Point Pleasant, which is what we're all targeting, is a carbonate. It's not a shale. In the shales, you tend to have some component of desorption of gas from that clays that are present there. Clearly, there may be a little bit of that in the Point Pleasant, but we're way, way early. We clearly don't understand it. It does appear in the Point Pleasant, that this data comes from Core Lab consortiums that we're all participating in, where we donate course and then we all share in the analysis and the data, that the Point Pleasant does have some pressured-dependent perm challenges. So that's why you're hearing about choke management programs and the managing near-wellbore pressure drawdowns and so forth. And I think every operator is handing -- handling that a little bit different. But I think as time goes on, we all zero in on what the best way to approach that is and go forward. But I think you still can't get past what mother nature put there and the fact that the rock rules. And what we all know at this point is the Bcf per square mile, it is what it is. And I think how you go about getting that out is going to be the key going forward."

But ultimately, its a long-term performance of not just 1 well or 2 wells or 10 wells, but across a large dataset that dictates what the economics of the play will be."

Importantly, with our 1.6 million acres of stacked pay potential in the core of the Marcellus, Utica and Upper Devonian, we have the option to drill dry, wet gas or super-rich acreage, since about 9,000 net acres are dry and the rest is split between wet and super-rich. In essence, this gives us a portfolio within a portfolio. Coupling this resource base with our capital discipline and diversified marketing arrangements, which gives us multiple options our competitors do not have, Range is positioned to create value as we move forward into an expected better market that more effectively balances supply, demand and infrastructure capabilities.

It will come as no surprise to anyone on this call when I say that the third quarter was difficult. In a commodity business, you go through cycles.

It will come as no surprise to anyone on this call when I say that the third quarter was difficult. In a commodity business, you go through cycles. Those of us who have seen a few of these cycles recall what they feel like, the difficult decisions that must be made. But ultimately, the companies with the right assets and strategy will emerge better for it. 
The Range team has navigated these cycles before and has designed a company to consistently create value for its shareholders over time. You've all heard these tenets before, but they bear repeating when we get distracted by minute-by-minute price updates. We believe value is created year-after-year by having a large position in the core of low-cost play, a great team that consistently and faithfully executes the business plan and a strong simple balance sheet. 
Going a little deeper into each of these points. First, Range has the largest position in the lowest cost play in North America. There's also a tremendous additional potential upside in form of the Utica, down-spacing in the Marcellus, the Upper Devonian, extending laterals and having size and scale. This resource has been captured and is largely held by production, which allows Range to be disciplined in its activity levels. 
Second, a team that consistently executes. For over a decade, the Range team has grown production at almost a 20% compounded annual growth rate. This was accomplished despite periods of declining prices and high service costs. This team pioneered the Marcellus and helped bring other technical innovations into the mainstream, for example, water recycling and reduced cluster spacing. Marketing has been another area of solid execution with the history of firsts, including our first in obtaining takeaway capacity and the upcoming exports of ethane and propane out of Marcus Hook. I believe that you'll see more firsts from Range. 
Third, the balance sheet is a foundation to enable the company to execute its strategy. Range has prudently managed its balance sheet in a consistent manner for many years. As an operating strategy-driven company, we focus first on rigorous capital allocation to be good storage of our shareholders' money. That has focused Range on building one of the best drilling inventories in the business. It has also led us to shed noncore assets totaling north of $3 billion over the last 10 years. 
Liquidity and financial flexibility are important, and we develop this just as we do our drilling inventory. We are well positioned with a carefully structured bank credit facility with ample liquidity and a long-term debt portfolio with staggered maturities. In addition, we continue to make progress on our noncore asset sales, and we expect to announce one or more asset sales and close them by the end of this year. We will use the proceeds to pay down debt, further strengthening our balance sheet. 
Turning to the third quarter. Another 3 months of strong operating performance drove 20% growth in production. Our relentless focus on cost and efficiency yielded a 12% reduction in our unit cost over the prior year quarter. This came against a continued backdrop of weak product prices, which more than offset lower costs. The good news is that 2 of the projects, which I mentioned last quarter, should help with fourth quarter pricing netbacks. 
Spectra's Uniontown to Gas City project became fully operational on September 1. This transportation allows us to move about 170 million per day net from local to Appalachian index to Midwest markets. The net effect is it has increased our netback price by more than $1 on this volume, and we expect that we'll see a continued uplift of $0.75 to $1 for the fourth quarter. 
The other project I mentioned during our last quarterly call was Mariner East I. Our understanding is that Mariner East I will be fully operational by the end of this year. When operational, this project should result in a significant uplift on our ethane and propane pricing netbacks. We are the only producer that has capacity on this project, and we have 40,000 barrels per day comprised of half ethane and half propane. We expect a $90 million uplift in our net cash flow on an annualized basis when combining the net effects from Mariner East, Mariner West and ATEX. 
For 2016, we have projected book ends for capital spending of $550 million to $890 million. Both cases give us good growth within or near cash flow, depending on the price forecast used. We believe that if you look at the capital we're spending in 2015 for the growth we're achieving, we have the most capital-efficient growth on a corporate basis versus any of our peers in the Appalachian or in any other basin. We believe in 2016, our capital efficiency will also be at or near the top of the peers. 
I'll now turn the call over to Ray."

During the first 3 quarters of this year, we've demonstrated capital discipline, we've increased operational efficiency, we further lowered our cost structure and continued to meet our production targets while staying within our $870 million",1697,"Thanks, Jeff. During the first 3 quarters of this year, we've demonstrated capital discipline, we've increased operational efficiency, we further lowered our cost structure and continued to meet our production targets while staying within our $870 million capital budget. 
Third quarter production was better-than-expected at 1.445 Bcf equivalent per day, again largely driven by improved performance in the dry gas area at Southwest Pennsylvania, and we're still on track to deliver approximately 20% year-over-year production growth. Our Marcellus growth is forecasted to be 26% year-over-year. With our reduced capital spending in the fourth quarter and Mariner East starting up lighter than originally planned, our fourth quarter production is expected to average about 1.42 Bcf equivalent per day. 
Our latest communications with Sonoco indicate that the Mariner East startup should occur in the next month with full commercial operations for propane and ethane by the end of the year. Thinking ahead about the book ends for next year's plan, we expect that our production growth profile in 2016 to be consistent with previous years, importantly, our 2016 exit rate being higher than this year's exit rate, again setting us up for growth in 2017. 
Our cost metrics are consistently improving on both an absolute and on a per-unit basis. Corporate LOE per Mcfe for the quarter was down 21% as compared to last year, and G&A per Mcfe is down 26%. We've made additional progress in operating efficiencies and reducing capital cost. 
I'll start with some highlights from Southwest Pennsylvania, where most of our capital is being invested. To give you an idea of just how much progress we've made in drilling cost, for the last 2 months, August and September, our average lateral length has increased by 38% over the average for 2014. Despite drilling 38% longer laterals, our drilling cost per well have actually declined by 10%. We recently finished a 5-well pad at 45% less cost per foot as compared to 2014. This was all accomplished by a combination of service cost reductions, the application of improved drilling technology and improved drilling efficiencies. On the completion side, we've achieved a 44% increase in frac stages per day as compared to last year. Three recent pads totaling 427 frac stages achieved an average between 8 and 10 stages per day. Combined with service cost reductions, we've seen completion cost drop by more than 34% compared to this time last year. 
We believe that these efficiencies can continue to improve going forward. We also believe that this is not the case for everyone. It's a distinct advantage for Range on 2 fronts, both on the capital efficiency side and the operational side. Today, we have some of the best recoveries per foot of lateral, combined with one of the lowest total well cost per foot of lateral, generating some of the best economics in the basin. Of course, this is largely driven by our team and our large-scale stacked pay and high-quality acreage position in Southwest Pennsylvania. 
One of the most important factors in improving capital efficiency is drilling longer laterals. Our average lateral length this year is about 6,000 feet, and we expect to see it closer to 7,000 feet next year and still growing longer after that. Most of our competitors in the basin are already drilling long laterals and will not see the same gains and efficiency going forward. Therefore, we see an advantage with our capital efficiency increasing steadily in the future as we go forward with longer and longer laterals.
The other distinct advantage is our operating efficiency. For example, we know that we frac more stages per day and have less downtime on our completions than any operator in the basin. Service providers know this and benefit with better utilization rates when they're on one of our locations. This generates a win-win situation for both us and the service company, resulting in Range receiving some of the best pricing in the basin while the service companies maintain their margins. 
Importantly, we're also continuing to see outstanding well performance. Recently, we brought online a new 5-well pad in the dry area of Southwest Pennsylvania. The wells are producing under constrained conditions into a high-pressure gathering system with an average initial sales rate per well of over 26 million a day. The 5 wells averaged 8,200 foot laterals with 42 stages. I also want to emphasize that the total well cost, including facilities, was less than $900 per foot. 
Now that we have more production history, I would also like to update you on the 5-well pad in the wet area that we reported on earlier this year. The average initial sales rate of the 5 wells was 18 million cubic feet equivalent per day under constrained conditions and had a 120-day average of 8.5 million a day. The average EUR per 1,000-foot for the 5 wells on the pad is 4 Bcf equivalent per 1,000-foot, and those wells averaged 5,700 foot laterals completed with 30 stages. The total well cost for these wells including facilities was less than $1,000 per foot, again, emphasizing class-leading cost with 4 Bcfe per 1,000-foot, which is one of the best recoveries in the entire basin. 
Again, the rock rules. Both our dry and liquids-rich wells in the Marcellus and Southwest Pennsylvania continue to deliver outstanding results and are a real testament to our operations and technical teams. As we continue to drill longer laterals, we expect to see even better performance. 
Our first 2 Utica wells in Washington County, Pennsylvania are now producing into the new dry gas pipeline, and we're currently drilling the third well on a nearby pad, expected to complete that well early next year. Our reservoir modeling for the first well, which is based on extensive reservoir measurements and production history, puts the EUR in the range of 15 Bcf from a 5,400-foot lateral with 32 stages. On a normalized basis, that's approximately 2.8 Bcf per 1,000-foot of lateral and is in the top tier of Utica wells to date. Again, looking at all the production data from across the entire Utica play, our first well appears to be in the top 10 performers on both an absolute and a per-thousand-foot basis, and the second well is better. 
Remember, the first 2 wells are opposing laterals off the same pad, but the completions were different. The first well was completed with 400,000 pounds of proppant per stage or approximately 24,000 pounds per foot, and the second well was completed with 500,000 pounds per stage or a little over 3,000 pounds per foot. Both wells incorporated 100 mesh sand and 30/50 ceramic proppant and were similar in reservoir pressure as you would expect being direct opposing offsets. 
On the second well, we also utilized a choke management program designed to manage the near-wellbore drawdown. The second well is currently flowing to sales at approximately 13 million a day. It's been online a very short time, but early indications suggest it we will be better than the first. It was off 5,200 foot lateral, also completed with 32 stages. 
As we evaluate these 2 wells and continue to develop our reservoir modeling, we will let the data and the modeling guide us in optimizing the completion design for our third well. The third well is a FEED for a total completed well cost of $15.9 million for a 6,500-foot lateral. This includes facilities, diagnostics, additional science and new technology, technology namely managed pressured drilling equipment, allowing us to keep drilling under the large pressure swings that have been seen by us and others in Southwest Pennsylvania. We believe as time goes on and we get more of these wells under our belt, that we'll see between 20% and 30% reductions in total well cost resulting from technology advancements and operational efficiencies, combined with improving well performance. 
We have 400,000 net acres of what we believe is core dry Utica. Early wells drilled by us and our offset competitors in Southwest Pennsylvania are promising and certainly helped to prove up and delineate the Range acreage position, but those 5-or-so wells have only limited production history today. We plan to gather data from the offset activity, combined with our wells, and while we focus on the Marcellus in the near term, just like the super-rich, wet and dry Marcellus and Upper Devonian, our Utica play could be another complementary large-scale and low-risk option in our portfolio with good economics for dry gas growth. 
Activity in Northeast Pennsylvania and in our Midcontinent division slowed dramatically in the third quarter, and today, both areas have finished their capital spend for the year. Our Fort Worth team, which now operates both areas, has done an excellent job of lowering cost and focusing on optimizing production and revenue. 
Our Southern Appalachian team in Nora is also finished for the year with its capital spending. They're continuing to bring online some of the best coal-bed methane wells we've seen in years. In fact, over the past 30 years, 4 of the top 5 wells are the new design and 11 of the top 30 wells are wells that we have drilled and completed since taking over full operational control of the properties in 2014. Utilizing a new high-rate and larger-size frac technique, the recent CBM wells are 75% better than their average offsets with significantly better economics. And again, this area has some of the best gas pricing in the Eastern U.S. It's large scale, low risk and has very low declines.
Environmental protection, regulatory compliance, employee safety and having positive relationships in the communities where we live and work remain top priorities in our operations. In Southwest Pennsylvania, we had no reportable spills in the third quarter, and we'll work hard to repeat that success going forward. Employee and management commitment to safety has resulted in Range having only one OSHA recordable injury thus far in 2015 and 0 hours of lost time in the last 21 months. We are really proud of all of our operating teams for working safely, protecting the environment and being good stewards in the communities where we live and work. 
Now over to Roger."

Financially, the third quarter of 2015 was much like the second quarter with significantly lower realized prices across all commodities set against significantly lower cost and consistent capital efficient growth. Year-over-year production",569,"Thank you, Ray. Financially, the third quarter of 2015 was much like the second quarter with significantly lower realized prices across all commodities set against significantly lower cost and consistent capital efficient growth. Year-over-year production growth for the quarter was 20%, and all-in realized prices were down by 36% from the third quarter of last year. 
We continue to improve our already low cost structure by reducing cash unit cost by $0.23 from last year, a 12% decrease. All of our individual unit cost categories were at or below guidance with another quarter of most expense categories coming in below last year on an absolute dollar basis as well. Fourth quarter line item expense guidance may be found in the third quarter earnings press release. 
Revenue from natural gas, oil and NGL sales, including cash-settled derivatives, was $390 million for the third quarter, a $7 million increase from the second quarter of this year, but $73 million below last year's third quarter. EBITDAX for the third quarter was $209 million, and third quarter cash flow was $169 million or $1.01 per fully diluted share. Year-to-date third quarter EBITDAX was $656 million, and year-to-date cash flow totals $536 million. 
Net loss on a GAAP basis for the third quarter was $301 million, driven primarily by $502 million of pretax proved property impairments from some of our legacy shallow gas areas in Northwest Pennsylvania and oil properties in Northern Oklahoma. The properties impaired are noncore assets. Year-to-date, less than 3% of total company production came from these impaired assets. 
Non-GAAP earnings, reflecting common analyst methodology, which removes many noncash and nonrecurring items, was $5.5 million or $0.03 per fully diluted share. Both non-GAAP earnings and cash flow per share for the quarter were higher than the second quarter and above analyst consensus. 
NYMEX strip oil prices were 16.5% lower at September 30 than June 30 and strip gas prices were 10% lower. The fact that revenue, cash flow, EBITDAX and adjusted earnings were all higher in the third quarter of this year than the second quarter speaks to the responsiveness of the company to the current industry environment through continued cost cutting and capital-efficient growth. 
Turning to the balance sheet. The most significant improvement completed during the third quarter was the redemption of our old 6¾% notes. Listeners may recall that we issued $750 million of 4 7/8% notes during the second quarter, effectively replacing our 6¾% notes, which were not callable until the third quarter. Having used the bank credit facility to bridge the 2 transactions, we redeemed the 6¾% notes in August using the bank credit facility. The refinancing reduces our corporate weighted average bond interest rate by 42 basis points, generating just under $11 million of annual interest expense savings. Also, the redemption of our 6¾% notes places our earliest bond maturity in the year 2021. 
We remain well hedged in 2016 with a floor gas price of $3.42 of Mcf on over half our anticipated 2016 gas production. Hedging activity during the third quarter, summarized in the earnings release in Range website, consisted of several new oil hedges and some natural gas basis swaps. 
All in all, a challenging but solid quarter with higher revenue, production, cash flow and lower cost sequentially from the second quarter. In the fourth quarter, we look forward to continued year-over-year growth, cost focus and balance sheet improvement.

If you look on our website on Slide 11, it lays out the economics for the Marcellus. And the good news for us is, our wells, we have all depth rights so we hold everything, basically, the Marcellus, the Utica, the Upper Devonian and every horizon up and down the wellbore. So what we know is we're encouraged by our first and second Utica wells and the wells in and around this, and we think, just like we've been saying for a long time, that the dry core -- the best part of the dry core of the Utica, we believe, will be down in Southwest Pennsylvania. And there's -- we hold a big chunk of it. A few other operators do too. But the good part for us is it's stacked on top. It's right below the Marcellus. So we're encouraged by the Utica. We've drilled our 2 wells. As Ray said, we're drilling the third and we'll complete it next year. When you look at our plan for next year, our focus is going to be really on the Marcellus. We think with those 3 wells, coupled with the activity in and around us, it'll give us a really good handle on what the Utica ultimately is, and we're encouraged by what it could be. But what we know is we have 10 years' worth of production history and thousands of wells that delineate, really, our position. So that's the low risk piece. And again, on Slide 16, when you look at our Marcellus wells right now, the EURs per 1,000-foot average for this year, 2.5 to 3, and Ray said our better pad is as high as 4 Bcf per 1,000-foot. Coupled with costs that range down there, you're looking at about $900,000 to $1 million per 1,000-foot or maybe said a little more simply, our Marcellus wells down there are basically 17, almost 18 Bcf wells that cost roughly $6 million. So we view it as a complementary development. We're going -- we can speak for Range. We're going to put our capital where we're getting the most -- the best returns and the best capital efficiency, coupled with the lowest risk. So we're excited and encouraged by what the Utica could be. But in the short run, you're going to see our focus be totally on the Marcellus. And we think that our wells and the other wells that'll be drilled in and around us, that'll help delineate our Utica position, but we won't be spending a lot of dollars on science. We will put them into the strong-return Marcellus wells that we have. Kind of a long-winded answer, but Matt, hopefully, that addressed your question."

Mariner East propane and ethane are on the verge of starting up in the next 30 days and will be fully on by the end of the year. That'll be a big uplift in our netbacks on both of those. So clearly, we think that's core and strong. We have a big position. We have 1.6 million net acres of stacked pay potential. So that's clearly size and scale and, we believe, is the highest quality play in North America. The things that -- even though those other assets are, by definition, noncore for us, they're not competing for capital and not competing for returns, they're good properties, and we're seeing a lot of interest.

So if your EBITDAX is increasing, you're not overspending, then your leverage is improving even without any asset sales. So -- and if I look at the balance sheet, I don't lose any sleep over the balance sheet. It's in great shape. As I mentioned, our earliest debt maturity is in 2021. We've got billions in liquidity. Our interest coverage for third quarter is 6.1x.  So very pleased with the balance sheet. And again, you don't have to take my word for it. Both the rating agencies just ratified in the last 2 weeks Range's credit rating. That's not the case for many other companies out there. And you look at where our bonds trade, very tight spread to treasuries. Our 2025s are trading below 400. That's kind of investment grade land.

So -- and that's the combination of new projects starting up for us that result in better netbacks and pricing on the natural gas side as well as seasonality. Coupled with that, we think with Mariner East being fully up and running, those real low propane quarters that we had, we've probably seen the low there as well with Mariner East enabling, one, lower transportation cost and, therefore, better netbacks, but also the opportunity potentially for better pricing by having the optionality of either selling in the Northeast markets when they're good or being able to export in a much more efficient way."

And this year, the average of the wells that we're putting to sale is about 6,000-foot all across the Marcellus. Clearly, there are some that are much, much longer, and clearly, there are some that are still shorter. But the average is 6,000. Next year, we see that average approaching 7,000 feet, and I do believe in a couple of years past that, you'll see us averaging close to 8,000 feet, more than likely. And I do think that the super-rich area of the wet and the dry and in the dry Northeast PA, that we may -- we'll zero in on what those optimal lateral lengths are.

There's only in Southwest Pennsylvania about 5-or-so wells that have any history at all. I think ours is -- clearly, our first well is about 9 months now. The wells after that, I think about the longest well after that is maybe getting close to 90 days. And then after that, most -- some of them haven't really even been to sales yet, and so this is really, really early on. But we feel pretty confident in our well. We've got 9 months of production history. We've built some very extensive reservoir modelings. They have 3D information in the reservoir. They have 3D modeling in the fracs that we performed on the well. We've done a lot of research and diagnostics. When we look across the entire play, including the stuff in Ohio, it's one of the top 10 wells as it stands today on an absolute basis and on a per 1,000-foot basis. So we're really pleased with it. And all we can say today is the first well has about 60 days, and clearly, it's way too early to start talking about the second well. I'm sorry, I may have said the first well. First well has about 9 months. Second well has about 60 days. And clearly, it's too early to talk about an EUR for it. But we can say with some confidence that it is better than the first well. So clearly, we're really pleased with our first 2 wells. The offset wells, hats off to EQT and CNX, great wells. There's no question about it. But I think they're really, really, early. And we're going to -- I think this play is going to need some more time. Our third well will complete sometime early next year and look at that. But this is a different kind of play. It's a Point Pleasant that we're really targeting. It's a carbonate. It's not a shale. Clearly, the faults and the fracture networks play a role in this. So I think there's a lot yet to be determined about how this play develops. And while it looks very promising to us and we're excited that it can be a very complementary play and something that we can do, it's a -- another lever we can push going down the road if we want to build some dry gas growth, but like Jeff said earlier, I think at this point, we're going to sit back, we're going to watch these 3 wells, we're going to watch the offset [ph] activities that's around us. Because the other important thing that I didn't mention about the 5 wells in Pennsylvania is they basically ring our acreage there. They outline our positions, which is really great. So we're going to sit back and watch all of that. And then I think as we go into 2017, I think we'll have much better idea how we see that development plan going forward."

Let me start by qualifying that. I'm a frac guy. If you look at our map on Page 15 in the presentation, and we've got some maps further back in the presentation, and you look at gas in place, these maps have been out there for some time. There's a lot of penetration. There's a lot of offset activity. There's, of course, tons and hundreds and hundreds of wells in Ohio that have all gone together to put this map. And I think it's pretty consistent against -- through all of our peers in Southwest PA and in Ohio, that everybody agrees with the map. About the best gas in place numbers that you see are around 100 Bcf. Now there might be some isolated areas that are closer to 150 Bcf per square mile. If you look at the Marcellus, it's about the same, if not higher in some cases. So I think it is what it is. The rock rules. I don't know that being a carbonate versus a shale would have any bearing on how much gas in place it has. It's going to be more things like total organic carbon content and vitrinite reflectance and permeability and porosity and pressure plays a big role and overburdened stresses and determine how it drills and how it fracs.  All those things play big, big roles in how these wells produce and how they basically develop going forward. So I think the Point Pleasant, which is what we're all targeting, is a carbonate. It's not a shale. In the shales, you tend to have some component of desorption of gas from the clays that are present there. Clearly, there may be a little bit of that in the Point Pleasant, but we're way, way early. We clearly don't understand it. It does appear in the Point Pleasant, that this data comes from Core Lab consortiums that we're all participating in, where we donate cores and then we all share in the analysis and the data, that the Point Pleasant does have some pressure-dependent perm challenges. So that's why you're hearing about choke management programs and managing the near-wellbore pressure drawdowns and so forth. And I think every operator is handing -- handling that a little bit different. But I think as time goes on, we'll all zero in on what the best way to approach that is and go forward. But I think you still can't get past what mother nature put there and the fact that the rock rules. And what we all know at this point is the Bcf per square mile is what it is. And I think how you go about getting that out is going to be the key going forward."

It will come as no surprise to anyone on this call when I say that the third quarter was difficult. In a commodity business, you go through cycles. Those of us who have seen a few of these cycles recall what they feel like, the difficult decisions that must be made. But ultimately, the companies with the right assets and strategy will emerge better for it. 
The Range team has navigated these cycles before and has designed a company to consistently create value for its shareholders over time. You've all heard these tenets before, but they bear repeating when we get distracted by minute-by-minute price updates. We believe value is created year-after-year by having a large position in the core of low-cost play, a great team that consistently and faithfully executes the business plan and a strong simple balance sheet. 
Going a little deeper into each of these points. First, Range has the largest position in the lowest cost play in North America. There's also a tremendous additional potential upside in form of the Utica, down-spacing in the Marcellus, the Upper Devonian, extending laterals and having size and scale. This resource has been captured and is largely held by production, which allows Range to be disciplined in its activity levels. 
Second, a team that consistently executes. For over a decade, the Range team has grown production at almost a 20% compounded annual growth rate. This was accomplished despite periods of declining prices and high service costs. This team pioneered the Marcellus and helped bring other technical innovations into the mainstream, for example, water recycling and reduced cluster spacing. Marketing has been another area of solid execution with the history of firsts, including our first in obtaining takeaway capacity and the upcoming exports of ethane and propane out of Marcus Hook. I believe that you'll see more firsts from Range. 
Third, the balance sheet is a foundation to enable the company to execute its strategy. Range has prudently managed its balance sheet in a consistent manner for many years. As an operating strategy-driven company, we focus first on rigorous capital allocation to be good storage of our shareholders' money. That has focused Range on building one of the best drilling inventories in the business. It has also led us to shed noncore assets totaling north of $3 billion over the last 10 years. 
Liquidity and financial flexibility are important, and we develop this just as we do our drilling inventory. We are well positioned with a carefully structured bank credit facility with ample liquidity and a long-term debt portfolio with staggered maturities. In addition, we continue to make progress on our noncore asset sales, and we expect to announce one or more asset sales and close them by the end of this year. We will use the proceeds to pay down debt, further strengthening our balance sheet. 
Turning to the third quarter. Another 3 months of strong operating performance drove 20% growth in production. Our relentless focus on cost and efficiency yielded a 12% reduction in our unit cost over the prior year quarter. This came against a continued backdrop of weak product prices, which more than offset lower costs. The good news is that 2 of the projects, which I mentioned last quarter, should help with fourth quarter pricing netbacks. 
Spectra's Uniontown to Gas City project became fully operational on September 1. This transportation allows us to move about 170 million per day net from local to Appalachian index to Midwest markets. The net effect is it has increased our netback price by more than $1 on this volume, and we expect that we'll see a continued uplift of $0.75 to $1 for the fourth quarter. 
The other project I mentioned during our last quarterly call was Mariner East I. Our understanding is that Mariner East I will be fully operational by the end of this year. When operational, this project should result in a significant uplift on our ethane and propane pricing netbacks. We are the only producer that has capacity on this project, and we have 40,000 barrels per day comprised of half ethane and half propane. We expect a $90 million uplift in our net cash flow on an annualized basis when combining the net effects from Mariner East, Mariner West and ATEX. 
For 2016, we have projected book ends for capital spending of $550 million to $890 million. Both cases give us good growth within or near cash flow, depending on the price forecast used. We believe that if you look at the capital we're spending in 2015 for the growth we're achieving, we have the most capital-efficient growth on a corporate basis versus any of our peers in the Appalachian or in any other basin. We believe in 2016, our capital efficiency will also be at or near the top of the peers. 
I'll now turn the call over to Ray."

During the first 3 quarters of this year, we've demonstrated capital discipline, we've increased operational efficiency, we further lowered our cost structure and continued to meet our production targets while staying within our $870 million",1697,"Thanks, Jeff. During the first 3 quarters of this year, we've demonstrated capital discipline, we've increased operational efficiency, we further lowered our cost structure and continued to meet our production targets while staying within our $870 million capital budget. 
Third quarter production was better-than-expected at 1.445 Bcf equivalent per day, again largely driven by improved performance in the dry gas area at Southwest Pennsylvania, and we're still on track to deliver approximately 20% year-over-year production growth. Our Marcellus growth is forecasted to be 26% year-over-year. With our reduced capital spending in the fourth quarter and Mariner East starting up lighter than originally planned, our fourth quarter production is expected to average about 1.42 Bcf equivalent per day. 
Our latest communications with Sonoco indicate that the Mariner East startup should occur in the next month with full commercial operations for propane and ethane by the end of the year. Thinking ahead about the book ends for next year's plan, we expect that our production growth profile in 2016 to be consistent with previous years, importantly, our 2016 exit rate being higher than this year's exit rate, again setting us up for growth in 2017. 
Our cost metrics are consistently improving on both an absolute and on a per-unit basis. Corporate LOE per Mcfe for the quarter was down 21% as compared to last year, and G&A per Mcfe is down 26%. We've made additional progress in operating efficiencies and reducing capital cost. 
I'll start with some highlights from Southwest Pennsylvania, where most of our capital is being invested. To give you an idea of just how much progress we've made in drilling cost, for the last 2 months, August and September, our average lateral length has increased by 38% over the average for 2014. Despite drilling 38% longer laterals, our drilling cost per well have actually declined by 10%. We recently finished a 5-well pad at 45% less cost per foot as compared to 2014. This was all accomplished by a combination of service cost reductions, the application of improved drilling technology and improved drilling efficiencies. On the completion side, we've achieved a 44% increase in frac stages per day as compared to last year. Three recent pads totaling 427 frac stages achieved an average between 8 and 10 stages per day. Combined with service cost reductions, we've seen completion cost drop by more than 34% compared to this time last year. 
We believe that these efficiencies can continue to improve going forward. We also believe that this is not the case for everyone. It's a distinct advantage for Range on 2 fronts, both on the capital efficiency side and the operational side. Today, we have some of the best recoveries per foot of lateral, combined with one of the lowest total well cost per foot of lateral, generating some of the best economics in the basin. Of course, this is largely driven by our team and our large-scale stacked pay and high-quality acreage position in Southwest Pennsylvania. 
One of the most important factors in improving capital efficiency is drilling longer laterals. Our average lateral length this year is about 6,000 feet, and we expect to see it closer to 7,000 feet next year and still growing longer after that. Most of our competitors in the basin are already drilling long laterals and will not see the same gains and efficiency going forward. Therefore, we see an advantage with our capital efficiency increasing steadily in the future as we go forward with longer and longer laterals.
The other distinct advantage is our operating efficiency. For example, we know that we frac more stages per day and have less downtime on our completions than any operator in the basin. Service providers know this and benefit with better utilization rates when they're on one of our locations. This generates a win-win situation for both us and the service company, resulting in Range receiving some of the best pricing in the basin while the service companies maintain their margins. 
Importantly, we're also continuing to see outstanding well performance. Recently, we brought online a new 5-well pad in the dry area of Southwest Pennsylvania. The wells are producing under constrained conditions into a high-pressure gathering system with an average initial sales rate per well of over 26 million a day. The 5 wells averaged 8,200 foot laterals with 42 stages. I also want to emphasize that the total well cost, including facilities, was less than $900 per foot. 
Now that we have more production history, I would also like to update you on the 5-well pad in the wet area that we reported on earlier this year. The average initial sales rate of the 5 wells was 18 million cubic feet equivalent per day under constrained conditions and had a 120-day average of 8.5 million a day. The average EUR per 1,000-foot for the 5 wells on the pad is 4 Bcf equivalent per 1,000-foot, and those wells averaged 5,700 foot laterals completed with 30 stages. The total well cost for these wells including facilities was less than $1,000 per foot, again, emphasizing class-leading cost with 4 Bcfe per 1,000-foot, which is one of the best recoveries in the entire basin. 
Again, the rock rules. Both our dry and liquids-rich wells in the Marcellus and Southwest Pennsylvania continue to deliver outstanding results and are a real testament to our operations and technical teams. As we continue to drill longer laterals, we expect to see even better performance. 
Our first 2 Utica wells in Washington County, Pennsylvania are now producing into the new dry gas pipeline, and we're currently drilling the third well on a nearby pad, expected to complete that well early next year. Our reservoir modeling for the first well, which is based on extensive reservoir measurements and production history, puts the EUR in the range of 15 Bcf from a 5,400-foot lateral with 32 stages. On a normalized basis, that's approximately 2.8 Bcf per 1,000-foot of lateral and is in the top tier of Utica wells to date. Again, looking at all the production data from across the entire Utica play, our first well appears to be in the top 10 performers on both an absolute and a per-thousand-foot basis, and the second well is better. 
Remember, the first 2 wells are opposing laterals off the same pad, but the completions were different. The first well was completed with 400,000 pounds of proppant per stage or approximately 24,000 pounds per foot, and the second well was completed with 500,000 pounds per stage or a little over 3,000 pounds per foot. Both wells incorporated 100 mesh sand and 30/50 ceramic proppant and were similar in reservoir pressure as you would expect being direct opposing offsets. 
On the second well, we also utilized a choke management program designed to manage the near-wellbore drawdown. The second well is currently flowing to sales at approximately 13 million a day. It's been online a very short time, but early indications suggest it we will be better than the first. It was off 5,200 foot lateral, also completed with 32 stages. 
As we evaluate these 2 wells and continue to develop our reservoir modeling, we will let the data and the modeling guide us in optimizing the completion design for our third well. The third well is a FEED for a total completed well cost of $15.9 million for a 6,500-foot lateral. This includes facilities, diagnostics, additional science and new technology, technology namely managed pressured drilling equipment, allowing us to keep drilling under the large pressure swings that have been seen by us and others in Southwest Pennsylvania. We believe as time goes on and we get more of these wells under our belt, that we'll see between 20% and 30% reductions in total well cost resulting from technology advancements and operational efficiencies, combined with improving well performance. 
We have 400,000 net acres of what we believe is core dry Utica. Early wells drilled by us and our offset competitors in Southwest Pennsylvania are promising and certainly helped to prove up and delineate the Range acreage position, but those 5-or-so wells have only limited production history today. We plan to gather data from the offset activity, combined with our wells, and while we focus on the Marcellus in the near term, just like the super-rich, wet and dry Marcellus and Upper Devonian, our Utica play could be another complementary large-scale and low-risk option in our portfolio with good economics for dry gas growth. 
Activity in Northeast Pennsylvania and in our Midcontinent division slowed dramatically in the third quarter, and today, both areas have finished their capital spend for the year. Our Fort Worth team, which now operates both areas, has done an excellent job of lowering cost and focusing on optimizing production and revenue. 
Our Southern Appalachian team in Nora is also finished for the year with its capital spending. They're continuing to bring online some of the best coal-bed methane wells we've seen in years. In fact, over the past 30 years, 4 of the top 5 wells are the new design and 11 of the top 30 wells are wells that we have drilled and completed since taking over full operational control of the properties in 2014. Utilizing a new high-rate and larger-size frac technique, the recent CBM wells are 75% better than their average offsets with significantly better economics. And again, this area has some of the best gas pricing in the Eastern U.S. It's large scale, low risk and has very low declines.
Environmental protection, regulatory compliance, employee safety and having positive relationships in the communities where we live and work remain top priorities in our operations. In Southwest Pennsylvania, we had no reportable spills in the third quarter, and we'll work hard to repeat that success going forward. Employee and management commitment to safety has resulted in Range having only one OSHA recordable injury thus far in 2015 and 0 hours of lost time in the last 21 months. We are really proud of all of our operating teams for working safely, protecting the environment and being good stewards in the communities where we live and work. 
Now over to Roger."

Financially, the third quarter of 2015 was much like the second quarter with significantly lower realized prices across all commodities set against significantly lower cost and consistent capital efficient growth. Year-over-year production",569,"Thank you, Ray. Financially, the third quarter of 2015 was much like the second quarter with significantly lower realized prices across all commodities set against significantly lower cost and consistent capital efficient growth. Year-over-year production growth for the quarter was 20%, and all-in realized prices were down by 36% from the third quarter of last year. 
We continue to improve our already low cost structure by reducing cash unit cost by $0.23 from last year, a 12% decrease. All of our individual unit cost categories were at or below guidance with another quarter of most expense categories coming in below last year on an absolute dollar basis as well. Fourth quarter line item expense guidance may be found in the third quarter earnings press release. 
Revenue from natural gas, oil and NGL sales, including cash-settled derivatives, was $390 million for the third quarter, a $7 million increase from the second quarter of this year, but $73 million below last year's third quarter. EBITDAX for the third quarter was $209 million, and third quarter cash flow was $169 million or $1.01 per fully diluted share. Year-to-date third quarter EBITDAX was $656 million, and year-to-date cash flow totals $536 million. 
Net loss on a GAAP basis for the third quarter was $301 million, driven primarily by $502 million of pretax proved property impairments from some of our legacy shallow gas areas in Northwest Pennsylvania and oil properties in Northern Oklahoma. The properties impaired are noncore assets. Year-to-date, less than 3% of total company production came from these impaired assets. 
Non-GAAP earnings, reflecting common analyst methodology, which removes many noncash and nonrecurring items, was $5.5 million or $0.03 per fully diluted share. Both non-GAAP earnings and cash flow per share for the quarter were higher than the second quarter and above analyst consensus. 
NYMEX strip oil prices were 16.5% lower at September 30 than June 30 and strip gas prices were 10% lower. The fact that revenue, cash flow, EBITDAX and adjusted earnings were all higher in the third quarter of this year than the second quarter speaks to the responsiveness of the company to the current industry environment through continued cost cutting and capital-efficient growth. 
Turning to the balance sheet. The most significant improvement completed during the third quarter was the redemption of our old 6¾% notes. Listeners may recall that we issued $750 million of 4 7/8% notes during the second quarter, effectively replacing our 6¾% notes, which were not callable until the third quarter. Having used the bank credit facility to bridge the 2 transactions, we redeemed the 6¾% notes in August using the bank credit facility. The refinancing reduces our corporate weighted average bond interest rate by 42 basis points, generating just under $11 million of annual interest expense savings. Also, the redemption of our 6¾% notes places our earliest bond maturity in the year 2021. 
We remain well hedged in 2016 with a floor gas price of $3.42 of Mcf on over half our anticipated 2016 gas production. Hedging activity during the third quarter, summarized in the earnings release in Range website, consisted of several new oil hedges and some natural gas basis swaps. 
All in all, a challenging but solid quarter with higher revenue, production, cash flow and lower cost sequentially from the second quarter. In the fourth quarter, we look forward to continued year-over-year growth, cost focus and balance sheet improvement.

If you look on our website on Slide 11, it lays out the economics for the Marcellus. And the good news for us is, our wells, we have all depth rights so we hold everything, basically, the Marcellus, the Utica, the Upper Devonian and every horizon up and down the wellbore. So what we know is we're encouraged by our first and second Utica wells and the wells in and around this, and we think, just like we've been saying for a long time, that the dry core -- the best part of the dry core of the Utica, we believe, will be down in Southwest Pennsylvania. And there's -- we hold a big chunk of it. A few other operators do too. But the good part for us is it's stacked on top. It's right below the Marcellus. So we're encouraged by the Utica. We've drilled our 2 wells. As Ray said, we're drilling the third and we'll complete it next year. When you look at our plan for next year, our focus is going to be really on the Marcellus. We think with those 3 wells, coupled with the activity in and around us, it'll give us a really good handle on what the Utica ultimately is, and we're encouraged by what it could be. But what we know is we have 10 years' worth of production history and thousands of wells that delineate, really, our position. So that's the low risk piece. And again, on Slide 16, when you look at our Marcellus wells right now, the EURs per 1,000-foot average for this year, 2.5 to 3, and Ray said our better pad is as high as 4 Bcf per 1,000-foot. Coupled with costs that range down there, you're looking at about $900,000 to $1 million per 1,000-foot or maybe said a little more simply, our Marcellus wells down there are basically 17, almost 18 Bcf wells that cost roughly $6 million. So we view it as a complementary development. We're going -- we can speak for Range. We're going to put our capital where we're getting the most -- the best returns and the best capital efficiency, coupled with the lowest risk. So we're excited and encouraged by what the Utica could be. But in the short run, you're going to see our focus be totally on the Marcellus. And we think that our wells and the other wells that'll be drilled in and around us, that'll help delineate our Utica position, but we won't be spending a lot of dollars on science. We will put them into the strong-return Marcellus wells that we have. Kind of a long-winded answer, but Matt, hopefully, that addressed your question."

So -- and if I look at the balance sheet, I don't lose any sleep over the balance sheet. It's in great shape. As I mentioned, our earliest debt maturity is in 2021. We've got billions in liquidity.

Both the rating agencies just ratified in the last 2 weeks Range's credit rating. That's not the case for many other companies out there.

So -- and that's the combination of new projects starting up for us that result in better netbacks and pricing on the natural gas side as well as seasonality. Coupled with that, we think with Mariner East being fully up and running, those real low propane quarters that we had, we've probably seen the low there as well with Mariner East enabling, one, lower transportation cost and, therefore, better netbacks, but also the opportunity potentially for better pricing by having the optionality of either selling in the Northeast markets when they're good or being able to export in a much more efficient way."

We have a very disciplined capital allocation process, and we look at AFEs throughout the year on a real time basis, every AFE above a couple of hundred thousand bucks has to go through Roger, myself and Jeff. So we get to look and see what real time is happening in the market. And with that, we will have some flexibility, be able to adjust throughout the year. Just like you've seen us do this -- from this year from the original budget process to what we finally arrived at in January. We -- you saw us change our capital allocation and begin to change our mix towards dry. As it stands today, clearly, our dry gas economics are still better, and you'll see us continue to push a little bit more that way. That does not mean we're walking away from the liquids by any means, because the returns there are still good, and we do still need to build infrastructure and do the things that we're doing over there. So -- but I do think you'll see our mix move more towards dry going into '16 also."

There's only in Southwest Pennsylvania about 5-or-so wells that have any history at all. I think ours is -- clearly, our first well is about 9 months now. The wells after that, I think about the longest well after that is maybe getting close to 90 days. And then after that, most -- some of them haven't really even been to sales yet, and so this is really, really early on. But we feel pretty confident in our well. We've got 9 months of production history. We've built some very extensive reservoir modelings. They have 3D information in the reservoir. They have 3D modeling in the fracs that we performed on the well. We've done a lot of research and diagnostics. When we look across the entire play, including the stuff in Ohio, it's one of the top 10 wells as it stands today on an absolute basis and on a per 1,000-foot basis. So we're really pleased with it. And all we can say today is the first well has about 60 days, and clearly, it's way too early to start talking about the second well. I'm sorry, I may have said the first well. First well has about 9 months. Second well has about 60 days. And clearly, it's too early to talk about an EUR for it. But we can say with some confidence that it is better than the first well. So clearly, we're really pleased with our first 2 wells. The offset wells, hats off to EQT and CNX, great wells. There's no question about it. But I think they're really, really, early. And we're going to -- I think this play is going to need some more time. Our third well will complete sometime early next year and look at that. But this is a different kind of play. It's a Point Pleasant that we're really targeting. It's a carbonate. It's not a shale. Clearly, the faults and the fracture networks play a role in this. So I think there's a lot yet to be determined about how this play develops. And while it looks very promising to us and we're excited that it can be a very complementary play and something that we can do, it's a -- another lever we can push going down the road if we want to build some dry gas growth, but like Jeff said earlier, I think at this point, we're going to sit back, we're going to watch these 3 wells, we're going to watch the offset [ph] activities that's around us. Because the other important thing that I didn't mention about the 5 wells in Pennsylvania is they basically ring our acreage there. They outline our positions, which is really great. So we're going to sit back and watch all of that. And then I think as we go into 2017, I think we'll have much better idea how we see that development plan going forward."

Let me start by qualifying that. I'm a frac guy. If you look at our map on Page 15 in the presentation, and we've got some maps further back in the presentation, and you look at gas in place, these maps have been out there for some time. There's a lot of penetration. There's a lot of offset activity. There's, of course, tons and hundreds and hundreds of wells in Ohio that have all gone together to put this map. And I think it's pretty consistent against -- through all of our peers in Southwest PA and in Ohio, that everybody agrees with the map. About the best gas in place numbers that you see are around 100 Bcf. Now there might be some isolated areas that are closer to 150 Bcf per square mile. If you look at the Marcellus, it's about the same, if not higher in some cases. So I think it is what it is. The rock rules. I don't know that being a carbonate versus a shale would have any bearing on how much gas in place it has. It's going to be more things like total organic carbon content and vitrinite reflectance and permeability and porosity and pressure plays a big role and overburdened stresses and determine how it drills and how it fracs.  All those things play big, big roles in how these wells produce and how they basically develop going forward. So I think the Point Pleasant, which is what we're all targeting, is a carbonate. It's not a shale. In the shales, you tend to have some component of desorption of gas from the clays that are present there. Clearly, there may be a little bit of that in the Point Pleasant, but we're way, way early. We clearly don't understand it. It does appear in the Point Pleasant, that this data comes from Core Lab consortiums that we're all participating in, where we donate cores and then we all share in the analysis and the data, that the Point Pleasant does have some pressure-dependent perm challenges. So that's why you're hearing about choke management programs and managing the near-wellbore pressure drawdowns and so forth. And I think every operator is handing -- handling that a little bit different. But I think as time goes on, we'll all zero in on what the best way to approach that is and go forward. But I think you still can't get past what mother nature put there and the fact that the rock rules. And what we all know at this point is the Bcf per square mile is what it is. And I think how you go about getting that out is going to be the key going forward."

The other thing that really is critical is long-term performance. So what's important to me is the fact that the oldest Marcellus well now, come this fall, which is our well, will have 11 years' worth of history. So there's up to -- or 11 years since the discovery, 10 years' worth of history, but on thousands of wells in the Marcellus. So you have a largely low-risk play. So when we say we have wells in the Marcellus that are -- if you look on Page 11, that are 17, 17.6 Bs that cost $6 million, we have a high degree of confidence that's what it is. And that's -- those are strong numbers. The Utica may be great. Time will tell. But ultimately, it's a long-term performance of not just 1 well or 2 wells or 10 wells, but across a large dataset that dictates what the economics of the play will be."
