We resolved 2 major uncertainties, Edison Mission Energy and San Onofre. We meaningfully increased the dividend. We continue to fulfill the long-term growth opportunities at Southern California Edison through our focused investment strategy that supports California's environmental and growth objectives. And we continue to selectively pursue growth opportunities that allow us to serve additional customers outside of the CE service territory. Most gratifying to me is that we delivered on what we told investors we would do. I am proud of this leadership team and the outstanding work of our employees. That said, we fully recognize that 2014 is over and we are in the new year. We need to build on the performance of 2014 and continue to build value. With the strong fourth quarter, full year 2014 core earnings were $4.59 per share, an increase of 21% over the previous year. This result was well above our updated guidance from last fall. Jim Scilacci will cover more of the details in his comments. 
The settlements reached on the EME bankruptcy and the SONGS Order Instituting Investigation positioned us to move forward decisively in a time of tremendous change in our industry. The unanimous approval by the California Public Utilities Commission on the SONG settlement agreement last November demonstrated that it is possible to resolve complex and important regulatory matters through settlement. The settlement was the product of tough negotiations among the initial settling parties. The Utility Reform Network or TURN, the office of ratepayer advocate and the 2 utilities, and later other intervenor signed on to the settlement. The settlement has been widely supported as fair and balanced. SCE is now proceeding with implementation of the approved agreement. We are also deeply engaged in the planning and early stages of decommissioning the plant. SCE will continue to work aggressively to maximize potential financial recoveries from insurers and from Mitsubishi Heavy Industries. I'm hopeful SCE will be able to resolve the insurance claims this year. Under the provisions of the settlement agreement, virtually all insurance proceeds, if any, will go to customers. The arbitration process with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries must follow International Chamber of Commerce rules, which means that there'll be a slower process. I don't expect any decision until 2016. The MHI arbitration proceeding is confidential so we won't be able to say much. However, we continue to assert the claims we first presented to the International Chamber of Commerce in 2013. 
Our nearly 18% dividend increase in early December underscores our optimism about the future and our commitment to bringing our dividend payout closer to that of the industry. We expect to extend our record of 11 years of annual dividend increases while stepping up the pace of dividend growth to exceed that earnings. This will allow us to return to our target payout ratio of 45% to 55% of earnings in steps over time. 
Let me now provide some longer-term thoughts. On January 5, in his State of the State speech, Governor Brown outlined his broad goals for the next stage in addressing climate change. By 2030, he wants to derive 50% of the state's electricity from renewable sources, reduce petroleum in cars and trucks by 50% and double the efficiency of existing buildings. In his speech he said, ""All of this is a very tall order. It means that we continue to transform our grid, our transportation system and even our communities."" He continue saying, ""I envision a wide range of initiatives, more distributed power, expanded rooftop solar, micro grids, and energy and balance market, battery storage, the full integration of information technology and electrical distribution and millions of electric and low carbon vehicles."" The state's ambition and overall direction is clear. In broad strokes, we at Edison have been painting a similar picture of the future of the power system. Importantly, our growth strategy is aligned accordingly. Of course, the devils in the details. Some of the regulatory framework to implement this vision will require legislative action in and that process has already started in Sacramento. We will be actively engaged on the legislative front. One of our larger priorities will be achieving policy goals at the lowest cost to customers. We see the need to expand California's Renewable Portfolio Standard beyond the current regime of only recognizing large-scale wholesale contracted projects to recognize the benefits of distributed generation, energy efficiency and electric vehicle charging. The 3-year General Rate Case cycle provides a broad framework to incorporate other initiatives such as the Distribution Resource Plan required to be filed this summer. The CPUC recently issued its final guidance on the distribution plan elements. We anticipate that our plan will create something of a road map for the distribution system investments at Southern California Edison needed to realize the governor's vison. Some elements of the plan are already in process, including initiatives on energy storage, residential rate design and electric vehicle charging. California's commitment to creating a low carbon economy does not necessarily conflict with SCE's core mission of delivering safe, reliable and affordable electricity. SCE's current General Rate Case will establish the revenue requirement and scope of work to achieve both. The record for the rate case was completed in late January. The GRC is now in the hands of administrative law judges to develop a proposed decision. We expect a decision sometime in 2015. So with that, I'll now turn the call over to Jim Scilacci."
301891,282079534,769117,"Edison International, Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 24, 2015",2015-02-24,"Earnings Calls","Edison International","Executives","Thanks, Ted. Good afternoon, everyone. My comments will cover fourth quarter and full year 2014 earnings, our updated capital spending in rate base forecast and cost of capital. As we have previously stated, we will not provide 2015 earnings guidance unti",1695,"Thanks, Ted. Good afternoon, everyone. My comments will cover fourth quarter and full year 2014 earnings, our updated capital spending in rate base forecast and cost of capital. As we have previously stated, we will not provide 2015 earnings guidance until SCE receives its 2015 General Rate Case decision. In this presentation, I will, however, discuss assumptions relevant to our 2015 earnings. 
Please turn to Page 2. In the fourth quarter of 2014, SCE earned $1.09 per share or $0.30 ahead of last year. This increase was driven by many of the same factors we have been seeing during 2014, including higher revenue of $0.28 partially offset by depreciation of $0.08, net tax benefits and other items of $0.04 and O&M savings of $0.05. There are 2 -- there also are 2 items of note that are included in the $0.28 of higher revenue and both of them were not included in our updated earnings guidance that we provided last October. First, we recorded $0.05 of additional revenue from resolution of an open item from our 2012 GRC decision. During 2014, SCE team and IRS private letter ruling regarding appropriate treatment of net operating loss carryforwards. The net effect of the ruling was to increase CPUC rate base in revenues. In November, we obtain a CPUC approval authorizing the additional revenues. Second, you may recall that during the third quarter call, we thought that the energy efficiency awards might be delayed until 2015. As things turned out we received our award in December and it amounted to $0.04 per share. In the fourth quarter, the net SONGS impact on core earnings was a positive $0.02 per share compared to last year. Our fourth quarter results include recognition of revenue for the rate of return on the SONGS regulatory assets. We also had the $0.05 benefit some lower O&M cost, the largest item was lower severance expense. Taxes and other items were a net benefit of $0.04 per share led by $0.07 in higher income tax benefits. Most of this relates to repair deductions that we've talked about previously. At the Edison International parent company level, results were a loss of $0.01 per share compared to income of $0.02 per share last year, which is mainly due to the income from Edison Capital and tax benefits. The loss of $0.01 this quarter includes higher income from Edison Capital and lower tax benefits. As we have indicated, Edison Capital's remaining low-income housing portfolio continues to wind down as units were sold. 
Turning to noncore items. SCE recorded a net $0.08 per share benefit during the fourth quarter from our revised estimate of the impact of the SONGS settlement. There are a number of items that make up the $0.08 including the return on SONGS regulatory asset from April 1 through September 30 of this year and accrual of contribution University of California for greenhouse gas research. At the parent, we also recorded $0.12 per share benefit in discontinued operations related to resolution of uncertain tax positions from settlement of our 2003 to 2006 federal income tax years and other tax impacts related to EME. As a reminder, EIX has net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards from EME that will be monetized in future years as part of our settlement with EME creditors. These tax benefits were approximately $1.1 billion at year-end. We also recorded $0.01 per share net benefit of the holding company related to allocation of income tax attributes to tax equity investors and projects developed by SoCore energy on what is called a hypothetical liquidation at book value or HLBD accounting method. Because HLBD accounting procedures produces income not related to project portfolio performance, we classify this as income as noncore. 
Please turn to Page 3. For the full year, core earnings were $4.59 per share versus $1 -- excuse me, $3.80 in 2013. For SCE, this improvement is mainly due to rate base growth. Year-end 2014 rate base was $23.3 billion, a $2.2 billion increase over the prior year. In addition, SCE recorded higher net tax benefits totaling $0.16 per share principally from repair deductions and resolution of uncertain tax positions. A number of other smaller items complete the picture. At the holding company, core losses were comparable at last -- excuse me, to last year at $0.09 per share. This remains lower than expected primarily due to higher income from Edison Capital. I know many of you are interested in tracking our earnings relative to our guidance so I'll cover that next. 
Please turn to Page 4. This slide shows a reconciliation of core earnings to guidance over the full year period. I will focus on the final 3 months of the year that took us from $4.30 midpoint guidance in October to actual core earnings of $4.59. As you can see, the increase is $0.29. First, there's $0.10 per share of income tax benefits from additional repair and cost of removal deductions recorded in the fourth quarter. Next are the 2 items I mentioned earlier, the $0.05 per share benefit from the revised determination of rate base and $0.04 of energy efficiency awards. The balance relates to cost savings and a number of small items at $0.05 per share. Holding company core results were $0.04 per share better than expected primarily due to Edison Capital's affordable housing project revenues. 
Please turn to Page 5. SCE's capital spending forecast changed slightly from our prior forecast due to timing of transmission capital expenditures. Actual 2014 capital spending totaled $4 billion, $100 million below our forecast. Our outlook for 2015 spending is down $100 million and up $200 million in 2016. Please note we continue to use the 12% variability between the range and request capital's expenditure forecast. 
Please turn to Page 6. Our rate base forecast remains consistent with the 7% to 9% compound annual growth rates. Based on a number of changes, we revised downward our rate base forecast by a net $300 million by 2017. As the slide shows, this reflects an average reduction of $400 million from bonus depreciation and average reduction of $100 million for timing of transmission spending and a positive $200 million adjustment upward to update deferred taxes related to our smart connect project. Please note that the capital spending and rate base forecast do not include electric vehicle charging, energy storage or distribution resource plan expenditures. The lion's share of this spending, future spending will likely occur beyond the current forecast period. 
Please turn to Page 7. This page updates the interest rate trends for the CPUC cost of capital trigger mechanism. Recently, the CPUC approved a 1-year extension of our cost of capital mechanism. We must now file our 2017 cost of capital application in April 2016. The trigger mechanism will remain in effect from 2016. However, based on the movement of the Moody's BWA bond in the -- it seems unlikely that the current return on common equity of 10.45% would change for 2016. Our FERC filed rate settlement remains in place through the end of 2017. Under the settlement, the return on common equity can be reopened after June 30 of this year. 
Next, I'd like to touch on some financial considerations related to 2015 earnings given the absence of guidance. Please turn to Page 8. On this page, we have included some important factors to consider in our earnings estimates until we can provide formal guidance. The capital spending and rate base forecast are taken from Pages 4 and 5 of this presentation. Both CPUC and FERC return on common equity remain unchanged at 10.45%. We have some carryover items on energy efficiency awards from prior years. The potential earnings opportunity for 2015 is up to $0.05 rather than the more typical $0.03 for a single year. Please keep in mind that some of the carryover items will likely be contested by other parties, and there's no assurance that energy efficiency earnings will be approved. Another positive item is the completion in January of the SONGS regulatory asset financing. The approved settlement led SCE finance this asset with 100% debt. The settlement also requires that we share with our customers the cost savings of these financing if the rate is below the 2.62% return on the regulatory asset. SCE completed this financing with a weighted average cost of debt of 2.2%. The blended average rate increases over time due to debt amortization. After the cost sharing with customers, there's a very modest earnings benefit. However, the financing has the added benefit of ultimately freeing up approximately $400 million of common equity. As we recover the regulatory asset, this amount will decline over time. At year-end 2014, SCE's 13-month weighted average equity ratio for regulatory purposes was 48.4%. The SONGS regulatory asset totaled $1.288 billion at year-end 2014. Of this amount, $919 million earns the 2.62% return, $345 million earns a commercial paper rate and the balance earns no return. For 2015 and beyond, we believe that the return on SONGS regulatory asset will roughly match the financing cost. I will also remind you that our quarterly earnings results will not reflect the revenues requested in the 2015 GRC and, accordingly, won't have the typical profile during the year. Until we receive final GRC decision, we plan to record revenues based on the 2014 authorized revenue requirement. 
Please turn to Page 9. The next slide highlights the details of our dividend policy that Ted has already touched on. I'd like to reinforce our view that EIX has one of the better opportunities on large large-cap activities with rate base, earnings and dividend growth. 
Please turn to Page 10. This last slide captures our strategic framework. Ted has touched on many of the major points already. To summarize, we are very focused on delivering on our organic growth opportunity. We have a good growth visibility from our we're spending and the prospect for continued growth from a number of initiatives. However, as we have previously said, we will continue to work to optimize our cost structure and improve our operational efficiency. Thanks. I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions."

That is at least the initial filing is not an investment filing. It's really a description of what needs to be done and from our view. Others will have, I'm sure, different views. We will subsequently follow that up with probably some type of application or alternatively will include in our 2018 in general rate case request the actual expenditures associated with this new plan. And from overall perspective stepping back and thinking about our capital expenditures, we've said that capital expenditures on average have been running about $4 billion a year. And we don't want to suggest that these new programs either we'll take it up or drop it down. We think that generally going forward, capital expenditures will stay in that same zone even with these new initiatives. So I'll pause there and turn it over to Pedro for additional elaboration, if you want to add anything."

Very broadly speaking as I kind of indicated in my opening comments, we see the potential in competitive businesses to serve customers outside of 50,000 square mile territory of Southern California Edison. Most of the word that we've done up to this point has been focused more on commercial and industrial customers outside of the territory. Second to that, I would say our various potential electrification initiatives, so this would be projects that with further electrification we think that actually fits in to a lot of effort across the country but particularly here in California, the move towards a little carbon economy moving towards higher levels of electrification and say the transportation sector, goods movement, water, some of the other areas, all of that helps move the economy towards a lower carbon footprint. So those are kind of the second bucket of areas that we continue to look at. Final point I'll make is we tried to be fairly high level about the things that we're looking at on that side. I think you know us well enough by now we don't kind of come up with a lot of fanfare upfront. We'd rather see what we can deliver and then talk about that. So at this point, mostly effort it is on the distributed generation activities around SoCore and how that fits into our kind of broader strategy on the commercial and industrial customer side."

I think what we're attempting to say and I struggled with it in an earlier question, my response was I think the $4 billion is probably in the right zone, and we'll just have to see how things unfold. If you go through the piece parts, distribution has been stepping up in the total level of expenditures over the last several GRCs, and we are still working to get our placement rates to levels that we think we need to be at to maintain reliability of the electric system. So you could see distribution step up some of from where we are today. Transmission is more -- it's related to some of these large projects that we have flowing through and we have very modest transmission spending in years past and that stepped up as a result of all the renewable interconnections that we were doing. Generation is typically done a very small part of our overall equation. It was really just replacement capital expenditures mainly at our nuclear plants and it's dropped down to maybe about $100 million a year. So going forward, we'll have to see as we lay out the distribution resources plan, how significant and how fast the commission would want to move to make some of these improvements. We put out numbers on the electric vehicle charging. It's a little over -- it's approximately $350 million over a multi-year period of time. There's some storage expenditures. So I think it's best and safest to assume that $4 billion is probably the appropriate level until we can get more information in the public domain."

You asked about the application for rehearing and a federal lawsuit. I'm taking one at a time. An application for rehearing was filed by the coalition to decommission San Onofre and that was filed in the end of last year, mid-December 2014. They're basically, asking for California Public Utility Commission to reconsider their decision approving the SONGS settlement. And the basis for their request is a bunch of alleged procedural irregularities in the proceeding undertaken by the CPUC. It's our review that there really is no legitimate basis for the CPUC to overturn the settlement based upon the theories that they answered by the coalition to decommission San Onofre. But, of course, that's for the CPUC to decide. All the parties to the SONGS settlement have filed a joint response in early January rejecting the request for rehearing. The CPUC did not operate under a firm deadline to respond but they normally respond within 3 to 5 months, so we should expect to hear from the CPUC by the middle of March to the middle of May. Separately, another plaintiff, Citizen Oversight, who happens to be represented by the same lawyer who represents the coalition for the commission San Onofre filed a federal court action down in San Diego. And basically, raised some constitutional theories that the SONGS atonement was an impermissible taking off rate payer property. That suit was filed in November of 2014. Both we and the CPUC filed motions to dismiss at the end of January, to be some further paperwork back and forth as that reply and we again reply in February and March. And if all goes well we expect a decision from the federal court in April of 2015, so in a couple of months."

We resolved 2 major uncertainties, Edison Mission Energy and San Onofre. We meaningfully increased the dividend. We continue to fulfill the long-term growth opportunity at Southern California Edison through our wires-focused investment strategy that supports California's environmental and growth objectives, and we continue to selectively pursue growth opportunities that allow us to serve additional customers outside of SCE's service territory. Most gratifying to me is that we delivered on what we told investors we would do. I'm proud of this leadership team and the outstanding work of our employees. That said, we fully recognize that 2014 is over, and we are in the new year. We need to build on the performance of 2014 and continue to build value. With the strong fourth quarter, full year 2014 core earnings were $4.59 per share, an increase of 21% over the previous year. This result was well above our updated guidance from last fall. Jim Scilacci will cover more of the details in his comments. 
The settlements reached on the EME bankruptcy and the SONGS order instituting investigation positioned us to move forward decisively in a time of tremendous change in our industry. The unanimous approval by the California Public Utilities Commission of the SONG settlement agreement last November demonstrated that it is possible to resolve complex and important regulatory matters through settlement. The settlement was the product of tough negotiations among the initial settling parties: The Utility Reform Network or TURN, the Office of Ratepayer Advocate and the 2 utilities. And later, other intervenors signed on to the settlement. The settlement has been widely supported as fair and balanced. SCE is now proceeding with implementation of the approved agreement. We are also deeply engaged in the planning and early stages of decommissioning the plant. 
SCE will continue to work aggressively to maximize potential financial recoveries from insurers and from Mitsubishi Heavy Industries. I'm hopeful SCE will be able to resolve the insurance claims this year. Under the provisions of the settlement agreement, virtually all insurance proceeds, if any, will go to customers. The arbitration process with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries must follow International Chamber of Commerce rules, which means it will be a slower process. I don't expect any decision until 2016. The MHI arbitration proceeding is confidential, so we won't be able to say much. However, we continue to assert the claims we first presented to the International Chamber of Commerce in 2013. 
Our nearly 18% dividend increase in early December underscores our optimism about the future and our commitment to bringing our dividend payout closer to that of the industry. We expect to extend our record of 11 years of annual dividend increases while stepping up the pace of dividend growth to exceed that of earnings. This will allow us to return to our target payout ratio of 45% to 55% of earnings in steps over time. 
Let me now provide some longer-term thoughts. On January 5, in his state of the state speech, Governor Brown outlined his broad goals for the next stage in addressing climate change. By 2030, he wants to derive 50% of the state's electricity from renewable sources, reduce petroleum in cars and trucks by 50% and double the efficiency of existing buildings. In his speech he said, ""All of this is a very tall order. It means that we continue to transform our grid, our transportation system and even our communities."" He continued saying, ""I envision a wide range of initiatives: more distributed power, expanded rooftop solar, microgrids, an energy imbalance market, battery storage, the full integration of information technology and electrical distribution and millions of electric and low-carbon vehicles."" 
The state's ambition and overall direction is clear. In broad strokes, we, at Edison, have been painting a similar picture of the future of the power system. Importantly, our growth strategy is aligned accordingly. Of course, the devil is in the details. Some of the regulatory framework to implement this vision will require legislative action, and that process has already started in Sacramento. We will be actively engaged on the legislative front. One of our larger priorities will be achieving policy goals at the lowest cost to customers. We see the need to expand California's Renewable Portfolio Standard beyond the current regime of only recognizing large-scale wholesale contracted projects to recognize the benefits of distributed generation, energy efficiency and electric vehicle charging. 
The 3-year General Rate Case cycle provides a broad framework to incorporate other initiatives such as the Distribution Resource Plan required to be filed this summer. The CPUC recently issued its final guidance on the distribution plan elements. We anticipate that our plan will create something of a roadmap for the distribution system investments at Southern California Edison needed to realize the governor's vision. Some elements of the plan are already in process, including initiatives on energy storage, residential rate design and electric vehicle charging. 
California's commitment to creating a low-carbon economy does not necessarily conflict with SCE's core mission of delivering safe, reliable and affordable electricity. SCE's current General Rate Case will establish the revenue requirement and scope of work to achieve both. The record for the rate case was completed in late January. The GRC is now in the hands of administrative law judges to develop a proposed decision. We expect a decision some time in 2015. 
So with that, I'll now turn the call over to Jim Scilacci."
301891,282079534,769275,"Edison International, Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 24, 2015",2015-02-24,"Earnings Calls","Edison International","Executives","Thanks, Ted. Good afternoon, everyone. My comments will cover fourth quarter and full year 2014 earnings, our updated capital spending and rate base forecast and cost of capital. As we have previously stated, we will not provide 2015 earnings guidance unt",1704,"Thanks, Ted. Good afternoon, everyone. My comments will cover fourth quarter and full year 2014 earnings, our updated capital spending and rate base forecast and cost of capital. As we have previously stated, we will not provide 2015 earnings guidance until SCE receives its 2015 General Rate Case decision. In this presentation, I will, however, discuss assumptions relevant to our 2015 earnings. 
Please turn to Page 2. In the fourth quarter of 2014, SCE earned $1.09 per share or $0.30 ahead of last year. This increase was driven by many of the same factors we have been seeing during 2014, including higher revenue of $0.28, partially offset by depreciation of $0.08, net tax benefits and other items of $0.04 and O&M savings of $0.05. There are 2 -- there also are 2 items of note that are included in the $0.28 of higher revenue, and both of them were not included in our updated earnings guidance that we provided last October. 
First, we recorded $0.05 of additional revenue from resolution of an open item from our 2012 GRC decision. During 2014, SCE obtained an IRS private letter ruling regarding appropriate treatment of net operating loss carryforwards. The net effect of the ruling was to increase CPUC rate base in revenues. In November, we obtained a CPUC approval authorizing the additional revenues. 
Second, you may recall that during the third quarter call, we thought that the energy efficiency awards might be delayed until 2015. As things turned out, we received our award in December and it amounted to $0.04 per share. In the fourth quarter, the net SONGS impact on core earnings was a positive $0.02 per share compared to last year. Our fourth quarter results include recognition of revenue for the rate of return on the SONGS regulatory asset. We also had a $0.05 benefit from lower O&M costs. The largest item was lower severance expense. Taxes and other items were a net benefit of $0.04 per share led by $0.07 in higher income tax benefits. Most of this relates to repair deductions that we've talked about previously. At the Edison International parent company level, results were a loss of $0.01 per share compared to income of $0.02 per share last year, which is mainly due to the income from Edison Capital and tax benefits. The loss of $0.01 this quarter includes higher income from Edison Capital and lower tax benefits. As we have indicated, Edison Capital's remaining low-income housing portfolio continues to wind down as units were sold. 
Turning to non-core items. SCE recorded a net $0.08 per share of benefit during the fourth quarter from a revised estimate of the impact of the SONGS settlement. There are a number of items that make up the $0.08, including the return on SONGS regulatory asset from April 1 through September 30 of this year and accrual of a contribution of the University of California for greenhouse gas research. 
At the parent, we also recorded $0.12 per share of benefit in discontinued operations related to resolution of uncertain tax positions from settlement of our 2003 to 2006 federal income tax years and other tax impacts related to EME. As a reminder, EIX has net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards from EME that will be monetized in future years as part of our settlement with EME creditors. These tax benefits were approximately $1.1 billion at year-end. We also recorded $0.01 per share net benefit of the holding company related to allocation of income tax attributes to tax equity investors and projects developed by SoCore Energy on what is called the Hypothetical Liquidation at Book Value or HLBV accounting method. Because HLBV accounting procedures produces income not related to project portfolio performance, we classify this income as non-core. 
Please turn to Page 3. For the full year, core earnings were $4.59 per share versus $1 -- excuse me, $3.80 in 2013. For SCE, this improvement is mainly due to rate base growth. Year-end 2014 rate base was $23.3 billion, a $2.2 billion increase over the prior year. In addition, SCE recorded higher net tax benefits totaling $0.16 per share, principally from repair deductions and resolution of uncertain tax positions. A number of other smaller items complete the picture. At the holding company, core losses were comparable at last -- excuse me, to last year at $0.09 per share. This remains lower than expected, primarily due to higher income from Edison Capital. I know many of you are interested in tracking our earnings relative to our guidance so I'll cover that next. 
Please turn to Page 4. This slide shows a reconciliation of core earnings to guidance over the full year period. I will focus on the final 3 months of the year that took us from $4.30 midpoint guidance in October to actual core earnings of $4.59. As you can see, the increase is $0.29. First, there's $0.10 per share of income tax benefits from additional repair and cost of removal deductions recorded in the fourth quarter. Next are the 2 items I mentioned earlier, the $0.05 per share benefit from the revised determination of rate base and $0.04 of energy efficiency awards. The balance relates to cost savings and a number of small items at $0.05 per share. Holding company core results were $0.04 per share better than expected, primarily due to Edison Capital's affordable housing project revenues. 
Please turn to Page 5. SCE's capital spending forecast changed slightly from our prior forecast due to timing of transmission capital expenditures. Actual 2014 capital spending totaled $4 billion, $100 million below our forecast. Our outlook for 2015 spending is down $100 million and up $200 million in 2016. Please note we continue to use the 12% variability between the range and request capital expenditure forecast. 
Please turn to Page 6. Our rate base forecast remains consistent with the 7% to 9% compound annual growth rates. Based on a number of changes, we revised downward our rate base forecast by a net $300 million by 2017. As the slide shows, this reflects an average reduction of $400 million from bonus depreciation, an average reduction of $100 million for timing of transmission spending and a positive $200 million adjustment upward to update deferred taxes related to our SmartConnect project. Please note that the capital spending and rate base forecast do not include electric vehicle charging, energy storage or Distribution Resource Plan expenditures. The lion's share of this spending -- future spending will likely occur beyond the current forecast period. 
Please turn to Page 7. This page updates the interest rate trends for the CPUC cost of capital trigger mechanism. Recently, the CPUC approved a 1-year extension of our cost of capital mechanism. We must now file our 2017 cost of capital application in April 2016. The trigger mechanism will remain in effect for 2016. However, based on the movement of the Moody's Baa bond index thus far, it seems unlikely that the current return on common equity of 10.45% would change for 2016. Our FERC filed rate settlement remains in place through the end of 2017. Under the settlement, the return on common equity can be reopened after June 30 of this year. 
Next, I'd like to touch on some financial considerations related to 2015 earnings, given the absence of guidance. Please turn to Page 8. On this page, we have included some important factors to consider in refining [ph] our earnings estimates until we can provide formal guidance. The capital spending and rate base forecast are taken from Pages 4 and 5 of this presentation. Both CPUC and FERC return on common equity remain unchanged at 10.45%. We have some carryover items on energy efficiency awards from prior years. The potential earnings opportunity for 2015 is up to $0.05 rather than a more typical $0.03 for a single year. Please keep in mind that some of the carryover items will likely be contested by other parties, and there's no assurance that energy efficiency earnings will be approved. 
Another positive item is the completion in January of the SONGS regulatory asset financing. The approved settlement let SCE finance this asset with 100% debt. The settlement also requires that we share with our customers the cost savings of these financing if the rate is below the 2.62% return on the regulatory asset. SCE completed this financing with a weighted average cost of debt of 2.2%. The blended average rate increases over time due to debt amortization. After the cost sharing with customers, there's a very modest earnings benefit. However, the financing has the added benefit of ultimately freeing up approximately $400 million of common equity. As we recover the regulatory asset, this amount will decline over time. 
At year-end 2014, SCE's 13-month weighted average equity ratio for regulatory purposes was 48.4%. The SONGS regulatory asset totaled $1.288 billion at year-end 2014. Of this amount, $919 million earns the 2.62% return, $345 million earns a commercial paper rate and the balance earns no return. For 2015 and beyond, we believe that the return on SONGS regulatory asset will roughly match the financing cost. I will also remind you that our quarterly earnings results will not reflect the revenues requested in the 2015 GRC and, accordingly, won't have the typical profile during the year. Until we receive a final GRC decision, we plan to record revenues based on the 2014 authorized revenue requirement. 
Please turn to Page 9. The next slide highlights the details of our dividend policy that Ted has already touched on. I'd like to reinforce our view that EIX has one of the better opportunities among the large-cap utilities for rate base, earnings and dividend growth. 
Please turn to Page 10. This last slide captures our strategic framework. Ted has touched on many of the major points already. To summarize, we are very focused on delivering on our organic growth opportunity. We have good growth visibility from our wires spending and the prospect for continued growth from a number of new initiatives. Moreover, we -- as we have previously said, we will continue to work to optimize our cost structure and improve our operational efficiency. 
Thanks. I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions."

This is Jim Scilacci, then I'll turn it over to Pedro for some additional comments. So the filing that's coming up in the second quarter or first part of the third quarter, we have a series of questions that the PUC has asked us to address. A lot of them is really what's happening in the system and how we plan to address it to encourage and incorporate more distributed energy resources in the distribution system. That is, at least the initial filing is not an investment filing. It's really a description of what needs to be done and from our view. Others will have, I'm sure, different views. We will subsequently follow that up with probably some type of application or alternatively will include in our 2018 General Rate Case request the actual expenditures associated with this new plan. And from an overall perspective stepping back and thinking about our capital expenditures, we've said that capital expenditures on average have been running about $4 billion a year. And we don't want to suggest that these new programs either will take it up or drop it down. We think that generally going forward, capital expenditures will stay in that same zone even with these new initiatives. So I'll pause there and turn it over to Pedro for additional elaboration, if you'd like to add anything."

And so there's -- a piece of this is mechanical but a broader piece around how does the grid continue to evolve. I think it will raise questions and drive some insights on what are some of the technologies and what's the evolution of that grid over time. And then as Jim said, we haven't determined this yet, but we'll have a -- the option of either including investment opportunities that we see in our future rate case cycles. Potentially, there might be an opportunity to do a separate filing. We saw a very pressing near-term need, but that's work that we have under way right now in determining what those next steps are and, really, in developing the filing for July 1."

Very broadly speaking, as I kind of indicated in my opening comments, we see the potential in competitive businesses to serve customers outside of the 50,000 square mile territory of Southern California Edison. Most of the work that we've done up to this point has been focused more on commercial and industrial customers outside of the territory. Second to that, I would say our various potential electrification initiatives, so this would be projects that with further electrification, we think that actually fits in to a lot of the effort across the country. But particularly here in California, the move towards a low-carbon economy, moving towards higher levels of electrification and, say, the transportation sector, goods movement, water, some of the other areas, all of that helps move the economy towards a lower-carbon footprint. So those are kind of the second -- the second bucket of areas that we're continuing to look at. Final point I'll make is we've tried to be fairly high level about the things that we're looking at on that side. I think you know us well enough by now. We don't like to kind of come out with a lot of fanfare upfront. We'd rather see what we can deliver and then talk about that. So at this point, most the effort it is on the distributed generation activities around SoCore and how that fits into our kind of broader strategy on the commercial and industrial customer side."

I think what we're attempting to say and I struggled with it in an earlier question, my response was I think the $4 billion is probably in the right zone, and we'll just have to see how things unfold. If you go through the piece parts, distribution has been stepping up in the total level of expenditures over the last several GRCs, and we're still working to get our replacement rates to levels that we think we need to be at to maintain the reliability of the electric system. So you could see distribution step up, somewhat more from where we are today. Transmission is more -- it's related to some of these large projects that we have flowing through, and we had very modest transmission spending in years past and that stepped up as a result of all the renewable interconnections that we were doing. Generation has typically been a very small part of our overall equation. It was really just replacement capital expenditures mainly at our nuclear plants, and it's dropped down to maybe about $100 million a year. So going forward, we'll have to see as we lay out the distribution resources plan how significant and how fast the commission would want to move to make some of these improvements. We put out numbers on the electric vehicle charging. It's a little over -- it's approximately $350 million over a multi-year period of time. There's some storage expenditures. So I think it's best and safest to assume that, that $4 billion is probably the appropriate level until we can get more information in the public domain."

I think a big consideration here is how fast you want to move towards modernizing the grid, converting it from largely electromechanical system to a much more digitized system, capable of two-way flows of electricity so on and so forth, all those stuff you've heard us talk about before. If you envision doing that over a 3- to 5-year period, then I think you'll probably be looking at higher numbers. If you envision doing that over a 5- to 7-year period, it temps down a little bit. If you envision doing it over a 10-year period, more modest yet. So I think a big component of trying to sort this through is the pace with which these investments get made, not just the absolute number."

But fundamentally, we kind of look at it as the core earnings power of the utility, and the dividend is tied to SCE's earnings, really, is the rate base model. So that's the way we tend to look at it. All of that said, we see continued significant growth in rate base and, therefore, we see good growth in earnings. And in order to move the payout ratio up, we expect the growth rate in dividend increases to be higher than the growth rate in earnings.

We've got 2 more payments of $200 million in September this year and September of next year for $400 million, and the whole source of repayment for a majority of the borrowings we have outstanding today really will be from the monetization of EME tax benefits. I said in my script we've got $1.1 billion of NOLs and tax credit carryforwards. And if we don't get an extension of bonus depreciation in '15, likely SCE will be fully taxable as it run off its NOLs and will be then paying taxes to the federal government. Bonus doesn't apply to state government -- state of California, so we're going to -- we're obviously paying taxes for the state, and then we'll start rapidly amortizing the EME benefits. One of the wildcards here that we'll have to consider, and Ted mentioned in his comments, if we do get resolution of the SONGS litigation with MHI, we would look to take an abandonment loss in the year that's resolved. We have to file a private letter ruling, and we'll take a write-off. And so that could affect the full timing of the monetization of tax benefits. But I think it's going to take out to '17, possibly in early '18, to fully amortize off the $1.1 billion of EME tax benefits."

In terms of affecting the business, I would say it doesn't really have a significant effect on the business. This is a fairly arcane area. But I would say, generally speaking, the ex parte rules, particularly on matters like the San Onofre matter, the OII, that's really designed to provide equal access to all parties to the proceeding with equal time. So it's I think one of the misconceptions, as in something like SONGS OII, that you're precluded from having conversations. You're not. It's just -- the rules are designed to make sure that if we have conversations with decision-makers that those are noticed, that those -- that we include in there how much time we spend with which decision-maker, so that all the other parties have the equal access, equal amount of time. That's the whole concept behind it. So I don't see any of this as hurting the ability to do business. It's complicated and cumbersome and sometimes kind of difficult on the interpretation of some of the specific provisions. But fundamentally, when it's -- when we have proceedings before the commission, we follow the rules. We go about doing the business the way it's really set up to do it. There's plenty of opportunity in all of those proceedings for all parties to be heard. That's the kind of the point of having these things before the commission. So I don't see any big element there.

You asked about the application for rehearing and a federal lawsuit. I'm taking one at a time. An application for rehearing was filed by the coalition to decommission San Onofre, and that was filed in the end of last year, mid-December 2014. They're basically asking for the California Public Utility Commission to reconsider their decision approving the SONGS settlement, and the basis for their request is a bunch of alleged procedural irregularities in the proceeding undertaken by the CPUC. It's our view that there really is no legitimate basis for the CPUC to overturn the settlement based upon the theories advanced by the coalition to decommission San Onofre. But of course, that's for the CPUC to decide. All the parties to the SONGS settlement have filed a joint response in early January rejecting the request for rehearing. The CPUC did not operate under a firm deadline to respond, but they normally respond within 3 to 5 months. So we should expect to hear from the CPUC by the middle of March to the middle of May. Separately, another plaintiff, Citizens' Oversight, who happens to be represented by the same lawyer who represents the coalition to decommission San Onofre, filed a federal court action down in San Diego and basically raised some constitutional theories that the SONGS settlement was an impermissible taking of ratepayer property. That suit was filed in November of 2014. Both we and the CPUC filed motions to dismiss at the end of January. There'll be some further paperwork back and forth as the plaintiff replies and we, again, reply in February and March. And if all goes well, we'd expect the decision from the federal court in April of 2015, so in a couple of months."

We resolved 2 major uncertainties, Edison Mission Energy and San Onofre. We meaningfully increased the dividend. We continue to fulfill the long-term growth opportunity at Southern California Edison through our wires-focused investment strategy that supports California's environmental and growth objectives, and we continue to selectively pursue growth opportunities that allow us to serve additional customers outside of SCE's service territory. Most gratifying to me is that we delivered on what we told investors we would do. I'm proud of this leadership team and the outstanding work of our employees. That said, we fully recognize that 2014 is over, and we are in the new year. We need to build on the performance of 2014 and continue to build value. With the strong fourth quarter, full year 2014 core earnings were $4.59 per share, an increase of 21% over the previous year. This result was well above our updated guidance from last fall. Jim Scilacci will cover more of the details in his comments. 
The settlements reached on the EME bankruptcy and the SONGS order instituting investigation positioned us to move forward decisively in a time of tremendous change in our industry. The unanimous approval by the California Public Utilities Commission of the SONG settlement agreement last November demonstrated that it is possible to resolve complex and important regulatory matters through settlement. The settlement was the product of tough negotiations among the initial settling parties: The Utility Reform Network or TURN, the Office of Ratepayer Advocate and the 2 utilities. And later, other intervenors signed on to the settlement. The settlement has been widely supported as fair and balanced. SCE is now proceeding with implementation of the approved agreement. We are also deeply engaged in the planning and early stages of decommissioning the plant. 
SCE will continue to work aggressively to maximize potential financial recoveries from insurers and from Mitsubishi Heavy Industries. I'm hopeful SCE will be able to resolve the insurance claims this year. Under the provisions of the settlement agreement, virtually all insurance proceeds, if any, will go to customers. The arbitration process with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries must follow International Chamber of Commerce rules, which means it will be a slower process. I don't expect any decision until 2016. The MHI arbitration proceeding is confidential, so we won't be able to say much. However, we continue to assert the claims we first presented to the International Chamber of Commerce in 2013. 
Our nearly 18% dividend increase in early December underscores our optimism about the future and our commitment to bringing our dividend payout closer to that of the industry. We expect to extend our record of 11 years of annual dividend increases while stepping up the pace of dividend growth to exceed that of earnings. This will allow us to return to our target payout ratio of 45% to 55% of earnings in steps over time. 
Let me now provide some longer-term thoughts. On January 5, in his state of the state speech, Governor Brown outlined his broad goals for the next stage in addressing climate change. By 2030, he wants to derive 50% of the state's electricity from renewable sources, reduce petroleum in cars and trucks by 50% and double the efficiency of existing buildings. In his speech he said, ""All of this is a very tall order. It means that we continue to transform our grid, our transportation system and even our communities."" He continued saying, ""I envision a wide range of initiatives: more distributed power, expanded rooftop solar, microgrids, an energy-in-balance market, battery storage, the full integration of information technology and electrical distribution and millions of electric and low-carbon vehicles."" 
The state's ambition and overall direction is clear. In broad strokes, we, at Edison, have been painting a similar picture of the future of the power system. Importantly, our growth strategy is aligned accordingly. Of course, the devil is in the details. Some of the regulatory framework to implement this vision will require legislative action, and that process has already started in Sacramento. We will be actively engaged on the legislative front. One of our larger priorities will be achieving policy goals at the lowest cost to customers. We see the need to expand California's Renewable Portfolio Standard beyond the current regime of only recognizing large-scale wholesale contracted projects to recognize the benefits of distributed generation, energy efficiency and electric vehicle charging. 
The 3-year General Rate Case cycle provides a broad framework to incorporate other initiatives such as the Distribution Resource Plan required to be filed this summer. The CPUC recently issued its final guidance on the distribution plan elements. We anticipate that our plan will create something of a roadmap for the distribution system investments at Southern California Edison needed to realize the governor's vision. Some elements of the plan are already in process, including initiatives on energy storage, residential rate design and electric vehicle charging. 
California's commitment to creating a low-carbon economy does not necessarily conflict with SCE's core mission of delivering safe, reliable and affordable electricity. SCE's current General Rate Case will establish the revenue requirement and scope of work to achieve both. The record for the rate case was completed in late January. The GRC is now in the hands of administrative law judges to develop a proposed decision. We expect a decision some time in 2015. 
So with that, I'll now turn the call over to Jim Scilacci."
301891,282079534,769328,"Edison International, Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 24, 2015",2015-02-24,"Earnings Calls","Edison International","Executives","Thanks, Ted. Good afternoon, everyone.

My comments will cover fourth quarter and full year 2014 earnings, our updated capital spending and rate base forecast and cost of capital. As we have previously stated, we will not provide 2015 earnings guidance until SCE receives its 2015 General Rate Case decision. In this presentation, I will, however, discuss assumptions relevant to our 2015 earnings. 
Please turn to Page 2. In the fourth quarter of 2014, SCE earned $1.09 per share or $0.30 ahead of last year. This increase was driven by many of the same factors we have been seeing during 2014, including higher revenue of $0.28, partially offset by depreciation of $0.08, net tax benefits and other items of $0.04 and O&M savings of $0.05. There are 2 -- there also are 2 items of note that are included in the $0.28 of higher revenue, and both of them were not included in our updated earnings guidance that we provided last October. 
First, we recorded $0.05 of additional revenue from resolution of an open item from our 2012 GRC decision. During 2014, SCE obtained an IRS private letter ruling regarding appropriate treatment of net operating loss carryforwards. The net effect of the ruling was to increase CPUC rate base in revenues. In November, we obtained a CPUC approval authorizing the additional revenues. 
Second, you may recall that during the third quarter call, we thought that the energy efficiency awards might be delayed until 2015. As things turned out, we received our award in December and it amounted to $0.04 per share. In the fourth quarter, the net SONGS impact on core earnings was a positive $0.02 per share compared to last year. Our fourth quarter results include recognition of revenue for the rate of return on the SONGS regulatory asset. We also had a $0.05 benefit from lower O&M costs. The largest item was lower severance expense. Taxes and other items were a net benefit of $0.04 per share led by $0.07 in higher income tax benefits. Most of this relates to repair deductions that we've talked about previously. At the Edison International parent company level, results were a loss of $0.01 per share compared to income of $0.02 per share last year, which is mainly due to the income from Edison Capital and tax benefits. The loss of $0.01 this quarter includes higher income from Edison Capital and lower tax benefits. As we have indicated, Edison Capital's remaining low-income housing portfolio continues to wind down as units were sold. 
Turning to non-core items. SCE recorded a net $0.08 per share of benefit during the fourth quarter from a revised estimate of the impact of the SONGS settlement. There are a number of items that make up the $0.08, including the return on SONGS regulatory asset from April 1 through September 30 of this year and accrual of a contribution of the University of California for greenhouse gas research. 
At the parent, we also recorded $0.12 per share of benefit in discontinued operations related to resolution of uncertain tax positions from settlement of our 2003 to 2006 federal income tax years and other tax impacts related to EME. As a reminder, EIX has net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards from EME that will be monetized in future years as part of our settlement with EME creditors. These tax benefits were approximately $1.1 billion at year-end. We also recorded $0.01 per share net benefit of the holding company related to allocation of income tax attributes to tax equity investors and projects developed by SoCore Energy on what is called the Hypothetical Liquidation at Book Value or HLBV accounting method. Because HLBV accounting procedures produces income not related to project portfolio performance, we classify this income as non-core. 
Please turn to Page 3. For the full year, core earnings were $4.59 per share versus $1 -- excuse me, $3.80 in 2013. For SCE, this improvement is mainly due to rate base growth. Year-end 2014 rate base was $23.3 billion, a $2.2 billion increase over the prior year. In addition, SCE recorded higher net tax benefits totaling $0.16 per share, principally from repair deductions and resolution of uncertain tax positions. A number of other smaller items complete the picture. At the holding company, core losses were comparable at last -- excuse me, to last year at $0.09 per share. This remains lower than expected, primarily due to higher income from Edison Capital. I know many of you are interested in tracking our earnings relative to our guidance so I'll cover that next. 
Please turn to Page 4. This slide shows a reconciliation of core earnings to guidance over the full year period. I will focus on the final 3 months of the year that took us from $4.30 midpoint guidance in October to actual core earnings of $4.59. As you can see, the increase is $0.29. First, there's $0.10 per share of income tax benefits from additional repair and cost of removal deductions recorded in the fourth quarter. Next are the 2 items I mentioned earlier, the $0.05 per share benefit from the revised determination of rate base and $0.04 of energy efficiency awards. The balance relates to cost savings and a number of small items at $0.05 per share. Holding company core results were $0.04 per share better than expected, primarily due to Edison Capital's affordable housing project revenues. 
Please turn to Page 5. SCE's capital spending forecast changed slightly from our prior forecast due to timing of transmission capital expenditures. Actual 2014 capital spending totaled $4 billion, $100 million below our forecast. Our outlook for 2015 spending is down $100 million and up $200 million in 2016. Please note we continue to use the 12% variability between the range and request capital expenditure forecast. 
Please turn to Page 6. Our rate base forecast remains consistent with the 7% to 9% compound annual growth rates. Based on a number of changes, we revised downward our rate base forecast by a net $300 million by 2017. As the slide shows, this reflects an average reduction of $400 million from bonus depreciation, an average reduction of $100 million for timing of transmission spending and a positive $200 million adjustment upward to update deferred taxes related to our SmartConnect project. Please note that the capital spending and rate base forecast do not include electric vehicle charging, energy storage or Distribution Resource Plan expenditures. The lion's share of this spending -- future spending will likely occur beyond the current forecast period. 
Please turn to Page 7. This page updates the interest rate trends for the CPUC cost of capital trigger mechanism. Recently, the CPUC approved a 1-year extension of our cost of capital mechanism. We must now file our 2017 cost of capital application in April 2016. The trigger mechanism will remain in effect for 2016. However, based on the movement of the Moody's Baa bond index thus far, it seems unlikely that the current return on common equity of 10.45% would change for 2016. Our FERC filed rate settlement remains in place through the end of 2017. Under the settlement, the return on common equity can be reopened after June 30 of this year. 
Next, I'd like to touch on some financial considerations related to 2015 earnings, given the absence of guidance. Please turn to Page 8. On this page, we have included some important factors to consider in refining [ph] our earnings estimates until we can provide formal guidance. The capital spending and rate base forecast are taken from Pages 4 and 5 of this presentation. Both CPUC and FERC return on common equity remain unchanged at 10.45%. We have some carryover items on energy efficiency awards from prior years. The potential earnings opportunity for 2015 is up to $0.05 rather than a more typical $0.03 for a single year. Please keep in mind that some of the carryover items will likely be contested by other parties, and there's no assurance that energy efficiency earnings will be approved. 
Another positive item is the completion in January of the SONGS regulatory asset financing. The approved settlement let SCE finance this asset with 100% debt. The settlement also requires that we share with our customers the cost savings of these financing if the rate is below the 2.62% return on the regulatory asset. SCE completed this financing with a weighted average cost of debt of 2.2%. The blended average rate increases over time due to debt amortization. After the cost sharing with customers, there's a very modest earnings benefit. However, the financing has the added benefit of ultimately freeing up approximately $400 million of common equity. As we recover the regulatory asset, this amount will decline over time. 
At year-end 2014, SCE's 13-month weighted average equity ratio for regulatory purposes was 48.4%. The SONGS regulatory asset totaled $1.288 billion at year-end 2014. Of this amount, $919 million earns the 2.62% return, $345 million earns a commercial paper rate and the balance earns no return. For 2015 and beyond, we believe that the return on SONGS regulatory asset will roughly match the financing cost. I will also remind you that our quarterly earnings results will not reflect the revenues requested in the 2015 GRC and, accordingly, won't have the typical profile during the year. Until we receive a final GRC decision, we plan to record revenues based on the 2014 authorized revenue requirement. 
Please turn to Page 9. The next slide highlights the details of our dividend policy that Ted has already touched on. I'd like to reinforce our view that EIX has one of the better opportunities among the large-cap utilities for rate base, earnings and dividend growth. 
Please turn to Page 10. This last slide captures our strategic framework. Ted has touched on many of the major points already. To summarize, we are very focused on delivering on our organic growth opportunity. We have good growth visibility from our wires spending and the prospect for continued growth from a number of new initiatives. Moreover, we -- as we have previously said, we will continue to work to optimize our cost structure and improve our operational efficiency. 
Thanks. I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions."

That is, at least the initial filing is not an investment filing. It's really a description of what needs to be done and from our view. Others will have, I'm sure, different views. We will subsequently follow that up with probably some type of application or alternatively will include in our 2018 General Rate Case request the actual expenditures associated with this new plan. And from an overall perspective stepping back and thinking about our capital expenditures, we've said that capital expenditures on average have been running about $4 billion a year. And we don't want to suggest that these new programs either will take it up or drop it down. We think that generally going forward, capital expenditures will stay in that same zone even with these new initiatives.

Most of the work that we've done up to this point has been focused more on commercial and industrial customers outside of the territory. Second to that, I would say our various potential electrification initiatives, so this would be projects that with further electrification, we think that actually fits in to a lot of the effort across the country. But particularly here in California, the move towards a low-carbon economy, moving towards higher levels of electrification and, say, the transportation sector, goods movement, water, some of the other areas, all of that helps move the economy towards a lower-carbon footprint. So those are kind of the second -- the second bucket of areas that we're continuing to look at. Final point I'll make is we've tried to be fairly high level about the things that we're looking at on that side. I think you know us well enough by now. We don't like to kind of come out with a lot of fanfare upfront. We'd rather see what we can deliver and then talk about that.

I think what we're attempting to say and I struggled with it in an earlier question, my response was I think the $4 billion is probably in the right zone, and we'll just have to see how things unfold. If you go through the piece parts, distribution has been stepping up in the total level of expenditures over the last several GRCs, and we're still working to get our replacement rates to levels that we think we need to be at to maintain the reliability of the electric system. So you could see distribution step up, somewhat more from where we are today. Transmission is more -- it's related to some of these large projects that we have flowing through, and we had very modest transmission spending in years past and that stepped up as a result of all the renewable interconnections that we were doing. Generation has typically been a very small part of our overall equation. It was really just replacement capital expenditures mainly at our nuclear plants, and it's dropped down to maybe about $100 million a year. So going forward, we'll have to see as we lay out the distribution resources plan how significant and how fast the commission would want to move to make some of these improvements. We put out numbers on the electric vehicle charging. It's a little over -- it's approximately $350 million over a multi-year period of time. There's some storage expenditures. So I think it's best and safest to assume that, that $4 billion is probably the appropriate level until we can get more information in the public domain."

If you envision doing that over a 3- to 5-year period, then I think you'll probably be looking at higher numbers. If you envision doing that over a 5- to 7-year period, it tamps down a little bit.

We try to provide, when you look at the K, some additional information in terms of the investment levels. The 1 - a little bit more than $0.01 a month was just in totality on a normal run-rate basis and then it excluded activities at Edison Capital, which are very hard to forecast or predict. So without Edison Capital and any other tax benefits, we would think in the normal course, we'd be hitting about a little over $0.01 a month. So you can do the math there, and it's consistent with what we've said in the past."

And a part -- the piece parts coming to help that are the rate increase and the SONGS settlement allows us to transfer some of the over-collections to that under-collection. And another critical piece is our decommissioning decision because we've been -- we have dollars that were spent for decommissioning that once we get approval, to get access to the decommissioning trust, we'll transfer those dollars over to the era under-collection. And hopefully, by year-end, we'll be in good shape. And obviously, the thing that's going to change it up or down is what happens with gas prices. And based on the forecast we used for '15, I know for a fact that we're probably underrunning the actual expenditures because we used a higher forecast than gas prices are right now."

We've got 2 more payments of $200 million in September this year and September of next year for $400 million, and the whole source of repayment for a majority of the borrowings we have outstanding today really will be from the monetization of EME tax benefits. I said in my script we've got $1.1 billion of NOLs and tax credit carryforwards. And if we don't get an extension of bonus depreciation in '15, likely SCE will be fully taxable as it runs off its NOLs and will be then paying taxes to the federal government. Bonus doesn't apply to state government -- state of California, so we're going to -- we're obviously paying taxes for the state, and then we'll start rapidly amortizing the EME benefits. One of the wildcards here that we'll have to consider, and Ted mentioned in his comments, if we do get resolution of the SONGS litigation with MHI, we would look to take an abandonment loss in the year that's resolved. We have to file a private letter ruling, and we'll take a write-off. And so that could affect the full timing of the monetization of tax benefits. But I think it's going to take out to '17, possibly in early '18, to fully amortize off the $1.1 billion of EME tax benefits."

In terms of affecting the business, I would say it doesn't really have a significant effect on the business. This is a fairly arcane area. But I would say, generally speaking, the ex parte rules, particularly on matters like the San Onofre matter, the OII, that's really designed to provide equal access to all parties to the proceeding with equal time. So it's I think one of the misconceptions, as in something like SONGS OII, that you're precluded from having conversations. You're not. It's just -- the rules are designed to make sure that if we have conversations with decision-makers that those are noticed, that those -- that we include in there how much time we spend with which decision-maker, so that all the other parties have the equal access, equal amount of time. That's the whole concept behind it. So I don't see any of this as hurting the ability to do business. It's complicated and cumbersome and sometimes kind of difficult on the interpretation of some of the specific provisions. But fundamentally, when it's -- when we have proceedings before the commission, we follow the rules. We go about doing the business the way it's really set up to do it. There's plenty of opportunity in all of those proceedings for all parties to be heard. That's the kind of the point of having these things before the commission. So I don't see any big element there.

You asked about the application for rehearing and a federal lawsuit. I'm taking one at a time. An application for rehearing was filed by the coalition to decommission San Onofre, and that was filed in the end of last year, mid-December 2014. They're basically asking for the California Public Utility Commission to reconsider their decision approving the SONGS settlement, and the basis for their request is a bunch of alleged procedural irregularities in the proceeding undertaken by the CPUC. It's our view that there really is no legitimate basis for the CPUC to overturn the settlement based upon the theories advanced by the coalition to decommission San Onofre. But of course, that's for the CPUC to decide. All the parties to the SONGS settlement have filed a joint response in early January rejecting the request for rehearing. The CPUC did not operate under a firm deadline to respond, but they normally respond within 3 to 5 months. So we should expect to hear from the CPUC by the middle of March to the middle of May. Separately, another plaintiff, Citizens' Oversight, who happens to be represented by the same lawyer who represents the coalition to decommission San Onofre, filed a federal court action down in San Diego and basically raised some constitutional theories that the SONGS settlement was an impermissible taking of ratepayer property. That suit was filed in November of 2014. Both we and the CPUC filed motions to dismiss at the end of January. There'll be some further paperwork back and forth as the plaintiff replies and we, again, reply in February and March. And if all goes well, we'd expect the decision from the federal court in April of 2015, so in a couple of months."

We resolved 2 major uncertainties, Edison Mission Energy and San Onofre. We meaningfully increased the dividend. We continue to fulfill the long-term growth opportunity at Southern California Edison through our wires-focused investment strategy that supports California's environmental and growth objectives, and we continue to selectively pursue growth opportunities that allow us to serve additional customers outside of SCE's service territory. Most gratifying to me is that we delivered on what we told investors we would do. I'm proud of this leadership team and the outstanding work of our employees. That said, we fully recognize that 2014 is over, and we are in the new year. We need to build on the performance of 2014 and continue to build value. With the strong fourth quarter, full year 2014 core earnings were $4.59 per share, an increase of 21% over the previous year. This result was well above our updated guidance from last fall. Jim Scilacci will cover more of the details in his comments. 
The settlements reached on the EME bankruptcy and the SONGS order instituting investigation positioned us to move forward decisively in a time of tremendous change in our industry. The unanimous approval by the California Public Utilities Commission of the SONGS settlement agreement last November demonstrated that it is possible to resolve complex and important regulatory matters through settlement. The settlement was the product of tough negotiations among the initial settling parties: The Utility Reform Network or TURN, the Office of Ratepayer Advocate and the 2 utilities. And later, other intervenors signed on to the settlement. The settlement has been widely supported as fair and balanced. SCE is now proceeding with implementation of the approved agreement. We are also deeply engaged in the planning and early stages of decommissioning the plant. 
SCE will continue to work aggressively to maximize potential financial recoveries from insurers and from Mitsubishi Heavy Industries. I'm hopeful SCE will be able to resolve the insurance claims this year. Under the provisions of the settlement agreement, virtually all insurance proceeds, if any, will go to customers. The arbitration process with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries must follow International Chamber of Commerce rules, which means it will be a slower process. I don't expect any decision until 2016. The MHI arbitration proceeding is confidential, so we won't be able to say much. However, we continue to assert the claims we first presented to the International Chamber of Commerce in 2013. 
Our nearly 18% dividend increase in early December underscores our optimism about the future and our commitment to bringing our dividend payout closer to that of the industry. We expect to extend our record of 11 years of annual dividend increases while stepping up the pace of dividend growth to exceed that of earnings. This will allow us to return to our target payout ratio of 45% to 55% of earnings in steps over time. 
Let me now provide some longer-term thoughts. On January 5, in his state of the state speech, Governor Brown outlined his broad goals for the next stage in addressing climate change. By 2030, he wants to derive 50% of the state's electricity from renewable sources, reduce petroleum in cars and trucks by 50% and double the efficiency of existing buildings. In his speech he said, ""All of this is a very tall order. It means that we continue to transform our grid, our transportation system and even our communities."" He continued saying, ""I envision a wide range of initiatives: more distributed power, expanded rooftop solar, microgrids, an energy-in-balance market, battery storage, the full integration of information technology and electrical distribution and millions of electric and low-carbon vehicles."" 
The state's ambition and overall direction is clear. In broad strokes, we, at Edison, have been painting a similar picture of the future of the power system. Importantly, our growth strategy is aligned accordingly. Of course, the devil is in the details. Some of the regulatory framework to implement this vision will require legislative action, and that process has already started in Sacramento. We will be actively engaged on the legislative front. One of our larger priorities will be achieving policy goals at the lowest cost to customers. We see the need to expand California's Renewable Portfolio Standard beyond the current regime of only recognizing large-scale wholesale contracted projects to recognize the benefits of distributed generation, energy efficiency and electric vehicle charging. 
The 3-year General Rate Case cycle provides a broad framework to incorporate other initiatives such as the Distribution Resource Plan required to be filed this summer. The CPUC recently issued its final guidance on the distribution plan elements. We anticipate that our plan will create something of a roadmap for the distribution system investments at Southern California Edison needed to realize the governor's vision. Some elements of the plan are already in process, including initiatives on energy storage, residential rate design and electric vehicle charging. 
California's commitment to creating a low-carbon economy does not necessarily conflict with SCE's core mission of delivering safe, reliable and affordable electricity. SCE's current General Rate Case will establish the revenue requirement and scope of work to achieve both. The record for the rate case was completed in late January. The GRC is now in the hands of administrative law judges to develop a proposed decision. We expect a decision sometime in 2015. 
So with that, I'll now turn the call over to Jim Scilacci."

As we have previously stated, we will not provide 2015 earnings guidance unt",1703,"Thanks, Ted. Good afternoon, everyone. My comments will cover fourth quarter and full year 2014 earnings, our updated capital spending and rate base forecast and cost of capital. As we have previously stated, we will not provide 2015 earnings guidance until SCE receives its 2015 General Rate Case decision. In this presentation, I will, however, discuss assumptions relevant to our 2015 earnings. 
Please turn to Page 2. In the fourth quarter of 2014, SCE earned $1.09 per share or $0.30 ahead of last year. This increase was driven by many of the same factors we have been seeing during 2014, including higher revenue of $0.28, partially offset by depreciation of $0.08, net tax benefits and other items of $0.04 and O&M savings of $0.05. There are 2 -- there also are 2 items of note that are included in the $0.28 of higher revenue, and both of them were not included in our updated earnings guidance that we provided last October. 
First, we recorded $0.05 of additional revenue from resolution of an open item from our 2012 GRC decision. During 2014, SCE obtained an IRS private letter ruling regarding appropriate treatment of net operating loss carryforwards. The net effect of the ruling was to increase CPUC rate base in revenues. In November, we obtained a CPUC approval authorizing the additional revenues. 
Second, you may recall that during the third quarter call, we thought that the energy efficiency awards might be delayed until 2015. As things turned out, we received our award in December and it amounted to $0.04 per share. In the fourth quarter, the net SONGS impact on core earnings was a positive $0.02 per share compared to last year. Our fourth quarter results include recognition of revenue for the rate of return on the SONGS regulatory asset. We also had a $0.05 benefit from lower O&M costs. The largest item was lower severance expense. Taxes and other items were a net benefit of $0.04 per share led by $0.07 in higher income tax benefits. Most of this relates to repair deductions that we've talked about previously. At the Edison International parent company level, results were a loss of $0.01 per share compared to income of $0.02 per share last year, which is mainly due to the income from Edison Capital and tax benefits. The loss of $0.01 this quarter includes higher income from Edison Capital and lower tax benefits. As we have indicated, Edison Capital's remaining low-income housing portfolio continues to wind down as units were sold. 
Turning to non-core items. SCE recorded a net $0.08 per share of benefit during the fourth quarter from a revised estimate of the impact of the SONGS settlement. There are a number of items that make up the $0.08, including the return on SONGS regulatory asset from April 1 through September 30 of this year and accrual of a contribution of the University of California for greenhouse gas research. 
At the parent, we also recorded $0.12 per share of benefit in discontinued operations related to resolution of uncertain tax positions from settlement of our 2003 to 2006 federal income tax years and other tax impacts related to EME. As a reminder, EIX has net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards from EME that will be monetized in future years as part of our settlement with EME creditors. These tax benefits were approximately $1.1 billion at year-end. We also recorded $0.01 per share net benefit of the holding company related to allocation of income tax attributes to tax equity investors and projects developed by SoCore Energy on what is called the Hypothetical Liquidation at Book Value or HLBV accounting method. Because HLBV accounting procedures produces income not related to project portfolio performance, we classify this income as non-core. 
Please turn to Page 3. For the full year, core earnings were $4.59 per share versus $1 -- excuse me, $3.80 in 2013. For SCE, this improvement is mainly due to rate base growth. Year-end 2014 rate base was $23.3 billion, a $2.2 billion increase over the prior year. In addition, SCE recorded higher net tax benefits totaling $0.16 per share, principally from repair deductions and resolution of uncertain tax positions. A number of other smaller items complete the picture. At the holding company, core losses were comparable at last -- excuse me, to last year at $0.09 per share. This remains lower than expected, primarily due to higher income from Edison Capital. I know many of you are interested in tracking our earnings relative to our guidance so I'll cover that next. 
Please turn to Page 4. This slide shows a reconciliation of core earnings to guidance over the full year period. I will focus on the final 3 months of the year that took us from $4.30 midpoint guidance in October to actual core earnings of $4.59. As you can see, the increase is $0.29. First, there's $0.10 per share of income tax benefits from additional repair and cost of removal deductions recorded in the fourth quarter. Next are the 2 items I mentioned earlier, the $0.05 per share benefit from the revised determination of rate base and $0.04 of energy efficiency awards. The balance relates to cost savings and a number of small items at $0.05 per share. Holding company core results were $0.04 per share better than expected, primarily due to Edison Capital's affordable housing project revenues. 
Please turn to Page 5. SCE's capital spending forecast changed slightly from our prior forecast due to timing of transmission capital expenditures. Actual 2014 capital spending totaled $4 billion, $100 million below our forecast. Our outlook for 2015 spending is down $100 million and up $200 million in 2016. Please note we continue to use the 12% variability between the range and request capital expenditure forecast. 
Please turn to Page 6. Our rate base forecast remains consistent with the 7% to 9% compound annual growth rates. Based on a number of changes, we revised downward our rate base forecast by a net $300 million by 2017. As the slide shows, this reflects an average reduction of $400 million from bonus depreciation, an average reduction of $100 million for timing of transmission spending and a positive $200 million adjustment upward to update deferred taxes related to our SmartConnect project. Please note that the capital spending and rate base forecast do not include electric vehicle charging, energy storage or Distribution Resource Plan expenditures. The lion's share of this spending -- future spending will likely occur beyond the current forecast period. 
Please turn to Page 7. This page updates the interest rate trends for the CPUC cost of capital trigger mechanism. Recently, the CPUC approved a 1-year extension of our cost of capital mechanism. We must now file our 2017 cost of capital application in April 2016. The trigger mechanism will remain in effect for 2016. However, based on the movement of the Moody's Baa bond index thus far, it seems unlikely that the current return on common equity of 10.45% would change for 2016. Our FERC filed rate settlement remains in place through the end of 2017. Under the settlement, the return on common equity can be reopened after June 30 of this year. 
Next, I'd like to touch on some financial considerations related to 2015 earnings, given the absence of guidance. Please turn to Page 8. On this page, we have included some important factors to consider in refining our earnings estimates until we can provide formal guidance. The capital spending and rate base forecast are taken from Pages 4 and 5 of this presentation. Both CPUC and FERC return on common equity remain unchanged at 10.45%. We have some carryover items on energy efficiency awards from prior years. The potential earnings opportunity for 2015 is up to $0.05 rather than a more typical $0.03 for a single year. Please keep in mind that some of the carryover items will likely be contested by other parties, and there's no assurance that energy efficiency earnings will be approved. 
Another positive item is the completion in January of the SONGS regulatory asset financing. The approved settlement let SCE finance this asset with 100% debt. The settlement also requires that we share with our customers the cost savings of these financing if the rate is below the 2.62% return on the regulatory asset. SCE completed this financing with a weighted average cost of debt of 2.2%. The blended average rate increases over time due to debt amortization. After the cost sharing with customers, there's a very modest earnings benefit. However, the financing has the added benefit of ultimately freeing up approximately $400 million of common equity. As we recover the regulatory asset, this amount will decline over time. 
At year-end 2014, SCE's 13-month weighted average equity ratio for regulatory purposes was 48.4%. The SONGS regulatory asset totaled $1.288 billion at year-end 2014. Of this amount, $919 million earns the 2.62% return, $345 million earns a commercial paper rate and the balance earns no return. For 2015 and beyond, we believe that the return on SONGS regulatory asset will roughly match the financing cost. I will also remind you that our quarterly earnings results will not reflect the revenues requested in the 2015 GRC and, accordingly, won't have the typical profile during the year. Until we receive a final GRC decision, we plan to record revenues based on the 2014 authorized revenue requirement. 
Please turn to Page 9. The next slide highlights the details of our dividend policy that Ted has already touched on. I'd like to reinforce our view that EIX has one of the better opportunities among the large-cap utilities for rate base, earnings and dividend growth. 
Please turn to Page 10. This last slide captures our strategic framework. Ted has touched on many of the major points already. To summarize, we are very focused on delivering on our organic growth opportunity. We have good growth visibility from our wires spending and the prospect for continued growth from a number of new initiatives. Moreover, we -- as we have previously said, we will continue to work to optimize our cost structure and improve our operational efficiency. 
Thanks. I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions."

This is Jim Scilacci, then I'll turn it over to Pedro for some additional comments. So the filing that's coming up in the second quarter or first part of the third quarter, we have a series of questions that the PUC has asked us to address. A lot of them is really what's happening in the system and how we plan to address it to encourage and incorporate more distributed energy resources in the distribution system. That is, at least the initial filing is not an investment filing. It's really a description of what needs to be done and from our view. Others will have, I'm sure, different views. We will subsequently follow that up with probably some type of application or alternatively will include in our 2018 General Rate Case request the actual expenditures associated with this new plan. And from an overall perspective stepping back and thinking about our capital expenditures, we've said that capital expenditures on average have been running about $4 billion a year. And we don't want to suggest that these new programs either will take it up or drop it down. We think that generally going forward, capital expenditures will stay in that same zone even with these new initiatives. So I'll pause there and turn it over to Pedro for additional elaboration, if you'd like to add anything."

And so there's -- a piece of this is mechanical but a broader piece around how does the grid continue to evolve. I think it will raise questions and provide some insights on what are some of the technologies and what's the evolution of that grid over time. And then as Jim said, we haven't determined this yet, but we'll have a -- the option of either including investment opportunities that we see in our future rate case cycles. Potentially, there might be an opportunity to do a separate filing. We saw a very pressing near-term need, but that's work that we have under way right now in determining what those next steps are and, really, in developing the filing for July 1."

But particularly here in California, the move towards a low-carbon economy, moving towards higher levels of electrification in, say, the transportation sector, goods movement, water, some of the other areas, all of that helps move the economy towards a lower-carbon footprint. So those are kind of the second -- the second bucket of areas that we're continuing to look at. Final point I'll make is we've tried to be fairly high level about the things that we're looking at on that side. I think you know us well enough by now. We don't like to kind of come out with a lot of fanfare upfront. We'd rather see what we can deliver and then talk about that. So at this point, most the effort is on the distributed generation activities around SoCore and how that fits into our kind of broader strategy on the commercial and industrial customer side."

If you go through the piece parts,",273,"Hugh, this is Jim. I think what we're attempting to say and I struggled with it in an earlier question, my response was I think the $4 billion is probably in the right zone, and we'll just have to see how things unfold. If you go through the piece parts, distribution has been stepping up in the total level of expenditures over the last several GRCs, and we're still working to get our replacement rates to levels that we think we need to be at to maintain the reliability of the electric system. So you could see distribution step up, somewhat more from where we are today. Transmission is more -- it's related to some of these large projects that we have flowing through, and we had very modest transmission spending in years past and that stepped up as a result of all the renewable interconnections that we were doing. Generation has typically been a very small part of our overall equation. It was really just replacement capital expenditures mainly at our nuclear plants, and it's dropped down to maybe about $100 million a year. So going forward, we'll have to see as we lay out the distribution resources plan how significant and how fast the commission would want to move to make some of these improvements. We put out numbers on the electric vehicle charging. It's a little over -- it's approximately $350 million over a multi-year period of time. There's some storage expenditures. So I think it's best and safest to assume that, that $4 billion is probably the appropriate level until we can get more information in the public domain."

If you envision doing that over a 3- to 5-year period, then I think you'll probably be looking at higher numbers. If you envision doing that over a 5- to 7-year period, it tamps down a little bit. If you envision doing it over a 10-year period, more modest yet. So I think a big component of trying to sort this through is the pace with which these investments get made, not just the absolute number."

And of course, I guess, it's possible you could have years where you end up having some of the more unusual items that work against you. But fundamentally, we kind of look at it as the core earnings power of the utility, and the dividend is tied to SCE's earnings, really, is the rate base model. So that's the way we tend to look at it. All of that said, we see continued significant growth in rate base and, therefore, we see good growth in earnings. And in order to move the payout ratio up, we expect the growth rate in dividend increases to be higher than the growth rate in earnings. Otherwise, we won't make any progress on moving the payout ratio up."

We've got 2 more payments of $200 million in September this year and September of next year for $400 million, and the whole source of repayment for a majority of the borrowings we have outstanding today really will be from the monetization of EME tax benefits. I said in my script we've got $1.1 billion of NOLs and tax credit carryforwards. And if we don't get an extension of bonus depreciation in '15, likely SCE will be fully taxable as it runs off its NOLs and will be then paying taxes to the federal government. Bonus doesn't apply to state government -- state of California, so we're going to -- we're obviously paying taxes for the state, and then we'll start rapidly amortizing the EME benefits. One of the wildcards here that we'll have to consider, and Ted mentioned in his comments, if we do get resolution of the SONGS litigation with MHI, we would look to take an abandonment loss in the year that's resolved. We have to file a private letter ruling, and we'll take a write-off. And so that could affect the full timing of the monetization of tax benefits. But I think it's going to take out to '17, possibly in early '18, to fully amortize off the $1.1 billion of EME tax benefits."

In terms of affecting the business, I would say it doesn't really have a significant effect on the business. This is a fairly arcane area. But I would say, generally speaking, the ex parte rules, particularly on matters like the San Onofre matter, the OII, that's really designed to provide equal access to all parties to the proceeding with equal time. So it's I think one of the misconceptions, as in something like SONGS OII, that you're precluded from having conversations. You're not. It's just -- the rules are designed to make sure that if we have conversations with decision-makers that those are noticed, that those -- that we include in there how much time we spend with which decision-maker, so that all the other parties have the equal access, equal amount of time. That's the whole concept behind it. So I don't see any of this as hurting the ability to do business. It's complicated and cumbersome and sometimes kind of difficult on the interpretation of some of the specific provisions. But fundamentally, when it's -- when we have proceedings before the commission, we follow the rules. We go about doing the business the way it's really set up to do it.

You asked about the application for rehearing and a federal lawsuit. I'm taking one at a time. An application for rehearing was filed by the coalition to decommission San Onofre, and that was filed in the end of last year, mid-December 2014. They're basically asking for the California Public Utility Commission to reconsider their decision approving the SONGS settlement, and the basis for their request is a bunch of alleged procedural irregularities in the proceeding undertaken by the CPUC. It's our view that there really is no legitimate basis for the CPUC to overturn the settlement based upon the theories advanced by the coalition to decommission San Onofre. But of course, that's for the CPUC to decide. All the parties to the SONGS settlement have filed a joint response in early January rejecting the request for rehearing. The CPUC did not operate under a firm deadline to respond, but they normally respond within 3 to 5 months. So we should expect to hear from the CPUC by the middle of March to the middle of May. Separately, another plaintiff, Citizens' Oversight, who happens to be represented by the same lawyer who represents the coalition to decommission San Onofre, filed a federal court action down in San Diego and basically raised some constitutional theories that the SONGS settlement was an impermissible taking of ratepayer property. That suit was filed in November of 2014. Both we and the CPUC filed motions to dismiss at the end of January. There'll be some further paperwork back and forth as the plaintiff replies and we, again, reply in February and March. And if all goes well, we'd expect the decision from the federal court in April of 2015, so in a couple of months."

Our first quarter core earnings were $0.90 per share, unchanged from the first quarter the previous year. Because SCE has not received a decision in its 2015 General Rate Case, comparisons of results are not particularly meaningful. Jim Scilacci will cover the specifics.
I'm certain that what is on your minds now more than anything else is the filing we will make tomorrow with the California Public Utilities Commission regarding communications with CPUC decision-makers during the SONGS settlement process. Although we are still finalizing our response, I want to make some comments about what we expect to file. Since our work on the filing is still ongoing, there is some small risk that I will have to supplement what I say today, but it is outweighed by our desire to be transparent.
First, we do not expect to file any additional late party -- late ex parte notices. We conducted a thorough process to identify and review communications and internal documents concerning the settlement of the SONGS OII between CPUC decision-makers and personnel SCE and EIX who could reasonably be expected to have engaged in such communications. As specified in the ALJ's order, we looked at documents from the period between March 1, 2013, a few weeks before the Warsaw meeting and November 30, 2014, a short while after the settlement was approved by the PUC. This is a mammoth undertaking involving an initial broad pool of slightly more than 2 million emails and documents, and then windling that group down in successive levels of review to isolate documents relating to the SONGS OII and the settlement process.
I've come to learn how these types of documents searches and reviews are done. It is very complicated. It requires real care and setting up the parameters for searching and sifting given the huge number of documents that could potentially be relevant. It also involves some judgments about search parameters. We used multiple levels of review and a lot of checking and rechecking of work. We used an outside law firm to conduct this work. All of this was done in a sincere attempt to do a thorough, complete and proper job. We believe we have done so. 
Our filing tomorrow will provide details on the search criteria and the multilayered review and the checking process used. This work will result in us providing a couple dozen emails in our response to the CPUC. 
As I said, we do not expect to make any additional late ex parte notices. That said, we are providing in our response quite a bit of additional information in an effort to be transparent and forthcoming on contacts between CPUC decision-makers and SCE and EIX executives on SONGS-related matters.  I want to highlight some of the additional information we intend to provide. 
We are providing a chronology of key events relating to the SONGS settlement, covering the period from the initiation of the OII to the commission approval of the settlement. We are also providing a summary and the relevant documents where we had communications with CPUC decision-makers, even though those communications fell outside of the criteria for filing ex parte notices. These cover things like: A courtesy call to a Commissioner to give him or her a heads up we were about to issue a press release on a SONGS-related matter, or a Commissioner-initiated contact, which was a one-way conversation from them to one of our executives with no substantive response by our executive, that is our executive was essentially in listen-only mode, or communications between a CPUC decision-maker and SCE or EIX personnel on procedural matters, or, updates provided to CPUC Commissioners on the status of SONGS restart and system reliability efforts.
This effort has also highlighted, for me, the need to have Rule 8.4, which covers ex parte notices, reviewed and clarified. Any rule can't possibly cover every conceivable communication circumstance, which creates a need to interpret that rule. Over time, the parties who regularly practice before the CPUC, commissioners, utilities, and interveners alike, and resulting commission decisions, develop a body of accepted practice concerning that rule. We make every effort to comply with Rule 8.4 on ex parte notices. 
In my opinion, Rule 8.4 could certainly stand to be clarified and updated. We are the ones who bear the reputational and financial risk of interpretations of and after the fact judgments regarding an ambiguous rule. We understand President Picker [ph] intends to review Rule 8.4. We very much welcome such an effort. 
Our response also contains, as required by the ALJ's order, a privilege log of the documents withheld based on legal privilege. 
Finally, our response will contain declarations from Steve picket and Ron Litzinger. These documents provide -- primarily provide additional information surrounding the meeting former President PV requested in Warsaw. Again, we are going this extra step in an attempt to provide all parties and the public with transparency about this contact. 
I want to make one final point on this matter. Some have contended that the settlement was influenced by the PV Picket Warsaw meeting, while I can certainly understand the motivation for some to make this statement, it just doesn't stand up to basic logic. To start with, the Warsaw contact was made a good 2.5 months before we had even made the decision to permanently shut down SONGS. Negotiations would turn an ORA commence after shut down and proceeded with both sides writing on a clean slate, so to speak. The settlement negotiations lasted over 10 months with 14 face-to-face meetings among the negotiating parties and numerous phone calls
SCE did not negotiate any settlement with PV nor did ORA or TURN. PV may have had his own ideas about what a settlement should contain, but he wasn't involved in the negotiations. Any settlement was going to have to address the same 4 basic cost issues, cost items that issue, whether articulated by PV or anyone else. Those 4 were: The cost of the replacement steam generators, held a non-RSG going to be recovered, replacement power and O&M expenses.  There was also the matter of how any third-party recoveries from insurance and MHI would be treated. 
Identifying the areas to negotiate was easy. The hard part was coming to agreement on how they were to be handled and everybody had different ideas about that. ORA, in turn, were active, fully engaged parties to the settlement negotiations. They reached their own conclusions as to the gives and takes in the negotiations and ultimately, as to the settlement as a whole and the value it would provide to customers. 
Importantly, the result of the negotiations was materially different from the general framework laid out by President PV in Warsaw. TURN and ORA in their April 17 press release provided their views of the material differences between the settlement and the PV construct and maintained ratepayers faired considerably better under the settlement. Just yesterday, the alliance for nuclear responsibility provided a different analysis that came to the opposite point of view, but still concludes that the settlement was materially different from the PV construct. 
All of these proves the point, comparing the final settlement to PV's generalized framework from Warsaw is bound to produce this type of debate given the lack of detail in that suggested framework. This vagueness lends itself to differing interpretations, really guesses, as to what he may have had in mind. What is most important here is that PV's contact with us and any subsequent contacts did not have any influence on the parties who were actually involved in the settlement negotiations. 
As I said, our current plan is to file our response to the ALJ's order tomorrow. Hopefully, my comments provide some helpful context for that filing. I'm sure you understand that we will probably decline to say anything more about this matter in the Q&A session on this call, and until after we made our filing.
I now want to turn to some of our other business priorities. Of course, the major item for us this year is reaching a reasonable outcome on SCE's General Rate Case. We don't really have anything material to report on that effort today. 
Beyond the GRC, our priorities for the business remains safety, operational excellence and investing and modernizing the electric system to enhance reliability, better serve our customers and support public policy. I'll touch on these briefly. 
Safety leads the list of operational excellence priorities for us. When we say safety, we mean both public safety and workers safety. In both cases, it requires us to constantly find new ways to keep the public and ourselves aware and focused on potential safety hazards and to invest in ways to eliminate or mitigate safety risk. Actually, some of this circles back to provisions in our GRC request too. Although we have continued to improve our safety performance in recent years, we can do more based on the best-in-class utilities and performance in other industries. A robust safety culture is a top priority. 
Our other operational excellence priorities are reliability, customer service and affordability. Sustained productivity improvement must be part of our DNA. We have made substantial progress on this over the last several years, but we want to continue to improve. 
One important measure is customer rates. We have mentioned to you before that our goal the last few years has been to keep the increase and our system average rate to 3% to 5% per annum. We seek to do this even in the face of cost pressures from expensive mandates that require substantial incremental investments. 
Over the last 5 years, we have managed to stay at the bottom end of that targeted range, which actually compares favorably with our peers in California and several others around the country. We would like to continue to push that down to the level of inflation or lower. 
Today's electric system provides customers with reliable and affordable electric energy, but the system needs to be upgraded to meet changing customer needs. Residential and business customer needs are evolving, while policymakers want us to provide an electric system that facilitates a low carbon economy. 
To meet these needs, we did to be able to integrate more distributed energy resources, such as rooftop solar, energy storage and electric transportation charging. The Distribution Resource Plan and related filings we will make this summer to the CPUC, will serve as the road map for modernizing the electric distribution system. 
The long-term need to invest in a reliable and technologically advanced grids puts a premium on mitigating the potential rate impact of those necessary investments by doing all we can to manage our costs, while operating more effectively and meeting customers' needs. This is critical for our long-term competitiveness. 
Beyond our Utility business, we continue to pursue growth opportunities and competitive businesses across the electric power industry. Doing so allows us to serve customers outside of SCE's territory. We are focused on providing energy services to commercial and industrial customers through Edison Energy as well as competitive transmission outside SCE's service area through Edison transmission. 
Frankly, I have never felt better about how our company is positioned for the future, both in terms of our strategy and the people we have in place to execute it. Our customers' needs and our industry will continue to evolve. I believe Edison is particularly well positioned to be at the forefront of these changes. 
With that, I will now turn it over to Jim Scilacci for the financial update."
301891,290053950,796276,"Edison International, Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2015",2015-04-28,"Earnings Calls","Edison International","Executives","Thanks, Ted. Good afternoon, everyone. I'll cover the following topics in my remarks, first quarter results, our updated capital spending and rate base forecast and our financing plans. I'll lead off my comments with a general statement about attempting t",1267,"Thanks, Ted. Good afternoon, everyone. I'll cover the following topics in my remarks, first quarter results, our updated capital spending and rate base forecast and our financing plans. I'll lead off my comments with a general statement about attempting to compare 2015 to 2014 earnings. Because SCE has yet to receive a General Rate Case decision, utility is recording revenues largely based on 2014 authorized levels. In the quarter, S&E received a final GRC decision, we will record a cumulative adjustment retroactive to January 1, 2015. As Ted mentioned, earnings comparisons will not be useful until we report full year 2015 earnings. In the meantime, we believe the simplified rate base model is the best starting point to model full year earnings. Please turn to Page 2 of the presentation. 
As Ted said, core earnings are unchanged year-over-year at $0.90 per share. GAAP, or basic earnings per share, are $0.38 per share higher. This is primarily due to noncore items last year related to the SONGS OII settlement of $0.29 per share and $0.07 per share related to EME. This quarter, we also had $0.02 per share of income under the HLBB accounting treatment for solar tax equity financings. 
As explained in our last call, Edison Energy has tax equity investors. We are required to allocate income under the hypothetical liquidation and book value accounting method. Since this income does not relate to project performance, we classified it as noncore. Edison Energy is included in EIX Parent and Other results. 
Edison International parent company costs are flat at $0.03 per share or slightly higher -- with slightly higher corporate expenses are offset by earnings from Edison Mission Group as we continue to monetize Edison capital's affordable housing portfolio. 
With respect to our quarterly results, let me clarify the presentation of 2 items on our results. First, as I previously mentioned, we are recording CPUC revenues at 2014 authorized level, pending a General Rate Case decision. We used this approach except for one modification. We deferred $36 million of authorized revenues or $0.07 per share, allocated to the first quarter related to incremental repair reductions pending the outcome of the GRC. There's an offsetting $0.07 per share of income tax benefits shown separately on the slide. Since we don't know how the General Rate Case will treat repair deductions, we decided it was prudent not to recognize these benefits. The $0.07 is above repair deductions that are included in our 2015 GRC filing.
Second, let me clarify the presentation of SONGS, which is addressed in Footnote 4 to this slide. During the first quarter of 2015, we began to amortize the SONGS regulatory asset and recorded property taxes, which are recovered through revenues. During the first quarter of last year, we had O&M cost and property taxes that were recovered through GRC revenues. Neither of these effective net income, so we have excluded them from earnings strivers. A fuller description of these items is included in our 10-Q. 
Let me also note that beginning January 1, 2015, SONGS costs are classified as decommissioning expense and recorded as a reduction in our asset retirement obligations. 
Turning back to our slide, we did benefit from $0.07 per share of higher FERC revenues primarily related to rate base growth and recovery of higher operating costs. 
Looking at costs, O&M is $0.01 per share higher, depreciation and amortization cost are $0.04 per share higher from an increase in transmission and distribution investments.
Net financing costs benefited by $0.02 per share, largely from higher AFUDC equity income. This reflects a higher AFUDC rate and a slightly higher construction work-in-progress balance. After adjusting for the incremental repair deductions, SCE had lower tax benefits of $0.04 per share. The lower tax relate principally to higher flow-through tax flow benefits related to repair reductions -- high repair deductions last year. 
Although our results are better than most analyst estimates, I suspect this is largely due to difficulty in estimating quarterly profile of revenues and earnings from our 2014 authorized revenue requirement. Other than perhaps a favorable AFUDC equity earnings trend, which could remain a factor for the rest of the year, first quarter results are largely consistent with the simplified rate base model we encourage investors to use as a starting point. Please turn to Page 3.
We have revised our 3-year forecast reflecting the removal of the Coolwater Lugo transmission project. This 220 kv project planned in the San Fernando County was intended to support additional renewable projects and overall, grid reliability. In mid-March, the California Independent system operator determined that this project is not necessary to provide full capacity, deliverability, but would conduct additional studies to assess potential need for all or portions of the project for future system requirements. In the interim, the CAISO requested that the CPUC suspend its approval to proceed with the project. SCE supports the suspension given the change in circumstances. Last week, the CPUC issued a proposed decision that recommends dismissing the Coolwater-Lugo application on the basis that sufficient deliverability now exist.
The Coolwater-Lugo project was forecasted to cost $740 million, of which the most recent forecast had $584 million of expenditures falling within the 2015 through 2017 forecast period, partially offsetting these are cost and timing updates for a number of other smaller FERC projects. The net result is a decrease of approximately $300 million and FERC CapEx in our capital spending forecast. For your information, we have provided a prior forecast at the bottom of this slide. 
Lastly, SCE has FERC pre-approval for prudently incurred and planned cost. We will continue to finance SCE's growth consistent with our authorized capital structure. Periodically, SCE will issue long-term debt and preferred stock to support its growing rate base. Of course, retained earnings will provide common equity needs. SCE's 13-month weighted average common equity ratio component was 48.4% with a cash flow benefits from bonus depreciation expected to commence later this year. SCE may have only modest additional financing requirements this year. Please turn to Page 4.
Our rate base growth forecast remains 7% to 9% compounded annually during the forecast period. The FERC capital spending changes have a minor impact on the average rate base forecast for each year and SCE continues to have a number of growth programs, such as storage, electric vehicle charging and the upgrade of the future projects that will remain important sources of growth well into stronger than expected. Please turn to Page 5.
We have included in this slide, some of the important 2015 earnings considerations that we introduced in our last call. The only change is a minor revision to the 2015 rate base forecast that I have discussed earlier. To reiterate, our prior statements, we don't plan on issuing 2015 guidance until after SCE receives a General Rate Case decision. 
I'll finish with a couple of reminders on Edison International's investment thesis. Please turn to Page 6. First, we continue to emphasize a lower risk SCE investment program focused on the wires business, both for reliability spending and for adapting the grid to the new technologies and needs that we have spoken about for some time. To meet these investment requirements, while keeping rate increases moderate, will require a sustained SCE productivity improvements. Our base financing case remains no common equity issuance to support SCE's investment program. 
Finally, we continue to see the opportunity for above-average dividend growth potential to complement SCE's earnings growth. Of course, our plan is to increase the dividend back to our target payout ratio in steps over time. 
Thanks, operator, let's get started with Q&A."

Question on a completely different subject, on the Coolwater-Lugo CapEx amount, you guys have indicated for some time, and I think this is to wrap up until this filing coming on the grid of the future that you see a very long runway of necessary capital expenditures at or around or even potentially above the current sort of $4 billion plus or minus a year that you're spending. Does the deferral or potential cancellation of the Coolwater-Lugo just sort of open up an opportunity for you to move other spending, if necessary, forward? And if so, at what point would you re-assess that or get an update? Or should we just assume over the next 3-year period that, that CapEx is out and we should do the rate base math based on the current guidance?"

That's the normal course that will occur. And we've got some other things in the works as obviously, the electric vehicle charging application in is crossing its way through the PUC. There's some storage opportunities. And the grid of the future likely will be -- could be outside this period of '15 through '17 period, but we're still working through that. So I think, we will stay consistent what we have previously said before that the capital expenditures are going to be in that $4 billion-inch range for the foreseeable future. And it will be probably later next year, before we can give you some additional visibility, because that's when ultimately when the GRC filing will go in, and that will cover '18, '19 and '20."

Edison Energy or on the competitive side, so whether that's Edison Transmission or some of the C&I energy services or some of the other areas that we're looking at, that's really opportunistic and it's based on kind of the standard parameters that we've used over the years for investment on the competitive side. If we see something that gives us a positive rate of return after considering cost of capital and risk, then we would seek to invest in those things, so long as it stays in the basic electric footprint that we have. So I think you should expect that most of the capital would be dedicated to the SCE activities. Public policy makers in pot are certainly keen to see the utilities facilitate the policy objectives of moving to a low carbon economy.

Also, starting this quarter, we have posted Ted's and Jim's prepared remarks on the website and filed an 8-K so that you can follow their comments. Later this week, we will distribute our regular business update presentation for use in upcoming Investor Meeting.
During this call, we will make forward-looking statements about the future outlook for Edison International and its subsidiaries. Actual results could differ materially from current expectations. Important factors that could cause different results are set forth in our SEC filings. Please read this carefully. The presentation includes certain outlook assumptions as well as reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the nearest GAAP measure. [Operator Instructions] I'll now turn the call over to Ted."

Our first quarter core earnings were $0.90 per share, unchanged from the first quarter the previous year. Because SCE has not received a decision in its 2015 General Rate Case, comparisons of results are not particularly meaningful. Jim Scilacci will cover the specifics.
I'm certain that what is on your minds now more than anything else is the filing we will make tomorrow with the California Public Utilities Commission regarding communications with CPUC decision-makers during the SONGS settlement process. Although we are still finalizing our response, I want to make some comments about what we expect to file. Since our work on the filing is still ongoing, there is some small risk that I will have to supplement what I say today, but it is outweighed by our desire to be transparent.
First, we do not expect to file any additional late party -- late ex parte notices. We conducted a thorough process to identify and review communications and internal documents concerning the settlement of the SONGS OII between CPUC decision-makers and personnel at SCE and EIX who could reasonably be expected to have engaged in such communications. As specified in the ALJ's order, we looked at documents from the period between March 1, 2013, a few weeks before the Warsaw meeting and November 30, 2014, a short while after the settlement was approved by the PUC. This is a mammoth undertaking involving an initial broad pool of slightly more than 2 million emails and documents, and then winnowing that group down in successive levels of review to isolate documents relating to the SONGS OII and the settlement process.
I've come to learn how these types of document searches and reviews are done. It is very complicated. It requires real care and setting up the parameters for searching and sifting given the huge number of documents that could potentially be relevant. It also involves some judgments about search parameters. We used multiple levels of review and a lot of checking and rechecking of work. We used an outside law firm to conduct this work. All of this was done in a sincere attempt to do a thorough, complete and proper job. We believe we have done so. 
Our filing tomorrow will provide details on the search criteria and the multilayered review and checking process used. This work will result in us providing a couple dozen emails in our response to the CPUC. 
As I said, we do not expect to make any additional late ex parte notices. That said, we are providing in our response quite a bit of additional information in an effort to be transparent and forthcoming on contacts between CPUC decision-makers and SCE and EIX executives on SONGS-related matters. I want to highlight some of the additional information we intend to provide. 
We are providing a chronology of key events relating to the SONGS settlement, covering the period from the initiation of the OII to the commission approval of the settlement. We are also providing a summary and the relevant documents where we had communications with CPUC decision-makers, even though those communications fell outside of the criteria for filing ex parte notices. These cover things like: A courtesy call to a commissioner to give him or her a heads up we were about to issue a press release on a SONGS-related matter, or a commissioner-initiated contact, which was a one-way conversation from them to one of our executives with no substantive response by our executive, that is our executive was essentially in listen-only mode, or communications between a CPUC decision-maker and SCE or EIX personnel on procedural matters, or updates provided to CPUC commissioners on the status of SONGS restart and system reliability efforts.
This effort has also highlighted, for me, the need to have Rule 8.4, which covers ex parte notices, reviewed and clarified. Any rule can't possibly cover every conceivable communication circumstance, which creates a need to interpret that rule. Over time, the parties who regularly practice before the CPUC, commissioners, utilities, and interveners alike, and resulting commission decisions, develop a body of accepted practice concerning that rule. We make every effort to comply with Rule 8.4 on ex parte notices. 
In my opinion, Rule 8.4 could certainly stand to be clarified and updated. We are the ones who bear the reputational and financial risk of interpretations of and after the fact judgments regarding an ambiguous rule. We understand President Picker intends to review Rule 8.4. We very much welcome such an effort. 
Our response also contains, as required by the ALJ's order, a privilege log of the documents withheld based on legal privilege. 
Finally, our response will contain declarations from Steve Pickett and Ron Litzinger. These documents provide -- primarily provide additional information surrounding the meeting former President Peevy requested in Warsaw. Again, we are going this extra step in an attempt to provide all parties and the public with transparency about this contact. 
I want to make one final point on this matter. Some have contended that the settlement was influenced by the Peevy/Pickett Warsaw meeting, while I can certainly understand the motivation for some to make this statement, it just doesn't stand up to basic logic. To start with, the Warsaw contact was made a good 2.5 months before we had even made the decision to permanently shut down SONGS. Negotiations would turn an ORA commenced after shut down and proceeded with both sides writing on a clean slate, so to speak. The settlement negotiations lasted over 10 months with 14 face-to-face meetings among the negotiating parties and numerous phone calls.
SCE did not negotiate any settlement with Peevy nor did ORA or TURN. Peevy may have had his own ideas about what a settlement should contain, but he wasn't involved in the negotiations. Any settlement was going to have to address the same 4 basic cost issues, cost items at issue, whether articulated by Peevy or anyone else. Those 4 were: The cost of the replacement steam generators, how the non-RSG assets were going to be recovered, replacement power and O&M expenses. There was also the matter of how any third-party recoveries from insurance and MHI would be treated. 
Identifying the areas to negotiate was easy. The hard part was coming to agreement on how they were to be handled and everybody had different ideas about that. ORA, in turn, were active, fully engaged parties to the settlement negotiations. They reached their own conclusions as to the gives and takes in the negotiations and ultimately, as to the settlement as a whole and the value it would provide to customers. 
Importantly, the result of the negotiations was materially different from the general framework laid out by President Peevy in Warsaw. TURN and ORA in their April 17 press releases provided their views of the material differences between the settlement and the Peevy construct and maintained ratepayers faired considerably better under the settlement. Just yesterday, the alliance for nuclear responsibility provided a different analysis that came to the opposite point of view, but still concludes that the settlement was materially different from the Peevy construct. 
All of this proves the point, comparing the final settlement to Peevy's generalized framework from Warsaw is bound to produce this type of debate given the lack of detail in that suggested framework. This vagueness lends itself to differing interpretations, really guesses, as to what he may have had in mind. What is most important here is that Peevy's contact with us and any subsequent contacts did not have any influence on the parties who were actually involved in the settlement negotiations. 
As I said, our current plan is to file our response to the ALJ's order tomorrow. Hopefully, my comments provide some helpful context for that filing. I'm sure you will understand that we will probably decline to say anything more about this matter in the Q&A session on this call, and until after we made our filing.
I now want to turn to some of our other business priorities. Of course, the major item for us this year is reaching a reasonable outcome on SCE's General Rate Case. We don't really have anything material to report on that effort today. 
Beyond the GRC, our priorities for the business remain safety, operational excellence and investing and modernizing the electric system to enhance reliability, better serve our customers and support public policy. I'll touch on these briefly. 
Safety leads the list of operational excellence priorities for us. When we say safety, we mean both public safety and worker safety. In both cases, it requires us to constantly find new ways to keep the public and ourselves aware and focused on potential safety hazards and to invest in ways to eliminate or mitigate safety risk. Actually, some of this circles back to provisions in our GRC request, too. Although we have continued to improve our safety performance in recent years, we can do more based on the best-in-class utilities and performance in other industries. A robust safety culture is a top priority. 
Our other operational excellence priorities are reliability, customer service and affordability. Sustained productivity improvement must be part of our DNA. We have made substantial progress on this over the last several years, but we want to continue to improve. 
One important measure is customer rates. We have mentioned to you before that our goal the last few years has been to keep the increase and our system average rate to 3% to 5% per annum. We seek to do this even in the face of cost pressures from expensive mandates that require substantial incremental investment. 
Over the last 5 years, we have managed to stay at the bottom end of that targeted range, which actually compares favorably with our peers in California and several others around the country. We would like to continue to push that down to the level of inflation or lower. 
Today's electric system provides customers with reliable and affordable electric energy, but the system needs to be upgraded to meet changing customer needs. Residential and business customer needs are evolving, while policymakers want us to provide an electric system that facilitates a low carbon economy. 
To meet these needs, we need to be able to integrate more distributed energy resources, such as rooftop solar, energy storage and electric transportation charging. The Distribution Resource Plan and related filings we will make this summer to the CPUC, will serve as the road map for modernizing the electric distribution system. 
The long-term need to invest in a reliable and technologically advanced grid puts a premium on mitigating the potential rate impact of those necessary investments by doing all we can to manage our costs, while operating more effectively and meeting customer needs. This is critical for our long-term competitiveness. 
Beyond our utility business, we continue to pursue growth opportunities and competitive businesses across the electric power industry. Doing so allows us to serve customers outside of SCE's territory. We are focused on providing energy services to commercial and industrial customers through Edison Energy as well as competitive transmission outside SCE's service area through Edison transmission. 
Frankly, I have never felt better about how our company is positioned for the future, both in terms of our strategy and the people we have in place to execute it. Our customers' needs and our industry will continue to evolve. I believe Edison is particularly well positioned to be at the forefront of these changes. 
With that, I will now turn it over to Jim Scilacci for the financial update."
301891,290053950,796525,"Edison International, Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2015",2015-04-28,"Earnings Calls","Edison International","Executives","Thanks, Ted. Good afternoon, everyone. I'll cover the following topics in my remarks, first quarter results, our updated capital spending and rate base forecast and our financing plans. I'll lead off my comments with a general statement about attempting t",1262,"Thanks, Ted. Good afternoon, everyone. I'll cover the following topics in my remarks, first quarter results, our updated capital spending and rate base forecast and our financing plans. I'll lead off my comments with a general statement about attempting to compare 2015 to 2014 earnings. Because SCE has yet to receive a General Rate Case decision, utility is recording revenues largely based on 2014 authorized levels. In the quarter, SCE receives a final GRC decision, we will record a cumulative adjustment retroactive to January 1, 2015. As Ted mentioned, earnings comparisons will not be useful until we report full year 2015 earnings. In the meantime, we believe the simplified rate base model is the best starting point to model full year earnings. Please turn to Page 2 of the presentation. 
As Ted said, core earnings are unchanged year-over-year at $0.90 per share. GAAP, or basic earnings per share, are $0.38 per share higher. This is primarily due to noncore items last year related to the SONGS OII settlement of $0.29 per share and $0.07 per share related to EME. This quarter, we also had $0.02 per share of income under the HLBV accounting treatment for solar tax equity financings. 
As explained in our last call, Edison Energy has tax equity investors. We are required to allocate income under the hypothetical liquidation at book value accounting method. Since this income does not relate to project performance, we classified it as noncore. Edison Energy is included in EIX Parent and Other results. 
Edison International parent company costs are flat at $0.03 per share or slightly higher -- with slightly higher corporate expenses are offset by earnings from Edison Mission Group as we continue to monetize Edison capital's affordable housing portfolio. 
With respect to our quarterly results, let me clarify the presentation of 2 items on our results. First, as I previously mentioned, we are recording CPUC revenues at 2014 authorized level, pending a General Rate Case decision. We used this approach except for one modification. We deferred $36 million of authorized revenues or $0.07 per share, allocated to the first quarter related to incremental repair deductions pending the outcome of the GRC. There's an offsetting $0.07 per share of income tax benefits shown separately on the slide. Since we don't know how the General Rate Case will treat repair deductions, we decided it was prudent not to recognize these benefits. The $0.07 is above repair deductions that are included in our 2015 GRC filing.
Second, let me clarify the presentation of SONGS, which is addressed in Footnote 4 to this slide. During the first quarter of 2015, we began to amortize the SONGS regulatory asset and recorded property taxes, which are recovered through revenues. During the first quarter of last year, we had O&M cost and property taxes that were recovered through GRC revenues. Neither of these affected net income, so we have excluded them from earnings drivers. A fuller description of these items is included in our 10-Q. 
Let me also note that beginning January 1, 2015, SONGS costs are classified as decommissioning expense and recorded as a reduction in our asset retirement obligations. 
Turning back to our slide, we did benefit from $0.07 per share of higher FERC revenues primarily related to rate base growth and recovery of higher operating costs. 
Looking at costs, O&M is $0.01 per share higher, depreciation and amortization cost are $0.04 per share higher from an increase in transmission and distribution investments.
Net financing costs benefited by $0.02 per share, largely from higher AFUDC equity income. This reflects a higher AFUDC rate and a slightly higher construction work-in-progress balance. After adjusting for the incremental repair deductions, SCE had lower tax benefits of $0.04 per share. The lower tax benefits relate principally to higher flow-through tax benefits related to repair deductions, high repair deductions last year. 
Although our results are better than most analyst estimates, I suspect this is largely due to difficulty in estimating quarterly profile of revenues and earnings from our 2014 authorized revenue requirement. Other than, perhaps, a favorable AFUDC equity earnings trend, which could remain a factor for the rest of the year, first quarter results are largely consistent with the simplified rate base model we encourage investors to use as a starting point. Please turn to Page 3.
We have revised our 3-year forecast reflecting the removal of the Coolwater-Lugo transmission project. This 220 kv project planned in the San Bernardino County was intended to support additional utility-scale renewable projects and overall, grid reliability. In mid-March, the California Independent System Operator determined that this project is not necessary to provide full capacity, deliverability, but would conduct additional studies to assess potential need for all or portions of the project for future system requirements. In the interim, the CAISO requested that the CPUC suspend its approval to proceed with the project. SCE supports the suspension given the changing circumstances. Last week, the CPUC issued a proposed decision that recommends dismissing the Coolwater-Lugo application on the basis that sufficient deliverability now exists.
The Coolwater-Lugo project was forecasted to cost $740 million, of which the most recent forecast had $584 million of expenditures falling within the 2015 through 2017 forecast period, partially offsetting this are costs and timing updates for a number of other smaller FERC projects. The net result is a decrease of approximately $300 million and FERC CapEx in our capital spending forecast. For your information, we have provided a prior forecast at the bottom of the slide. 
Lastly, SCE has FERC pre-approval for prudently incurred abandoned plant costs. We will continue to finance SCE's growth consistent with our authorized capital structure. Periodically, SCE will issue long-term debt and preferred stock to support its growing rate base. Of course, retained earnings will provide common equity needs. SCE's 13-month weighted average common equity ratio component was 48.4%. With a cash flow benefits from bonus depreciation expected to commence later this year, SCE may have only modest additional financing requirements this year. Please turn to Page 4.
Our rate base growth forecast remains 7% to 9% compounded annually during the forecast period. The FERC capital spending changes have a minor impact on the average rate base forecast for each year and SCE continues to have a number of growth programs, such as storage, electric vehicle charging and the grid of the future projects that will remain important sources of growth well into the next. Please turn to Page 5.
We have included in this slide some of the important 2015 earnings considerations that we introduced in our last call. The only change is a minor revision to the 2015 rate base forecast that I have discussed earlier. To reiterate our prior statements, we don't plan on issuing 2015 guidance until after SCE receives a General Rate Case decision. 
I'll finish with a couple of reminders on Edison International's investment thesis. Please turn to Page 6. First, we continue to emphasize a lower risk SCE investment program focused on the wires business, both for reliability spending and for adapting the grid to the new technologies and needs that we've spoken about for some time. To meet these investment requirements, while keeping rate increases moderate, will require sustained SCE productivity improvements. Our base financing case remains no common equity issuance to support SCE's investment program. 
Finally, we continue to see the opportunity for above-average dividend growth potential to complement SCE's earnings growth. Of course, our plan is to increase the dividend back to our target payout ratio in steps over time.

Edison Energy or on the competitive side, so whether that's Edison Transmission or some of the C&I energy services or some of the other areas that we're looking at, that's really opportunistic and it's based on kind of the standard parameters that we've used over the years for investment on the competitive side. If we see something that gives us a positive rate of return after considering cost of capital and risk, then we would seek to invest in those things, so long as it stays in the basic electric footprint that we have. So I think you should expect that most of the capital would be dedicated to the SCE activities. Public policy makers in California are certainly keen to see the utilities facilitate the policy objectives of moving to a low carbon economy. That requires modernizing the system and allowing it to facilitate a number of the new technologies and that's where the bulk of the effort will be probably over the next few years."

I would say, broadly, strategically, most definitely, Edison International is in the electricity business and we look for opportunities, not just in SCE's territory but throughout. I think a lot of the changes that we see taking place in the electric industry are, in fact, often occurring here in California. So there's definitely, I'll say, a general strategic learning opportunity that comes from that. We have to be careful on some of the specifics there though. Remember, a lot of the investments that are being made in SCE are being funded by customer rates, customer payments. And we always have to be extremely careful about any bleed over specific information or assets or value from the utility to the unregulated side.

I'm certain that what is on your minds now more than anything else is the filing we will make tomorrow with the California Public Utilities Commission regarding communications with CPUC decision-makers during the SONGS settlement process. Although we are still finalizing our response, I want to make some comments about what we expect to file. Since our work on the filing is still ongoing, there is some small risk that I will have to supplement what I say today, but it is outweighed by our desire to be transparent.
First, we do not expect to file any additional late party -- late ex parte notices. We conducted a thorough process to identify and review communications and internal documents concerning the settlement of the SONGS OII between CPUC decision-makers and personnel at SCE and EIX who could reasonably be expected to have engaged in such communications. As specified in the ALJ's order, we looked at documents from the period between March 1, 2013, a few weeks before the Warsaw meeting and November 30, 2014, a short while after the settlement was approved by the PUC. This is a mammoth undertaking involving an initial broad pool of slightly more than 2 million emails and documents, and then winnowing that group down in successive levels of review to isolate documents relating to the SONGS OII and the settlement process.
I've come to learn how these types of document searches and reviews are done. It is very complicated. It requires real care and setting up the parameters for searching and sifting given the huge number of documents that could potentially be relevant. It also involves some judgments about search parameters. We used multiple levels of review and a lot of checking and rechecking of work. We used an outside law firm to conduct this work. All of this was done in a sincere attempt to do a thorough, complete and proper job. We believe we have done so. 
Our filing tomorrow will provide details on the search criteria and the multilayered review and checking process used. This work will result in us providing a couple dozen emails in our response to the CPUC. 
As I said, we do not expect to make any additional late ex parte notices. That said, we are providing in our response quite a bit of additional information in an effort to be transparent and forthcoming on contacts between CPUC decision-makers and SCE and EIX executives on SONGS-related matters. I want to highlight some of the additional information we intend to provide. 
We are providing a chronology of key events relating to the SONGS settlement, covering the period from the initiation of the OII to the commission approval of the settlement. We are also providing a summary and the relevant documents where we had communications with CPUC decision-makers, even though those communications fell outside of the criteria for filing ex parte notices. These cover things like: A courtesy call to a commissioner to give him or her a heads up we were about to issue a press release on a SONGS-related matter, or a commissioner-initiated contact, which was a one-way conversation from them to one of our executives with no substantive response by our executive, that is our executive was essentially in listen-only mode, or communications between a CPUC decision-maker and SCE or EIX personnel on procedural matters, or updates provided to CPUC commissioners on the status of SONGS restart and system reliability efforts.
This effort has also highlighted, for me, the need to have Rule 8.4, which covers ex parte notices, reviewed and clarified. Any rule can't possibly cover every conceivable communication circumstance, which creates a need to interpret that rule. Over time, the parties who regularly practice before the CPUC, commissioners, utilities, and interveners alike, and resulting commission decisions, develop a body of accepted practice concerning that rule. We make every effort to comply with Rule 8.4 on ex parte notices. 
In my opinion, Rule 8.4 could certainly stand to be clarified and updated. We are the ones who bear the reputational and financial risk of interpretations of and after the fact judgments regarding an ambiguous rule. We understand President Picker intends to review Rule 8.4. We very much welcome such an effort. 
Our response also contains, as required by the ALJ's order, a privilege log of the documents withheld based on legal privilege. 
Finally, our response will contain declarations from Steve Pickett and Ron Litzinger. These documents provide -- primarily provide additional information surrounding the meeting former President Peevy requested in Warsaw. Again, we are going this extra step in an attempt to provide all parties and the public with transparency about this contact. 
I want to make one final point on this matter. Some have contended that the settlement was influenced by the Peevy/Pickett Warsaw meeting, while I can certainly understand the motivation for some to make this statement, it just doesn't stand up to basic logic. To start with, the Warsaw contact was made a good 2.5 months before we had even made the decision to permanently shut down SONGS. Negotiations would turn an ORA commenced after shut down and proceeded with both sides writing on a clean slate, so to speak. The settlement negotiations lasted over 10 months with 14 face-to-face meetings among the negotiating parties and numerous phone calls.
SCE did not negotiate any settlement with Peevy nor did ORA or TURN. Peevy may have had his own ideas about what a settlement should contain, but he wasn't involved in the negotiations. Any settlement was going to have to address the same 4 basic cost issues, cost items at issue, whether articulated by Peevy or anyone else. Those 4 were: The cost of the replacement steam generators, how the non-RSG assets were going to be recovered, replacement power and O&M expenses. There was also the matter of how any third-party recoveries from insurance and MHI would be treated. 
Identifying the areas to negotiate was easy. The hard part was coming to agreement on how they were to be handled and everybody had different ideas about that. ORA, in turn, were active, fully engaged parties to the settlement negotiations. They reached their own conclusions as to the gives and takes in the negotiations and ultimately, as to the settlement as a whole and the value it would provide to customers. 
Importantly, the result of the negotiations was materially different from the general framework laid out by President Peevy in Warsaw. TURN and ORA in their April 17 press releases provided their views of the material differences between the settlement and the Peevy construct and maintained ratepayers faired considerably better under the settlement. Just yesterday, the alliance for nuclear responsibility provided a different analysis that came to the opposite point of view, but still concludes that the settlement was materially different from the Peevy construct. 
All of this proves the point, comparing the final settlement to Peevy's generalized framework from Warsaw is bound to produce this type of debate given the lack of detail in that suggested framework. This vagueness lends itself to differing interpretations, really guesses, as to what he may have had in mind. What is most important here is that Peevy's contact with us and any subsequent contacts did not have any influence on the parties who were actually involved in the settlement negotiations. 
As I said, our current plan is to file our response to the ALJ's order tomorrow. Hopefully, my comments provide some helpful context for that filing. I'm sure you will understand that we will probably decline to say anything more about this matter in the Q&A session on this call, and until after we made our filing.
I now want to turn to some of our other business priorities. Of course, the major item for us this year is reaching a reasonable outcome on SCE's General Rate Case. We don't really have anything material to report on that effort today. 
Beyond the GRC, our priorities for the business remain safety, operational excellence and investing and modernizing the electric system to enhance reliability, better serve our customers and support public policy. I'll touch on these briefly. 
Safety leads the list of operational excellence priorities for us. When we say safety, we mean both public safety and worker safety. In both cases, it requires us to constantly find new ways to keep the public and ourselves aware and focused on potential safety hazards and to invest in ways to eliminate or mitigate safety risk. Actually, some of this circles back to provisions in our GRC request, too. Although we have continued to improve our safety performance in recent years, we can do more based on the best-in-class utilities and performance in other industries. A robust safety culture is a top priority. 
Our other operational excellence priorities are reliability, customer service and affordability. Sustained productivity improvement must be part of our DNA. We have made substantial progress on this over the last several years, but we want to continue to improve. 
One important measure is customer rates. We have mentioned to you before that our goal the last few years has been to keep the increase and our system average rate to 3% to 5% per annum. We seek to do this even in the face of cost pressures from expensive mandates that require substantial incremental investment. 
Over the last 5 years, we have managed to stay at the bottom end of that targeted range, which actually compares favorably with our peers in California and several others around the country. We would like to continue to push that down to the level of inflation or lower. 
Today's electric system provides customers with reliable and affordable electric energy, but the system needs to be upgraded to meet changing customer needs. Residential and business customer needs are evolving, while policymakers want us to provide an electric system that facilitates a low carbon economy. 
To meet these needs, we need to be able to integrate more distributed energy resources, such as rooftop solar, energy storage and electric transportation charging. The Distribution Resource Plan and related filings we will make this summer to the CPUC, will serve as the road map for modernizing the electric distribution system. 
The long-term need to invest in a reliable and technologically advanced grid puts a premium on mitigating the potential rate impact of those necessary investments by doing all we can to manage our costs, while operating more effectively and meeting customer needs. This is critical for our long-term competitiveness. 
Beyond our utility business, we continue to pursue growth opportunities and competitive businesses across the electric power industry. Doing so allows us to serve customers outside of SCE's territory. We are focused on providing energy services to commercial and industrial customers through Edison Energy as well as competitive transmission outside SCE's service area through Edison transmission. 
Frankly, I have never felt better about how our company is positioned for the future, both in terms of our strategy and the people we have in place to execute it. Our customers' needs and our industry will continue to evolve. I believe Edison is particularly well positioned to be at the forefront of these changes. 
With that, I will now turn it over to Jim Scilacci for the financial update."
301891,290053950,796585,"Edison International, Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2015",2015-04-28,"Earnings Calls","Edison International","Executives","Thanks, Ted. Good afternoon, everyone. I'll cover the following topics in my remarks, first quarter results, our updated capital spending and rate base forecast and our financing plans. I'll lead off my comments with a general statement about attempting t",1263,"Thanks, Ted. Good afternoon, everyone. I'll cover the following topics in my remarks, first quarter results, our updated capital spending and rate base forecast and our financing plans. I'll lead off my comments with a general statement about attempting to compare 2015 to 2014 earnings. Because SCE has yet to receive a General Rate Case decision, utility is recording revenues largely based on 2014 authorized levels. In the quarter SCE receives a final GRC decision, we will record a cumulative adjustment retroactive to January 1, 2015. As Ted mentioned, earnings comparisons will not be useful until we report full year 2015 earnings. In the meantime, we believe the simplified rate base model is the best starting point to model full year earnings. Please turn to Page 2 of the presentation. 
As Ted said, core earnings are unchanged year-over-year at $0.90 per share. GAAP, or basic earnings per share, are $0.38 per share higher. This is primarily due to noncore items last year related to the SONGS OII settlement of $0.29 per share and $0.07 per share related to EME. This quarter, we also had $0.02 per share of income under the HLBV accounting treatment for solar tax equity financings. 
As explained in our last call, Edison Energy has tax equity investors. We are required to allocate income under the hypothetical liquidation at book value accounting method. Since this income does not relate to project performance, we classified it as noncore. Edison Energy is included in EIX Parent and Other results. 
Edison International parent company costs are flat at $0.03 per share or slightly higher -- with slightly higher corporate expenses are offset by earnings from Edison Mission Group as we continue to monetize Edison capital's affordable housing portfolio. 
With respect to our quarterly results, let me clarify the presentation of 2 items on our results. First, as I previously mentioned, we are recording CPUC revenues at 2014 authorized level, pending a General Rate Case decision. We used this approach except for one modification. We deferred $36 million of authorized revenues or $0.07 per share, allocated to the first quarter related to incremental repair deductions pending the outcome of the GRC. There's an offsetting $0.07 per share of income tax benefits shown separately on the slide. Since we don't know how the General Rate Case will treat repair deductions, we decided it was prudent not to recognize these benefits. The $0.07 is above repair deductions that are included in our 2015 GRC filing.
Second, let me clarify the presentation of SONGS, which is addressed in Footnote 4 to this slide. During the first quarter of 2015, we began to amortize the SONGS regulatory asset and recorded property taxes, which are recovered through revenues. During the first quarter of last year, we had O&M cost and property taxes that were recovered through GRC revenues. Neither of these affected net income, so we have excluded them from earnings drivers. A fuller description of these items is included in our 10-Q. 
Let me also note that beginning January 1, 2015, SONGS costs are classified as decommissioning expense and recorded as a reduction in our asset retirement obligations. 
Turning back to our slide, we did benefit from $0.07 per share of higher FERC revenues primarily related to rate base growth and recovery of higher operating costs. 
Looking at costs, O&M is $0.01 per share higher, depreciation and amortization cost are $0.04 per share higher from an increase in transmission and distribution investments.
Net financing costs benefited by $0.02 per share, largely from higher AFUDC equity income. This reflects a higher AFUDC rate and a slightly higher construction work-in-progress balance. After adjusting for the incremental repair deductions, SCE had lower tax benefits of $0.04 per share. The lower tax benefits relate principally to higher flow-through tax benefits related to repair deductions, high repair deductions last year. 
Although our results are better than most analyst estimates, I suspect this is largely due to difficulty in estimating quarterly profile of revenues and earnings from our 2014 authorized revenue requirement. Other than, perhaps, a favorable AFUDC equity earnings trend, which could remain a factor for the rest of the year, first quarter results are largely consistent with the simplified rate base model we encourage investors to use as a starting point. Please turn to Page 3.
We have revised our 3-year forecast reflecting the removal of the Coolwater-Lugo transmission project. This 220 kv project planned in the San Bernardino County was intended to support additional utility-scale renewable projects and overall, grid reliability. In mid-March, the California Independent System Operator determined that this project is not necessary to provide full capacity, deliverability, but would conduct additional studies to assess potential need for all or portions of the project for future system requirements. In the interim, the CAISO requested that the CPUC suspend its approval to proceed with the project. SCE supports the suspension given the changing circumstances. Last week, the CPUC issued a proposed decision that recommends dismissing the Coolwater-Lugo application on the basis that sufficient deliverability now exists.
The Coolwater-Lugo project was forecasted to cost $740 million, of which the most recent forecast had $584 million of expenditures falling within the 2015 through 2017 forecast period, partially offsetting this are costs and timing updates for a number of other smaller FERC projects. The net result is a decrease of approximately $300 million and FERC CapEx in our capital spending forecast. For your information, we have provided a prior forecast at the bottom of the slide. 
Lastly, SCE has FERC pre-approval for prudently incurred abandoned plant costs. We will continue to finance SCE's growth consistent with our authorized capital structure. Periodically, SCE will issue long-term debt and preferred stock to support its growing rate base. Of course, retained earnings will provide common equity needs. SCE's 13-month weighted average common equity ratio component was 48.4%. With a cash flow benefits from bonus depreciation expected to commence later this year, SCE may have only modest additional financing requirements this year. Please turn to Page 4.
Our rate base growth forecast remains 7% to 9% compounded annually during the forecast period. The FERC capital spending changes have a minor impact on the average rate base forecast for each year and SCE continues to have a number of growth programs, such as storage, electric vehicle charging and the grid of the future projects that will remain important sources of growth well into the next decade. Please turn to Page 5.
We have included in this slide some of the important 2015 earnings considerations that we introduced in our last call. The only change is a minor revision to the 2015 rate base forecast that I have discussed earlier. To reiterate our prior statements, we don't plan on issuing 2015 guidance until after SCE receives a General Rate Case decision. 
I'll finish with a couple of reminders on Edison International's investment thesis. Please turn to Page 6. First, we continue to emphasize a lower risk SCE investment program focused on the wires business, both for reliability spending and for adapting the grid to the new technologies and needs that we've spoken about for some time. To meet these investment requirements, while keeping rate increases moderate, will require sustained SCE productivity improvements. Our base financing case remains no common equity issuance to support SCE's investment program. 
Finally, we continue to see the opportunity for above-average dividend growth potential to complement SCE's earnings growth. Of course, our plan is to increase the dividend back to our target payout ratio in steps over time.

Edison Energy or on the competitive side, so whether that's Edison Transmission or some of the C&I energy services or some of the other areas that we're looking at, that's really opportunistic and it's based on kind of the standard parameters that we've used over the years for investment on the competitive side. If we see something that gives us a positive rate of return after considering cost of capital and risk, then we would seek to invest in those things, so long as it stays in the basic electric footprint that we have. So I think you should expect that most of the capital would be dedicated to the SCE activities. Public policy makers in California are certainly keen to see the utilities facilitate the policy objectives of moving to a low carbon economy. That requires modernizing the system and allowing it to facilitate a number of the new technologies and that's where the bulk of the effort will be probably over the next few years."

I would say, broadly, strategically, most definitely, Edison International is in the electricity business and we look for opportunities, not just in SCE's territory but throughout. I think a lot of the changes that we see taking place in the electric industry are, in fact, often occurring here in California. So there's definitely, I'll say, a general strategic learning opportunity that comes from that. We have to be careful on some of the specifics there though. Remember, a lot of the investments that are being made in SCE are being funded by customer rates, customer payments. And we always have to be extremely careful about any bleed over of specific information or assets or value from the utility to the unregulated side.

Our first quarter core earnings were $0.90 per share, unchanged from the first quarter the previous year. Because SCE has not received a decision in its 2015 General Rate Case, comparisons of results are not particularly meaningful. Jim Scilacci will cover the specifics.
I'm certain that what is on your minds now more than anything else is the filing we will make tomorrow with the California Public Utilities Commission regarding communications with CPUC decision-makers during the SONGS settlement process. Although we are still finalizing our response, I want to make some comments about what we expect to file. Since our work on the filing is still ongoing, there is some small risk that I will have to supplement what I say today, but it is outweighed by our desire to be transparent.
First, we do not expect to file any additional late party -- late ex parte notices. We conducted a thorough process to identify and review communications and internal documents concerning the settlement of the SONGS OII between CPUC decision-makers and personnel at SCE and EIX who could reasonably be expected to have engaged in such communications. As specified in the ALJ's order, we looked at documents from the period between March 1, 2013, a few weeks before the Warsaw meeting and November 30, 2014, a short while after the settlement was approved by the PUC. This is a mammoth undertaking involving an initial broad pool of slightly more than 2 million emails and documents, and then winnowing that group down in successive levels of review to isolate documents relating to the SONGS OII and the settlement process.
I've come to learn how these types of document searches and reviews are done. It is very complicated. It requires real care and setting up the parameters for searching and sifting given the huge number of documents that could potentially be relevant. It also involves some judgments about search parameters. We used multiple levels of review and a lot of checking and rechecking of work. We used an outside law firm to conduct this work. All of this was done in a sincere attempt to do a thorough, complete and proper job. We believe we have done so. 
Our filing tomorrow will provide details on the search criteria and the multilayered review and checking process used. This work will result in us providing a couple dozen emails in our response to the CPUC. 
As I said, we do not expect to make any additional late ex parte notices. That said, we are providing in our response quite a bit of additional information in an effort to be transparent and forthcoming on contacts between CPUC decision-makers and SCE and EIX executives on SONGS-related matters. I want to highlight some of the additional information we intend to provide. 
We are providing a chronology of key events relating to the SONGS settlement, covering the period from the initiation of the OII to the commission approval of the settlement. We are also providing a summary and the relevant documents where we had communications with CPUC decision-makers, even though those communications fell outside of the criteria for filing ex parte notices. These cover things like: A courtesy call to a commissioner to give him or her a heads up we were about to issue a press release on a SONGS-related matter, or a commissioner-initiated contact, which was a one-way conversation from them to one of our executives with no substantive response by our executive, that is our executive was essentially in listen-only mode, or communications between a CPUC decision-maker and SCE or EIX personnel on procedural matters, or updates provided to CPUC commissioners on the status of SONGS restart and system reliability efforts.
This effort has also highlighted, for me, the need to have Rule 8.4, which covers ex parte notices, reviewed and clarified. Any rule can't possibly cover every conceivable communication circumstance, which creates a need to interpret that rule. Over time, the parties who regularly practice before the CPUC, commissioners, utilities, and interveners alike, and resulting commission decisions, develop a body of accepted practice concerning that rule. We make every effort to comply with Rule 8.4 on ex parte notices. 
In my opinion, Rule 8.4 could certainly stand to be clarified and updated. We are the ones who bear the reputational and financial risk of interpretations of and after the fact judgments regarding an ambiguous rule. We understand President Picker intends to review Rule 8.4. We very much welcome such an effort. 
Our response also contains, as required by the ALJ's order, a privilege log of the documents withheld based on legal privilege. 
Finally, our response will contain declarations from Steve Pickett and Ron Litzinger. These documents provide -- primarily provide additional information surrounding the meeting former President Peevy requested in Warsaw. Again, we are going this extra step in an attempt to provide all parties and the public with transparency about this contact. 
I want to make one final point on this matter. Some have contended that the settlement was influenced by the Peevy/Pickett Warsaw meeting, while I can certainly understand the motivation for some to make this statement, it just doesn't stand up to basic logic. To start with, the Warsaw contact was made a good 2.5 months before we had even made the decision to permanently shut down SONGS. Negotiations would turn an ORA commenced after shut down and proceeded with both sides writing on a clean slate, so to speak. The settlement negotiations lasted over 10 months with 14 face-to-face meetings among the negotiating parties and numerous phone calls.
SCE did not negotiate any settlement with Peevy nor did ORA or TURN. Peevy may have had his own ideas about what a settlement should contain, but he wasn't involved in the negotiations. Any settlement was going to have to address the same 4 basic cost issues, cost items at issue, whether articulated by Peevy or anyone else. Those 4 were: The cost of the replacement steam generators, how the non-RSG assets were going to be recovered, replacement power and O&M expenses. There was also the matter of how any third-party recoveries from insurance and MHI would be treated. 
Identifying the areas to negotiate was easy. The hard part was coming to agreement on how they were to be handled and everybody had different ideas about that. ORA, in turn, were active, fully engaged parties to the settlement negotiations. They reached their own conclusions as to the gives and takes in the negotiations and ultimately, as to the settlement as a whole and the value it would provide to customers. 
Importantly, the result of the negotiations was materially different from the general framework laid out by President Peevy in Warsaw. TURN and ORA in their April 17 press releases provided their views of the material differences between the settlement and the Peevy construct and maintained ratepayers faired considerably better under the settlement. Just yesterday, the alliance for nuclear responsibility provided a different analysis that came to the opposite point of view, but still concludes that the settlement was materially different from the Peevy construct. 
All of this proves the point, comparing the final settlement to Peevy's generalized framework from Warsaw is bound to produce this type of debate given the lack of detail in that suggested framework. This vagueness lends itself to differing interpretations, really guesses, as to what he may have had in mind. What is most important here is that Peevy's contact with us and any subsequent contacts did not have any influence on the parties who were actually involved in the settlement negotiations. 
As I said, our current plan is to file our response to the ALJ's order tomorrow. Hopefully, my comments provide some helpful context for that filing. I'm sure you will understand that we will probably decline to say anything more about this matter in the Q&A session on this call, and until after we made our filing.
I now want to turn to some of our other business priorities. Of course, the major item for us this year is reaching a reasonable outcome on SCE's General Rate Case. We don't really have anything material to report on that effort today. 
Beyond the GRC, our priorities for the business remain safety, operational excellence and investing and modernizing the electric system to enhance reliability, better serve our customers and support public policy. I'll touch on these briefly. 
Safety leads the list of operational excellence priorities for us. When we say safety, we mean both public safety and worker safety. In both cases, it requires us to constantly find new ways to keep the public and ourselves aware and focused on potential safety hazards and to invest in ways to eliminate or mitigate safety risk. Actually, some of this circles back to provisions in our GRC request, too. Although we have continued to improve our safety performance in recent years, we can do more based on the best-in-class utilities and performance in other industries. A robust safety culture is a top priority. 
Our other operational excellence priorities are reliability, customer service and affordability. Sustained productivity improvement must be part of our DNA. We have made substantial progress on this over the last several years, but we want to continue to improve. 
One important measure is customer rates. We have mentioned to you before that our goal the last few years has been to keep the increase and our system average rate to 3% to 5% per annum. We seek to do this even in the face of cost pressures from expensive mandates that require substantial incremental investment. 
Over the last 5 years, we have managed to stay at the bottom end of that targeted range, which actually compares favorably with our peers in California and several others around the country. We would like to continue to push that down to the level of inflation or lower. 
Today's electric system provides customers with reliable and affordable electric energy, but the system needs to be upgraded to meet changing customer needs. Residential and business customer needs are evolving, while policymakers want us to provide an electric system that facilitates a low carbon economy. 
To meet these needs, we need to be able to integrate more distributed energy resources, such as rooftop solar, energy storage and electric transportation charging. The Distribution Resource Plan and related filings we will make this summer to the CPUC, will serve as the road map for modernizing the electric distribution system. 
The long-term need to invest in a reliable and technologically advanced grid puts a premium on mitigating the potential rate impact of those necessary investments by doing all we can to manage our costs, while operating more effectively and meeting customer needs. This is critical for our long-term competitiveness. 
Beyond our utility business, we continue to pursue growth opportunities and competitive businesses across the electric power industry. Doing so allows us to serve customers outside of SCE's territory. We are focused on providing energy services to commercial and industrial customers through Edison Energy as well as competitive transmission outside SCE's service area through Edison transmission. 
Frankly, I have never felt better about how our company is positioned for the future, both in terms of our strategy and the people we have in place to execute it. Our customers' needs and our industry will continue to evolve. I believe Edison is particularly well positioned to be at the forefront of these changes. 
With that, I will now turn it over to Jim Scilacci for the financial update."
301891,290053950,798259,"Edison International, Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2015",2015-04-28,"Earnings Calls","Edison International","Executives","Thanks, Ted. Good afternoon, everyone. I'll cover the following topics in my remarks, first quarter results, our updated capital spending and rate base forecast and our financing plans. I'll lead off my comments with a general statement about attempting t",1263,"Thanks, Ted. Good afternoon, everyone. I'll cover the following topics in my remarks, first quarter results, our updated capital spending and rate base forecast and our financing plans. I'll lead off my comments with a general statement about attempting to compare 2015 to 2014 earnings. Because SCE has yet to receive a General Rate Case decision, utility is recording revenues largely based on 2014 authorized levels. In the quarter SCE receives a final GRC decision, we will record a cumulative adjustment retroactive to January 1, 2015. As Ted mentioned, earnings comparisons will not be useful until we report full year 2015 earnings. In the meantime, we believe the simplified rate base model is the best starting point to model full year earnings. Please turn to Page 2 of the presentation. 
As Ted said, core earnings are unchanged year-over-year at $0.90 per share. GAAP, or basic earnings per share, are $0.38 per share higher. This is primarily due to noncore items last year related to the SONGS OII settlement of $0.29 per share and $0.07 per share related to EME. This quarter, we also had $0.02 per share of income under the HLBV accounting treatment for solar tax equity financings. 
As explained in our last call, Edison Energy has tax equity investors. We are required to allocate income under the hypothetical liquidation at book value accounting method. Since this income does not relate to project performance, we classified it as noncore. Edison Energy is included in EIX Parent and Other results. 
Edison International parent company costs are flat at $0.03 per share or slightly higher -- with slightly higher corporate expenses are offset by earnings from Edison Mission Group as we continue to monetize Edison capital's affordable housing portfolio. 
With respect to our quarterly results, let me clarify the presentation of 2 items on our results. First, as I previously mentioned, we are recording CPUC revenues at 2014 authorized level, pending a General Rate Case decision. We used this approach except for one modification. We deferred $36 million of authorized revenues or $0.07 per share, allocated to the first quarter related to incremental repair deductions pending the outcome of the GRC. There's an offsetting $0.07 per share of income tax benefits shown separately on the slide. Since we don't know how the General Rate Case will treat repair deductions, we decided it was prudent not to recognize these benefits. The $0.07 is above repair deductions that are included in our 2015 GRC filing.
Second, let me clarify the presentation of SONGS, which is addressed in Footnote 4 to this slide. During the first quarter of 2015, we began to amortize the SONGS regulatory asset and recorded property taxes, which are recovered through revenues. During the first quarter of last year, we had O&M cost and property taxes that were recovered through GRC revenues. Neither of these affected net income, so we have excluded them from earnings drivers. A fuller description of these items is included in our 10-Q. 
Let me also note that beginning January 1, 2015, SONGS costs are classified as decommissioning expense and recorded as a reduction in our asset retirement obligations. 
Turning back to our slide, we did benefit from $0.07 per share of higher FERC revenues primarily related to rate base growth and recovery of higher operating costs. 
Looking at costs, O&M is $0.01 per share higher, depreciation and amortization cost are $0.04 per share higher from an increase in transmission and distribution investments.
Net financing costs benefited by $0.02 per share, largely from higher AFUDC equity income. This reflects a higher AFUDC rate and a slightly higher construction work-in-progress balance. After adjusting for the incremental repair deductions, SCE had lower tax benefits of $0.04 per share. The lower tax benefits relate principally to higher flow-through tax benefits related to repair deductions, high repair deductions last year. 
Although our results are better than most analyst estimates, I suspect this is largely due to difficulty in estimating quarterly profile of revenues and earnings from our 2014 authorized revenue requirement. Other than, perhaps, a favorable AFUDC equity earnings trend, which could remain a factor for the rest of the year, first quarter results are largely consistent with the simplified rate base model we encourage investors to use as a starting point. Please turn to Page 3.
We have revised our 3-year forecast reflecting the removal of the Coolwater-Lugo transmission project. This 220 kv project planned in the San Bernardino County was intended to support additional utility-scale renewable projects and overall, grid reliability. In mid-March, the California Independent System Operator determined that this project is not necessary to provide full capacity, deliverability, but would conduct additional studies to assess potential need for all or portions of the project for future system requirements. In the interim, the CAISO requested that the CPUC suspend its approval to proceed with the project. SCE supports the suspension given the changing circumstances. Last week, the CPUC issued a proposed decision that recommends dismissing the Coolwater-Lugo application on the basis that sufficient deliverability now exists.
The Coolwater-Lugo project was forecasted to cost $740 million, of which the most recent forecast had $584 million of expenditures falling within the 2015 through 2017 forecast period, partially offsetting this are costs and timing updates for a number of other smaller FERC projects. The net result is a decrease of approximately $300 million and FERC CapEx in our capital spending forecast. For your information, we have provided a prior forecast at the bottom of the slide. 
Lastly, SCE has FERC pre-approval for prudently incurred abandoned plant costs. We will continue to finance SCE's growth consistent with our authorized capital structure. Periodically, SCE will issue long-term debt and preferred stock to support its growing rate base. Of course, retained earnings will provide common equity needs. SCE's 13-month weighted average common equity ratio component was 48.4%. With a cash flow benefits from bonus depreciation expected to commence later this year, SCE may have only modest additional financing requirements this year. Please turn to Page 4.
Our rate base growth forecast remains 7% to 9% compounded annually during the forecast period. The FERC capital spending changes have a minor impact on the average rate base forecast for each year and SCE continues to have a number of growth programs, such as storage, electric vehicle charging and the grid of the future projects that will remain important sources of growth well into the next decade. Please turn to Page 5.
We have included in this slide some of the important 2015 earnings considerations that we introduced in our last call. The only change is a minor revision to the 2015 rate base forecast that I have discussed earlier. To reiterate our prior statements, we don't plan on issuing 2015 guidance until after SCE receives a General Rate Case decision. 
I'll finish with a couple of reminders on Edison International's investment thesis. Please turn to Page 6. First, we continue to emphasize a lower risk SCE investment program focused on the wires business, both for reliability spending and for adapting the grid to the new technologies and needs that we've spoken about for some time. To meet these investment requirements, while keeping rate increases moderate, will require sustained SCE productivity improvements. Our base financing case remains no common equity issuance to support SCE's investment program. 
Finally, we continue to see the opportunity for above-average dividend growth potential to complement SCE's earnings growth. Of course, our plan is to increase the dividend back to our target payout ratio in steps over time.

However, until SCE receives a decision on its 2015 General Rate Case comparisons of year-over-year results, will not be that",1071,"Thank you, Scott, and good afternoon, everyone. 
Second quarter earnings were $1.16 per share, up $0.08 per share from last year. However, until SCE receives a decision on its 2015 General Rate Case comparisons of year-over-year results, will not be that meaningful. Jim will have the details in his comments. 
Today, I will touch on several policy and growth topics but first, a comment on SONGS. We are disappointed about the renewed uncertainty surrounding the SONGS settlement. Most of the recent procedural moves and various motions have come from individuals and organizations that have consistently opposed the settlement since it was first announced over a year ago. It was more troubling to have one of the six signatories of the settlement, the Utility Reform Network, advice the CPUC in late June that it no longer supported the settlement. Interestingly, in Turn's announcement, it acknowledged that the terms of the settlement were good for customers and that the outcome of any litigated reconsideration process may not differ substantially from the terms of the settlement. Turn is an important blaze on consumer matters before the CPUC, so we must hope that its failure to adhere to its obligations under the SONGS settlement represents an aberration. 
We have now responded to all requests for information from the CPUC's administrative law judges regarding the challenges to the SONGS settlement. We are hopeful they will rule on the outstanding issues soon. Prolonging this period of uncertainty is not good for anyone. We continue to believe strongly that the settlement met all the required standards for last November's unanimous commission approval. We believe that the SONGS settlement was the product of good faith, arm's-length negotiations that resulted in a fair and reasonable outcome for our customers. 
Let me turn to some regulatory policy developments. The CPUC recently ruled on a residential rate design reform as required by Assembly Bill 327. Their recent unanimous decision was the product of significant debate and compromise among the commissioners. We didn't get everything we advocated for. We would've liked to see more progress in increasing the proportion of revenues collected through fixed charges, which would better match our actual cause of serving residential customers. But the minimum bill will be raised from $1.80 to $10 a month. Also, we preserved the opportunity to revisit a more meaningful fixed charge in the future. We achieved rate report reform that places approximately 96% of our retail customers kilowatt hours into a two-tier rate structure, very similar to what we recommended. About 4% of our retail customers kilowatt hours will be subject to a surcharge for high usage. The commissioners invested a tremendous amount of time and effort in this phase of the preceding, and we appreciated the unanimous agreement that getting residential rates closer to the true cost of service was an important tenant in producing fairness amongst customers. Attention will now turn to the portion of the CPUC proceeding on net energy metering, which relates to how customers who opt for rooftop solar are credited for their own generation. Parties will be filing their net energy metering proposals next week. 
Turning to a different subject. We have received broad support for SCEs charge ready program. This is the program we announced last October to invest in infrastructure to support transportation electrification. On July 9, a settlement with most of the parties was filed with the CPUC on the $22 million pilot phase of the program. Importantly, both Turn and the office of rate peer advocates are parties to the settlement as our environmental organizations and electric vehicle charger equipment companies. The principal change to our original application in the settlement is to expense rather than capitalize the rebates that SCE would provide customers for the vehicle chargers installed. While it didn't change the amount recommended for the pilot program, we expect that if  this provision is adopted for the full program, the rate base opportunity will now be $225 million of the total $342 million estimate for the program. We look forward to commission action on the pilot and subsequently, on the full program. 
The final topic I want to cover is SCE's distribution resources plan or DRP, filed with the CPUC on July 1. We consider this planned to be one of our most important filings this year and probably, of several years. We endeavored to not simply answered the commissions's initial questions about integration of distributed energy resources, but also to lay out our vision for how the grid of the future will facilitate customer choice of new technologies and support California's policies to move to a low carbon economy. The goal of the distribution resources plan is to facilitate the integration of distributed energy resources at optimal locations within the distribution grid, and to upgrade the distribution grid to better enable a plug-and-play approach for adding distributed energy resources and new technologies more broadly across our system. These resources include distributed renewable generation, such as rooftop and ground mount solar, electric vehicle charging, energy storage, energy efficiency, demand response. California use these resources as enablers in achieving its low carbon objectives over the next several decades. At the expected adoption rate for these distributed resources, the electric grid will require substantial investment and modernization and upgrades. As part of its filing, SCE provided an initial view of the range of possible capital investments to achieve the goals of the DRP. Assuming CPUC support, this provides some indication of our view of the investment required for the long-term program, which will likely go well into the next decade. Jim will talk about some of the financial details, and how we see this working with the GRC process. 
As I've just indicated, significant capital investment will be required to modernize and upgrade SCEs distribution grid consistent with the DRP recommendations. This is in addition to continued distribution system reliability investment, anticipated electric vehicle charging and storage investments, continued transmission and generation maintenance capital investment and potential improvements in capital spending productivity. All of this is consistent with our lower risk, wires-focused investment strategy. Taken together, we expect overall SCE capital spending to be at least $4 billion annually for the foreseeable future. Depending on the state's preferences on the pace of adoption and on approval of DRP related work in future general rate cases, capital spending could be higher. 
I will now turn it over to Jim for the financial update."

This afternoon, I will cover second quarter and year-to-date results and several other topics. Please turn to Page 2 of the presentation. I will lead off my comments with a general statement about attempting to compare 2015 to 2014 earnings",1514,"Thanks, Ted. This afternoon, I will cover second quarter and year-to-date results and several other topics. 
Please turn to Page 2 of the presentation. I will lead off my comments with a general statement about attempting to compare 2015 to 2014 earnings. Because SCE has yet to receive a 2015 general rate case decision, utilities recording revenues largely based upon 2014 authorized levels. In the quarter, SCE receives a final GRC decision, we will record a cumulative adjustment retroactive to January 1, 2015. Earnings comparisons will not be useful until we report full year 2015 earnings. In the meantime, we believe the simple rate base approach is the best starting point to model full year earnings. 
As Ted said, second quarter core earnings are $1.16 per share. Consistent with our first quarter approach, we did defer revenues to offset incremental repair adoptions pending the outcome of the 2015 GRC. The amount of deferred revenue this quarter was $0.09 per share, with the offsetting benefit in taxes. You can see this in the summary of SCE's drivers on the slide. On a year-to-date basis, SCE has now deferred $0.16 of revenue from incremental repair reductions. Because of the large Delta between expected and forecast repaired reductions for 2015, last May, SCE made a filing with the CPUC to update its prepared reductions for the 15 through 17 GRC period. With a May filing, SCE's updated 2015 revenue request would result in a $120 million revenue decrease from authorized revenues. For the two post-test years, the year-over-year revenue change would be an increase of $236 million and $320 million for the 2016 and 2017, respectively. We have no insight as to the timing of the proposed GRC decision. On July 24, SCE did respond to certain questions raised by the ALJ concerning the May filing regarding repair reductions, the questions related to the coordination of rate making between CPUC and FERC. 
The major items impacting second quarter results is a $31.01 per share tax benefit from reducing liabilities from uncertain tax positions. During the quarter, we received an IRS report for tax years 2010 through 2012. Based on this report, we updated our estimated liabilities for uncertain tax positions, which flow directly through their earnings. We had a similar benefit of $0.09 last year related to updating uncertain tax positions or other tax benefit years. Both of these are highlighted in the SCE key earnings drivers. Historically, we have classified a change in an estimate of uncertain tax position, both positive and negative, as part of core earnings and highlights significant changes that affect period-over-period comparisons. These items are not part of the simplified earnings model that we have discussed in the past, and are subject to future revisions based on audit, new information and other developments related to our tax positions. Excluding the $31.01 per share benefit, second quarter core earnings are $0.85 per share, with SCE contributing $0.87, offset by $0.02 loss at the EIX holding company. In the core EPS drivers stable, we netted out SONGS related impact on revenues, O&M and depreciation. On this basis, revenues are lower by $0.03 per share due to the $0.09 per share deferred revenue I mentioned earlier, and partially offset by $0.06 per share benefit from higher FERC-related and other revenues. 
Looking at costs. O&M has $0.01 per share of positive variance as we continue our cost management focus. SCE second quarter results include $0.02 per share in severance costs this year and $0.01 per share last year. On a year-over-year basis, the difference is minimal because of rounding. Depreciation expense increased by $0.06 per share reflecting SCE's ongoing wires investment. SCE benefited by lower financing costs by $0.03 per share, this relates primarily to higher AFUDC equity earnings. 
Turning to taxes. I've already discussed most of the major items, these include the uncertain tax position this year and last year, as well as the $0.09 per share of incremental repair deductions that is the offset to the $0.09 of revenue, so no net earnings impact. The balance is lower tax benefits year-over-year of $0.12 per share, mainly related to the lower flow through tax benefits and last year, revisions to estimated liabilities of our net operating losses, interest and state income taxes. Remaining $0.07 per share negative variance includes benefit from last year that did not recur in '15, such as generator settlements in a San Onofre property tax refund. For the EIX holding company, losses were $0.01 lower than last year. Due to lower corporate expenses and higher income from affordable housing projects, we continue to wind down the Edison Capital low income housing portfolio. 
Please turn to Page 3. I don't plan to review the year-to-date result -- financial results in detail but the earnings analysis is consistent with the second quarter results. As I've said previously, comparisons pending the 2015 GRC decision are not meaningful. 
Please turn to Page 4. You'll see that the uptick in interest rates is reflected in the trend of the Moody's Utility Bond Index shown as the green line. 12-month moving average line shown in blue isn't moving back towards the 5% base rate. Given the short time period remaining on the 12-month measurement period, it is likely that SCE's CPUC return on common equity will remain at 10.45% during 2016. At FERC, filing an ROE change expires on July 1. 
I will also like to touch on a few other SEC related financial matters that are not shown on this slide. First, SCE's weighted average equity component for regulatory purposes was 48.9% at June 30 compared to 48.4% at the end of the first quarter. SCE's required to maintain a 48% common equity layer on a rolling 13-month basis. Second, SCE continues to make good progress on reducing its fuel and purchased power under collection. As of June 30 of last year, SCE's ERRA balancing count was under collected by $1.6 billion. As of June 30 this year, the ERRA under collection was $543 million. The billion dollar reduction was from 3 primary reasons: SONGS settlement refund credits against the ERRA balancing account; the 2014 ERRA rate increase; and lower-than-expected power and natural gas prices. At the July 23rd commission conference, the CPUC approved SCE's access to the SONGS 213 Nuclear Decommissioning Trust for costs incurred from the June 13, 2013, plant shut down through the end of 2014. These costs amounted $340 million and the amount will be refunded to customers via credit to the ERRA under collections pursuant to the SONGS settlement. This morning, SCE filed a settlement agreement in the 2015 ERRA proceeding. As part of the settlement, SCE has agreed to forgo any 2015 ERRA rate increase adjustment. We now expect that the ERRA under collection will be fully before year-end. Lastly, earlier this month, both SCE and EIX extended the terms of their respective credit agreement by a year to July 2020 for $2.6 billion at SCE and $1.18 billion at EIX. The remainder $150 million for SCE and $68 million for EIX will mature in July 2019. There are no material changes to the terms and conditions. 
Please turn to Page 5. SCE's capital spending forecast is unchanged from the first quarter. That is already discussed the long-term growth opportunity around the Distribution Resources Plan but I want to add a couple of financial specifics. 
Please turn to Page 6. SCE preliminary estimated up to $560 million in potential DRP capital expenditures during the 2015 through 2017 forecast period. These proposed expenditures are largely weighted towards 2017. SCE has requested a memorandum account for the 2015 through '17 revenue requirement of these investments to avoid any retroactive rate making issues. DRP investment that are made within authorized levels for the '15 through '17 GRC period will not have any incremental earnings impact. If our total investment exceeds the amount authorized due to the DRP spending, and if a memorandum account is authorized, then we will seek to recover associated revenue requirement as part of SCE's 2018 General Rate Case. 
Please turn to Page 7. The rate base forecast for the 2015 through '17 GRC period is unchanged from the first quarter. 
Please turn to Page 8. This chart provides 2015 financial assumptions and has been updated for year-to-date results and amounts related to revenue recognition on repair deductions that I covered earlier. 
Please turn to Page 9. I'd like to finish with a recap of our investment pieces. The DRP filing on ongoing rate investments, that Ted discussed, strengthens the long-term growth pieces for SCE. Future capital spending at the $4 billion level implies very roughly a $2 billion per year increase in rate base. We are planning to grow our dividend meaningfully as we look back -- as we move back to our target payout ratio of 45% to 55% of SCE earnings in steps over time. Lastly, we will prudently manage our capital structure and have no plans for external common equity. 
Thank you, and I will turn the call over to the operator to moderate the Q&A."

I would expect that as we go through future rate case cycles, that line between ""new DRP spending and what's a core distribution spending"" will start to emerge as these technologies of the future really become part of the core mainstream for distribution system. One other piece there is that some of the DRP spending, the great reinforcement piece that we've outlined for both the '15, '17 and then beyond time frames, some of that is accelerating work that normally see as distribution infrastructure replacement, hardening circuits that maybe some of our lower voltage circuits need to be brought up to more modern higher voltage circuits so they can accommodate greater number of distributor resources. So that's, again, an area where taking investments that may have been part of the longer-term infrastructure replacement plan but because of the needs to integrate distributed resources, needs to get accelerated forward in order to harden the grid and allow faster adoption of the new technology. So yes, that's a place where you see that line or over the years ahead, little between infrastructure replacement and the DRP bucket."

I think as we go through this and think for not only ourselves but the entire market continues to learn in terms of what the competitive practices are in terms of designing lines, constructing them, et cetera, I think we will be part of the learning process and make sure that we are making our proposals more competitive in the future. So we're still capturing the lessons learned out of the Delaney-Colorado River experience but certainly support the process of the ISOs going through in evaluating proposals and accepting bids based on the parameters."

One of the reasons that we have the range there is that, especially, as we start getting out into 2018 to 2020 timeframe, a lot of the -- our view on the DRP is colored by our internal forecasting of the pace of adoption of technologies.

We are assuming that rural areas would not have quick pace of adoption that might happen in later years. We've taken a stab, what circuits might have a faster level of adoption versus a slower level of adoption. So I think that ranging there really is coupled back to where do customers end up choosing to deploy these technology, how quickly they do and what things do we need to do to make sure that our grid is ready to plug and play, their choices. I think that's really that range as opposed to more interment decision on our part to invest here or there.

Second quarter earnings were $1.16 per share, up $0.08 per share from last year. However, until SCE receives a decision on its 2015 General Rate Case comparisons of year-over-year results, will not be that",1066,"Thank you, Scott, and good afternoon, everyone. 
Second quarter earnings were $1.16 per share, up $0.08 per share from last year. However, until SCE receives a decision on its 2015 General Rate Case comparisons of year-over-year results, will not be that meaningful. Jim will have the details in his comments. 
Today, I will touch on several policy and growth topics, but first, a comment on SONGS. We are disappointed about the renewed uncertainty surrounding the SONGS settlement. Most of the recent procedural moves and various motions have come from individuals and organizations that have consistently opposed the settlement since it was first announced over a year ago. It was more troubling to have 1 of the 6 signatories of the settlement, The Utility Reform Network, advice the CPUC in late June that it no longer supported the settlement. Interestingly, in TURN'S announcement, it acknowledged that the terms of the settlement were good for customers and that the outcome of any litigated reconsideration process may not differ substantially from the terms of the settlement. TURN is an important voice on consumer matters before the CPUC, so we must hope that its failure to adhere to its obligations under the SONGS settlement represents an aberration. 
We have now responded to all requests for information from the CPUC's administrative law judges, regarding the challenges to the SONGS settlement. We are hopeful they will rule on the outstanding issues soon. Prolonging this period of uncertainty is not good for anyone. We continue to believe strongly that the settlement met all the required standards for last November's unanimous commission approval. We believe that the SONGS settlement was the product of good faith, arm's-length negotiations that resulted in a fair and reasonable outcome for our customers. 
Let me turn to some regulatory policy developments. The CPUC recently ruled on a residential rate design reform as required by Assembly Bill 327. Their recent unanimous decision was the product of significant debate and compromise among the commissioners. We didn't get everything we advocated for. We would've liked to see more progress in increasing the proportion of revenues collected through fixed charges, which would better match our actual costs of serving residential customers. But the minimum bill will be raised from $1.80 to $10 a month. Also, we preserved the opportunity to revisit a more meaningful fixed charge in the future. We achieved rate reform that places approximately 96% of our retail customers kilowatt hours into a 2-tier rate structure, very similar to what we recommended. About 4% of our retail customers kilowatt hours will be subject to a surcharge for high usage. The commissioners invested a tremendous amount of time and effort in this phase of the proceeding, and we appreciated the unanimous agreement that getting residential rates closer to the true cost of service was an important tenant in producing fairness amongst customers. Attention will now turn to the portion of the CPUC proceeding on net energy metering, which relates to how customers who opt for rooftop solar are credited for their own generation. Parties will be filing their net energy metering proposals next week. 
Turning to a different subject. We have received broad support for SCEs Charge Ready program. This is the program we announced last October to invest in infrastructure to support transportation electrification. On July 9, a settlement with most of the parties was filed with the CPUC on the $22 million pilot phase of the program. Importantly, both TURN and the Office of Ratepayer Advocates are parties to the settlement, as are environmental organizations and electric vehicle charger equipment companies. The principal change to our original application in the settlement is to expense rather than capitalize the rebates that SCE would provide customers for the vehicle chargers installed. While it didn't change the amount recommended for the pilot program, we expect that if  this provision is adopted for the full program, the rate base opportunity will now be $225 million of the total $342 million estimate for the program. We look forward to commission action on the pilot and subsequently, on the full program. 
The final topic I want to cover is SCE's distribution resources plan or DRP, filed with the CPUC on July 1. We consider this plan to be one of our most important filings this year, and probably, of several years. We endeavored to not simply answer the commissions initial questions about integration of distributed energy resources, but also to lay out our vision for how the grid of the future will facilitate customer choice of new technologies and support California's policies to move to a low-carbon economy. The goal of the distribution resources plan is to facilitate the integration of distributed energy resources at optimal locations within the distribution grid, and to upgrade the distribution grid to better enable a plug-and-play approach for adding distributed energy resources and new technologies more broadly across our system. These resources include distributed renewable generation, such as rooftop and ground mount solar, electric vehicle charging, energy storage, energy efficiency, demand response. California views these resources as enablers in achieving its low-carbon objectives over the next several decades. At the expected adoption rate for these distributed resources, the electric grid will require substantial investment in modernization and upgrades. As part of its filing, SCE provided an initial view of the range of possible capital investments to achieve the goals of the DRP. Assuming CPUC support, this provides some indication of our view of the investment required for the long-term program, which will likely go well into the next decade. Jim will talk about some of the financial details, and how we see this working with the GRC process. 
As I've just indicated, significant capital investment will be required to modernize and upgrade SCEs distribution grid consistent with the DRP recommendations. This is in addition to continued distribution system reliability investment, anticipated electric vehicle charging and storage investments, continued transmission and generation maintenance capital investment and potential improvements in capital spending productivity. All of this is consistent with our lower risk, wires-focused investment strategy. Taken together, we expect overall SCE capital spending to be at least $4 billion annually for the foreseeable future. Depending on the state's preferences on the pace of adoption and on approval of DRP-related work in future general rate cases, capital spending could be higher. 
I will now turn it over to Jim for the financial update."
301891,305647472,845645,"Edison International, Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 30, 2015",2015-07-30,"Earnings Calls","Edison International","Executives","Thanks, Ted. This afternoon, I will cover second quarter and year-to-date results and several other topics. Please turn to Page 2 of the presentation. I will lead off my comments with a general statement about attempting to compare 2015 to 2014 earnings",1517,"Thanks, Ted. This afternoon, I will cover second quarter and year-to-date results and several other topics. 
Please turn to Page 2 of the presentation. I will lead off my comments with a general statement about attempting to compare 2015 to 2014 earnings. Because SCE has yet to receive a 2015 general rate case decision, utilities recording revenues largely based upon 2014 authorized levels. In the quarter, SCE receives a final GRC decision, we will record a cumulative adjustment retroactive to January 1, 2015. Earnings comparisons will not be useful until we report full year 2015 earnings. In the meantime, we believe the simple rate base approach is the best starting point to model full year earnings. 
As Ted said, second quarter core earnings are $1.16 per share. Consistent with our first quarter approach, we did defer revenues to offset incremental repair deductions pending the outcome of the 2015 GRC. The amount of deferred revenue this quarter was $0.09 per share, with the offsetting benefit in taxes. You can see this in the summary of SCE's drivers on the slide. On a year-to-date basis, SCE has now deferred $0.16 of revenue from incremental repair reductions. Because of the large Delta between expected and forecast repair deductions for 2015, last May, SCE made a filing with the CPUC to update its repair reductions for the '15 through '17 GRC period. With the May filing, SCE's updated 2015 revenue request would result in a $120 million revenue decrease from authorized revenues. For the 2 post-test years, the year-over-year revenue change would be an increase of $236 million and $320 million for the 2016 and 2017, respectively. We have no insight as to the timing of the proposed GRC decision. On July 24, SCE did respond to certain questions raised by the ALJ concerning the May filing regarding repair reductions. The questions related to the coordination of ratemaking between CPUC and FERC. 
The major items impacting second quarter results is a $0.31 per share tax benefit from reducing liabilities from uncertain tax positions. During the quarter, we received an IRS report for tax years 2010 through 2012. Based on this report, we updated our estimated liabilities for uncertain tax positions, which flow directly through to earnings. We had a similar benefit of $0.09 last year, related to updating uncertain tax positions for other tax benefit years. Both of these are highlighted in the SCE key earnings drivers. Historically, we have classified a change in an estimate of uncertain tax position, both positive and negative, as part of core earnings and highlight significant changes that affect period-over-period comparisons. These items are not part of the simplified earnings model that we have discussed in the past, and are subject to future revisions based on audits, new information and other developments related to our tax positions. Excluding the $0.31 per share benefit, second quarter core earnings are $0.85 per share, with SCE contributing $0.87, offset by $0.02 loss at the EIX holding company. In the core EPS drivers table, we netted out SONGS-related impact on revenues, O&M and depreciation. On this basis, revenues are lower by $0.03 per share due to the $0.09 per share deferred revenue I mentioned earlier, and partially offset by $0.06 per share benefit from higher FERC-related and other revenues. 
Looking at costs. O&M has $0.01 per share positive variance as we continue our cost management focus. SCE second quarter results included $0.02 per share in severance costs this year and $0.01 per share last year. On a year-over-year basis, the difference is minimal because of rounding. Depreciation expense increased by $0.06 per share, reflecting SCE's ongoing wires investment. SCE benefited by lower financing costs by $0.03 per share. This relates primarily to higher AFUDC equity earnings. 
Turning to taxes. I've already discussed most of the major items. These include the uncertain tax position this year and last year as well as the $0.09 per share of incremental repair deductions that is the offset to the $0.09 of revenue, so no net earnings impact. The balance is lower tax benefits year-over-year of $0.12 per share, mainly related to the lower flow through tax benefits in last year, revisions to estimated liabilities for net operating losses, interest and state income taxes. Remaining $0.07 per share negative variance includes benefits from last year that did not recur in '15, such as generator settlements and a San Onofre property tax refund. For the EIX holding company, losses were $0.01 lower than last year, due to lower corporate expenses and higher income from affordable housing projects. We continue to wind down the Edison Capital low income housing portfolio. 
Please turn to Page 3. I don't plan to review the year-to-date result -- financial results in detail, but the earnings analysis is consistent with the second quarter results. As I have said previously, comparisons pending the 2015 GRC decision are not meaningful. 
Please turn to Page 4. You'll see that the uptick in interest rates is reflected in the trend of the Moody's Utility Bond Index shown as the green line. The 12-month moving average line shown in blue isn't moving back towards the 5% base rate. Given the short time period remaining on the 12-month measurement period, it is likely that SCE's CPUC return on common equity will remain at 10.45%, during 2016. At FERC, the moratorium on filing an ROE change expired on July 1. 
I'd also like to touch on a few other SCE-related financial matters that are not shown on the slide. First, SCE's weighted average equity component for regulatory purposes was 48.9% at June 30 compared to 48.4% at the end of the first quarter. SCE is required to maintain a 48% common equity layer on a rolling 13-month basis. Second, SCE continues to make good progress on reducing its fuel and purchased power under collection. As of June 30 of last year, SCE's ERRA balancing account was under collected by $1.6 billion. As of June 30 this year, the ERRA under collection was $543 million. The $1 billion dollar reduction was from 3 primary reasons: SONGS settlement refund credits against the ERRA balancing account; the 2014 ERRA rate increase; and lower-than-expected power and natural gas prices. At the July 23rd Commission Conference, the CPUC approved SCE's access to the SONGS 2 and 3 Nuclear Decommissioning Trusts for costs incurred from the June 13, 2013, plant shutdown through the end of 2014. These costs amount to $340 million, and the amount will be refunded to customers via credit to the ERRA under collections pursuant to the SONGS settlement. This morning, SCE filed a settlement agreement in the 2015 ERRA proceeding. As part of the settlement, SCE has agreed to forgo any 2015 ERRA rate increase adjustment. We now expect that the ERRA under collection will be fully recovered before year-end. Lastly, earlier this month, both SCE and EIX extended the terms of their respective credit agreement by a year to July 2020 for $2.6 billion at SCE and $1.18 billion at EIX. The remainder $150 million for SCE and $68 million for EIX will mature in July 2019. There are no material changes to the terms and conditions. 
Please turn to Page 5. SCE's capital spending forecast is unchanged from the first quarter. That is already discussed the long-term growth opportunity around the Distribution Resources Plan, but I want to add a couple of financial specifics. 
Please turn to Page 6. SCE preliminary estimated up to $560 million in potential DRP capital expenditures during the 2015 through 2017 forecast period. These proposed expenditures are largely weighted towards 2017. SCE has requested a memorandum account for the 2015 through '17 revenue requirement of these investments to avoid any retroactive ratemaking issues. DRP investments that are made within authorized levels for the '15 through '17 GRC period will not have any incremental earnings impact. If our total investment exceeds the amount authorized due to the DRP spending, and if a memorandum account is authorized, then we will seek to recover associated revenue requirement as part of SCE's 2018 General Rate Case. 
Please turn to Page 7. The rate base forecast for the 2015 through '17 GRC period is unchanged from the first quarter. 
Please turn to Page 8. This chart provides 2015 financial assumptions and has been updated for year-to-date results and amounts related to revenue recognition on repair deductions that I covered earlier. 
Please turn to Page 9. I'd like to finish with a recap of our investment pieces. The DRP filing in ongoing grid investments, that Ted discussed, strengthens the long-term growth pieces for SCE. Future capital spending at the $4 billion level implies very roughly a $2 billion per year increase in rate base. We are planning to grow our dividend meaningfully as we look back -- as we move back to our target payout ratio of 45% to 55% of SCE earnings in steps over time. Lastly, we will prudently manage our capital structure and have no plans for external common equity. 
Thank you, and I will turn the call over to the operator to moderate the Q&A."

It's also number of demonstration projects that we propose to do for the PUC order, so they will -- we'll plan on all of that and ultimately approve a final approach.

In the DRP filing, we outlined a number of categories of DRP-related investments. I would expect that as we go through future rate case cycles, that line between ""what's a new DRP spending and what's a core distribution spending"" will start to emerge as these technologies of the future really become part of the core mainstream for distribution system. One other piece there is that some of the DRP spending, the grid reinforcement piece that we've outlined for both the '15, '17 and then beyond time frames, some of that is accelerating work that might normally see as distribution infrastructure replacement, like hardening circuits that might be some of our lower voltage circuits that need to be brought up to more modern higher voltage circuits, so they can accommodate greater number of distributed resources. So that's, again, an area where we're taking investments that may have been part of a longer-term infrastructure replacement plan but because of the needs to integrate distributed resources, needs to get accelerated forward in order to harden the grid and allow faster adoption of the new technology. So again, that's a place where you see that line over the years ahead, blurring a little bit between infrastructure replacement and the DRP bucket."

One of the reasons that we have the range there is that, especially, as we start getting out into that 2018 to 2020 time frame, a lot of the -- our view on the DRP is colored by our internal forecasting of the pace of adoption of technologies. And how that pace of adoption varies across different parts of our system. For example, the capital spending forecast that we included in the DRP filing are really focused on urban areas. We are assuming that rural areas would not have as quick a pace of adoption and it might happen in later years. We've taken a stab, at what circuits might have a faster level of adoption versus a slower level of adoption. So I think that ranging there really is coupled back to where do customers end up choosing to deploy these technologies? How quickly they do it? And what things do we need to do to ensure that our grid is ready to plug and play, their choices? I think that's really the range as opposed to more a determinative decision on our part to invest here or there. Some of this is that we're really changing the mindset here to make sure that we are supporting, having a grid that's robust and that can keep pace and be ready for customer choices, but we're taking a bit of a stab at this point as to what those customer choices will be."

However, until SCE receives a decision on its 2015 General Rate Case, comparisons of year-over-year results will not be that",1067,"Thank you, Scott, and good afternoon, everyone. 
Second quarter earnings were $1.16 per share, up $0.08 per share from last year. However, until SCE receives a decision on its 2015 General Rate Case, comparisons of year-over-year results will not be that meaningful. Jim will have the details in his comments. 
Today, I will touch on several policy and growth topics, but first, a comment on SONGS. We are disappointed about the renewed uncertainty surrounding the SONGS settlement. Most of the recent procedural moves and various motions have come from individuals and organizations that have consistently opposed the settlement since it was first announced over a year ago. It was more troubling to have 1 of the 6 signatories of the settlement, The Utility Reform Network, advice the CPUC in late June that it no longer supported the settlement. Interestingly, in TURN'S announcement, it acknowledged that the terms of the settlement were good for customers and that the outcome of any litigated reconsideration process may not differ substantially from the terms of the settlement. TURN is an important voice on consumer matters before the CPUC, so we must hope that its failure to adhere to its obligations under the SONGS settlement represents an aberration. 
We have now responded to all requests for information from the CPUC's administrative law judges, regarding the challenges to the SONGS settlement. We are hopeful they will rule on the outstanding issues soon. Prolonging this period of uncertainty is not good for anyone. We continue to believe strongly that the settlement met all the required standards for last November's unanimous commission approval. We believe that the SONGS settlement was the product of good faith, arm's-length negotiations that resulted in a fair and reasonable outcome for our customers. 
Let me turn to some regulatory policy developments. The CPUC recently ruled on a residential rate design reform as required by Assembly Bill 327. Their recent unanimous decision was the product of significant debate and compromise among the commissioners. We didn't get everything we advocated for. We would've liked to see more progress in increasing the proportion of revenues collected through fixed charges, which would better match our actual costs of serving residential customers. But the minimum bill will be raised from $1.80 to $10 a month. Also, we preserved the opportunity to revisit a more meaningful fixed charge in the future. We achieved rate reform that places approximately 96% of our retail customers’ kilowatt hours into a 2-tier rate structure, very similar to what we recommended. About 4% of our retail customers’ kilowatt hours will be subject to a surcharge for high usage. The commissioner has invested a tremendous amount of time and effort in this phase of the proceeding, and we appreciated the unanimous agreement that getting residential rates closer to the true cost of service was an important tenet in producing fairness amongst customers. Attention will now turn to the portion of the CPUC proceeding on net energy metering, which relates to how customers who opt for rooftop solar are credited for their own generation. Parties will be filing their net energy metering proposals next week. 
Turning to a different subject. We have received broad support for SCEs Charge Ready program. This is the program we announced last October to invest in infrastructure to support transportation electrification. On July 9, a settlement with most of the parties was filed with the CPUC on the $22 million pilot phase of the program. Importantly, both TURN and the Office of Ratepayer Advocates are parties to the settlement, as are environmental organizations and electric vehicle charger equipment companies. The principal change to our original application in the settlement is to expense rather than capitalize the rebates that SCE would provide customers for the vehicle chargers installed. While it didn't change the amount recommended for the pilot program, we expect that if this provision is adopted for the full program, the rate base opportunity will now be $225 million of the total $342 million estimate for the program. We look forward to commission action on the pilot and subsequently, on the full program. 
The final topic I want to cover is SCE's distribution resources plan or DRP, filed with the CPUC on July 1. We consider this plan to be one of our most important filings this year, and probably, of several years. We endeavored to not simply answer the commissions’ initial questions about integration of distributed energy resources, but also to lay out our vision for how the grid of the future will facilitate customer choice of new technologies and support California's policies to move to a low-carbon economy. The goal of the distribution resources plan is to facilitate the integration of distributed energy resources at optimal locations within the distribution grid, and to upgrade the distribution grid to better enable a plug-and-play approach for adding distributed energy resources and new technologies more broadly across our system. These resources include distributed renewable generation, such as rooftop and ground mount solar, electric vehicle charging, energy storage, energy efficiency, demand response. California views these resources as enablers in achieving its low-carbon objectives over the next several decades. At the expected adoption rate for these distributed resources, the electric grid will require substantial investment in modernization and upgrades. As part of its filing, SCE provided an initial view of the range of possible capital investments to achieve the goals of the DRP. Assuming CPUC support, this provides some indication of our view of the investment required for the long-term program, which will likely go well into the next decade. Jim will talk about some of the financial details, and how we see this working with the GRC process. 
As I've just indicated, significant capital investment will be required to modernize and upgrade SCEs distribution grid consistent with the DRP recommendations. This is in addition to continued distribution system reliability investment, anticipated electric vehicle charging and storage investments, continued transmission and generation maintenance capital investment and potential improvements in capital spending productivity. All of this is consistent with our lower risk, wires-focused investment strategy. Taken together, we expect overall SCE capital spending to be at least $4 billion annually for the foreseeable future. Depending on the state's preferences on the pace of adoption and on approval of DRP-related work in future general rate cases, capital spending could be higher. 
I will now turn it over to Jim for the financial update."
301891,305647472,845703,"Edison International, Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 30, 2015",2015-07-30,"Earnings Calls","Edison International","Executives","Thanks, Ted. This afternoon, I will cover second quarter and year-to-date results and several other topics. Please turn to Page 2 of the presentation. I will lead off my comments with a general statement about attempting to compare 2015 to 2014 earnings",1520,"Thanks, Ted. This afternoon, I will cover second quarter and year-to-date results and several other topics. 
Please turn to Page 2 of the presentation. I will lead off my comments with a general statement about attempting to compare 2015 to 2014 earnings. Because SCE has yet to receive a 2015 general rate case decision, utilities recording revenue is largely based upon 2014 authorized levels. In the quarter, SCE receives a final GRC decision, we will record a cumulative adjustment retroactive to January 1, 2015. Earnings comparisons will not be useful until we report full year 2015 earnings. In the meantime, we believe the simplified rate base approach is the best starting point to model full year earnings. 
As Ted said, second quarter core earnings are $1.16 per share. Consistent with our first quarter approach, we did defer revenues to offset incremental repair deductions pending the outcome of the 2015 GRC. The amount of deferred revenue this quarter was $0.09 per share, with the offsetting benefit in taxes. You can see this in the summary of SCE's drivers on the slide. On a year-to-date basis, SCE has now deferred $0.16 of revenue from incremental repair reductions. Because of the large delta between expected and forecast repair deductions for 2015, last May, SCE made a filing with the CPUC to update its repair deductions for the '15 through '17 GRC period. With the May filing, SCE's updated 2015 revenue request would result in a $120 million revenue decrease from authorized revenues. For the 2 post-test years, the year-over-year revenue change would be an increase of $236 million and $320 million for the 2016 and 2017, respectively. We have no insight as to the timing of the proposed GRC decision. On July 24, SCE did respond to certain questions raised by the ALJ concerning the May filing regarding repair deductions. The questions related to the coordination of ratemaking between CPUC and FERC. 
The major items impacting second quarter results is a $0.31 per share tax benefit from reducing liabilities from uncertain tax positions. During the quarter, we received an IRS report for tax years 2010 through 2012. Based on this report, we updated our estimated liabilities for uncertain tax positions, which flow directly through to earnings. We had a similar benefit of $0.09 last year, related to updating uncertain tax positions for other tax benefit years. Both of these are highlighted in the SCE key earnings drivers. Historically, we have classified a change in an estimate of an uncertain tax position, both positive and negative, as part of core earnings and highlight significant changes that affect period-over-period comparisons. These items are not part of the simplified earnings model that we have discussed in the past, and are subject to future revisions based on audits, new information and other developments related to our tax positions. Excluding the $0.31 per share benefit, second quarter core earnings are $0.85 per share, with SCE contributing $0.87, offset by $0.02 loss at the EIX holding company. In the core EPS drivers table, we netted out SONGS-related impact on revenues, O&M and depreciation. On this basis, revenues are lower by $0.03 per share due to the $0.09 per share deferred revenue I mentioned earlier, and partially offset by $0.06 per share benefit from higher FERC-related and other revenues. 
Looking at costs. O&M has $0.01 per share positive variance as we continue our cost management focus. SCE second quarter results included $0.02 per share in severance costs this year and $0.01 per share last year. On a year-over-year basis, the difference is minimal because of rounding. Depreciation expense increased by $0.06 per share, reflecting SCE's ongoing wires investment. SCE benefited by lower financing costs by $0.03 per share. This relates primarily to higher AFUDC equity earnings. 
Turning to taxes. I've already discussed most of the major items. These include the uncertain tax position this year and last year as well as the $0.09 per share of incremental repair deductions that is the offset to the $0.09 of revenue, so no net earnings impact. The balance is lower tax benefits year-over-year of $0.12 per share, mainly related to the lower flow through tax benefits in last year, revisions to estimated liabilities for net operating losses, interest and state income taxes. Remaining $0.07 per share negative variance includes benefits from last year that did not recur in '15, such as generator settlements and a San Onofre property tax refund. For the EIX holding company, losses were $0.01 lower than last year, due to lower corporate expenses and higher income from affordable housing projects. We continue to wind down the Edison Capital low income housing portfolio. 
Please turn to Page 3. I don't plan to review the year-to-date result -- financial results in detail, but the earnings analysis is consistent with the second quarter results. As I have said previously, comparisons pending the 2015 GRC decision are not meaningful. 
Please turn to Page 4. You'll see that the uptick in interest rates is reflected in the trend of the Moody's Utility Bond Index shown as the green line. The 12-month moving average line shown in blue isn't moving back towards the 5% base rate. Given the short time period remaining on the 12-month measurement period, it is likely that SCE's CPUC return on common equity will remain at 10.45%, during 2016. At FERC, the moratorium on filing an ROE change expired on July 1. 
I'd also like to touch on a few other SCE-related financial matters that are not shown on the slide. First, SCE's weighted average equity component for regulatory purposes was 48.9% at June 30 compared to 48.4% at the end of the first quarter. SCE is required to maintain a 48% common equity layer on a rolling 13-month basis. Second, SCE continues to make good progress on reducing its fuel and purchased power under collection. As of June 30 of last year, SCE's ERRA balancing account was under collected by $1.6 billion. As of June 30 this year, the ERRA under collection was $543 million. The $1 billion dollar reduction was from 3 primary reasons: SONGS settlement refund credits against the ERRA balancing account; the 2014 ERRA rate increase; and lower-than-expected power and natural gas prices. At the July 23rd Commission Conference, the CPUC approved SCE's access to the SONGS 2 and 3 Nuclear Decommissioning Trusts for costs incurred from the June 13, 2013, plant shutdown through the end of 2014. These costs amount to $340 million, and the amount will be refunded to customers via a credit to the ERRA under collections pursuant to the SONGS settlement. This morning, SCE filed a settlement agreement in the 2015 ERRA proceeding. As part of this settlement, SCE has agreed to forgo any 2015 ERRA rate increase adjustment. We now expect that the ERRA under collection will be fully recovered before year-end. Lastly, earlier this month, both SCE and EIX extended the terms of their respective credit agreement by a year to July 2020 for $2.6 billion at SCE and $1.18 billion at EIX. The remainder, $150 million for SCE and $68 million for EIX, will mature in July 2019. There are no material changes to the terms and conditions. 
Please turn to Page 5. SCE's capital spending forecast is unchanged from the first quarter. Ted has already discussed the long-term growth opportunity around the Distribution Resources Plan, but I want to add a couple of financial specifics. 
Please turn to Page 6. SCE preliminary estimated up to $560 million in potential DRP capital expenditures during the 2015 through 2017 forecast period. These proposed expenditures are largely weighted towards 2017. SCE has requested a memorandum account for the 2015 through '17 revenue requirement of these investments to avoid any retroactive ratemaking issues. DRP investments that are made within authorized levels for the '15 through '17 GRC period will not have any incremental earnings impact. If our total investment exceeds the amount authorized due to the DRP spending, and if a memorandum account is authorized, then we will seek to recover associated revenue requirement as part of SCE's 2018 General Rate Case. 
Please turn to Page 7. The rate base forecast for the 2015 through '17 GRC period is unchanged from the first quarter. 
Please turn to Page 8. This chart provides 2015 financial assumptions and has been updated for year-to-date results and amounts related to revenue recognition on repair deductions that I covered earlier. 
Please turn to Page 9. I'd like to finish with a recap of our investment pieces. The DRP filing in ongoing grid investments, that Ted discussed, strengthens the long-term growth pieces for SCE. Future capital spending at the $4 billion level implies very roughly a $2 billion per year increase in rate base. We are planning to grow our dividend meaningfully as we look back -- as we move back to our target payout ratio of 45% to 55% of SCE earnings in steps over time. Lastly, we will prudently manage our capital structure and have no plans for external common equity. 
Thank you, and I will turn the call over to the operator to moderate the Q&A."

In the DRP filing, we outlined a number of categories of DRP-related investments. I would expect that as we go through future rate case cycles, that line between what's a ""new"" DRP spending and what's a core distribution spending will start to emerge as these technologies of the future really become part of the core mainstream for distribution system. One other piece there is that some of the DRP spending, the grid reinforcement piece that we've outlined for both the '15, '17 and then beyond time frames, some of that is accelerating work that we might normally see as distribution infrastructure replacement, like hardening circuits, there might be some of our lower voltage circuits that need to be brought up to more modern higher voltage circuits, so they can accommodate a greater number of distributed resources. So that's, again, an area where we're taking investments that may have been part of a longer-term infrastructure replacement plan but because of the needs to integrate distributed resources, needs to get accelerated forward in order to harden the grid and allow faster adoption of the new technology. So again, that's a place where you see that line over the years ahead, blurring a little bit between infrastructure replacement and the DRP bucket."

One of the reasons that we have the range there is that, especially, as we start getting out into that 2018 to 2020 time frame, a lot of the -- our view on the DRP is colored by our internal forecasting of the pace of adoption of technologies. And how that pace of adoption varies across different parts of our system. For example, the capital spending forecast that we included in the DRP filing are really focused on urban areas. We are assuming that rural areas would not have as quick a pace of adoption that might happen in later years. We've taken a stab, at what circuits might have a faster level of adoption versus a slower level of adoption. So I think that ranging there really is coupled back to where do customers end up choosing to deploy these technologies? How quickly they do it? And what things do we need to do to ensure that our grid is ready to plug and play their choices. That's really the range as opposed to more a determinative decision on our part to invest here or there. Some of this is that we're really changing the mindset here to make sure that we are supporting having a grid that's robust and that can keep pace and be ready for customer choices, but we're taking a bit of a stab at this point as to what those customer choices will be."

Today, we reported core earnings of $1.16 per share. While this is well below last year's third quarter core earnings of $1.52 per share, year-over-year third quarter earnings comparisons, as was the case wi",1604,"Thank you, Scott, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, we reported core earnings of $1.16 per share. While this is well below last year's third quarter core earnings of $1.52 per share, year-over-year third quarter earnings comparisons, as was the case with the first two quarters of the year, are not very useful. This is because of the way we have had to recognize revenue with the delay in SEC's 2015 general rate case and how we are accounting for the recently released proposed position.
We have said in the past that we would provide 2015 earnings guidance when we receive a final GRC decision. However, with the noise on our quarterly earnings numbers, we thought it a disservice to investors to have them guessing about 2015 earnings, therefore we decided it was best to provide 2015 guidance at this time today. 
So today, we introduced core earnings guidance for 2015 of $3.77 to $3.87 per share. This guidance has some key assumptions that Jim will review in his comments.
Of course, should the final GRC decision differ substantially from the proposed decision, we may have to revisit our guidance. We plan to return to our normal practice of providing annual earnings guidance for 2016 when we report full year 2015 results in late February.
One more comment on the General Rate Case. While we feel the GRC proposed decision is overall generally constructive, SCE identified several important issues in its October 8 comments to the CPUC. Jim will cover most of these, but I want to touch on one in particular. 
The proposed decision attempts to recover certain tax repair benefits that were reflected in earnings in 2012 to 2014 through a permanent reduction to rate base of $344 million. We consider this retroactive ratemaking and a potential violation of internal revenue service rules. We are hopeful that the CPUC will correct their legal error. If the commission were to adopt the proposed decision's retroactive treatment of repair deductions, then SCE would be forced to write-off some or all of the $380 million regulatory asset related to future recovery of taxes.
The final decision on SCEs General Rate Case is currently scheduled for the November 5 CPUC meeting. 
I assume most if not all of you are aware of the administrative law judge's proposed decision released yesterday on penalties related to SONGS ex parte communications. In short, the ALJ found in our PD that there were 8 communications that were late reported to the commission and found 2 rule 1.1 violations. The PD proposed a $16.74 million penalty on Southern California Edison. There are additional procedural steps yet to come on this issue, but we are thankful that this appears to be moving towards resolution.
This has been a painful episode including for Edison, and I feel obliged to make several comments on it. First, I want to set the record straight on some misconceptions that are constantly being repeated. Contrary to the many reports, SCE has not engaged ""improper talks or communications with regulators"" related to the SONGS' OII. The important distinction is that the judge found that we didn't report in a timely manner permissible communications with regulators. The communications themselves were not found to be improper or illegal under the ex-party roles as certain parties have repeatedly and wrongly asserted.
In our recent filing, we maintained that 7 of these 8 communications were either not required or outright not allowed to be reported under the ex parte roles. The difference of opinion is a direct result of ambiguity in California is overly complicated ex parte roles. 
The Ambiguous rules require the parties to do their best to interpret them and practice, which creates a risk. We believe the rules need to be clarified and simplified so that we do not find ourselves underwriting the risk of after-the-fact reviews. It is worth noting that even the ALJ concluded in her P.D. that the ex parte rules were are ambiguous and cited that as a mitigating factor in calculating the penalty. As I said in an earnings call a few quarters ago, we look forward to working with President Bicker to clarify the ex parte roles soon. 
Many of the matters we deal within our business involve tough judgment calls and contentious proceedings under ambiguous rules and conditions. We don't particularly like it, but it comes with the territory. We expect controversy. We also expect a great deal of ourselves and our employees because we provide such an essential service to society and we rely on the public trust.
That is why it is important to do the right thing. We expect nothing less of ourselves. We want to earn the trust of our customers, the public and the CPUC-based on our conduct. While we aren't perfect and there will be times when we fail to live up to our own expectations and those of others, we must, and we do, set high standards of conduct for ourselves.
We have an obligation to be transparent and open and we will redouble our efforts to conduct ourselves in this manner. We will also work hard to support President Vickers efforts to clarify and improve the current poorly-crafted ex parte name roles. Strong efforts on both fronts will go a long way to avoiding a repeat of this in the future.
On a brighter note, we were pleased to report last week the settlement reached with Nuclear Electric Insurance Limited, known as NIOL, on insurance claims related to the shutdown of the Center for Nuclear Generating Station. The settlement is for $400 million and covers all insurance claims by the 3 owners of SONGS related to the events leading to the shutdown. All necessary approvals have been received from the owners and NIOL.
This is another important step in implementing the SONGS' settlement approved unanimously by the CPUC last November. Consistent with the SONGS' settlement, insurance recoveries will first pay associated legal cost and then 95% will be allocated to customers and 5% to the owners.
SCE customers will receive its allocation as a credit to the purchase power balancing account known as ERRA. Assuming payment from NIOL received in the fourth quarter, then customer benefit should show up in their books as a reduction of purchased power cost in 2016.
The larger claim against Mitsubishi Heavy Industries for the failed design of the replacement steam generators continues to proceed under binding arbitration through the International Chamber of Commerce. We still expect a decision on that case by late 2016.
SCE's share of the NIOL recoveries and any MHI recoveries including recovery of legal cost will be treated as non-core. That is, they will not be included in our core earnings.
There's still much procedurally to be accomplished before the SONGS' OII in related matters can be completed. We are hopeful that this is all moving towards a conclusion this year or early next. We continue to believe that no new information has been presented to suggest that the SONGS' settlement was anything other than independently-negotiated,  -- warrants continued full support by the CPUC and its customers.
I'd like to turn to a couple of items that address some of our longer-term growth opportunities, starting with SCEs distribution resources plan or DRP.
Since the July 1 filing, we have seen tremendous interest amongst stakeholders and some encouraging early support from a number of parties on our conceptual long-term approach. Appropriately, there will be concerns about cost and the pace of implementation, of building a flexible twenty-first century grid as outlined in our DRP filings. We are awaiting a more definitive schedule for the balance of the preceding, which the CPUC indicates will be completed next spring. This should give SCE adequate time to incorporate DRP elements into its 2018 to 2020 General Rate Case, which we expect to file in the Fall of 2016. 
Moving on, the California Legislature provided its own form of support for Governor Brown's low carbon goals and the DRP with the passage of Senate Bill 350. The governor signed this bill into law earlier this month. Senate Bill 350 will move renewables targets to 50% of delivered energy from qualifying renewable resources by 2030. The current renewables target is 53% of delivered power by 2020. The new law provides some valuable implementation flexibility that will help us meet the goals at the lowest reasonable cost to our customers. It also provided legislative support for future utility investment and transportation electrification. This is one of the long-term growth opportunities that we see for Southern California Edison, just as we see similar opportunities around electrical -- electric vehicle charging infrastructure and energy storage as complements to SCEs wire-focused investment strategy.
One final comment. I continue to believe that we have an attractive multiyear dividend opportunity that complements a strong earnings growth outlook. The GRC-proposed decision, the DRP and SB 350 are all data points that underscore SCEs growth potential. This in turn reaffirms the dividend growth opportunity I discussed on recent earnings calls. We recognize that for a few years now, we have been below our targeted payout ratio of 45% to 55% of SCE's earnings. We remain committed to moving well into that target range in steps over time.
Hopefully, we will be well along the way to resolution on both the SONGS' OII and the GRC before the Board's usual December consideration of the dividend increase. Even if both are not fully resolved by then, I don't see it impacting our ability to continue to implement our dividend policy. 
That concludes my comments. Now Jim will provide his financial report."

I plan on covering third quarter and year-to-date results, SCEs 2015 General Rate Case proposed decision, capital spending and rate-based forecast, a few other financial topics and guidance. Please turn to Page 2-two",2124,"Thanks, Ted. Good afternoon, everyone. I plan on covering third quarter and year-to-date results, SCEs 2015 General Rate Case proposed decision, capital spending and rate-based forecast, a few other financial topics and guidance. Please turn to Page 2-two of the presentation. 
Let me first address revenue recognition for the first 6 months and then for the third quarter. For the first two months of the year -- for the first two quarters of the year, we recorded revenues largely based on 2014 authorized revenues, which included a revenue in deferral of $85 million or $0.16 per share related to incremental flow-through, tax repaired deductions. Our accounting was based on management judgment that these revenues refunded to customers. Having received the proposed decision, we had updated our estimates of probable refunds to customers as part of our third quarter reporting.  This in turn lowered third quarter revenues. 
The GRC-related revenue deduction was $0.42 per share. This is comprised of the 2 elements shown under key earnings drivers at the right of the slide.
As Ted noted, earnings comparisons will not be useful until we receive a final GRC decision and report full year 2015 earnings. Of course, if the final GRC decision is different than the proposed decision, then there could be other related adjustments. With that background, I'd like to walk through the key earnings drivers starting with SCE. 
There are 2 key earnings drivers of the $0.35 per share decline in SCEs earnings. First, as I mentioned before, we recorded revenue largely based on the GRC-proposed decision, including a catch-up adjustment. Second, there were favorable cost and tax benefits realized in 2014, which did not recur in 2015.
Looking at revenue, I've highlighted the $0.42 per share-related to the GRC-proposed decision. $0.20 of this revenue reduction is from the flow through tax repair benefits to customers with a related offset in the form of higher tax repair deductions. The remaining decrease in GRC revenues are $0.22 per share. Also we continue to see revenue increases from a growing FERC rate base and higher operating costs. This is a positive $0.02 per share.
Lastly, please note that the revenue variances is a net of SONGS' for comparability. The SONGS detail are footnoted below. 
Moving to O&M, SCE had $0.03 per share and higher cost this quarter versus the third quarter of last year. This includes $0.01 per share of additional severance at SCE. Depreciation is $0.02 per share higher primarily due to transmission and distribution investments. Net financing cost provided a $0.02 per share benefit, primarily due to higher earnings from AFUDC.
Turning to taxes. I've already covered the $0.20 per share for the 2015 repair deductions. Most of the remaining variants relates to $0.11 per share in earnings from incremental repair deductions recorded last year.
In all, SCEs third quarter core earnings are $1.19 per share, down $0.35 from last year.
For the holding company, costs are $0.01 per share higher than last year, largely from lower income from Edison capital. I'll come back to Edison Capital later in my remarks. 
Noncore earnings in the quarter of $0.13 per share largely relate to the EME bankruptcy, tax benefits and insurance recoveries.
Please turn to Page 3. We addEd this slide to simplify the explanation of third quarter core earnings. As you can see, the differences -- the difference on this slide versus the prior slide is that we netted out the impact of lower revenues and income tax benefits related to repair deductions in 2015. As indicated on this slide, the 2 key drivers are the lower revenues based on the GRC-proposed decision of $0.22; and the $0.11 of 2014 incremental repair deductions.
That gets us to $0.33 of the $0.35 reduction in third quarter core SCE earnings. Please turn to Page 4.
For year-to-date earnings, GRC related revenue is $0.58 per share lower, reflecting the $0.42 for the third quarter and the $0.16 for the first half of the year. Again, this is a mix of a lower tax repair revenues, $0.30 -- $0.36 per share, which is offset in taxes and the third quarter revenue adjustment of $0.22 per share.
Most of the cost items continue their trend. And for the year-to-date, we also have higher depreciation and O&M and lower financing costs from higher AFUDC earnings.
You We also see the significant impact in both years related to changes in uncertain tax positions and lower tax benefits in other areas. Last year, we also had the generator settlements and other items that are absent this year. All in, year-to-date SCE core earnings are $3.31 per share, down $0.27 from last year.
Page 5 has a similar waterfall chart of year-to-date core earnings. 
Please turn to Page 6. This slide compares the key revenue and rate base differences between the 2015 GRC-proposed decision and SCE's updated request. The revenue adjustments are recorded in the third quarter largely reflect the 3 quarters worth of proposed decisions authorized annual revenue.
Please turn to Page 7. This slide summarizes the most important issues identified in SCEs comments on the proposed decision. Ted has already talked about the tax repare deduction issue. Next is the customer deposit issue. Since the 2003 GRC, the CPUC has weakened customer deposits as a rate base offset. However, PG&E and Sanyo Gas Electric do not have this adjustment. The third item is a proposed reduction in the poll-loading program. The proposed decision did not approve approximately $100 million of capital, which has a 2015 rate base impact of $73 million, putting aside the rate base adjustment for repair deductions, the proposed decision would adopt 92% of our requested capital. This is higher than previous GRC's and of course, this percentage could change the final decision. 
I will note the 2 other key issues. The principal one is incentive compensation. The proposed decision recommended significant reductions and authorized revenues related to incentive compensation for the entire workforce, even though the jointly sponsored SCE and compensation study concluded, SCEs total compensation is an average 5% below market. We are strong believers in pay-for-performance compensation philosophy and incentive-based compensation for all employees, not just executives as a fundamental element of that philosophy. This reduction is larger than experience in prior cases. 
Lastly, there is a $10 million disallowance for a contract termination payment dating back to SCE's rooftop solar initiative. We believe the termination payment is reasonable and benefit the customer substantially. 
In accounting for the quarter, the revenue adjustment track the proposed decision except for 2 items: The tax item; and the solar program contract cancellation disallowance. I'll pick this up later when I discussed rate base forecast and earnings guidance.
Please turn to Page 8. Pages 8 and 9 update forecasted capital expenditures and rate base for the GRC-proposed decision and known FERC-related capital expenditure changes. SCE's experiencing licensing and permitting delays with 2 -- with a few of its transmission projects, notably the West Endeavors project. As a result, the timing of expenditures was moved out beyond 2017. Once SCE files its 2018 GRC application and we update our CapEx and rate-based forecast, these delayed expenditures will appear back in the forecast. The FERC adjustments are shown on the right side of the slide. The balance of the reduction is related to the GRC proposed decision, largely infrastructure replacement, inspection and maintenance and nonelectric facility capital projects.
Historically, we have shown what we call a request level of capital expenditures and rate base in a lower range level. As you can see on the chart, on Pages 8 and 9, we have replaced the word request with the word outlook. Where CPUC capital, we now forecast that we will spend all authorized dollars for 2015 through 2017. For FERC Capital, we have continued our practice of reducing outlook expenditures by 12% to arrive at the range level of expenditures.
Once we file our 2018 General Rate Case, we will revert back to using both request and range monikers. 
As a reminder, the CPUC capital expenditures do not include any distribution resources, plan expenditures. We have asked the commission to approve a memorandum account so we can track costs associated with the DRP spending. So if we were to spend all authorized CPUC amounts provided in the GRC-proposed decision, then we would need to have the DRP memorandum account in place in order to be allowed to see cost recovery in the next GRC.
Beyond 2017, we still believe the long-term capital spending will continue to run at least $4 billion annually. And spending could be higher depending upon CPUC approval and future rate cases.
Please turn to Page 9. Based on a revised capital spending forecast from the prior slide, we have updated our rate-based forecast. The updated rate base forecast yields compound annual growth rates of 8% from 2017 -- '15 through 2017. The prior forecasts was 7% to 9% annually. Consistent with our accounting for the proposed decision, we have not factored in the proposed $344 million reduction in rate base related to the disputed tax repair deduction issue in this forecast. If a final GRC decision about the rate base adjustment, then each of the year's rate base would decline by the adjustment amount.
Please turn to Page 10. As expected, the CPUC cost of capital mechanism did not trigger any change in allowed ROE for 2016. While the Spot, Moody's, PW utility Index rate moved quite a bit, the moving average dampened the full year impact. Starting October 1, we began the new measurement period starting with the moving average where the spot rate ended at September 30 at 5.45%. We are currently scheduled to file our next cost of capital application in April of 2016.
Please turn to Page 11. This page covers a handful of other financial topics. SCEs weighted average common equity component, for regulatory purposes, was 49.5% at September 30, increasing from 48.9% we reported in the second quarter. This excess equity gives us additional financial flexibility.
Next, you will recall that SCEs fuel and purchase power balance account, or ERA have been deeply under collected as recently as year-end 2014. With the previous rate increase, SONGS settlement refunds, lower natural gas costs and the balancing account has moved to an over collective position of $112 [ph] million as of September 30.
When SCE receives the new settlement proceeds, expect it in the fourth quarter, they will be credited to era.
Turning to the holding company. Last month, we renewed an EIX holding company shelf registration to provide us flexibility to access the capital markets as needed for liquidity and general purposes. EIX commercial paper outstanding was $738 million as of September 30, compared to a total EIX credit facility of $1.18 million [ph]. 
Also early this month, we reached an agreement to sell our remaining affordable housing portfolio at Edison Capital. Terms of the transaction have not yet disclosed pending final due diligence and negotiations. In any case, the amounts are not material and the transaction will be treated as non-core.
For the past few years, Edison Capital Earnings have helped offset capital cost. 
Please turn to Page 12. This page provides the detail of our 2015 earnings guidance that Ted discussed. We have followed the same approach we have used the last several years. We start with SCE rate base earnings. We used the 23.1 billion [ph] weighted average rate base outlook as shown on Page 10. Based on SCEs authorized capital structure and flat share count, that gets us to $3.56 [ph] per share of rate-based earnings. We then identified $0.41 per share of SCE items that take earnings higher. The principal item is the $0.31 per share revision to uncertain tax provisions recorded in the second quarter. We have also discussed AFUDC being a net positive factor for the year rather than just offsetting costs not recovered by the General Rate Case revenues. 
We continue to estimate $0.05 of energy efficiency earnings in the fourth quarter as previously disclosed. We have recorded severance cost of $0.03 year-to-date. The balance of all our items is a positive penny a share, including the ex parte proposed penalty. We have estimated full year holding company cost at $0.15, getting us to a midpoint of $3.82 per share.
To the right, we have included key guidance assumptions. We had excluded a shareholder portion of the NIOL settlement proceeds and related litigation cost. We consider these revenues non-core. Our guidance tracks our accounting for the GRC-proposed decision, so it excludes the $344 million rate base adjustment for repair deductions and the solar termination payment disallowance. 
That concludes my comments. I would turn the call over to the operator to moderate the Q&A."

I guess I would try to respond to it this way. If you pull up from looking at one year versus the next year, any individual year, which is kind of the larger theme, the larger trends, as you know, we try to strike this theme consistently. We expect somewhere in this $4 billion plus kind of annual CapEx. We expect pretty significant rate base growth. And we expect that as the base gets larger, as the rate base gets larger, we're going to have more cash flow. So we feel that we could keep a good balance between solid annual CapEx and related earnings from a growing rate, base but cash to move us back in that 45% to 55%. Any given year, any couple of years, you might run a little hotter on CapEx. You might run a little slower on CapEx, that may give you a little -- on the margin, a little more room to move on dividends or slow it down a little bit. But fundamentally, I think rather than try to pick it apart year by year. That's the Teeter totter. It's keeping CapEx in that kind of $4-plus billion range and getting back solidly. I think I used the term well within the range of 45% to 55%. So I wouldn't get too ribbed up on any one year movement. Both of those things are going to be really what we're focused on. And we believe, as a result, we'll be able to provide investors with a higher than industry average growth rate in earnings and a higher than industry average growth rate in dividends."

Today, we reported core earnings of $1.16 per share. While this is well below last year's third quarter core earnings of $1.52 per share, year-over-year third quarter earnings comparisons, as was the case wi",1611,"Thank you, Scott, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, we reported core earnings of $1.16 per share. While this is well below last year's third quarter core earnings of $1.52 per share, year-over-year third quarter earnings comparisons, as was the case with the first 2 quarters of the year, are not very useful. This is because of the way we have had to recognize revenue with the delay in SCE's 2015 General Rate Case and how we are accounting for the recently released proposed decision.
We have said in the past that we would provide 2015 earnings guidance when we received a final GRC decision. However, with the noise in our quarterly earnings numbers, we thought it a disservice to investors to have them guessing about 2015 earnings. Therefore, we decided it was best to provide 2015 guidance at this time today. 
So today, we introduced core earnings guidance for 2015 of $3.77 to $3.87 per share. This guidance has some key assumptions that Jim will review in his comments. Of course, should the final GRC decision differ substantially from the proposed decision, we may have to revisit our guidance. We plan to return to our normal practice of providing annual earnings guidance for 2016 when we report full year 2015 results in late February.
One more comment on the General Rate Case. While we feel the GRC proposed decision is overall generally constructive, SCE identified several important issues in its October 8 comments to the CPUC. Jim will cover most of these, but I want to touch on one in particular. 
The proposed decision attempts to recover certain tax repair benefits that were reflected in earnings in 2012 to 2014 through a permanent reduction to rate base of $344 million. We consider this retroactive ratemaking and a potential violation of internal revenue service rules. We are hopeful that the CPUC will correct their legal error. If the commission were to adopt the proposed decision's retroactive treatment of repair deductions, then SCE would be forced to write off some or all of the $380 million regulatory asset related to future recovery of taxes. The final decision on SCE's General Rate Case is currently scheduled for the November 5 CPUC meeting. 
I assume most, if not all of you, are aware of the administrative law judge's proposed decision released yesterday on penalties related to SONGS ex parte communications. In short, the ALJ found in her P.D. that there were 8 communications that were late reported to the commission and found 2 Rule 1.1 violations. The P.D. proposed a $16.74 million penalty on Southern California Edison. There are additional procedural steps yet to come on this issue, but we are thankful that this appears to be moving towards resolution.
This has been a painful episode, including for Edison, and I feel obliged to make several comments on it. First, I want to set the record straight on some misconceptions that are constantly being repeated. Contrary to the many reports, SCE has not engaged ""improper talks or communications with regulators"" related to the SONGS OII. The important distinction is that the judge found that we didn't report in a timely manner permissible communications with regulators. The communications themselves were not found to be improper or illegal under the ex parte roles, as certain parties have repeatedly and wrongly asserted.
In our recent filing, we maintained that 7 of these 8 communications were either not required or outright not allowed to be reported under the ex parte roles. The difference of opinion is a direct result of ambiguity in California's overly complicated ex parte roles. Ambiguous rules require the parties to do their best to interpret them and practice, which creates a risk. We believe the rules need to be clarified and simplified so that we do not find ourselves underwriting the risk of after-the-fact reviews. It is worth noting that even the ALJ concluded in her P.D. that the ex parte rules were ambiguous and cited that as a mitigating factor in calculating the penalty. As I said in an earnings call a few quarters ago, we look forward to working with President Picker to clarify the ex parte rules soon. 
Many of the matters we deal with in our business involve tough judgments -- tough judgment calls in contentious proceedings under ambiguous rules and conditions. We don't particularly like it, but it comes with the territory. We expect controversy. We also expect a great deal of ourselves and our employees because we provide such an essential service to society, and we rely on the public trust. That is why it is important to do the right thing. We expect nothing less of ourselves. We want to earn the trust of our customers, the public and the CPUC based on our conduct. While we aren't perfect and there will be times when we fail to live up to our own expectations and those of others, we must, and we do, set high standards of conduct for ourselves. We have an obligation to be transparent and open, and we will redouble our efforts to conduct ourselves in this manner. We will also work hard to support President Picker's efforts to clarify and improve the current poorly-crafted ex parte rules. Strong efforts on both fronts will go a long way to avoiding a repeat of this in the future.
On a brighter note, we were pleased to report last week the settlement reached with Nuclear Electric Insurance Limited, known as NEIL, on insurance claims related to the shutdown of the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station. The settlement is for $400 million and covers all insurance claims by the 3 owners of SONGS related to the events leading to the shutdown. All necessary approvals have been received from the owners and NEIL.
This is another important step in implementing the SONGS settlement approved unanimously by the CPUC last November. Consistent with the SONGS settlement, insurance recoveries will first pay associated legal costs, and then 95% will be allocated to customers and 5% to the owners. SCE customers will receive its allocation as a credit to the purchase power balancing account known as ERRA. Assuming payment from NEIL is received in the fourth quarter, then customer benefits should show up in their bills as a reduction in purchase power cost in 2016.
The larger claim against Mitsubishi Heavy Industries for the failed design of the replacement steam generators continues to proceed under binding arbitration through the International Chamber of Commerce. We still expect a decision on that case by late 2016.
SCE's share of the NEIL recoveries and any MHI recoveries, including recovery of legal costs, will be treated as noncore. That is, they will not be included in our core earnings.
There's still much procedurally to be accomplished before the SONGS OII and related matters can be completed. We are hopeful that this is all moving towards a conclusion this year or early next. We continue to believe that no new information has been presented to suggest that the SONGS settlement was anything other than independently negotiated that warrants full -- warrants continued full support by the CPUC and customers.
I'd like to turn to a couple of items that address some of our longer-term growth opportunities, starting with SCE's distribution resources plan, or DRP. Since the July 1 filing, we have seen tremendous interest among stakeholders and some encouraging early support from a number of parties on our conceptual long-term approach. Appropriately, there will be concerns about cost and the pace of implementation of building a flexible 21st century grid, as outlined in our DRP filing. We are awaiting a more definitive schedule for the balance of the preceding, which the CPUC indicates will be completed next spring. This should give SCE adequate time to incorporate DRP elements into its 2018 to 2020 General Rate Case, which we expect to file in the fall of 2016. 
Moving on, the California Legislature provided its own form of support for Governor Brown's low carbon goals and the DRP with the passage of Senate Bill 350. The governor signed this bill into law earlier this month. Senate Bill 350 will move renewables targets to 50% of delivered energy from qualifying renewable resources by 2030. The current renewables target is 33% of delivered power by 2020. The new law provides some valuable implementation flexibility that will help us meet the goals at the lowest reasonable cost to our customers. It also provided legislative support for future utility investment and transportation electrification. This was one of the long-term growth opportunities that we see for Southern California Edison, just as we see similar opportunities around electrical -- electric vehicle charging infrastructure and energy storage as complements to SCE's wire-focused investment strategy.
One final comment. I continue to believe that we have an attractive multiyear dividend opportunity that complements a strong earnings growth outlook. The GRC-proposed decision, the DRP and SB 350 are all data points that underscore SCE's growth potential. This, in turn, reaffirms the dividend growth opportunity I've discussed on recent earnings calls. We recognize that, for a few years now, we have been below our targeted payout ratio of 45% to 55% of SCE's earnings. We remain committed to moving well into that target range in steps over time.
Hopefully, we will be well along the way to resolution on both the SONGS OII and the GRC before the board's usual December consideration of the dividend increase. Even if both are not fully resolved by then, I don't see it impacting our ability to continue to implement our dividend policy. 
That concludes my comments. Now Jim will provide his financial report."
301891,312356148,883116,"Edison International, Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2015",2015-10-27,"Earnings Calls","Edison International","Executives","Thanks, Ted. Good afternoon, everyone. I plan on covering third quarter and year-to-date results, SCE's 2015 General Rate Case proposed decision, capital spending and rate base forecasts, a few other financial topics and guidance. Please turn to Page 2",2127,"Thanks, Ted. Good afternoon, everyone. I plan on covering third quarter and year-to-date results, SCE's 2015 General Rate Case proposed decision, capital spending and rate base forecasts, a few other financial topics and guidance. 
Please turn to Page 2 of the presentation. Let me first address revenue recognition for the first 6 months and then for the third quarter. For the first 2 months of the year -- excuse me, the first 2 quarters of the year, we recorded revenues largely based on 2014 authorized revenues, which included a revenue deferral of $85 million or $0.16 per share related to incremental flow-through tax repair deductions. Our accounting was based on management judgment that these revenues would likely be refunded to customers. Having received the proposed decision, we updated our estimate of probable refunds to customers as part of our third quarter reporting. This, in turn, lowered third quarter revenues. 
The GRC-related revenue reduction was $0.42 per share. This is comprised of the 2 elements shown under key earnings drivers at the right of the slide.
As Ted noted, earnings comparisons will not be useful until we receive a final GRC decision and report full year 2015 earnings. Of course, if the final GRC decision is different than the proposed decision, then there could be other related adjustments. 
With that background, I'd like to walk through the key earnings drivers, starting with SCE. There are 2 key earnings drivers of the $0.35 per share decline in SCE's earnings. First, as I mentioned before, we recorded revenue largely based on the GRC-proposed decision, including a catch-up adjustment; second, there were favorable cost and tax benefits realized in 2014, which did not recur in 2015.
Looking at revenue, I've highlighted the $0.42 per share related to the GRC-proposed decision. $0.20 of this revenue reduction is from the flow-through tax repair benefits to customers with a related offset in the form of higher tax repair deductions. The remaining decrease in GRC revenues are $0.22 per share. Also, we continue to see revenue increases from a growing FERC rate base and higher operating costs. This is a positive $0.02 per share.
Lastly, please note that the revenue variances is a net of SONGS for comparability. The SONGS detail are footnoted below. 
Moving to O&M. SCE had $0.03 per share in higher cost this quarter versus the third quarter of last year. This includes $0.01 per share of additional severance at SCE. Depreciation is $0.02 per share higher, primarily due to transmission and distribution investments. Net financing cost provided a $0.02 per share benefit, primarily due to higher earnings from AFUDC.
Turning to taxes. I've already covered the $0.20 per share for the 2015 repair deductions. Most of the remaining variance relates to $0.11 per share in earnings from incremental repair deductions recorded last year. In all, SCE's third quarter core earnings are $1.19 per share, down $0.35 from last year.
For the holding company, costs are $0.01 per share higher than last year, largely on lower income from Edison Capital. I'll come back to Edison Capital later in my remarks. 
Noncore earnings in the quarter of $0.13 per share largely relate to EME bankruptcy, tax benefits and insurance recoveries.
Please turn to Page 3. We've added this slide to simplify the explanation of third quarter core earnings. As you can see, the differences -- the difference on this slide versus the prior slide is that we netted out the impact of lower revenues and income tax benefits related to repair deductions in 2015. As indicated on this slide, the 2 key drivers are the lower revenues based on the GRC-proposed decision of $0.22 and the $0.11 of 2014 incremental repair deductions. That gets us to $0.33 of the $0.35 reduction in third quarter SCE core earnings. 
Please turn to Page 4. For year-to-date earnings, GRC-related revenue is $0.58 per share lower, reflecting the $0.42 for the third quarter and the $0.16 for the first half of the year. Again, this is a mix of lower tax repair revenues, $0.30 -- $0.36 per share, which is offset in taxes; and the third quarter revenue adjustment of $0.22 per share.
Most of the cost items continue their trend. And for the year-to-date, we also have higher depreciation and O&M and lower financing costs from higher AFUDC earnings. You will also see the significant impact in both years related to changes in uncertain tax positions and lower tax benefits in other areas. Last year, we also had the generator settlements and other items that are absent this year. All in, year-to-date SCE core earnings are $3.31 per share, down $0.27 from last year.
Page 5 has a similar waterfall chart of year-to-date core earnings. 
Please turn to Page 6. This slide compares the key revenue and rate base differences between the 2015 GRC proposed decision and SCE's updated request. The revenue adjustments recorded in the third quarter largely reflect the 3 quarters worth of proposed decisions authorized annual revenue.
Please turn to Page 7. This slide summarizes the most important issues identified in SCE's comments on the proposed decision. Ted has already talked about the tax repair deduction issue. 
Next is the customer deposit issue. Since the 2003 GRC, the CPUC has treated customer deposits as a rate base offset. However, PG&E and San Diego Gas & Electric do not have this adjustment. The third item is a proposed reduction in the pole loading program. The proposed decision did not approve approximately $100 million of capital, which has a 2015 rate base impact of $73 million. Putting aside the rate base adjustment for repair deductions, the proposed decision would adopt 92% of our requested capital. This is higher than previous GRCs and of course, this percentage could change with the final decision. 
I will note 2 other key issues. The principal one is incentive compensation. The proposed decision recommended significant reductions in authorized revenues related to incentive compensation for the entire workforce, even though the jointly sponsored SCE and ORA compensation study concluded SCE's total compensation is, on average, 5% below the market. We are strong believers in pay-for-performance compensation philosophy, and incentive-based compensation for all employees, not just executives, is a fundamental element of that philosophy. This reduction is larger than experienced in prior cases. 
Lastly, there is a $10 million disallowance for a contract termination payment dating back to SCE's commercial rooftop solar initiative. We believe the termination payment is reasonable and benefited customers substantially. 
In accounting for the quarter, the revenue adjustment tracks the proposed decision except for 2 items: the tax item and the solar program contract cancellation disallowance. I'll pick this up later when I discuss rate base forecast and earnings guidance.
Please turn to Page 8. Pages 8 and 9 update forecasted capital expenditures and rate base for the GRC-proposed decision and known FERC-related capital expenditure changes. SCE's experiencing licensing and permitting delays with 2 -- with a few of its transmission projects, notably the West of Devers project. As a result, the timing of expenditures was moved out beyond 2017. Once SCE files its 2018 GRC application and we update our CapEx and rate base forecasts, these delayed expenditures will appear back in the forecast. The FERC adjustments are shown on the right side of the slide. A balance of the reduction is related to the GRC proposed decision, largely infrastructure replacement, inspection and maintenance and nonelectric facility capital projects.
Historically, we have shown what we call a request level of capital expenditures and rate base and a lower range level. As you can see on the chart, on Pages 8 and 9, we have replaced the word request with the word outlook. For CPUC capital, we now forecast that we will spend all authorized dollars for 2015 through 2017. For FERC capital, we have continued our practice of reducing outlook expenditures by 12% to arrive at the range level of expenditures. Once we file our 2018 General Rate Case, we will revert back to using both request and range monikers. 
As a reminder, the CPUC capital expenditures do not include any distribution resources planned expenditures. We have asked the commission to approve a memorandum account so we can track costs associated with the DRP spending. So if we were to spend all authorized CPUC amounts provided in the GRC-proposed decision, then we would need to have the DRP memorandum account in place in order to be allowed to see cost recovery in the next GRC.
Beyond 2017, we still believe the long-term capital spending will continue to run at least $4 billion annually, and spending could be higher depending upon CPUC approval and future rate cases.
Please turn to Page 9. Based on a revised capital spending forecast from the prior slide, we have updated our rate base forecasts. The updated rate base forecast yields compound annual growth rates of 8% from 2017 -- excuse me, '15 through 2017. The prior forecast was 7% to 9% annually. Consistent with our accounting for the proposed decision, we have not factored in the proposed $344 million reduction in rate base related to the disputed tax repair deduction issue in this forecast. If the final GRC decision adopts the rate base adjustment, then each of the year's rate base would decline by the adjustment amount.
Please turn to Page 10. As expected, the CPUC cost of capital mechanism did not trigger any change in allowed ROE for 2016. While the spot Moody's Baa Utility Index rate moved quite a bit, the moving average dampened the full year impact. Starting October 1, we began the new measurement period, starting with the moving average, where the spot rate ended at September 30 at 5.45%. We are currently scheduled to file our next cost of capital application in April 2016.
Please turn to Page 11. This page covers a handful of other financial topics. SCE's weighted average common equity component, for regulatory purposes, was 49.5% at September 30, increasing from 48.9% we reported in the second quarter. This excess equity gives us additional financial flexibility.
Next, you will recall that SCE's fuel and purchase power balancing account, or ERRA, had been deeply under-collected as recently as year-end 2014. With the previous rate increase, SONGS settlement refunds, lower natural gas costs, the balancing account has moved to an over-collective position of $112 million as of September 30. When SCE receives the NEIL settlement proceeds expected in the fourth quarter, they will be credited to ERRA.
Turning to the holding company. Last month, we renewed an EIX holding company shelf registration to provide us flexibility to access the capital markets as needed for liquidity and general corporate purposes. EIX commercial paper outstanding was $738 million as of September 30 compared to a total EIX credit facility of $1.18 billion. 
Also, earlier this month, we reached an agreement to sell our remaining affordable housing portfolio at Edison Capital. Terms of the transaction have not been disclosed, pending final due diligence and negotiations. In any case, the amounts are not material, and the transaction will be treated as noncore. For the past few years, Edison Capital's earnings have helped offset holding company costs. 
Please turn to Page 12. This page provides detail of our 2015 earnings guidance that Ted discussed. We have followed the same approach we have used the last several years. We start with SCE rate base earnings. We use the $23.1 billion weighted average rate base outlook, as shown on Page 10. Based on SCE's authorized capital structure and flat share count, that gets us to $3.56 per share of rate base earnings. We then identify $0.41 per share of SCE items that take earnings higher. The principal item is the $0.31 per share revision to uncertain tax provisions recorded in the second quarter. We have also discussed AFUDC being a net positive factor for the year rather than just offsetting costs not recovered by the General Rate Case revenues. 
We continue to estimate $0.05 of energy efficiency earnings in the fourth quarter, as previously disclosed. We have recorded severance cost of $0.03 year-to-date. The balance of all items is a positive $0.01 a share, including the ex parte proposed penalty. We have estimated full year holding company cost at $0.15, getting us to a midpoint of $3.82 per share.
To the right, we have included key guidance assumptions. We had excluded the shareholder portion of the NEIL settlement proceeds and related litigation costs. We consider these revenues noncore. Our guidance tracks our accounting for the GRC proposed decision, so it excludes the $344 million rate base adjustment for repair deductions and the solar termination payment disallowance. 
That concludes my comments. I will turn the call over to the operator to moderate the Q&A."

And there's also a balancing account that has been set up for our pole loading program, which a lot of the repair deductions are arising from. That's why these repair benefits have increased so dramatically over the last 3 years. So with that balancing account, there's not an opportunity for earnings or losses associated with differences from forecast. A lot of complexity there. Sorry for all the -- there's still more to be written here until we get a final decision."

So I'm just going to touch a couple of items that we see that are changing, both up and down to be fair. So clearly, the DRP is a big element of potential new expenditures. We've provided information at public domain, and you can see there is substantial ramp-up of expenditures in '17 and as you go into '18. But those expenditures will be subject to review as part of our General Rate Case process. There are other things that are going up that would include our -- we have an opportunity through the storage program. We have an opportunity through the electric vehicle charging program. And those are still working their way through -- and all 3 of those, just to emphasize, are not included in the numbers we're seeing here today. So there's a potential upside depending upon how those proceedings progress. On the downside, there's -- the transmission issue is there's still going to be a lot to see where that goes. As you finish some of these larger projects, we've ramped up in transmission area, then we ramp back down as they're finished, then we'll get to a steady state of capital expenditures. We will just have to see how load growth goes. That could be up or down depending upon the health of the service territory and the penetration of distributed generation resources. So I'll leave it there. There's ups and downs. There's probably more of a bias that we see to the upside because of some of these larger projects."

I guess I would try to respond to it this way. If you pull up from looking at 1 year versus the next year, any individual year, which is kind of the larger theme, the larger trends, as you know, I've tried to strike this theme consistently. We expect somewhere in this $4 billion plus kind of annual CapEx. We expect pretty significant rate base growth. And we expect that as the base gets larger, as the rate base gets larger, we're going to have more cash flow. So we feel that we could keep a good balance between solid annual CapEx and related earnings from a growing rate base, but cash to move us back in that 45% to 55%. Any given year, any couple of years, you might run a little hotter on CapEx. You might run a little slower on CapEx. That may give you a little -- on the margin, a little more room to move on dividends or slow it down a little bit. But fundamentally, I think rather than trying to pick it apart year by year, that's the teeter-totter. It's keeping CapEx in that kind of $4-plus billion range and getting them back solidly. I think I used the term well within the range of 45% to 55%. So I wouldn't get too ribbed up on any 1 year movement. Both of those things are going to be really what we're focused on. And we believe, as a result, we'll be able to provide investors with a higher-than-industry average growth rate in earnings and a higher-than-industry average growth rate in dividends."

So those are -- there's executive compensation, board-related costs, our corporate dues and philanthropy activities. There's a whole bucket of that cost that aren't recovered, and we have assumed historically that AFUDC earnings offset those. And what can cause it to go up or down is the balance of what's in the account or the rate. So the rate can go up and down, depending upon what's happening at any point in time. So I think for planning purposes, it's probably appropriate to assume that AFUDC will not come out again in the future in terms of providing a benefit and go back to that rate base approach as the core utility source of earnings and a little bit of energy efficiency that we've talked about repeatedly adjusted for the holding company cost to get you to a decent starting point."

Today, we reported core earnings of $1.16 per share. While this is well below last year's third quarter core earnings of $1.52 per share, year-over-year third quarter earnings comparisons, as was the case wi",1612,"Thank you, Scott, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, we reported core earnings of $1.16 per share. While this is well below last year's third quarter core earnings of $1.52 per share, year-over-year third quarter earnings comparisons, as was the case with the first 2 quarters of the year, are not very useful. This is because of the way we have had to recognize revenue with the delay in SCE's 2015 General Rate Case and how we are accounting for the recently released proposed decision.
We have said in the past that we would provide 2015 earnings guidance when we received a final GRC decision. However, with the noise in our quarterly earnings numbers, we thought it a disservice to investors to have them guessing about 2015 earnings. Therefore, we decided it was best to provide 2015 guidance at this time today. 
So today we introduced core earnings guidance for 2015 of $3.77 to $3.87 per share. This guidance has some key assumptions that Jim will review in his comments. Of course, should the final GRC decision differ substantially from the proposed decision, we may have to revisit our guidance. We plan to return to our normal practice of providing annual earnings guidance for 2016 when we report full year 2015 results in late February.
One more comment on the General Rate Case. While we feel the GRC proposed decision is overall generally constructive, SCE identified several important issues in its October 8 comments to the CPUC. Jim will cover most of these, but I want to touch on one in particular. 
The proposed decision attempts to recover certain tax repair benefits that were reflected in earnings in 2012 to 2014 through a permanent reduction to rate base of $344 million. We consider this retroactive ratemaking and a potential violation of internal revenue service rules. We are hopeful that the CPUC will correct their legal error. If the commission were to adopt the proposed decision's retroactive treatment of repair deductions, then SCE would be forced to write off some or all of the $380 million regulatory asset related to future recovery of taxes. The final decision on SCE's General Rate Case is currently scheduled for the November 5 CPUC meeting. 
I assume most, if not all of you, are aware of the administrative law judge's proposed decision released yesterday on penalties related to SONGS ex parte communications. In short, the ALJ found in her P.D. that there were 8 communications that were late reported to the commission and found 2 Rule 1.1 violations. The P.D. proposed a $16.74 million penalty on Southern California Edison. There are additional procedural steps yet to come on this issue, but we are thankful that this appears to be moving towards resolution.
This has been a painful episode, including for Edison, and I feel obliged to make several comments on it. First, I want to set the record straight on some misconceptions that are constantly being repeated. Contrary to the many reports, SCE has not engaged in ""improper talks or communications with regulators"" related to the SONGS OII. The important distinction is that the judge found that we didn't report in a timely manner permissible communications with regulators. The communications themselves were not found to be improper or illegal under the ex parte roles, as certain parties have repeatedly and wrongly asserted.
In our recent filing, we maintained that 7 of these 8 communications were either not required or outright not allowed to be reported under the ex parte rules. The difference of opinion is a direct result of ambiguity in California's overly complicated ex parte roles. Ambiguous rules require the parties to do their best to interpret them in practice, which creates a risk. We believe the rules need to be clarified and simplified so that we do not find ourselves underwriting the risk of after-the-fact reviews. It is worth noting that even the ALJ concluded in her P.D. that the ex parte rules were ambiguous and cited that as a mitigating factor in calculating the penalty. As I said in an earnings call a few quarters ago, we look forward to working with President Picker to clarify the ex parte rules soon. 
Many of the matters we deal with in our business involve tough judgments -- tough judgment calls in contentious proceedings under ambiguous rules and conditions. We don't particularly like it, but it comes with the territory. We expect controversy. We also expect a great deal of ourselves and our employees because we provide such an essential service to society, and we rely on the public trust. That is why it is important to do the right thing. We expect nothing less of ourselves. We want to earn the trust of our customers, the public and the CPUC based on our conduct. While we aren't perfect, and there will be times when we fail to live up to our own expectations and those of others, we must, and we do, set high standards of conduct for ourselves. We have an obligation to be transparent and open, and we will redouble our efforts to conduct ourselves in this manner. We will also work hard to support President Picker's efforts to clarify and improve the current poorly-crafted ex parte rules. Strong efforts on both fronts will go a long way to avoiding a repeat of this in the future.
On a brighter note, we were pleased to report last week the settlement reached with Nuclear Electric Insurance Limited, known as NEIL, on insurance claims related to the shutdown of the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station. The settlement is for $400 million and covers all insurance claims by the 3 owners of SONGS related to the events leading to the shutdown. All necessary approvals have been received from the owners and NEIL.
This is another important step in implementing the SONGS settlement approved unanimously by the CPUC last November. Consistent with the SONGS settlement, insurance recoveries will first pay associated legal costs, and then 95% will be allocated to customers and 5% to the owners. SCE customers will receive its allocation as a credit to the purchase power balancing account known as ERRA. Assuming payment from NEIL is received in the fourth quarter, then customer benefits should show up in their bills as a reduction in purchase power costs in 2016.
The larger claim against Mitsubishi Heavy Industries for the failed design of the replacement steam generators continues to proceed under binding arbitration through the International Chamber of Commerce. We still expect a decision on that case by late 2016.
SCE's share of the NEIL recoveries and any MHI recoveries, including recovery of legal costs, will be treated as noncore. That is, they will not be included in our core earnings.
There's still much procedurally to be accomplished before the SONGS OII and related matters can be completed. We are hopeful that this is all moving towards a conclusion this year or early next. We continue to believe that no new information has been presented to suggest that the SONGS settlement was anything other than independently negotiated that warrants full -- warrants continued full support by the CPUC and customers.
I'd like to turn to a couple of items that address some of our longer-term growth opportunities, starting with SCE's distribution resources plan, or DRP. Since the July 1 filing, we have seen tremendous interest among stakeholders and some encouraging early support from a number of parties on our conceptual long-term approach. Appropriately, there will be concerns about cost and the pace of implementation of building a flexible 21st century grid, as outlined in our DRP filing. We are awaiting a more definitive schedule for the balance of the proceeding, which the CPUC indicates will be completed next spring. This should give SCE adequate time to incorporate DRP elements into its 2018 to 2020 General Rate Case, which we expect to file in the fall of 2016. 
Moving on, the California Legislature provided its own form of support for Governor Brown's low carbon goals and the DRP with the passage of Senate Bill 350. The governor signed this bill into law earlier this month. Senate Bill 350 will move renewables targets to 50% of delivered energy from qualifying renewable resources by 2030. The current renewables target is 33% of delivered power by 2020. The new law provides some valuable implementation flexibility that will help us meet the goals at the lowest reasonable cost to our customers. It also provided legislative support for future utility investment and transportation electrification. This was one of the long-term growth opportunities that we see for Southern California Edison, just as we see similar opportunities around electrical -- electric vehicle charging infrastructure and energy storage as complements to SCE's wire-focused investment strategy.
One final comment. I continue to believe that we have an attractive multiyear dividend opportunity that complements a strong earnings growth outlook. The GRC-proposed decision, the DRP and SB 350 are all data points that underscore SCE's growth potential. This, in turn, reaffirms the dividend growth opportunity I've discussed on recent earnings calls. We recognize that for a few years now we have been below our targeted payout ratio of 45% to 55% of SCE's earnings. We remain committed to moving well into that target range in steps over time.
Hopefully, we will be well along the way to resolution on both the SONGS OII and the GRC before the board's usual December consideration of the dividend increase. Even if both are not fully resolved by then, I don't see it impacting our ability to continue to implement our dividend policy. 
That concludes my comments. Now Jim will provide his financial report."

I plan on covering third quarter and year-to-date results, SCE's 2015 General Rate Case proposed decision, capital spending and rate base forecasts, a few other financial topics and guidance. Please turn to Page 2",2129,"Thanks, Ted. Good afternoon, everyone. I plan on covering third quarter and year-to-date results, SCE's 2015 General Rate Case proposed decision, capital spending and rate base forecasts, a few other financial topics and guidance. 
Please turn to Page 2 of the presentation. Let me first address revenue recognition for the first 6 months and then for the third quarter. For the first 2 months of the year -- excuse me, the first 2 quarters of the year, we recorded revenues largely based on 2014 authorized revenues, which included a revenue deferral of $85 million or $0.16 per share related to incremental flow-through tax repair deductions. Our accounting was based on management judgment that these revenues would likely be refunded to customers. Having received the proposed decision, we updated our estimate of probable refunds to customers as part of our third quarter reporting. This, in turn, lowered third quarter revenues. 
The GRC-related revenue reduction was $0.42 per share. This is comprised of the 2 elements shown under key earnings drivers at the right of the slide.
As Ted noted, earnings comparisons will not be useful until we receive a final GRC decision and report full year 2015 earnings. Of course, if the final GRC decision is different than the proposed decision, then there could be other related adjustments. 
With that background, I'd like to walk through the key earnings drivers, starting with SCE. There are 2 key earnings drivers of the $0.35 per share decline in SCE's earnings. First, as I mentioned before, we recorded revenue largely based on the GRC-proposed decision, including a catch-up adjustment; second, there were favorable cost and tax benefits realized in 2014, which did not recur in 2015.
Looking at revenue, I've highlighted the $0.42 per share related to the GRC-proposed decision. $0.20 of this revenue reduction is from the flow-through tax repair benefits to customers with a related offset in the form of higher tax repair deductions. The remaining decrease in GRC revenues are $0.22 per share. Also, we continue to see revenue increases from a growing FERC rate base and higher operating costs. This is a positive $0.02 per share.
Lastly, please note that the revenue variances is a net of SONGS for comparability. The SONGS detail are footnoted below. 
Moving to O&M. SCE had $0.03 per share in higher costs this quarter versus the third quarter of last year. This includes $0.01 per share of additional severance at SCE. Depreciation is $0.02 per share higher, primarily due to transmission and distribution investments. Net financing cost provided a $0.02 per share benefit, primarily due to higher earnings from AFUDC.
Turning to taxes. I've already covered the $0.20 per share for the 2015 repair deductions. Most of the remaining variance relates to $0.11 per share in earnings from incremental repair deductions recorded last year. In all, SCE's third quarter core earnings are $1.19 per share, down $0.35 from last year.
For the holding company, costs are $0.01 per share higher than last year, largely on lower income from Edison Capital. I'll come back to Edison Capital later in my remarks. 
Noncore earnings in the quarter of $0.13 per share largely relate to EME bankruptcy, tax benefits and insurance recoveries.
Please turn to Page 3. We've added this slide to simplify the explanation of third quarter core earnings. As you can see, the differences -- the difference on this slide versus the prior slide is that we netted out the impact of lower revenues and income tax benefits related to repair deductions in 2015. As indicated on this slide, the 2 key drivers are the lower revenues based on the GRC-proposed decision of $0.22 and the $0.11 of 2014 incremental repair deductions. That gets us to $0.33 of the $0.35 reduction in third quarter SCE core earnings. 
Please turn to Page 4. For year-to-date earnings, GRC-related revenue is $0.58 per share lower, reflecting the $0.42 for the third quarter and the $0.16 for the first half of the year. Again, this is a mix of lower tax repair revenues, $0.30 -- $0.36 per share, which is offset in taxes; and the third quarter revenue adjustment of $0.22 per share.
Most of the cost items continue their trend. And for the year-to-date, we also have higher depreciation and O&M and lower financing costs from higher AFUDC earnings. You will also see the significant impact in both years related to changes in uncertain tax positions and lower tax benefits in other areas. Last year, we also had the generator settlements and other items that are absent this year. All in, year-to-date SCE core earnings are $3.31 per share, down $0.27 from last year.
Page 5 has a similar waterfall chart of year-to-date core earnings. 
Please turn to Page 6. This slide compares the key revenue and rate base differences between the 2015 GRC proposed decision and SCE's updated request. The revenue adjustments  recorded in the third quarter largely reflect the 3 quarters worth of proposed decisions authorized annual revenue.
Please turn to Page 7. This slide summarizes the most important issues identified in SCE's comments on the proposed decision. Ted has already talked about the tax repair deduction issue. 
Next is the customer deposit issue. Since the 2003 GRC, the CPUC has treated customer deposits as a rate base offset. However, PG&E and San Diego Gas & Electric do not have this adjustment. The third item is a proposed reduction in the pole loading program. The proposed decision did not approve approximately $100 million of capital, which has a 2015 rate base impact of $73 million. Putting aside the rate base adjustment for repair deductions, the proposed decision would adopt 92% of our requested capital. This is higher than previous GRCs, and of course this percentage could change with the final decision. 
I will note 2 other key issues. The principal one is incentive compensation. The proposed decision recommended significant reductions in authorized revenues related to incentive compensation for the entire workforce, even though the jointly sponsored SCE and ORA compensation study concluded SCE's total compensation is, on average, 5% below the market. We are strong believers in pay-for-performance compensation philosophy, and incentive-based compensation for all employees, not just executives, is a fundamental element of that philosophy. This reduction is larger than experienced in prior cases. 
Lastly, there is a $10 million disallowance for a contract termination payment dating back to SCE's commercial rooftop solar initiative. We believe the termination payment is reasonable and benefited customers substantially. 
In accounting for the quarter, the revenue adjustment tracked the proposed decision except for 2 items: the tax item and the solar program contract cancellation disallowance. I'll pick this up later when I discuss rate base forecast and earnings guidance.
Please turn to Page 8. Pages 8 and 9 update forecasted capital expenditures and rate base for the GRC-proposed decision and known FERC-related capital expenditure changes. SCE's experiencing licensing and permitting delays with 2 -- with a few of its transmission projects, notably the West of Devers project. As a result, the timing of expenditures was moved out beyond 2017. Once SCE files its 2018 GRC application and we update our CapEx and rate base forecasts, these delayed expenditures will appear back in the forecast. The FERC adjustments are shown on the right side of the slide. A balance of the reduction is related to the GRC proposed decision, largely infrastructure replacement, inspection and maintenance and nonelectric facility capital projects.
Historically, we have shown what we call a request level of capital expenditures and rate base and a lower range level. As you can see on the chart, on Pages 8 and 9, we have replaced the word request with the word outlook. For CPUC capital, we now forecast that we will spend all authorized dollars for 2015 through 2017. For FERC capital, we have continued our practice of reducing outlook expenditures by 12% to arrive at the range level of expenditures. Once we file our 2018 General Rate Case, we will revert back to using both request and range monikers. 
As a reminder, the CPUC capital expenditures do not include any distribution resources planned expenditures. We have asked the commission to approve a memorandum account so we can track costs associated with the DRP spending. So if we were to spend all authorized CPUC amounts provided in the GRC-proposed decision, then we would need to have the DRP memorandum account in place in order to be allowed to see cost recovery in the next GRC.
Beyond 2017, we still believe the long-term capital spending will continue to run at least $4 billion annually, and spending could be higher depending upon CPUC approval and future rate cases.
Please turn to Page 9. Based on a revised capital spending forecast from the prior slide, we have updated our rate base forecasts. The updated rate base forecast yields compound annual growth rates of 8% from 2017 -- excuse me, in '15 through 2017. The prior forecast was 7% to 9% annually. Consistent with our accounting for the proposed decision, we have not factored in the proposed $344 million reduction in rate base related to the disputed tax repair deduction issue in this forecast. If the final GRC decision adopts the rate base adjustment, then each of the year's rate base would decline by the adjustment amount.
Please turn to Page 10. As expected, the CPUC cost of capital mechanism did not trigger any change in allowed ROE for 2016. Though the spot Moody's Baa Utility Index rate moved quite a bit, the moving average dampened the full year impact. Starting October 1, we began the new measurement period, starting with the moving average, where the spot rate ended at September 30 at 5.45%. We are currently scheduled to file our next cost of capital application in April 2016.
Please turn to Page 11. This page covers a handful of other financial topics. SCE's weighted average common equity component, for regulatory purposes, was 49.5% at September 30, increasing from 48.9% we reported in the second quarter. This excess equity gives us additional financial flexibility.
Next, you will recall that SCE's fuel and purchase power balancing account, or ERRA, had been deeply under-collected as recently as year-end 2014. With the previous rate increase, SONGS settlement refunds, lower natural gas costs, the balancing account has moved to an over-collected position of $112 million as of September 30. When SCE receives the NEIL settlement proceeds expected in the fourth quarter, they will be credited to ERRA.
Turning to the holding company. Last month, we renewed an EIX holding company shelf registration to provide us flexibility to access the capital markets as needed for liquidity and general corporate purposes. EIX commercial paper outstanding was $738 million as of September 30 compared to a total EIX credit facility of $1.18 billion. 
Also, earlier this month, we reached an agreement to sell our remaining affordable housing portfolio at Edison Capital. Terms of the transaction have not been disclosed, pending final due diligence and negotiations. In any case, the amounts are not material, and the transaction will be treated as noncore. For the past few years, Edison Capital's earnings have helped offset holding company costs. 
Please turn to Page 12. This page provides detail of our 2015 earnings guidance that Ted discussed. We have followed the same approach we have used the last several years. We start with SCE rate base earnings. We use the $23.1 billion weighted average rate base outlook, as shown on Page 10. Based on SCE's authorized capital structure and flat share count, that gets us to $3.56 per share of rate base earnings. We then identify $0.41 per share of SCE items that take earnings higher. The principal item is the $0.31 per share revision to uncertain tax provisions recorded in the second quarter. We have also discussed AFUDC being a net positive factor for the year rather than just offsetting costs not recovered by the General Rate Case revenues. 
We continue to estimate $0.05 of energy efficiency earnings in the fourth quarter, as previously disclosed. We have recorded severance cost of $0.03 year-to-date. The balance of all other items is a positive $0.01 a share, including the ex parte proposed penalty. We have estimated full year holding company costs at $0.15, getting us to a midpoint of $3.82 per share.
To the right, we have included key guidance assumptions. We have excluded the shareholder portion of the NEIL settlement proceeds and related litigation costs. We consider these revenues noncore. Our guidance tracks our accounting for the GRC proposed decision, so it excludes the $344 million rate base adjustment for repair deductions and the solar termination payment disallowance. 
That concludes my comments. I will turn the call over to the operator to moderate the Q&A."

So there's some potential upside depending upon how those proceedings progress. 
On the downside, there's -- the transmission issue is there's still going to be a lot to see where that goes. As you finish some of these larger projects, we've ramped up in transmission area, then we ramp back down as they're finished, then we'll get to a steady state of capital expenditures. We will just have to see how load growth goes. That could be up or down depending upon the health of the service territory and the penetration of distributed generation resources. So I'll leave it there. There's ups and downs. There's probably more of a bias that we see to the upside because of some of these larger projects."

I guess I would try to respond to it this way. If you pull up from looking at 1 year versus the next year, any individual year, which is kind of the larger theme, the larger trends, as you know, I've tried to strike this theme consistently. We expect somewhere in this $4 billion plus kind of annual CapEx. We expect pretty significant rate base growth. And we expect that as the base gets larger, as the rate base gets larger, we're going to have more cash flow. So we feel that we could keep a good balance between solid annual CapEx and related earnings from a growing rate base, but cash to move us back in that 45% to 55%. 
Any given year, any couple of years, you might run a little hotter on CapEx. You might run a little slower on CapEx. That may give you a little -- on the margin, a little more room to move on dividends or slow it down a little bit. But fundamentally, I think rather than trying to pick it apart year by year, that's the teeter-totter. It's keeping CapEx in that kind of $4-plus billion range and getting back solidly -- I think I used the term well within -- the range of 45% to 55%. So I wouldn't get too revved up on any 1 year movement. Both of those things are going to be really what we're focused on. And we believe, as a result, we'll be able to provide investors with a higher-than-industry average growth rate in earnings and a higher-than-industry average growth rate in dividends."

Historically, the way we've done this over the last several years, we assume that the AFUDC earnings offsets all the costs that aren't recovered through the ratemaking process. So those are -- there's executive compensation, board-related costs, our corporate dues and philanthropy activities. There's a whole bucket of that cost that aren't recovered, and we have assumed historically that AFUDC earnings offset those.  And what can cause it to go up or down is the balance of what's in the account or the rate. So the rate can go up and down, depending upon what's happening at any point in time. 
So I think for planning purposes, it's probably appropriate to assume that AFUDC will not come out again in the future in terms of providing a benefit and go back to that rate base approach as the core utility source of earnings and a little bit of energy efficiency that we've talked about repeatedly adjusted for the holding company cost to get you to a decent starting point."
