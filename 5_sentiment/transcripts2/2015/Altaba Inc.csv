Before I go into our quarterly and annual financials, I'd like to dedicate the first portion of the call to the announcement we sent out earlier today regarding our Al",764,"Thank you for joining us on our live earnings webcast covering our Q4 and 2014 results. Before I go into our quarterly and annual financials, I'd like to dedicate the first portion of the call to the announcement we sent out earlier today regarding our Alibaba holdings.
As our shareholders are aware, Yahoo holds a total of 384 million shares of Alibaba, which comprises 15.4% of Alibaba and is worth nearly $40 billion using Monday's closing Alibaba share price. Following the Alibaba IPO, these shares are subject to a 1-year lockup agreement that runs until September 1, 2015. If further transferred through ordinary means, the proceeds will be taxable at approximately 40%. Given the low basis, this will give rise to a tax liability of approximately $16 billion or roughly $16 per share of Yahoo.
For over 2 years, we have worked with leading tax, accounting, legal and financial advisors to identify and design an optimal transaction that could maximize the value of our Alibaba stake in a tax efficient manner. Today I'm happy and proud to announce that management has recommended and Yahoo board has authorized a plan to pursue a tax-free spin-off of 100% of the company's remaining holdings in Alibaba. We expect to essentially spin-off in Q4 of 2015. This will result in 2 independent publicly traded companies.
The spin-off company, which we will refer to as SpinCo, will be a newly formed independently registered investment company that will hold 384 million shares of Alibaba and a legacy business that we will separate from Yahoo's core. The transaction will be subject to closing conditions, including regulatory review as appropriate for a deal of this type. After an exhaustive review, we are pursuing the transaction as we believe it maximizes value for our shareholders and authorizes transaction efficiency and certainty. This is a structure that we can pursue and the fact independently, capturing value exclusively for our shareholders. And we made the conscious decision to distribute 100% of our Alibaba shares because we felt maximum tax efficiency was important in our roles as steward of capital.
During this tenure, Yahoo was returned approximately $9.3 billion in capital to shareholders through share repurchases. Assuming Monday's value of Alibaba post spin, we will have returned nearly $50 billion in value to our shareholders. This level of return is historic.
Moreover, concerning the tax-free spin-off announced today, plus the already completed share repurchases, we are on track to return approximately 97% of our proceeds from Alibaba.
It's also worth noting how reducing the number of shares sold in the Alibaba IPO yield an addition value for Yahoo shareholders. As you know, this management team worked very hard to reduce the number of shares that we are contractually required to sell in the IPO. We noted in the last call that renegotiating the previous agreement, we have realized appreciation of over $4 billion. With today's plan for a tax-free transaction, we stand to realize $3.31 billion [ph] of additional tax savings.
In total, the improved relationship between the company and negotiation we worked so hard for is worth more than $7.7 billion today and nearly $8 per share of Yahoo.
I'm proud that our management team has, through good stewardship and focus, found a possible path to delivering this type of value to our shareholders. I'd like to pause here and offer some gratitude to those who helped along the way. I'd like to thank the Yahoo team, along with our advisors, for helping us deliver this excellent plan. I'd like to thank our board for their approval of this plan as well as significant time and energy that they dedicated to this issue. And finally and most importantly, I would like to thank you, our shareholders, for your patience and suggestions as we carefully analyzed the best path forward for Yahoo. I'd like to thank you for investing in us and believing in us. It makes us both really happy to be able to deliver this plan today.
Given its immense value, we made finance solution for Alibaba holdings a priority in the transactions announced today. While our holding in Yahoo Japan by comparison are a small fraction of our Alibaba holdings, we will continue to explore ways to maximize the value of Yahoo Japan, continuing our commitment to be good stewards of capital.
In our core operating business, we see only a strong foundation and we are in and return the company to growth.
I'll now turn it over to Ken to discuss the tax-free spin-off structure and the execution plan in more depth."

I'm here to provide further details of announcement as summary transactions slide presentation available on our Investor Relations website.
As shown in Slides 3 and 4, 1 company will be the coexisting Yahoo entity, which will include the Yahoo operating business, net cash and at 35.5% equity ownership stake in our Yahoo Japan joint venture. As Marissa mentioned, the second company will be the newly formed entity, which will be a registered investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940. It will include a remaining 15.4% ownership of Alibaba shares. SpinCo will also include a legacy ancillary business as active trade of business with approximately $50 million in adjusted EBITDA that we have identified to be part of the transaction. The stock in the new company will be distributed Yahoo share listed. It will be read by independent, newly appointed management team and Board of Directors. The composition of SpinCo's Board of Directors and management team details the transaction, including the distribution ratio, will be announced prior to the close of the transaction.
SpinCo will assume no debt as part of the transaction. We believe this will be a unique spin-off transaction. We are not aware of any present -- of an operating company spinning off a registered investment company. And as seen in Slide 5, we believe the structure is most attractive alternative for Yahoo and our shareholders.
Should the transaction decides to maximize value of our Alibaba holdings exclusively to our shareholders as distribution will be tax-free. The ability to execute the transaction independently optimizes timing and execution efficiency.
Lastly, we view the transaction will improve valuation transparency for both SpinCo and Yahoo. The transaction is subject to regulatory and certain other conditions, and we expect it to close in Q4 2015 as seen on Slide 6.
Key cause and conditions do include receipt of iOS and requisite tax opinions, confirming tax-free status of the spin, filing effectiveness of applicable with the Securities and Exchange Commission, in compliance with the requirements and the Investment Company Act of 1940. We are in the process of filing for ruling from the IRS and our ongoing communication with the SEC. Today's announcement culminates a comprehensive review of alternatives connected by the board and that the management team working with our top advisers, and we believe this is the structure with a clean transaction for the company and our shareholders.
With regard to our equity ownership in Yahoo Japan, YJ is a joint venture with Softbank. We remain open-minded about the value -- alternatives for value creation and our equity ownership in Yahoo Japan is not part of this transaction. Today, we are primarily focused on maximizing the value of our Alibaba shares, which are, by far, our largest nonoperating asset in a tax efficient manner to drive significant shareholder value. The Yahoo Japan ownership stake is currently valued at approximately $7 billion compared to the much greater value of the Alibaba stake at approximately $40 billion. And that's a very much smaller value-creation opportunity.
Given our operating relationship, we also need to carefully consider other factors relative to our Yahoo Japan equity ownership such as our brand license and technology license agreements. In conjunction with our advisors, the management team is continuing a evaluation of financial competitive and strategic implications for this entity.
Now let me turn it back to Marissa as we discuss our Q4 and full year 2014 performance. Marissa?"
91800,281170058,749605,"Yahoo! Inc., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Jan 27, 2015",2015-01-27,"Earnings Calls","Altaba Inc.","Executives","This historic level of return for the business has been possible because of Alibaba's tremendous performance and because of our Founder, Jerry Yang's investment in 2005. We'd like to thank both Jerry as well as the team in Alibaba by Jack and Jill. Thank",2871,"This historic level of return for the business has been possible because of Alibaba's tremendous performance and because of our Founder, Jerry Yang's investment in 2005. We'd like to thank both Jerry as well as the team in Alibaba by Jack and Jill. Thank you.
This level of return is also impossible because the core of Yahoo's business is returning to health and stability and we believe growth. We've seen over the past 2.5 years that our own free cash flow is healthy enough to allow for the necessary investment in the core business through organic means.
Look at our Q4 in 2014 results, I'm pleased to report that our performance continues to show stability in the core business. In Q4, our GAAP revenue was $1,253,000,000. In 2014, our GAAP revenue was $4,680,000,000. Both are roughly flat year-over-year, down approximately 1%.
On a revenue ex-TAC basis, our revenue in Q4 was $1,179,000,000, down approximately 2% year-over-year, largely due to tax acceleration in our Search business. In 2014, our revenue ex-TAC was $4,401,000,000, down less than 1%.
I'm now going to turn to look at our progress in detail. On Mobile, on our investment businesses, mobile, video, native and social, on Search and on Display and a broader look at the company's strengths are efficiency and excellence; and our acquisition strategy.
For the first time last quarter, we reported on our Mobile revenue. In Q3, we saw approximately $200 million on a GAAP basis and predicted more than $1.2 billion on a gross basis and more than $700 million on a GAAP basis for the year. I'm proud to say that we achieved these estimates. In Q4, our Mobile revenue was $254 million, up from $207 million in Q3, a growth of 23% quarter-over-quarter.
Our GAAP level revenue for the year was $1,260,000,000, and our Mobile GAAP revenue was $768 million, exceeding our estimates by 5% and 10%, respectively. We had a very good year in Mobile and we grew accelerating rate and one that seems to be faster than the industry.
In Q4, our Mobile monthly active users were up to 575 million, making us one of the largest mobile audiences globally. those number include Tumblr and is measured based on a different methodology, so it now can be compared with the Q4 number from 2013. For reference, we believe this number has grown 18% year-over-year, showing strong growth on an already large user base.
In terms of Mobile products, our Mobile apps continue to win accolades. Google Play recognized Yahoo News Digest, Yahoo Mail and Tumblr on new best apps in 2014 list. And the Apple iOS store recognized 4 of our apps on their best apps in 2014 list: Yahoo News Digest; Flickr; Yahoo Finance; and Yahoo Weather. We're incredibly proud of the strong product offering we have built and as an offering that is in demand with key mobile partners.
In Q4, we launched various integrations with Sprint, Samsung and AT&T.
In late 2012, this management team changed course from a confused red-based Mobile strategy, which preceded us, to a beautiful native app-based strategy. The first of our Mobile strategy are obvious just 2 years later as we have fundamentally changed our in user growth, in industry response and most importantly, in Mobile revenue.
Building on Mobile, I'd like now to turn to the other key areas of investment. We discussed on past calls the importance of mobile, video, native and social. This is where we invest most heavily and these are the fastest-growing areas of digital advertising. For ease of reference, we refer to these with the synonym MVNS, short for mobile, video, native and social.
Here at Yahoo, the MVNS grew 95% year-over-year and 100% year-over-year in Q4. In 2014, these businesses account for more than $1.1 billion of GAAP revenue. The 4 MVNS businesses do have some overlap, which we do duplicate, since we minus both mobile and social, Tumblr for example, with native ads. However, MVNS did not contribute meaningfully to Yahoo prior to 2012. We had no native or social ads and mobile and video were. We have created more than $1 billion of new revenue annually basically from nothing in just 2 years.
In 2015, we expect the MVNS will contribute over $1.5 billion to our business. It's broken down on their own as a company, they would undoubtedly be one of the fastest-growing startups in the world.
let's take a deeper look at each of the MVNS beyond mobile, starting with video. Video is incredibly important as we look at how to reinvent our large legacy display business for the future. Video is key because it is an essential and familiar way for marketers to deliver their messages. We couldn't be more excited about our Q4 acquisition of BrightRoll as it instantly puts us in a leadership position across the video advertising ecosystem. In 2014, BrightRoll served more video ads and reached more consumers than any other platform according to ComScore. They power digital video advertising for the world's largest brands and agencies, including 87 of the Ad Age top 100 U.S. advertisers, all of the top 15 advertising agencies and all 10 of the leading demand side platforms.
BrightRoll is a fast-growing business with net revenues exceeding $100 million last year and solid growth expected this year. In our MVNS portfolio, video is the slowest-growing area. We look for the right acquisition to jumpstart our work in video ads, and we are confident that we found it rounded.
Native ads here at Yahoo refers to Yahoo Gemini, which continues to impress. In Q3, we had approximately $80 million of revenue from native ads, and we predicted that we would see a quarter of a billion dollars of revenue in 2014. Yahoo Gemini's native ads saw $106 million of revenue in Q4, up more than 32% quarter-over-quarter.
In total, over the year, Yahoo Gemini native ads saw nearly $300 million of GAAP revenue. We are seeing strong growth and demand for Gemini-powered ads on both PC and mobile, on Yahoo-owned and operated sites as well as through our newly launched outlook offering, Yahoo Recommends.
On our final of MVNS, we turn to social and Tumblr. According to November report from Global Web Index, Tumblr overtook Instagram as the fastest-growing social network over the preceding 6 months. And that growth continued in Q4. Across Tumblr, we saw our audience rise from 420 million in Q3 to 460 million in Q4, up approximately 9% quarter-over-quarter. Mobile app usage continue to be a key growth driver with mobile app users up 33% year-over-year. And we now have 75 of the Ad Age top 100 with a presence on Tumblr and 56 of the 75 spending on Tumblr.
Overall, we are confident that we have honed in on the right investment businesses and our efforts are beginning to show significant traction. More than $1.1 billion of GAAP revenue in 2014 and 95% growth year-over-year. I really want to applaud the teams here at Yahoo who have helped us invent and create this billion-dollar-plus business suite.
I'll now turn to a broader discussion of our core business in Search and Display. Let's first look at Search. Many people were struck last quarter by the difference between our growth in Mobile revenue and our GAAP Mobile revenue. This difference is driven by the fact that we account for our Search including affiliates on a net basis. This means our GAAP revenue is roughly equal to our revenue ex-TAC on Search and the TAC paid to partners hasn't really been visible to our external numbers. This dynamic exists on PC as well. So in order to give our investors more insight into our Search affiliate business and our Search business as a whole, we have decided to begin to release growth Search revenues in addition to the GAAP and ex-TAC measures.
In Q4, we had growth Search revenue ex-TAC of $932 million, which maps to GAAP revenue of $467 million [ph] and ex-TAC revenue of $462 million. Gross revenue was up 14% year-over-year. GAAP revenue was up a modest 1% and revenue ex-TAC was roughly flat.
Overall, in 2014, we saw $3,378,000,000 of growth Search revenue, which maps to $1.793 billion in GAAP revenue and $1.784 billion in ex-TAC revenue.
Gross revenue is up 14%. GAAP revenue was up 3% year-over-year and revenue ex-TAC was up 5% year-over-year.
Across Price-per-Click and Paid Clicks, we saw a nice balancing of the metrics. Paid Clicks growth 10% year-over-year versus 0% in the prior quarter. This growth in Paid Clicks was driven primarily by strong growth in the Americas, which saw a 23% year-over-year click growth.
Price-per-Click also grew. It was up 7% year-over-year. Our Search click-driven revenue was up 18% year-over-year. As you know, the Search click-driven revenue closely tracks and predicts our growth revenue growth.
Also in Q4, we struck a 5-year partnership Mozilla to make Yahoo the preferred search experience on Firefox browsers across mobile and desktop. External forces estimate that Mozilla has 3% to 5% of the North American search market, so this is a significant opportunity. We began Mozilla part way through December, so we not yet have a complete calendar month update on the deal, but we are already impressed with the volume Mozilla search has brought to our marketplace and the insightfulness and agility of the Mozilla team.
Search is in a strong growth for us and is a strong growth industry. Mobile search does monetize at a lower than PC search. Search mom the revenue per search decreases. And we also see TAC rise across the search industry. That said, we believe deeply that Search is a core great driver and we intend to keep it that way.
Finally, turning to Display. Traditional PC Display advertising is in decline across the industry. At yahoo, we have been working hard to stabilize the traditional business while adding fast growth through our new forward-looking MVNS businesses. Our GAAP Display revenue in Q4 was $532 million. On a revenue ex-TAC basis, our Display revenue was $464 million. Year-over-year, this represents a decline of 5% on an ex-TAC revenue basis and 4% on a GAAP revenue basis.
While the declines have continued, they are slowing. In Q3, we have seen 6% and 5% declines, respectively. Our ad in quarter increased approximately 17%. However, our Price-per-Ad decreased 20%. [ph] On our Q3 earnings call, we discussed significant decline in the traditional PC Display industry and the effect it has on Yahoo's business. These decline has and will continue. The decline undoubtedly would've been worse if not for the significant investment we made in programmatic advertising through Yahoo Ad Manager Plus as well as our investment to increase engagement on our properties.
Encouragingly, our MVNS businesses showed strong enough growth to nearly offset these declines. As we conjectured in the last call, we believe the growth from them MVNS businesses will exceed the declines we experienced in traditional display in 2015. Our overall display business will return to growth this year.
One key factor to returning Display to growth is to grow engagement on Yahoo Mail and our digital content across all platforms. In Q4, we worked hard to enhance and improve both. On Mail, we launched a broad appeal on a claim stationery in partnership with Paperless Post. We also launched better image handling, added our stream from our home page to Mail and a scroll to search feature. And in partnership with Sprint and our 2 prepay brands, Virgin Mobile and Boost Mobile, we run smart contacts both on technology from .
In digital content, we continue to increase the quality of our content and improve our engagement. In Q4, we grew our portfolio of digital magazines to 10 by launching Yahoo Music, Yahoo Parenting and Yahoo Makers. With top-notch content and Yahoo distribution power, our digital magazines are quickly ascending into the leading position in their categories.
In recent comScore reports, we saw both Yahoo Parenting and Yahoo Travel at #1 in their categories and Yahoo Style at #2. Across all of our  magazines, we saw our daily active user grow 39% quarter-over-quarter, and advertisers are responding to this beautiful immersive format. In Q4, we added new major advertisers, including Gucci, Mars, Toyota, Visa, Chase, Volkswagen and Citibank.
Our efforts on video technological excellence and great video content are also bearing fruits. We grew video streams across our network quarter-over-quarter by 15%. With Yahoo Live, our concert series featuring a live concert each day through our partnership with Live Nation, we saw a 65% increase quarter-over-quarter in stream, and even more excitedly, 55% [ph] of the Yahoo Live viewers were new to the network. We also launched several short form video series in conjunction with our digital magazines, including the and Yahoo Tax and beauty stores with Bobbi in Yahoo beauty. And looking to Q1 and coming to a screen near you on March 17, we announced that we will bring Season 6 of Community to Yahoo.
Finally, and also in Q4, we added serious strength to our sales team. joined us as a Senior Vice President of Americas sales. Kevin Denzel joined as our Vice President of our premium sales; and Cathy joined us as our VP of Sales, Strategy and Solutions. These 3 leaders have energized our sales force, particularly here in the Americas, with new, broader and deeper relationships with advertisers and a fresh modern look at our go-to-market strategy. I'm thrilled to have them on board and look forward to seeing their impact on the business.
In summary on the core, while our focus is Search and Display, we saw a strong growth in Search on a gross basis. However, increasing TAC rates kept us reasonably flat on a net basis. That said, our new partnership with Mozilla gives us reason to be optimistic that Search will be continue to be a growth story.
On Display, the decline has continued, though it is improving. We remain confident we were to growth on Display this year. We believe the strong growth from our MVNS businesses will offset the Display decline elsewhere that we've worked to stabilize.
And one final look at the core in really trying to understand the growth trends and headwinds, if we set aside the traditional PC Display business, which is in decline across the industry, the core business grew 10% on a GAAP basis and 7% on a revenue ex-TAC basis.
Finally, I want to spend some time talking about the widespread and ongoing remix of resources that we're pursuing here at Yahoo. We have been remixing our business and resources away from legacy businesses and toward future-oriented activities such as our MVNS product lines. We have been achieving this remix both through changes in headcount allocation as well as through acquisitions.
In terms of people at Yahoo, we closed the year with approximately 12,500 full-time employees. Our headcount has been essentially flat throughout current management tenure. At the same time, we've added more than 1,000 people from acquisitions. Tumblr had nearly 200; Flurry, 100; BrightRoll had more than 400; and several hundreds from other building block and town acquisitions. And we converted more than 1,000 contract to roll to full time. We have achieved the stability in headcount despite these additions through strong performance management, by reprioritizing resources, by sunsetting all those products and businesses and by consolidating locations.
We enclosed 12 offices, including 4 since our last earnings call: Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia and Budapest. And we had sunset more than 75 products.
We will continue to seek and execute on efficiencies that we find on an ongoing basis as an effort to better align our resources with our strategy and growth opportunities and to drive enhanced profitability in the business.
On acquisitions. We've seen a lot of speculation along what we might do. We have worked hard to become a preferred acquirer, and we think it is important as we transition the business to continue to look for great opportunities to smartly deploy capital. As you know, we approached acquisitions in 3 different categories: talent acquisitions, which essentially are group hires; building block acquisitions, where we want the technology and the people and they generally align with 1 in Search, communications or digital content; and larger strategic acquisition.
On strategic acquisitions, we are looking for businesses that can really us forward in mobile, video, native or social, and usually multiple elements thereof. Flurry is a great example of this with more than 600,000 applications with the Flurry integrated and more than 2.1 trillion app sessions seen last year. Flurry gives us unique advantages and insights in mobile, and they give us a platform for syndicating our native Gemini ads and BrightRoll ads on Mobile. Flurry really touches 3 of the 4 MVNS. Flurry is mobile, video and native.
However, the space is the contrary, we don't consider larger acquisitions, Flurry, BrightRoll or Tumblr size or larger unless they really align with mobile, video, native or social. We will continue to be very disciplined in this regard.
I will now turn it over to Ken, who will discuss our Q4 and annual financial results in more detail"

I would now start by highlighting Q4 and full year 2014 performance, following the discussion of our financial details and close with our forward-looking guidance.
Looking back in our Q4 and full year 2014 performance, I am pleased by the significant steps we have made delivering shareholder value by improving our operations, executing on transformative investments and prudently allocating our capital.
Q4 GAAP revenue was $1.253 billion and revenue ex-TAC was $1.179 billion, at or above the high end of the guidance range. Adjusted EBITDA also exceeded our expectations at $49 million [ph] in the quarter as we continue to actively manage our cost base. And for the full year 2014, GAAP revenue and revenue ex-TAC were $4.681 billion and $4.4 billion, respectively. We saw a modest 1% year-over-year decline in both metrics as revenue from our transformative investments of mobile, social, video and native, MVNS, became more meaningful to offset the larger headwinds from our legacy PC businesses.
In Q4 and full-year 2014, these 4 businesses together delivered strong revenue growth of 100% and 95% on a year-over-year basis. GAAP Mobile revenue surpassed $250 million in Q4, representing 23% quarter-over-quarter growth, while full year GAAP Mobile revenue was well above the $700 million figure we highlighted on our last earnings call.
In our native ads business also shows significant progress with GAAP revenue over $100 million in Q4.
When you talk about capital return. We continued a strong commitment to capital return in Q4 as we repurchased 22 million shares in the open market for $980 million an average price of $45.26. And also in the quarter, we entered into a second accelerated share repurchase agreement, under which we acquired 16 million shares for $800 million. This brings our total share repurchases for the full year to $4.2 billion with 102 million shares repurchased at an average price of $40.94.
In terms of our commitment to return at least half of the $6.1 billion of after-tax Alibaba to our shareholders, we have bought back nearly 3 billion of our stocks in just 4 months, consisting of $2.8 million from the closing of Alibaba's IPO through the end of 2014 and approximately $120 million quarter-to-date.
Since the beginning of Q2 2012, our significant buyback activity has seen us repurchased 354 million shares, totaling 9.7 billion to date, representing approximately 29% gross reduction in our initial share base at an overall average price of $27.44. This has been extremely accretive for our shareholders. And our diluted share count was 963 million for Q4. At the end of the quarter it was approximately 932 million [ph], down 8% from a year ago and down 22% from the beginning of Q2 2012 on a net basis.
In Q4, we created additional capital by continuing to monetize our IP assets through patent sales, resulting in $35 million of cost benefits. This brings a total cash value from ongoing IP monetization efforts to approximately $575 million since 2012. We also realized $56 million in cash value from our Japanese yen hedges in Q4, resulting also in total realized value of $538 million from hedging of balance sheet investment in Yahoo Japan.
We would like to congratulate on a successful IPO as we hold equity of the company our balance sheet, which is valued approximately $200 million.
Moving forward, we will continue to be good stewards as we evaluate the best ways to allocate capital and drive shareholder value.
Now let's go to our fourth quarter and full-year 2014 [ph] results in greater detail. And later, I will close with our forward-looking guidance. As a reminder, I will focus most discussion around non-GAAP results, which includes stock-based compensation expense of $103 million and $420 million and restructuring charges of $33 million and $103 million for Q4 and full year 2014, respectively.
Non-GAAP results also exclude a gain on equity of $98 million and goodwill impairment charges of $88 million for both Q4 and the full year and the related tax impact from all of these items. You can find complete reconciliation between the GAAP and non-GAAP results in our earnings slides on our Investor Relations website.
Now starting with the financial highlights for the Q4 seen on Slide 5. As I mentioned earlier, Q4 GAAP revenue is $1.253 billion and revenue ex-TAC was $1.179 billion. Search revenue at TAC was flat year-over-year, while Display revenue ex-TAC was down 5%. The adjusted EBITDA was $409 million [ph] in the quarter. Non-GAAP operating income was $256 million, well above our guidance range, and earnings and equity interest was $102 million, down versus prior year as we no longer account for Alibaba investment under the equity method.
Non-GAAP EPS was $0.30, and our Q4 average fully diluted share count decreased 7% versus the prior year to 963 million [ph] shares. Free cash flow was $78 million for the quarter. Decline was primarily caused by temporary shifts in working capital relative to the prior year, including prepaid and expenses and also the impact of the BrightRoll acquisition.
Our cash and marketable securities balance was $10.2 billion, which was down from the prior quarter as a result of a significant buyback activity in Q4. And lastly, our headcount ended the quarter at approximately 12,500, with no significant increase from Q3 despite adding the headcount from the BrightRoll acquisition.
We will aggressively manage our headcount and operating expenses with the goals of increasing profitability and EBITDA over time.
Now moving to the full year review, as seen an Slide 6. 2014 revenue ex-TAC was $4.4 billion, slightly down from 2013. Search revenue ex-TAC grew 5% year-over-year, while Display revenue ex-TAC declined 4% year-over-year. The adjusted EBITDA was $1.36 billion, decline of 13% versus prior year as we made investments in our sales and product organizations to support our growth initiatives in the MVNS area.
As we had stated previously, cost structure is important to us and then as we see it continues attention throughout the year. I am particularly pleased with our ongoing efforts to unlock value in our IP assets with patent sales and licensing programs in 2014 that resulted in $98 million of total cost benefits and the Q2 transaction for patent licenses resulting in $400 million [ph] fee revenue, which is being recognized over a 5-year period. Actually, nearly $500 million in total value. We recognized $103 million of restructuring expenses for the year related to office consolidations and cost initiatives to improve our operating efficiency and reduce expenses.
In Q4, we announced several initiatives in our Mail and Asia Pac regions to minor operations and improve our function elaboration. Non-GAAP operating income was $755 million [ph], down 19% from the prior year. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.57, a 3% improvement over 2013. And finally, free cash flow was $590 million for the year, which was down due to the decline in EBITDA and increase in capital expenses and working capital just as we noted.
Now let me walk through the financial results for Q4. Beginning with Search, GAAP revenue grew 1% while revenue ex-TAC was flat year-over-year.  revenue grew 18% year-over-year, representative of our gross revenue growth. We saw a large percentage of our TAC traffic coming from channels that incurred higher TAC, including mobile and other distribution partners. Switching from quick-driven revenue growth to revenue ex-TAC year-over-year, approximately 13% of the delta was due to the increase in TAC and 5% due to other factors.
Global Paid Clicks returned to double-digit growth, up 10%. This was mostly driven by the Americas region where we saw accelerated growth in holiday season to monetization initiatives, including product ads which ramped significantly in Yahoo properties. Global PPC was up 7%. We continue to see favorable traffic mix come from higher monetizing segments.
Some of the was caused by lower PPC in the Americas as our Q4 monetization efforts toward clicks.
Regarding the Mozilla deal, we are very pleased with the significant impact it has had to our Search volume share. The Americas region saw a search click-driven revenue increased 20% year-over-year, driven by clicks growing 23%, offset by a PPC decline modestly of 2%. Much of this growth came from the higher TAC distribution partners.
Moving to -- now moving to Display. GAAP Display revenue declined 4% and revenue ex-TAC declined 5% year-over-year in the quarter. The GAAP revenue trend showed improvement as we gained revenue momentum from our transformative investments. Our programmatic audience buying platforms is now globally available, while our native ads continues to strong growth in the quarter.
Ads sold showed healthy growth in Q4 at 17% as we continue to increase our native and mobile inventory year-over-year. The PPA declined at 20% offset the volume increase in Q4. The year-over-year decline is mainly the result of the mixed shift away from high price premium inventory.
Native ads continue to grow and accounted for 43% of ads sold in the quarter. Our native ads PPA grew over 20% from Q3 to Q4, driven by improved optimizations of our format and placements.
We closed the acquisition of BrightRoll in the late Q4 and expect positive contributions to our video and display growth in 2015.
The Flurry team continues to execute a mobile advertising, and we look forward to showing additional plans at our mobile developer conference next month.
For revenue detail by region, please refer to Slide 10. Americas revenue ex-TAC was flat year-over-year. APAC revenue ex-TAC was down 7%, [ph] up 4% on a constant currency basis. And EMEA revenue ex-TAC declined 7%, [ph] 5% on a constant currency basis.
Now moving to expenses. Traffic acquisition costs were up 12% compared to the prior-year. The main drivers for this increased TAC were: TAC payments for acquired properties and the continued rollout of our Gemini search platform. Non-GAAP total operating expenses were $923 million for the quarter, which was up 6% versus the prior year. Depreciation and amortization has remained consistent with the past several quarters at approximately $150 million per quarter.
Our cash operating expense was $770 million, an improvement of $30 million versus our and $19 million [ph] less in the prior quarter. However, excluding the impact of patent sales from both years, our cash operating expense is up a modest 2% year-over-year.
Workforce continues to drive expenses as we invest in our technical workforce. We have worked hard to find ways to offset our investments with prudent cost initiatives in there areas. For example, in Q4, we realized significant savings in data center efficiencies and continue reduction in contractors and other outside sales providers, totaling approximately $40 million.
For GAAP total operating expenses in Q4, stock-based compensation was $103 million, $3 million lower versus prior quarter, and restructuring costs were $33 million, and we had a goodwill impairment charge of $88 million. EBITDA, as I noted, was $409 million [ph] in Q4 with a margin of 35% based upon ---based on revenue ex-TAC. And non-GAAP operating income was $256 million for the quarter, resulting in a margin of 22% on a revenue ex-TAC basis.
Quickly running out the income statement. We had a gain of $98 million resulting from our investment in. Earnings and interest was $102 million. As a reminder reduction was Alibaba earnings and equity interest for our new IPO and is more indicative of the forward look.
Turning to the balance sheet. At the end of the Q4 and the year, we had $10.2 billion in cash and marketable securities. And as I stated previously, cash tax related to the Alibaba IPO proceeds are expected to be approximately $3.3 billion what we paid in Q1. Adjusting for this tax payment and converting our debt of $1.3 billion, our net cash balance at the end of the year was approximately $5.7 billion.
The change in cash balance from Q3 to Q4 was primarily driven by free cash flow of $78 million, adversely impacted by working capital movement in the accounting for BrightRoll; acquisitions of $545 million primarily for BrightRoll; and cash utilized for share repurchases activity for the quarter of $1.6 billion.
Now let me cover guidance. As we move to the first quarter of the year and going forward, we are committed to sustainably growing our business. I am pleased with the plans we have in place to drive shareholder value both through our Alibaba investment as well as through our MVNS businesses. We also recognize we have much work ahead to sustainably grow both revenues and profit going forward. Our guidance assumes that we continue to make steady process on our core business into Q1 and over 2015. We will increase our focus on GAAP revenue, expect this to lead to lead to growth in revenue ex-TAC as we decide more partnerships and BrightRoll and Gemini search.
In the short term, our guidance accounts for: in the Americas, we brought our new sales leadership and realigned our efforts to some near-term additionally, the in the 2014 makes for a tougher comp in Q1; and in May, we announced the researcher of our organization, we did see nearly 1/3 of I had found which will be to long-term efficiencies but does post interim challenges. And we expect to be tracking to comparable revenues levels in Asia Pacific, with the exception of foreign exchanges.
Q4 non-GAAP cash expenses were approximately $800 million on a normalized basis. We expect Q1 to be comparable but with the addition of BrightRoll, resulting in a somewhat -- a number somewhat higher.
Looking ahead, we would like to get back to the quarterly range of $800 million or less, inclusive of our recent acquisitions. Specifically, for Q1 guidance, we expect the following: GAAP revenue range of $1.11 billion to $1.15 billion; revenue ex-TAC in the range of $1.02 billion to $1.06 billion; EBITDA in the range of $200 million to $240 million; and non-GAAP operating income in the range of $50 million [ph] to $90 million.
We have taken significant steps to deliver shareholder value. We have made progress in our transformative investments to set up a strong platform for growth while continuing to demonstrate our disciplined stewardship of capital. I will now turn it back to Marissa."

If I had to take a look at what we need to accomplish in 2015, one, we need better targeting. The more personalized these ads are, the price on CPC basis, the more clicks we get on those ads, the better they perform for both our advertisers and for us in terms of revenue. We also need to explore additional formats. When we started off with Gemini, we were doing text-only ads. we since have been adding various image ads, now some product ads as well as some video ads. I think these new formats are something that has really helped us take the Gemini ads and that something truly native as you move across products and platforms. And finally, I also think it's important for us to get distribution since that we don't run Gemini ads on native ads only on Yahoo and Tumblr, but we also can run them across other sites. And Flurry is a great distribution channel for us here. We're really looking forward to integrating Gemini into the Flurry SDK. So when a new app developer brings a targeted new app, first question they asked is analytics, the next question that they ask is really, how can I make money from my application? And so if we actually have that ad network easily and readily available in the APIs and Flurry SDK, and this is a easy way for us to more Gemini ads as well as our BrightRoll video ads. And native and video ads are really the way to monetize mobile, particularly apps. And more broadly on the Search reorganization point, we're really excited to have Lisa and Cathy and Kevin onboard. I don't think that the reorganization that we have to play with the new hires really changes things regarding me native and other than native ads are trends that are here to stay. They're not a big part of our product portfolio. And there's been some adjustment in our sales force has really gotten familiar with the product and understood which advertisers to bring that product to, how to optimize them and ultimately, provide better -- better performance on the campaign. But it's going to need a lot of progress there. And so overall, I think that the reorg, for my viewpoint is I would say somewhat perpendicular to our progress on native ads. Obviously I think our team has already done a great job positioning."

Generally, these heads of advertisers who buy a mobile, native or social ad, the type of ad production they need to do have an audience are looking for the way they want to interact with those users is pretty fundamentally different than banner ads. What we have seen -- but there has been applying pressure on the cannibalistic to the original PC business is the move towards programmatic. And so when an advertisement, for example, moves from being premium channel to a programmatic channel, that certainly causes some cannibalization overall of revenue. And we have seen, particularly on Search, not as much on Display, that when we move a user from a PC search to a mobile search, they do -- that search monetizes at a slightly lower rate. We've been making improvements there, but we still aren't to a point on Search where mobile search has the same revenue per search in and, say PC search. We're getting closer to that on Display, but I think overall in terms of the cannibalistic of the MVNS, certainly on the Display side, it's much more of a programmatic versus premium."

I've given examples on past calls, for example, of flight itineraries. It's really great to see those kind of features on the search results page. And that's something that Yahoo can do exclusively because of our large base of Yahoo Mail users. And I would also look I'm thinking about what mobile search should be in the future. because while we've done a lot to optimize PC search the place that we're really investing the most in mobile search. And there, today we have a really traditional HTML-based approach. But we really been trying to think about how do we do the best possible job answering queries on the phone. And when you  look at, for example, acquisitions like , which is growing nicely, we have that offered as an application. We really think that mobile search will be take into much more account your contacts, your location, your particular information.

So we're very active in our discussions. We've very thoughtful in the that we selected to meet the requirements there. And so it's our assumption that, at the end of this, we will have a private ruling that allows us to go forward. So we are very cognizant of the actions we have to take. We are in the process of taking many of those. And again, the goal here is to be able to complete this in Q4 of this year."

We think that the sequential growth in users that we saw on Tumblr is really because we have much better composition tools. If you look back at Tumblr's growth graph, what you tend to see is every time there's been an improvement in terms of how well you can post or how well you can present your blog, we saw a real burst of this in mobile. Last year, at Tumblr we did our mobile app to make composing on the phone much easier and much more beautiful so that you could actually be mobile only. Previously, it was really -- it tells you what you set up your blog on PC and then work on it on mobile. so that we know whenever we make changes on composition tool there, it not only causes users to use the platform more if they're already on it, but also attracts new users to it. in terms of mobile usage, we haven't -- I don't have -- and we haven't broken out in the past mobile-only users, but I can say what we have today is more than half of the users on Tumblr use mobile to engage and participate on Tumblr. And we have internal goals this year really around trying to grow that number significantly such that most users, the vast majority of users on Tumblr is engaged at some points using mobile. And on the native ads and what it will take to ultimately improve the targeted thing and therefore, stop the price erosion. What we've been really doing is more information sources. The more we understand about to the better job, we can do targeting ads towards you. And so over the past year, for example, if you look at our stream on the home page, we use the same targeting technology for those articles as we do for the ads. And over the past year, we've got a lot of new information sources. So for example, the sports theme the business I follow on now Yahoo Finance, pulling that data over. We're also looking for signed-in users can be accessed with their permission some of the information coming from Yahoo! Mail. These are all things that we are working on as well as retargeting off of other sites. And so these are all areas of investment and each of them has brought with it a gain in native Price-per-Ad. And I should note that we're starting to see this turnaround. Native pricing -- the native price per ad actually grew 20% quarter-over-quarter from Q3 to Q4. Jam and I really overperformed our expectations in Q4 and that's what really -- we were saying at the end of Q3 that we had about a quarter of a billion dollar business, plus or minus 10%, and we actually closed the year about $300 million [ph] of revenue. And that's a nice surprise really was driven in part because of the improvement in Price-per-Ad in Gemini, which is driven by these targeting improvements."

I would say the first really is on Yahoo O&O, it's about growing our engagement, getting more apps installed. this is something that we worked on really intensively. We have a great growth team here at Yahoo and our Mobile group, and they really studied how can we help get more users downloading our apps and using them every day in the first place and how can we take users who already have those apps and use things like push notifications to ultimately get them reengaged. And so we've been working very hard on our engagement, and that certainly goes for mobile, native and social. the more engaging the platforms on O&O basis, the better off we'll be. In terms of off-network mobile, native and social advertisements, it's really around distribution. And that's one of the reasons we were so excited about the Flurry acquisition. Flurry brings with it access to 1.6 billion smart devices. today as we see more smart devices than any other company on the planet from what we can tell. And the opportunity there to work with a mobile app developer integrate Flurry. And for those who want to monetize their applications, making native and video ads on native Gemini ads as well as our BrightRoll video ads available to that huge number of mobile applications and their reach is something that's really exciting and as I said, it's something that's going to really accelerate our revenue in mobile, native and social. And so that's really where the focus is, how can we get better off-network distribution through Flurry and also how can we improve our engagement on applications that will naturally drive up native and social on the core Yahoo platform. And on Tumblr, we are referring to the 50% [ph] of the people who use our dashboard view who basically blog posts are actually now doing so through the application. And so the audience numbers, the 460 million [ph] actually include blog readers as opposed to blog posters. And so there -- a good look at it basically maps the -- overall trend of how much traffic is on PC versus mobile as a whole because in essence, as a blog reader, you're simply reading a web page and reading that content we're will glad to be that, that Tumblr page on our network. But when we think about mobile users, it's really about the very engaged bloggers that are on Tumblr. And more than half of those are using the app to do their blog post and to read the dashboard."

So we're really happy with our position overall in terms of how well our applications are performing, how well these new ad formats are performing. I think when I look out across the acquisitions base or even what we might allocate people to internally, our goal is we want to make sure that we have at least 1 app for each user and for each user, it might be different, where to go-to app. You've heard us talk about in our past calls that we're really working to grow our daily active users in comparison to monthly active users. We want to have fewer with call marketing segmentation exercise, fewer tourists and more fanatics who are using the product all the time. And so when we look across the space of what we might invest in, we look not only at our core competencies in the past, of course, digital content and what we might do in that space to really become part of the users every day. But we also wanted to think about what is something that you might build or require a new? So it could be something ultimately in the messaging space. Obviously we've had Yahoo Messenger for a number of years. What does that look like in the mobile space? We made some nice small acquisitions in Q4 of Message Me and Cool , both of which have very good technology and just great user interfaces in the messaging space. And so we'd like to see how we might buildout our communications offering there. And that's really what I would say the goal is, how do we get more DAU and improve our DAU to MAU ratio. And the obvious reason to build on our core competencies but in particular, to build on communication which of course has a native aspect, a social aspect and a mobile aspect in all parts of today and builds on our strength of email and some of our client base messaging on the PC."

Before I go into our quarterly and annual financials, I'd like to dedicate the first portion of the call to the announcement we sent out earlier today regarding our Al",778,"Thank you for joining us on our live earnings webcast covering our Q4 and 2014 results. Before I go into our quarterly and annual financials, I'd like to dedicate the first portion of the call to the announcement we sent out earlier today regarding our Alibaba holdings.
As our shareholders are aware, Yahoo holds a total of 384 million shares of Alibaba, which comprises 15.4% of Alibaba and is worth nearly $40 billion using Monday's closing Alibaba share price. Following the Alibaba IPO, these shares are subject to a 1-year lockup agreement that runs until September 21, 2015. If sold or transferred through ordinary means, the proceeds will be taxable at approximately 40%. Given the low basis, this will give rise to a tax liability of approximately $16 billion or roughly $16 per share of Yahoo.
For over 2 years, we have worked with leading tax, accounting, legal and financial advisers to identify and design an optimal transaction that could maximize the value of our Alibaba stake in a tax-efficient manner. Today, I'm happy and proud to announce that management has recommended and the Yahoo board has authorized a plan to pursue a tax-free spin-off of 100% of the company's remaining holdings in Alibaba. We expect to effectuate the spin-off in Q4 of 2015. This will result in 2 independent publicly traded companies.
The spin-off company, which we will refer to as SpinCo, will be a newly formed independently registered investment company that will hold 384 million shares of Alibaba and a legacy, ancillary business that we will separate from Yahoo's core. The transaction will be subject to closing conditions, including regulatory review, as appropriate for a deal of this type. After an exhaustive review, we are pursuing this transaction as we believe it maximizes value for our shareholders and authorizes transaction efficiency and certainty. This is a structure that we can pursue and affect independently, capturing value exclusively for our shareholders. And we made the conscious decision to distribute 100% of our Alibaba shares because we felt maximum tax efficiency was important in our roles as stewards of capital.
During this team's tenure, Yahoo has returned approximately $9.3 billion in capital to shareholders through share repurchases. Assuming Monday's value of Alibaba post-spin, we will have returned nearly $50 billion in value to our shareholders. This level of return is historic.
Moreover, considering the tax-free spin-off announced today, plus the already completed share repurchases, we are on track to return approximately 97% of our proceeds from Alibaba.
It's also worth noting how reducing the number of shares sold in the Alibaba IPO yielded additional value for Yahoo shareholders. As you know, this management team worked very hard to reduce the number of shares that we are contractually required to sell in the IPO. We noted on our last call that renegotiating the preexisting agreement, we have realized appreciation of over $4 billion. With today's plan for a tax-free transaction, we stand to realize $3.31 billion of additional tax savings. In total, the improved relationship between the companies and that negotiation we worked so hard for is worth more than $7.7 billion today and nearly $8 per share of Yahoo.
I'm proud that our management team has, through good stewardship and focus, found a possible path to delivering this type of value to our shareholders. I'd like to pause here and offer some gratitude to those who helped along the way. I would like to thank the Yahoo team, along with our advisers, for helping us deliver this excellent plan. I'd like to thank our board for their approval of this plan as well as the significant time and energy that they dedicated to this issue. And finally and most importantly, I would like to thank you, our shareholders, for your patience and suggestions as we carefully analyzed the best path forward for Yahoo. I'd like to thank you for investing in us and believing in us. It makes us both really happy to be able to deliver this plan today.
Given its immense value, we made finance solution for our Alibaba holdings a priority in the transaction announced today. While our holdings in Yahoo Japan, by comparison, are a small fraction of our Alibaba holdings, we will continue to explore ways to maximize the value of Yahoo Japan, continuing in our commitment to be good stewards of capital. In our core operating business, we feel we have built a strong foundation and we are in an excellent position to execute and return the company to growth.
I'm now going to turn it over to Ken to discuss the tax-free spin-off structure and the execution plan in more depth."

Let me provide further details and announcement as summary transaction highlights can be found in our slide presentation available in our Investor Relations website.
As shown in Slides 3 and 4, 1 company will be the currently existing Yahoo entity, which will include the Yahoo operating business, net cash and a 35.5% equity ownership stake in our Yahoo Japan joint venture. As Marissa mentioned, the second company will be the newly formed entity, which will be a registered investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940. It will include a remaining 15.4% ownership of Alibaba shares. SpinCo will also include a legacy, ancillary business as the active trade of business with approximately $50 million in adjusted EBITDA that we have identified to be part of the transaction. The stock in the new company will be distributed pro rata to Yahoo shareholders. It will be led by independent, newly appointed management team and Board of Directors. The composition of SpinCo's Board of Directors and management team and other details and transaction, including the distribution ratio, will be announced prior to the close of the transaction.
SpinCo will assume no debt as part of the transaction. We believe this to be a unique spin-off transaction. We are not aware of any present -- of an operating company spinning off a registered investment company. And as seen on Slide 5, we believe the structure is the most attractive alternative for Yahoo and our shareholders.
The transaction is designed to maximize value of our -- of Alibaba holdings exclusively to our shareholders as the distribution will be tax-free. The ability to execute the transaction independently optimizes timing and execution efficiency.
Lastly, we believe the structure will improve valuation transparency for both SpinCo and Yahoo. The transaction is subject to regulatory and certain other conditions, and we expect it to close in Q4 2015 as seen on Slide 6.
Key closing conditions do include receipt of iOS and requisite tax opinions, confirming tax-free status of the spin, filing and effectiveness of an applicable registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission, in compliance with the requirements under the Investment Company Act of 1940. We are in the process of filing for a ruling from the IRS and are in ongoing communications with the SEC. Today's announcement culminates a comprehensive review of alternatives conducted by the board and the management team working with our top advisers, and we believe this is the optimal structure with a clean transaction for the company and our shareholders.
With regard to our equity ownership in Yahoo Japan, YJ is a joint venture with Softbank. We remain open-minded about alternatives for value creation, and our equity ownership in Yahoo Japan is not part of this transaction. Today, we are primarily focused on maximizing the value of our Alibaba shares, which are, by far, our largest nonoperating asset in a tax-efficient manner to drive significant shareholder value. The Yahoo Japan ownership stake is currently valued at approximately $7 billion compared to the much greater value of the Alibaba stake at approximately $40 billion. And that's a very much smaller value creation opportunity.
Given our operating relationship, we also need to carefully consider other factors relative to our Yahoo Japan equity ownership such as our brand license and technology license agreements. In conjunction with our advisers, the management team is continuing a thorough evaluation of financial competitive and strategic implications for this entity.
Now let me turn it back to Marissa as we discuss our Q4 and full year 2014 performance. Marissa?"

We'd like to thank both Jerry as well as the team at Alibaba [indiscernible] by Jack and Jill [ph]. Thank you.
This level of return has also been possible because the core of Yahoo's business is returning to health and stability and, we believe, growth. We've seen over the past 2.5 years that our own free cash flow is healthy enough to allow for the necessary investment in the core business through organic means.
Taking look at our Q4 and 2014 results. I'm pleased to report that our performance continues to show stability in the core business. In Q4, our GAAP revenue was $1,253,000,000. In 2014, our GAAP revenue was $4,680,000,000. Both are roughly flat year-over-year, down approximately 1%.
On a revenue ex-TAC basis, our revenue in Q4 was $1,179,000,000, down approximately 2% year-over-year, largely due to TAC acceleration in our Search business. In 2014, our revenue ex-TAC was $4,401,000,000, down less than 1%.
I'm now going to turn to look at our progress in detail on Mobile; on our investment businesses, mobile, video, native and social; on Search; and on Display. I'll then offer a broader look at the company's progress, our strides for efficiency and excellence and our acquisition strategy.
For the first time last quarter, we reported on our Mobile revenue. In Q3, we saw approximately $200 million on a GAAP basis and predicted more than $1.2 billion on a gross basis and more than $700 million on a GAAP basis for the year. I'm proud to say that we achieved these estimates. In Q4, our Mobile revenue was $254 million, up from $207 million in Q3, a growth of 23% quarter-over-quarter.
Our gross Mobile revenue for the year was $1,260,000,000, and our Mobile GAAP revenue was $768 million, exceeding our estimates by 5% and 10%, respectively. We had a very good year in Mobile, and we grew at an accelerating rate and one that appears to be faster than the industry.
In Q4, our Mobile monthly active users were up to 575 million, making us one of the largest mobile audiences globally. Note this number includes Tumblr and is measured based on a different methodology, so it can now be compared with the Q4 number from 2013. For reference, we believe this number has grown 18% year-over-year, showing strong growth on an already large user base.
In terms of Mobile products, our Mobile apps continue to win accolades. Google Play recognized Yahoo News Digest, Yahoo Mail and Tumblr on their Best Apps of 2014 list. And the Apple iOS store recognized 4 of our apps on their Best Apps of 2014 list: Yahoo News Digest, Flickr, Yahoo Finance and Yahoo Weather. We are incredibly proud of the strong product offering we have built, and it's an offering that is in demand with key mobile partners. In Q4, we launched various integrations with Sprint, Samsung and AT&T.
In late 2012, this management team changed course from a confused web-based mobile strategy, which preceded us, to a beautiful native app-based strategy. The fruits from our mobile strategy are obvious just 2 years later as we have fundamentally changed our trajectory in user growth, in industry response and, most importantly, in Mobile revenue.
Building on Mobile, I'd like now to turn to the other key areas of investment. We've discussed on past calls the importance of mobile, video, native and social. This is where we invest most heavily, and these are the fastest-growing areas of digital advertising. For ease of reference, we refer to these with the synonym MVNS, short for mobile, video, native and social.
Here at Yahoo, the MVNS grew 95% year-over-year and 100% year-over-year in Q4. In 2014, these businesses accounted for more than $1.1 billion of GAAP revenue. The 4 MVNS businesses do have some overlap, which we deduplicate, since we monetize both mobile and social, Tumblr, for example, with native ads. However, please recall that the MVNS did not contribute meaningfully to Yahoo prior to 2012. We had no native or social ads, and mobile and video were nascent. We have created more than $1 billion of new revenue annually basically from nothing in just 2 years. In 2015, we expect the MVNS will contribute over $1.5 billion to our business. If broken out on their own, as a company, they would undoubtedly be one of the fastest-growing startups in the world.
Let's take a deeper look at each of the MVNS beyond mobile, starting with video. Video is incredibly important as we look at how to reinvent our large legacy display business for the future. Video is key because it is an essential and familiar way for marketers to deliver their messages. We couldn't be more excited about our Q4 acquisition of BrightRoll as it instantly puts us in a leadership position across the video advertising ecosystem. 
In 2014, BrightRoll served more video ads and reached more consumers than any other platform according to comScore. They power digital video advertising for the world's largest brands and agencies, including 87 of the Ad Age Top 100 U.S. advertisers, all of the top 15 advertising agencies and all 10 of the leading demand-side platforms.
BrightRoll is a fast-growing business with net revenues exceeding $100 million last year and solid growth expected this year. In our MVNS portfolio, video is the slowest-growing area. We look for the right acquisition to jump-start our work in video ads, and we are confident that we found it.
Native ads here at Yahoo refers to Yahoo Gemini, which continues to impress. In Q3, we had approximately $80 million of revenue from native ads, and we predicted that we would see $0.25 billion of revenue in 2014. Yahoo Gemini's native ads saw $106 million of revenue in Q4, up more than 32% quarter-over-quarter.
In total, over the year, Yahoo Gemini native ads saw nearly $300 million of GAAP revenue. We are seeing strong growth and demand for Gemini-powered ads on both PC and mobile, on Yahoo-owned and operated sites as well as through our newly launched publisher offering, Yahoo Recommends.
On our final of the MVNS, we turn to social and Tumblr. According to November report from GlobalWebIndex, Tumblr overtook Instagram as the fastest-growing social network over the preceding 6 months, and that growth continued in Q4. Across Tumblr, we saw our audience rise from 420 million in Q3 to 460 million in Q4, up approximately 9% quarter-over-quarter. Mobile app usage continues to be a key growth driver, with mobile app users up 33% year-over-year. And we now have 75 of the Ad Age Top 100 with a presence on Tumblr and 56 of the 75 spending on Tumblr.
Overall, we are confident that we have honed in on the right investment businesses, and our efforts are beginning to show significant traction, more than $1.1 billion of GAAP revenue in 2014 and 95% growth year-over-year. I really want to applaud the teams here at Yahoo who have helped us invent and create this billion-dollar-plus business suite.
I'll now turn to a broader discussion of our core business in Search and Display. Let's first look at Search. Many people were struck last quarter by the difference between our gross Mobile revenue and our GAAP Mobile revenue. This difference is driven by the fact that we account for our Search, including affiliates, on a net basis. This means our GAAP revenue is roughly equal to our revenue ex-TAC on Search, and the TAC paid to partners hasn't really been visible in our external numbers. This dynamic exists on PC as well. So in order to give our investors more insight into our Search affiliate business and our Search business as a whole, we have decided to begin to release growth Search revenues in addition to the GAAP and ex-TAC measures.
In Q4, we had gross Search revenue ex-TAC of $932 million, which maps to GAAP revenue of $467 million and ex-TAC revenue of $462 million. Gross revenue was up 14% year-over-year, GAAP revenue was up a modest 1% and revenue ex-TAC was roughly flat. 
Overall, in 2014, we saw $3,378,000,000 of gross Search revenue, which maps to $1.793 billion in GAAP revenue and $1.784 billion in ex-TAC revenue. Gross revenue was up 14%, GAAP revenue was up 3% year-over-year and revenue ex-TAC was up 5% year-over-year.
Across Price-per-Click and Paid Clicks, we saw a nice balancing of the metrics. Paid Clicks rose 10% year-over-year versus 0% in the prior quarter. This growth in Paid Clicks was driven primarily by strong growth in the Americas, which saw a 23% year-over-year click growth.
Price-per-Click also grew. It was up 7% year-over-year. Our Search click-driven revenue was up 18% year-over-year. As a note, the Search click-driven revenue closely tracks and predicts our gross revenue growth.
Also in Q4, we struck a 5-year partnership with Mozilla to make Yahoo the preferred search experience on Firefox browsers across mobile and desktop. External sources estimate that Mozilla has 3% to 5% of the North American search market, so this is a significant opportunity. We began serving Mozilla partway through December, so we not yet have a complete calendar month update on the deal. But we are already impressed with the volume Mozilla search has brought to our marketplace and the insightfulness and agility of the Mozilla team.
Search has been a strong growth story for us and is a strong growth industry. Mobile search does monetize at a lower rate than PC search. So as consumers switch to mobile devices, the revenue per search decreases. And we are also seeing TAC rise across the search industry. That said, we believe deeply in Search as a core growth driver, and we intend to keep it that way.
Finally, turning to Display. Traditional PC Display advertising is in decline across the industry. At Yahoo, we have been working hard to stabilize the traditional business while adding fast growth through our new forward-looking MVNS businesses. Our GAAP Display revenue in Q4 was $532 million. On a revenue ex-TAC basis, our Display revenue was $464 million. Year-over-year, this represents a decline of 5% on an ex-TAC revenue basis and 4% on a GAAP revenue basis.
While the declines have continued, they are slowing. In Q3, we had seen 6% and 5% declines, respectively. Our ads solds in quarter increased approximately 17%. However, our Price-per-Ad decreased approximately 20%. On our Q3 earnings call, we discussed significant decline in the traditional PC Display industry and the effect it has on Yahoo's business. While this decline has and will continue, the decline undoubtedly would have been worse if not for the significant investment we made in programmatic advertising through Yahoo Ad Manager Plus as well as our investments to increase engagement on our properties.
Encouragingly, our MVNS businesses showed strong enough growth to nearly offset these declines. As we conjectured on the last call, we believe the growth from the MVNS businesses will exceed the declines we experienced in traditional display in 2015, and our overall display business will return to growth this year.
One key factor to returning Display to growth is to grow engagement on Yahoo Mail and our digital content across all platforms. In Q4, we worked hard to enhance and improve both. On Mail, we launched a broad appeal and a claim, stationery, in partnership with Paperless Post. We also launched better image handling, added our stream from our home page to Mail and a scroll-to-search [ph] feature. And in partnership with Sprint and their 2 prepay brands, Virgin Mobile and Boost Mobile, we launched Smartr Contacts built on acquired technology from Xobni. 
In digital content, we continue to increase the quality of our content and improve our engagement. In Q4, we grew our portfolio of digital magazines to 10 by launching Yahoo Music, Yahoo Parenting and Yahoo Makers. With top-notch content and Yahoo's distribution power, our digital magazines are quickly ascending into the leading position in their categories.
In recent comScore reports, we saw both Yahoo Parenting and Yahoo Travel at #1 in their categories and Yahoo Style at #2. Across all of our digital magazines, we saw our daily active users grow 39% quarter-over-quarter, and advertisers are responding to this beautiful, immersive format. In Q4, we added new major advertisers, including Gucci, Meta Forte [ph], Mars [ph], Toyota, Visa, Chase, Volkswagen and Citibank.
Our efforts around video technological excellence and great video content are also bearing fruits. We grew video streams across our network quarter-over-quarter by 15%. With Yahoo Live, our concert series featuring a live concert each day through our partnership with Live Nation, we saw a 65% increase quarter-over-quarter in streams, and even more excitingly, 55% of the Yahoo Live viewers were new to the network. We also launched several short-form video series in conjunction with our digital magazines, including Pogue's Basics in Yahoo Tech and beauty stories with Bobbi in Yahoo Beauty. And looking to Q1 and coming to a screen near you on March 17, we announced that we will bring Season 6 of Community to Yahoo.
Finally, and also in Q4, we added serious strength to our sales team. Lisa Utzschneider joined us as a Senior Vice President of Americas Sales. Kevin Gentzel joined us as our Vice President of Premium Sales. And Katie Seitz joined us as our VP of Sales, Strategy and Solutions. These 3 leaders have energized our sales force, particularly here in the Americas, with new, broader and deeper relationships with advertisers and a fresh modern look at our go-to-market strategy. I'm thrilled to have them on board and look forward to seeing their impact on the business.
In summary, on the core, where our focus is Search and Display, we saw a strong growth in Search on a gross basis. However, increasing TAC rates kept us reasonably flat on a net basis. That said, our new partnership with Mozilla gives us reason to be optimistic that Search will continue to be a growth story.
On Display, the decline has continued, though it is improving. We remain confident we will get to growth on Display this year. We believe the strong growth from our MVNS businesses will offset the Display declines elsewhere that we've worked to stabilize.
In one final look at the core and really trying to understand the growth trends and headwinds, if we set aside the traditional PC Display business, which is in decline across the industry, the core business grew 10% on a GAAP basis and 7% on a revenue ex-TAC basis.
Finally, I want to spend some time talking about the widespread and ongoing remix of resources that we're pursuing here at Yahoo. We have been remixing our business and resources away from legacy businesses and toward future-oriented activities such as our MVNS product lines. We have been achieving this remix both through changes in headcount allocation as well as through acquisitions.
In terms of people at Yahoo, we closed the year with approximately 12,500 full-time employees. Our headcount has been essentially flat throughout current management's tenure. At the same time, we have added more than 1,000 people from acquisitions. Tumblr had nearly 200; Flurry, 100; BrightRoll had more than 400; and several hundred from other building block and town acquisitions. And we converted more than 1,000 contractor roles to full time. We have achieved the stability in headcount despite these additions through strong performance management by reprioritizing resources, by sunsetting older products and businesses and by consolidating locations.
We have closed 12 offices, including 4 since our last earnings call: Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia and Budapest. And we have sunset more than 75 products.
We will continue to seek and execute on efficiencies that we find on an ongoing basis as an effort to better align our resources with our strategy and growth opportunities and to drive enhanced profitability in the business.
On acquisitions, we've seen a lot of speculation around what we might do. We have worked hard to become a preferred acquirer, and we think it is important as we transition the business to continue to look for great opportunities to smartly deploy capital. As you know, we approach acquisitions in 3 different categories: talent acquisitions, which essentially are group hires; building block acquisitions, where we want the technology and the people and they generally align with 1 of Search, communications or digital content; and larger strategic acquisitions.
On strategic acquisitions, we are looking for businesses that can really accelerate us forward in mobile, video, native or social and usually multiple elements thereof. Flurry is a great example of this with more than 600,000 applications with the Flurry SDK integrated and more than 2.1 trillion app sessions seen last year. Flurry gives us unique advantages and insights in mobile, and they give us a platform for syndicating our native Gemini ads and BrightRoll ads on Mobile. Flurry really touches 3 of the 4 MVNS. Flurry is mobile, video and native.
However, despite speculation of the contrary, we don't consider larger acquisitions, Flurry, BrightRoll or Tumblr size or larger unless they really align with mobile, video, native or social. We will continue to be very disciplined in this regard.
I will now turn it over to Ken, who will discuss our Q4 and annual financial results in more detail."

I will now start by highlighting Q4 and full year 2014 performance, following with a discussion of our financial details and close with our forward-looking guidance.
Looking back in our Q4 and full year 2014 performance, I am pleased by the significant steps we have made delivering shareholder value by improving our operations, executing on transformative investments and prudently allocating our capital.
Q4 GAAP revenue was $1.253 billion, and revenue ex-TAC was $1.179 billion, at or above the high end of our guidance range. Adjusted EBITDA also exceeded our expectations at $409 million in the quarter as we continue to actively manage our cost base. And for the full year 2014, GAAP revenue and revenue ex-TAC were $4.681 billion and $4.4 billion, respectively. We saw a modest 1% year-over-year decline in both metrics as revenue from our transformative investments of mobile, social, video and native, MVNS, become more meaningful to offset the larger headwinds from our legacy PC businesses.
In Q4 and full year 2014, these 4 businesses together delivered strong revenue growth of 100% and 95% on a year-over-year basis. GAAP Mobile revenue surpassed $250 million in Q4, representing 23% quarter-over-quarter growth, while full year GAAP Mobile revenue was well above the $700 million figure we highlighted on our last earnings call. And our native ads business also shows significant progress with GAAP revenue of over $100 million in Q4.
Let me talk about capital return. We continued a strong commitment to capital return in Q4 as we repurchased 22 million shares in the open market for $980 million at an average price of $45.26. And also in the quarter, we entered into a second accelerated share repurchase agreement, under which we acquired 16 million shares for $800 million. This brings our total share repurchases for the full year to $4.2 billion, with 102 million shares repurchased at an average price of $40.94.
In terms of our commitment to return at least half of the $6.1 billion of after-tax Alibaba proceeds to our shareholders, we have aggressively bought back nearly 3 billion of our stock in just 4 months, consisting of $2.8 billion from the closing of Alibaba's IPO through the end of 2014 and approximately $120 million quarter-to-date.
Since the beginning of Q2 2012, our significant buyback activity has seen us repurchase 354 million shares, totaling 9.7 billion to date, representing approximately 29% growth reduction in our initial share base, at an overall average price of $27.44. This has been extremely accretive for our shareholders. And our diluted share count was 963 million for Q4. And at the end of the quarter, it was approximately 952 million, down 8% from a year ago and down 22% from the beginning of Q2 2012 on a net basis.
In Q4, we created additional capital by continuing to monetize our IP assets through patent sales, resulting in $35 million of cost benefits. This brings a total cash value from ongoing IP monetization efforts to approximately $575 million since 2012. We also realized $56 million in cash value from our Japanese yen hedges in Q4, resulting also in total realized value of $538 million from hedging a balance sheet investment in Yahoo Japan.
We would like to congratulate Hortonworks on the successful IPO as we hold equity of the company on our balance sheet, which is valued approximately $200 million.
Moving forward, we will continue to be good stewards as we evaluate the best ways to allocate capital and drive shareholder value.
Now let's go through our fourth quarter and full year 2004 (sic) [2014] results in greater detail. And later, I will close with our forward-looking guidance. As a reminder, I will focus most of the discussion around non-GAAP results, which excludes stock-based compensation expense of $103 million and $420 million and restructuring charges of $33 million and $103 million for Q4 and full year 2014, respectively. Non-GAAP results also exclude a gain on Hortonworks equity of $98 million and goodwill impairment charges of $88 million for both Q4 and the full year and the related tax impacts from all of these items. You can find complete reconciliation between the GAAP and non-GAAP results in our earnings slides on our Investor Relations website.
Now starting with the financial highlights for Q4 as seen on Slide 5. As I mentioned earlier, Q4 GAAP revenue was $1.253 billion, and revenue ex-TAC was $1.179 billion. Search revenue ex-TAC was flat year-over-year, while Display revenue ex-TAC was down 5%. The adjusted EBITDA was $409 million in the quarter. Non-GAAP operating income was $256 million, well above our guidance range. And earnings and equity interest was $102 million, down versus prior year as we no longer account for Alibaba investment under the equity method.
Non-GAAP EPS was $0.30, and our Q4 average fully diluted share count decreased 7% versus the prior year to 963 million shares. Free cash flow was $78 million for the quarter. Decline was primarily caused by temporary shifts in working capital relative to the prior year, including prepaid and accrued expenses and also the impact of the BrightRoll acquisition.
Our cash and marketable securities balance was $10.2 billion, which was down from the prior quarter as a result of a significant buyback activity in Q4. 
And lastly, our headcount ended the quarter at approximately 12,500, with no significant increase from Q3 despite adding the headcount from the BrightRoll acquisition. We will aggressively manage our headcount and operating expenses with the goals of increasing profitability and EBITDA over time.
Now moving to the full year review as seen on Slide 6. 2014 revenue ex-TAC was $4.4 billion, slightly down from 2013. Search revenue ex-TAC grew 5% year-over-year, while Display revenue ex-TAC declined 4% year-over-year. The adjusted EBITDA was $1.36 billion, decline of 13% versus prior year as we made investments in our sales and product organizations to support our growth initiatives in the MVNS area.
As we have stated previously, managing our cost structure is important to us, and then as we see, it continues [ph] attention throughout the year. I am particularly pleased with our ongoing efforts to unlock value in our IP assets with patent sales and licensing programs in 2014 that resulted in $98 million of total cost benefits and a Q2 transaction for patent licenses resulting in $400 million of fee revenue, which is being recognized over a 5-year period, actually, nearly $500 million in total value. We recognized $103 million of restructuring expenses for the year related to office consolidations and cost initiatives to improve our operating efficiency and reduce expenses.
In Q4, we announced several initiatives in our EMEA and Asia Pac regions to streamline our operations and improve our function of collaboration. Non-GAAP operating income was $755 million, down 19% from the prior year. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.57, a 3% improvement over 2013. And finally, free cash flow was $590 million for the year, which was down due to the decline in EBITDA and increase in capital expenses and working capital adjustments as noted.
Now let me walk through the financial results for Q4. Beginning with Search, GAAP revenue grew 1%, while revenue ex-TAC was flat year-over-year.  Click-driven revenue grew 18% year-over-year, representative of our gross revenue growth. We saw a large percentage of our TAC traffic coming from channels that incur a higher TAC, including mobile and other distribution partners. Bridging from click-driven revenue growth to revenue ex-TAC year-over-year, approximately 13% of the delta was due to the increase in TAC and 5% due to other factors.
Global Paid Clicks returned to double-digit growth, up 10%. This was mostly driven by the Americas region where we saw accelerated growth in the holiday season through monetization initiatives, including product ads which ramped significantly in Yahoo properties. Global PPC was up 7%. We continue to see favorable traffic mix coming from higher monetizing segments.
Some of this acceleration was caused by lower PPC in the Americas as our Q4 monetization effort's optimized toward clicks.
Regarding the Mozilla deal, we are very pleased with the significant impact it has had to our Search volume share. The Americas region saw search click-driven revenue increased 20% year-over-year, driven by clicks growing 23%, offset by a PPC decline modestly of 2%. Much of this growth came from the higher TAC distribution partners.
Moving -- now moving to Display. GAAP Display revenue declined 4% and revenue ex-TAC declined 5% year-over-year in the quarter. The GAAP revenue trend showed improvement as we gained revenue momentum from our transformative investments. Our programmatic audience buying platform, YAM Plus, is now globally available, while our native ads continue to show strong growth in the quarter.
Ads sold showed healthy growth in Q4 at 17% as we continue to increase our native and mobile inventory year-over-year. The PPA declined at 20% offset the volume increase in Q4. The year-over-year decline is mainly the result of the mixed shift away from higher price premium inventory.
Native ads continue to grow and accounted for 43% of ads sold in the quarter. Our native ads PPA grew over 20% from Q3 to Q4, driven by improved optimizations of our format and placements.
We closed the acquisition of BrightRoll in the late Q4 and expect positive contributions to our video and display growth in 2015.
The Flurry team continues to execute on mobile advertising, and we look forward to showing additional plans at our upcoming mobile developer conference next month.
For revenue detail by region, please refer to Slide 10. Americas revenue ex-TAC was flat year-over-year. APAC revenue ex-TAC was down 7%, or 4% on a constant currency basis. And EMEA revenue ex-TAC declined 7%, or 5% on a constant currency basis.
Now moving to expenses. Traffic acquisition costs were up 12% compared to the prior year. The main drivers for this increased TAC were TAC payments for acquired properties and the continued rollout of our Gemini search platform. Non-GAAP total operating expenses were $923 million for the quarter, which were up 6% versus the prior year. Depreciation and amortization has remained consistent with the past several quarters at approximately $150 million per quarter.
Our cash operating expense was $770 million, an improvement of $30 million versus our expectation and $19 million less than the prior quarter. However, excluding the impact of patent sales from both years, our cash operating expense is up a modest 2% year-over-year.
Workforce continues to drive expenses as we invest in a technical workforce. We have worked hard to find ways to offset our investments with prudent cost initiatives in other areas. For example, in Q4, we realized significant savings in data center efficiencies and continue reduction in contractors and other outside service providers, totaling approximately $40 million.
For GAAP total operating expenses in Q4, stock-based compensation was $103 million, $3 million lower versus prior quarter, and restructuring costs were $33 million, and we had a goodwill impairment charge of $88 million. EBITDA, as I noted, was $409 million in Q4, with a margin of 35% based upon ---based on revenue ex-TAC. And non-GAAP operating income was $256 million for the quarter, resulting in a margin of 22% on a revenue ex-TAC basis.
Quickly running out the income statement. We had a gain of $98 million resulting from our investment in Hortonworks. Earnings and equity interest was $102 million. As a reminder, reduction from last quarter is due to removal of Alibaba earnings and equity interest for our new IPO and is more indicative of the forward look.
Turning to the balance sheet. At the end of the Q4, end of the year, we had $10.2 billion in cash and marketable securities. And as I stated previously, cash tax related to the Alibaba IPO proceeds are expected to be approximately $3.3 billion and will be paid in Q1. Adjusting for this tax payment and convert another debt of $1.3 billion, our net cash balance at the end of the year was approximately $5.7 billion.
The change in cash balance from Q3 to Q4 was primarily driven by free cash flow of $78 million, adversely impacted by working capital movement in the accounting for BrightRoll; acquisitions of $545 million primarily for BrightRoll; and cash utilized for share repurchases activity for the quarter of $1.6 billion.
Now let me cover guidance. As we look to the first quarter of the year and going forward, we are committed to sustainably growing our business. I am pleased with the plans we have in place to drive shareholder value both through our Alibaba investment as well as through our MVNS businesses. We also recognize we have much work ahead to sustainably grow both revenues and profit going forward. Our guidance assumes that we continue to make steady on our core business into Q1 and over 2015. We will increase our focus on GAAP revenue, and expect this to lead to growth in revenue ex-TAC as we decide more partnerships and grow our business in BrightRoll and Gemini search.
In the short term, our guidance accounts for: in the Americas, we brought our new sales leadership and realigned our efforts to some near-term transitionary effects. Additionally, the Olympics in 2014 makes for a tougher comp in Q1. In EMEA, we announced the restructure of our organization, reducing nearly 1/3 of our headcount, which will lead to longer-term efficiencies but does post mid-term challenges. And we expect to be tracking to comparable revenue levels in Asia Pacific, with the exception of foreign exchanges.
Q4 non-GAAP cash expenses were approximately $800 million on a normalized basis. We expect Q1 to be comparable but with the addition of BrightRoll, resulting in a somewhat -- a number somewhat higher.
Looking ahead, we would like to get back to the quarterly range of $800 million or less, inclusive of our recent acquisitions. Specifically, for Q1 guidance, we expect the following: GAAP revenue range of $1.11 billion to $1.15 billion; revenue ex-TAC in the range of $1.02 billion to $1.06 billion; EBITDA in the range of $200 million to $240 million; and non-GAAP operating income in the range of $50 million to $90 million.
We have taken significant steps to deliver shareholder value. We have made progress in our transformative investments to set up a strong platform for growth while continuing to demonstrate our disciplined stewardship of capital. I will now turn it back to Marissa."

If I had to take a look at what I think we need to accomplish in 2015, one, we need better targeting. The more personalized these ads are, their price on a CPC basis, the more clicks we get on those ads, the better they perform for both our advertisers and for us in terms of revenue. We also need to explore additional formats. When we started off with Gemini, we were doing text-only ads. we since have been adding various image ads, now some product ads as well as some video ads. And I think that these new formats are something that has really helped us take the Gemini ads and adapt them into something that's really truly native as we move across different products and platforms. And finally, I also think it's important for us to get distribution since that we don't run Gemini ads nor native ads only on Yahoo and Tumblr, but we also can run them across other sites. And Flurry is a great distribution channel for us here. We're really looking forward to integrating Gemini into the Flurry SDK. So when a new app developer brings to the market a new app, first question they ask is analytics, the next question that they ask is really, how can I make money from my application? And so if we actually have that ad network easily and readily available in the APIs and the Flurry SDK, we think this is an easy way for us to distribute more Gemini ads as well as our BrightRoll video ads. And native and video ads are really the way that people prefer to monetize mobile, particularly apps. And more broadly on the Search reorganization point, we're really excited to have Lisa and Cathy and Kevin onboard. I don't think that the reorganization that we have deployed in those new hires really changes things with regard to native ads, other than native ads are trends that are here to stay. They're not a big part of our product portfolio. And there's been some adjustment as our sales force has really gotten familiar with the product and understood which advertisers to bring that product to, how to optimize them and ultimately, provide better -- better performance on the campaign. But we're going to need a lot of progress there. And so overall, I think that the re-org, from my viewpoint, is I would say somewhat perpendicular to our progress on native ads. Obviously, I think the team has already done a great job transitioning."

So we thought, given the different aspects of YJ, the different facts that we have operating relationships with them, joint venture relationships with them, they are non-U.S. therefore, non-SEC registrants.

I would say that overall, what we've seen is the MVNS businesses are not cannibalistic to traditional PC advertising. Generally, these types of advertisers who buy a mobile, video, native or social ad, the type of ad production they need to do, the type of audience they're looking for, the way they want to interact with those users is pretty fundamentally different than banner ads. What we have seen that has been applying pressure and is somewhat cannibalistic to that traditional PC business is the move towards programmatic. And so when an advertisement, for example, moves from being sold through premium channel to a programmatic channel, that certainly causes some cannibalization overall of revenue. And we have seen, particularly on Search, not as much on Display, that when we move a user from a PC search to a mobile search, they do -- that search monetizes at a slightly lower rate. We've been making improvements there, but we still aren't to a point on Search where mobile search has the same revenue per search in, say, a PC search. We're getting closer to that on Display, but I think that overall, in terms of the cannibalistic movement of the MVNS, certainly on the Display side, it's much more about programmatic versus premium."

We work across the board with Google, Microsoft, Apple, Facebook, Twitter. We have different -- Samsung. We have different partnerships with all of these different providers. Not that they can't work with each other, but we work well with them. And one of the reasons we work well with them is we're trying to be as flexible in our approach to partnerships as we can be. We really, especially when approaching a search partnership, we acknowledge that these users belong to that distribution partner, and they should be able to present search the way that they really want search ultimately presented. And so we worked with the partner, as we did Mozilla, to redesign the best possible user experience that they feel really suit their users, their value, their environment. And I think overall, we've been really investing in features on top of web search. And so when you look at things like search my world, results may take, for example, data from your email and brings those results right onto search results page. I've given examples on past calls, like for example, of flight itineraries. It's really great to see those kinds of features on the search results page. And that's something that Yahoo can do willingly exclusively because of our large base of Yahoo Mail users. And I would also look for towards and think about what mobile search should be in the future. Because while we've done a lot to optimize PC search, the place that we're really investing the most is in mobile search. And there, today we have a very traditional HTML-based approach. But we've really been trying to think about how do we do the best possible job answering queries on the phone. And when you look at, for example, acquisitions like Aviate, which is growing nicely, we have that offered as an application, we really think that mobile search should take into much more account your contacts, your location, your particular information. And so we're really hoping, as we pursue the mobile search, to come up with a more app-based experience and one that suits the mobile area better, and we think the best partners will respond to."

We think that the sequential growth in users that we saw on Tumblr is really because we have much better composition tools. If you look back at Tumblr's growth graph, what you tend to see is every time there's been an improvement in terms of how well you can post or how well you can present your blog, we saw a real burst in this in mobile. Last year, at Tumblr, we did our mobile app to make composing on the phone much easier and much more beautiful such that you could actually be mobile only. Previously, it was really -- it tells me where you'd set up your blog on PC and then work on it on mobile. So we know whenever we make changes and improvements to the composition tool there, it not only causes users to use the platform more if they're already on it, but it also attracts new users to it. in terms of mobile usage, we haven't -- I don't have and we haven't just broken out in the past mobile-only users, but I can say that what we have today is more than half of the users on Tumblr use mobile to engage and participate on Tumblr. And we have internal goals this year that are really around trying to grow that number significantly such that most users, the vast majority of users on Tumblr at least engage at some point using mobile. And on the native ads and what it will take to ultimately improve the targeted thing and therefore, stop the price-per-click erosion. What we've really been doing is accessing more information sources. The more we understand about you, the better job we can do targeting ads towards you. And so over the past year, for example, if you look at our stream on the home page, we use the same targeting technology for those articles as we do for the ads contained therein. And over the past year, we've gotten a lot of new information sources. So for example, the sports teams I follow, the businesses I follow on Yahoo Finance, pulling that data over. And we're also looking for signed-in users, can we access with their permission some of the information coming from Yahoo Mail. These are all things that we are working on as well as retargeting off of other sites. And so these are all areas of investment and each of them has brought with it a gain in native Price-per-Ad. And I should note that we're starting to see this turnaround. Native price -- the native price per ad actually grew 20% quarter-over-quarter from Q3 to Q4. Gemini really over-performed our expectations in Q4 and that's what really -- we were saying at the end of last -- at the end of Q3 that we had about $0.25 billion business, plus or minus 10%, and we actually closed the year about $300 million of revenue. And that nice upside surprise really was driven in part because of the improvement in Price-per-Ad in Gemini, which is driven by these targeting improvements."

I would say the first really is on Yahoo O&O, it's about growing our engagement, getting more apps installed. And this is something we've worked on really intensively. We have a great growth team here at Yahoo and our Mobile group, and they really studied how can we help get more users downloading our apps and using them every day in the first place, and how can we take users who already have those apps and use things like push notifications to ultimately get them reengaged. And so we've been working very hard on our engagement, and that certainly goes for mobile, native and social. The more engaging we make the platforms on an O&O basis, the better off we'll be. In terms of off-network mobile, native and social advertisements, it's really around distribution. And that's one of the reasons we were so excited about the Flurry acquisition. Flurry brings with it access to 1.6 billion smart devices. They easily see more smart devices than any other company on the planet from what we can tell. And the opportunity there, to work with the mobile app developers and integrate Flurry, and for those who want to monetize their applications, making native and video ads, our native Gemini ads as well as our BrightRoll video ads available to that huge number of mobile applications and their reach is something that's really exciting and I'll say can really accelerate our revenue in mobile, native and social. And so that's really where the focus is, how can we get better off-network distribution through Flurry and also how can we improve our engagement on applications that will naturally drive up native, mobile and social on the core Yahoo platform. And on Tumblr, what we are referring to, around 50% of the people who use our dashboard view, who basically blog posts are actually now doing so through the application. And so the audience numbers, that 460 million actually include blog readers as opposed to blog posters. And so there -- we can look at it. It basically maps the overall trend of how much traffic is on PC versus mobile as a whole because in essence, as a blog reader, you're simply reading a web page and reading that content. We're proud to have that contributor that brought you that Tumblr page on our network. But when we think about mobile users, it's really about the very engaged bloggers that are on Tumblr. And more than half of those are using the app to do their blog posts and to read the dashboard."

The fact that we have basically grown to more than $1.1 billion of revenue and from essentially nothing in just 2 years makes us incredibly proud. So we're really happy with our position overall in terms of how well our applications are performing, how well these new ad formats are performing. I think when I look out across the acquisition space or even what we might allocate people to internally, our goal is we want to make sure that we have at least 1 app for each user and for each user, it might be different, whether it's a go-to app. You heard us talk about on past calls that we're really working to grow our daily active users in comparison to monthly active users. We want to have fewer, what we would call in sort of a marketing segmentation exercise, fewer tourists and more fanatics who are using the product all the time. And so when we look across the space of what we might invest in, we look not only at our core competencies in the past, which of course, are around search, communications, digital content and what we might do in that space to really become part of the users' every day. But we also want to think about what is something that we might build or acquire anew? So that could be something ultimately in the messaging space. Obviously, we've had Yahoo Messenger for a number of years. What does that look like in the mobile space? We made some nice small acquisitions in Q4 of MessageMe and Cooliris, both of which have very good technology and just great user interfaces in the messaging space. And so we'd like to see how we might build out our communications offering more there. And that's really what I would say the goal is, how do we get more DAU and improve our DAU to MAU ratio. And the obvious ways to do that are to build on our core competencies but in particular, to build on communication which of course has a native aspect, a social aspect and a mobile aspect in all parts of today and builds on our strength of email and some of our client base messaging on the PC."

Before I go into our quarterly and annual financials, I'd like to dedicate the first portion of the call to the announcement we sent out earlier today regarding our Alibaba holdings.
As our shareholders are aware, Yahoo holds a total of 384 million shares of Alibaba, which comprises 15.4% of Alibaba and is worth nearly $40 billion using Monday's closing Alibaba share price. Following the Alibaba IPO, these shares are subject to a 1-year lockup agreement that runs until September 21, 2015. If sold or transferred through ordinary means, the proceeds would be taxable at approximately 40%. Given the low basis, this would give rise to a tax liability of approximately $16 billion or roughly $16 per share of Yahoo.
For over 2 years, we have worked with leading tax, accounting, legal and financial advisers to identify and design an optimal transaction that could maximize the value of our Alibaba stake in a tax-efficient manner. Today, I'm happy and proud to announce that management has recommended and the Yahoo board has authorized a plan to pursue a tax-free spin-off of 100% of the company's remaining holdings in Alibaba. We expect to effectuate the spin-off in Q4 of 2015. This will result in 2 independent publicly traded companies.
The spin-off company, which we will refer to as SpinCo, will be a newly formed independently registered investment company that will hold 384 million shares of Alibaba and a legacy, ancillary business that we will separate from Yahoo's core. The transaction will be subject to closing conditions, including regulatory review, as appropriate for a deal of this type. After an exhaustive review, we are pursuing this transaction as we believe it maximizes value for our shareholders and authorizes transaction efficiency and certainty. This is a structure that we can pursue and affect independently, capturing value exclusively for our shareholders. And we made the conscious decision to distribute 100% of our Alibaba shares because we felt maximum tax efficiency was important in our roles as stewards of capital.
During this team tenure, Yahoo has returned approximately $9.3 billion in capital to shareholders through share repurchases. Assuming Monday's value of Alibaba post-spin, we will have returned nearly $50 billion in value to our shareholders. This level of return is historic.
Moreover, considering the tax-free spin-off announced today, plus the already completed share repurchases, we are on track to return approximately 97% of our proceeds from Alibaba.
It's also worth noting how reducing the number of shares sold in the Alibaba IPO yielded additional value for Yahoo shareholders. As you know, this management team worked very hard to reduce the number of shares that we are contractually required to sell in the IPO. We noted on our last call that renegotiating the preexisting agreement, we have realized appreciation of over $4 billion. With today's plan for a tax-free transaction, we stand to realize $3.31 billion of additional tax savings. In total, the improved relationship between the companies and that negotiation we worked so hard for is worth more than $7.7 billion today and nearly $8 per share of Yahoo.
I'm proud that our management team has, through good stewardship and focus, found a possible path to delivering this type of value to our shareholders. I'd like to pause here and offer some gratitude to those who helped along the way. I would like to thank the Yahoo team, along with our advisers, for helping us deliver this excellent plan. I'd like to thank our board for their approval of this plan as well as the significant time and energy that they dedicated to this issue. And finally, and most importantly, I would like to thank you, our shareholders, for your patience and suggestions as we carefully analyzed the best path forward for Yahoo. I'd like to thank you for investing in us and believing in us. It makes us both really happy to be able to deliver this plan today.
Given its immense value, we made finance solution for our Alibaba holdings a priority in the transaction announced today. While our holdings in Yahoo Japan, by comparison, are a small fraction of our Alibaba holdings, we will continue to explore ways to maximize the value of Yahoo Japan, continuing in our commitment to be good stewards of capital. In our core operating business, we feel we have built a strong foundation and we are in an excellent position to execute and return the company to growth.
I'm now going to turn it over to Ken to discuss the tax-free spin-off structure and the execution plan in more depth."

Let me provide further details and announcement as summary transaction highlights can be found in our slide presentation available in our Investor Relations website.
As shown in Slides 3 and 4, one company will be the currently existing Yahoo entity, which will include the Yahoo operating business, net cash and our 35.5% equity ownership stake in our Yahoo Japan joint venture. As Marissa mentioned, the second company will be the newly formed entity, which will be a registered investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940. It will include our remaining 15.4% ownership of Alibaba shares. SpinCo will also include a legacy, ancillary business as the active trader business with approximately $50 million in adjusted EBITDA that we have identified to be part of the transaction. The stock in the new company will be distributed pro rata to Yahoo shareholders. It will be led by independent, newly appointed management team and Board of Directors. The composition of SpinCo's Board of Directors and management team and other details and transaction, including the distribution ratio, will be announced prior to the close of the transaction.
SpinCo will assume no debt as part of the transaction. We believe this to be a unique spin-off transaction. We are not aware of any precedent of an operating company spinning off a registered investment company. And as seen on Slide 5, we believe the structure is the most attractive alternative for Yahoo and our shareholders.
The transaction is designed to maximize value of our -- of Alibaba holdings exclusively to our shareholders as the distribution will be tax-free. The ability to execute the transaction independently optimizes timing and execution efficiency.
Lastly, we believe the structure will improve valuation transparency for both SpinCo and Yahoo. The transaction is subject to regulatory and certain other conditions, and we expect it to close in Q4 2015 as seen on Slide 6.
Key closing conditions do include receipt of IRS and requisite tax opinions, confirming tax-free status of the spin, filing and effectiveness of an applicable registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission, in compliance with the requirements under the Investment Company Act of 1940. We are in the process of filing for a ruling from the IRS and are in ongoing communications with the SEC. Today's announcement culminates a comprehensive review of alternatives conducted by the board and the management team working with our top advisers, and we believe this is the optimal structure with a clean transaction for the company and our shareholders.
With regard to our equity ownership in Yahoo Japan, YJ is a joint venture with Softbank. We remain open-minded about alternatives for value creation, and our equity ownership in Yahoo Japan is not part of this transaction. Today, we are primarily focused on maximizing the value of our Alibaba shares, which are, by far, our largest nonoperating asset in a tax-efficient manner to drive significant shareholder value. The Yahoo Japan ownership stake is currently valued at approximately $7 billion compared to the much greater value of the Alibaba stake at approximately $40 billion. And that's a very much smaller value creation opportunity.
Given our operating relationship, we also need to carefully consider other factors relative to our Yahoo Japan equity ownership such as our brand license and technology license agreements. In conjunction with our advisers, the management team is continuing a thorough evaluation of financial competitive and strategic implications for this entity.
Now let me turn it back to Marissa as we discuss our Q4 and full year 2014 performance. Marissa?"

We'd like to thank both Jerry as well as the team at Alibaba, [indiscernible] by Jack and Joe. Thank you.
This level of return has also been possible because the core of Yahoo's business is returning to health and stability and, we believe, growth. We've seen over the past 2.5 years that our own free cash flow is healthy enough to allow for the necessary investment in the core business through organic means.
Taking a look at our Q4 and 2014 results. I'm pleased to report that our performance continues to show stability in the core business. In Q4, our GAAP revenue was $1,253,000,000. In 2014, our GAAP revenue was $4,618,000,000. Both are roughly flat year-over-year, down approximately 1%.
On a revenue ex-TAC basis, our revenue in Q4 was $1,179,000,000, down approximately 2% year-over-year, largely due to TAC acceleration in our Search business. In 2014, our revenue ex-TAC was $4,401,000,000, down less than 1%.
I'm now going to turn to look at our progress in detail on Mobile; on our investment businesses, mobile, video, native and social; on Search; and on Display. I'll then offer a broader look at the company's progress, our strides for efficiency and excellence and our acquisition strategy.
For the first time last quarter, we reported on our Mobile revenue. In Q3, we saw approximately $200 million on a GAAP basis and predicted more than $1.2 billion on a gross basis and more than $700 million on a GAAP basis for the year. I'm proud to say that we achieved these estimates. In Q4, our Mobile revenue was $254 million, up from $207 million in Q3, a growth of 23% quarter-over-quarter.
Our gross Mobile revenue for the year was $1,260,000,000, and our Mobile GAAP revenue was $768 million, exceeding our estimates by 5% and 10%, respectively. We had a very good year in Mobile, and we grew at an accelerating rate and one that appears to be faster than the industry.
In Q4, our Mobile monthly active users were up to 575 million, making us one of the largest mobile audiences globally. Note this number includes Tumblr and is measured based on a different methodology, so it can now be compared with the Q4 number from 2013. For reference, we believe this number has grown 18% year-over-year, showing strong growth on an already large user base.
In terms of Mobile products, our Mobile apps continue to win accolades. Google Play recognized Yahoo News Digest, Yahoo Mail and Tumblr on their Best Apps of 2014 list. And the Apple iOS store recognized 4 of our apps on their Best Apps of 2014 list: Yahoo News Digest, Flickr, Yahoo Finance and Yahoo Weather. We are incredibly proud of the strong product offering we have built, and it's an offering that is in demand with key mobile partners. In Q4, we launched various integrations with Sprint, Samsung and AT&T.
In late 2012, this management team changed course from a confused web-based mobile strategy, which preceded us, to a beautiful native app-based strategy. The fruits from our mobile strategy are obvious just 2 years later as we have fundamentally changed our trajectory in user growth, in industry response and, most importantly, in Mobile revenue.
Building on Mobile, I'd like now to turn to the other key areas of investment. We've discussed on past calls the importance of mobile, video, native and social. This is where we invest most heavily, and these are the fastest-growing areas of digital advertising. For ease of reference, we refer to these with the synonym MVNS, short for mobile, video, native and social.
Here at Yahoo, the MVNS grew 95% year-over-year and 100% year-over-year in Q4. In 2014, these businesses accounted for more than $1.1 billion of GAAP revenue. The 4 MVNS businesses do have some overlap, which we deduplicate, since we monetize both mobile and social, Tumblr, for example, with native ads. However, please recall that the MVNS did not contribute meaningfully to Yahoo prior to 2012. We had no native or social ads, and mobile and video were nascent. We have created more than $1 billion of new revenue annually basically from nothing in just 2 years. In 2015, we expect the MVNS will contribute over $1.5 billion to our business. If broken out on their own, as a company, they would undoubtedly be one of the fastest-growing startups in the world.
Let's take a deeper look at each of the MVNS beyond mobile, starting with video. Video is incredibly important as we look at how to reinvent our large legacy display business for the future. Video is key because it is an essential and familiar way for marketers to deliver their messages. We couldn't be more excited about our Q4 acquisition of BrightRoll as it instantly puts us in a leadership position across the video advertising ecosystem. 
In 2014, BrightRoll served more video ads and reached more consumers than any other platform according to comScore. They powered digital video advertising for the world's largest brands and agencies, including 87 of the Ad Age Top 100 U.S. advertisers, all of the top 15 advertising agencies and all 10 of the leading demand-side platforms.
BrightRoll is a fast-growing business with net revenues exceeding $100 million last year and solid growth expected this year. In our MVNS portfolio, video is the slowest-growing area. We looked for the right acquisition to jump-start our work in video ads, and we are confident that we found it.
Native ads here at Yahoo refers to Yahoo Gemini, which continues to impress. In Q3, we had approximately $80 million of revenue from native ads, and we predicted that we would see $0.25 billion of revenue in 2014. Yahoo Gemini's native ads saw $106 million of revenue in Q4, up more than 32% quarter-over-quarter.
In total, over the year, Yahoo Gemini native ads saw nearly $300 million of GAAP revenue. We are seeing strong growth and demand for Gemini-powered ads on both PC and mobile, on Yahoo-owned and operated sites as well as through our newly launched publisher offering, Yahoo Recommends.
On our final of the MVNS, we turn to social and Tumblr. According to November report from GlobalWebIndex, Tumblr overtook Instagram as the fastest-growing social network over the preceding 6 months, and that growth continued in Q4. Across Tumblr, we saw our audience rise from 420 million in Q3 to 460 million in Q4, up approximately 9% quarter-over-quarter. Mobile app usage continues to be a key growth driver, with mobile app users up 33% year-over-year. And we now have 75 of the Ad Age Top 100 with a presence on Tumblr and 56 of the 75 spending on Tumblr.
Overall, we are confident that we have honed in on the right investment businesses, and our efforts are beginning to show significant traction, more than $1.1 billion of GAAP revenue in 2014 and 95% growth year-over-year. I really want to applaud the teams here at Yahoo who have helped us invent and create this billion-dollar-plus business suite.
I'll now turn to a broader discussion of our core business in Search and Display. Let's first look at Search. Many people were struck last quarter by the difference between our gross Mobile revenue and our GAAP Mobile revenue. This difference is driven by the fact that we account for our Search, including affiliates, on a net basis. This means our GAAP revenue is roughly equal to our revenue ex-TAC on Search, and the TAC paid to partners hasn't really been visible in our external numbers. This dynamic exists on PC as well. So in order to give our investors more insight into our Search affiliate business and our Search business as a whole, we have decided to begin to release growth Search revenues in addition to the GAAP and ex-TAC measures.
In Q4, we had gross Search revenue ex-TAC of $932 million, which maps to GAAP revenue of $467 million and ex-TAC revenue of $462 million. Gross revenue was up 14% year-over-year, GAAP revenue was up a modest 1% and revenue ex-TAC was roughly flat. 
Overall, in 2014, we saw $3,378,000,000 of gross Search revenue, which maps to $1.793 billion in GAAP revenue and $1.784 billion in ex-TAC revenue. Gross revenue was up 14%, GAAP revenue was up 3% year-over-year and revenue ex-TAC was up 5% year-over-year.
Across Price-per-Click and Paid Clicks, we saw a nice balancing of the metrics. Paid Clicks rose 10% year-over-year versus 0% in the prior quarter. This growth in Paid Clicks was driven primarily by strong growth in the Americas, which saw a 23% year-over-year click growth.
Price-per-Click also grew. It was up 7% year-over-year. Our Search click-driven revenue was up 18% year-over-year. As a note, the Search click-driven revenue closely tracks and predicts our gross revenue growth.
Also in Q4, we struck a 5-year partnership with Mozilla to make Yahoo the preferred search experience on Firefox browsers across mobile and desktop. External sources estimate that Mozilla has 3% to 5% of the North American search market, so this is a significant opportunity. We began serving Mozilla partway through December, so we do not yet have a complete calendar month of data on the deal. But we are already impressed with the volume Mozilla search has brought to our marketplace and the insightfulness and agility of the Mozilla team.
Search has been a strong growth story for us and is a strong growth industry. Mobile search does monetize at a lower rate than PC search. So as consumers switch to mobile devices, the revenue per search decreases. And we are also seeing TAC rates [ph] rise across the search industry. That said, we believe deeply in Search as a core growth driver, and we intend to keep it that way.
Finally, turning to Display. Traditional PC Display advertising is in decline across the industry. At Yahoo, we have been working hard to stabilize the traditional business while adding fast growth through our new forward-looking MVNS businesses. Our GAAP Display revenue in Q4 was $532 million. On a revenue ex-TAC basis, our Display revenue was $464 million. Year-over-year, this represents a decline of 5% on an ex-TAC revenue basis and 4% on a GAAP revenue basis.
While the declines have continued, they are slowing. In Q3, we had seen 6% and 5% declines, respectively. Our ads sold in quarter increased approximately 17%. However, our Price-per-Ad decreased approximately 20%. On our Q3 earnings call, we discussed significant decline in the traditional PC Display industry and the effect it has on Yahoo's business. While this decline has and will continue, the decline undoubtedly would have been worse if not for the significant investment we made in programmatic advertising through Yahoo Ad Manager Plus as well as our investments to increase engagement on our properties.
Encouragingly, our MVNS businesses showed strong enough growth to nearly offset these declines. As we conjectured on the last call, we believe the growth from the MVNS businesses will exceed the declines we experience in traditional display in 2015, and our overall display business will return to growth this year.
One key factor to returning Display to growth is to grow engagement on Yahoo Mail and our digital content across all platforms. In Q4, we worked hard to enhance and improve both. On Mail, we launched to broad appeal and acclaim, Stationery, in partnership with Paperless Post. We also launched better image handling, added our stream from our home page to Mail and a scroll-to-search feature. And in partnership with Sprint and their 2 prepay brands, Virgin Mobile and Boost Mobile, we launched Smartr Contacts built on acquired technology from Xobni. 
In digital content, we continue to increase the quality of our content and improve our engagement. In Q4, we grew our portfolio of digital magazines to 10 by launching Yahoo Music, Yahoo Parenting and Yahoo Makers. With top-notch content and Yahoo's distribution power, our digital magazines are quickly ascending into the leading position in their categories.
In recent comScore reports, we saw both Yahoo Parenting and Yahoo Travel at #1 in their categories and Yahoo Style at #2. Across all of our digital magazines, we saw our daily active users grow 39% quarter-over-quarter, and advertisers are responding to this beautiful, immersive format. In Q4, we added new major advertisers, including Gucci, Net-A-Porter, Mars, Toyota, Visa, Chase, Volkswagen and Citibank.
Our efforts around video technological excellence and great video content are also bearing fruits. We grew video streams across our network quarter-over-quarter by 15%. With Yahoo Live, our concert series featuring a live concert each day through our partnership with Live Nation, we saw a 65% increase quarter-over-quarter in streams, and even more excitingly, 55% of the Yahoo Live viewers were new to the network. We also launched several short-form video series in conjunction with our digital magazines, including Pogue's Basics in Yahoo Tech and Beauty Stories with Bobbi in Yahoo Beauty. And looking to Q1 and coming to a screen near you on March 17, we announced that we will bring Season 6 of Community to Yahoo.
Finally, and also in Q4, we added serious strength to our sales team. Lisa Utzschneider joined us as a Senior Vice President of Americas Sales. Kevin Gentzel joins as our Vice President of Premium Sales. And Kathy Kayse joins as our VP of Sales, Strategy and Solutions. These 3 leaders have energized our sales force, particularly here in the Americas, with new, broader and deeper relationships with advertisers and a fresh modern look at our go-to-market strategy. I'm thrilled to have them on board and look forward to seeing their impact on the business.
In summary, on the core, where our focus is Search and Display, we saw a strong growth in Search on a gross basis. However, increasing TAC rates kept us reasonably flat on a net basis. That said, our new partnership with Mozilla gives us reason to be optimistic that Search will continue to be a growth story.
On Display, the decline has continued, though it is improving. We remain confident we will get to growth on Display this year. We believe the strong growth from our MVNS businesses will offset the Display declines elsewhere that we've worked to stabilize.
In one final look at the core in really trying to understand the growth trends and headwinds, if we set aside the traditional PC Display business, which is in decline across the industry, the core business grew 10% on a GAAP basis and 7% on a revenue ex-TAC basis.
Finally, I want to spend some time talking about the widespread and ongoing remix of resources that we're pursuing here at Yahoo. We have been remixing our business and resources away from legacy businesses and toward future-oriented activities such as our MVNS product lines. We have been achieving this remix both through changes in headcount allocation as well as through acquisitions.
In terms of people at Yahoo, we closed the year with approximately 12,500 full-time employees. Our headcount has been essentially flat throughout current management's tenure. At the same time, we have added more than 1,000 people from acquisitions. Tumblr had nearly 200; Flurry, 100; BrightRoll had more than 400; and several hundred from other building block and town acquisitions. And we converted more than 1,000 contractor roles to full time. We have achieved the stability in headcount despite these additions through strong performance management by reprioritizing resources, by sunsetting older products and businesses and by consolidating locations.
We have closed 12 offices, including 4 since our last earnings call: Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia and Budapest. And we have sunset more than 75 products.
We will continue to seek and execute on efficiencies that we find on an ongoing basis as an effort to better align our resources with our strategy and growth opportunities and to drive enhanced profitability in the business.
On acquisitions, we've seen a lot of speculation around what we might do. We have worked hard to become a preferred acquirer, and we think it is important as we transition the business to continue to look for great opportunities to smartly deploy capital. As you know, we approach acquisitions in 3 different categories: talent acquisitions, which essentially are group hires; building block acquisitions, where we want the technology and the people and they generally align with one of Search, communications or digital content; and larger strategic acquisitions.
On strategic acquisitions, we are looking for businesses that can really accelerate us forward in mobile, video, native or social and usually multiple elements thereof. Flurry is a great example of this with more than 600,000 applications with the Flurry SDK integrated and more than 2.1 trillion app sessions seen last year. Flurry gives us unique advantages and insights in mobile, and they give us a platform for syndicating our native Gemini ads and BrightRoll ads on Mobile. Flurry really touches 3 of the 4 MVNS. Flurry is mobile, video and native.
However, despite speculation to the contrary, we don't consider larger acquisitions, Flurry, BrightRoll or Tumblr size or larger unless they really align with mobile, video, native or social. We will continue to be very disciplined in this regard.
I will now turn it over to Ken, who will discuss our Q4 and annual financial results in more detail."

I will now start by highlighting our Q4 and full year 2014 performance, following with a discussion of our financial details and close with our forward-looking guidance.Looking back at our Q4 and full year 2014 performance, I am pleased",2395,"Thanks, Marissa. I will now start by highlighting our Q4 and full year 2014 performance, following with a discussion of our financial details and close with our forward-looking guidance.
Looking back at our Q4 and full year 2014 performance, I am pleased by the significant steps we have made delivering shareholder value by improving our operations, executing on transformative investments and prudently allocating our capital.
Q4 GAAP revenue was $1.253 billion, and revenue ex-TAC was $1.179 billion, at or above the high end of our guidance range. Adjusted EBITDA also exceeded our expectations at $409 million in the quarter as we continue to actively manage our cost base. And for the full year 2014, GAAP revenue and revenue ex-TAC were $4.618 billion and $4.4 billion, respectively. We saw a modest 1% year-over-year decline in both metrics as revenue from our transformative investments of mobile, social, video and native, MVNS, become more meaningful to offset the larger headwinds from our legacy PC businesses.
In Q4 and full year 2014, these 4 businesses together delivered strong revenue growth of 100% and 95% on a year-over-year basis. GAAP Mobile revenue surpassed $250 million in Q4, representing 23% quarter-over-quarter growth, while full year GAAP Mobile revenue was well above the $700 million figure we highlighted on our last earnings call. And our native ads business also shows significant progress with GAAP revenue of over $100 million in Q4.
Let me talk about capital return. We continued a strong commitment to capital return in Q4 as we repurchased 22 million shares in the open market for $980 million at an average price of $45.26. And also in the quarter, we entered into a second accelerated share repurchase agreement, under which we acquired 16 million shares for $800 million. This brings our total share repurchases for the full year to $4.2 billion, with 102 million shares repurchased at an average price of $40.94.
In terms of our commitment to return at least half of the $6.1 billion of after-tax Alibaba proceeds to our shareholders, we have aggressively bought back nearly $3 billion of our stock in just 4 months, consisting of $2.8 billion from the closing of Alibaba's IPO through the end of 2014 and approximately $120 million quarter-to-date.
Since the beginning of Q2 2012, our significant buyback activity has seen us repurchase 354 million shares, totaling $9.7 billion to date, representing approximately 29% gross reduction in our initial share base, at an overall average price of $27.44. This has been extremely accretive for our shareholders. And our diluted share count was 963 million for Q4. And at the end of the quarter, it was approximately 952 million, down 8% from a year ago and down 22% from the beginning of Q2 2012 on a net basis.
In Q4, we created additional capital by continuing to monetize our IP assets through patent sales, resulting in $35 million of cost benefits. This brings a total cash value from ongoing IP monetization efforts to approximately $575 million since 2012. We also realized $56 million in cash value from our Japanese yen hedges in Q4, resulting also in a total realized value of $538 million from hedging a balance sheet investment in Yahoo Japan.
We would like to congratulate Hortonworks on a successful IPO as we hold equity of the company on our balance sheet, which is valued approximately $200 million.
Moving forward, we will continue to be good stewards as we evaluate the best ways to allocate capital and drive shareholder value.
Now let's go through our fourth quarter and full year 2004 (sic) [2014] results in greater detail. And later, I will close with our forward-looking guidance. As a reminder, I will focus most of the discussion around non-GAAP results, which excludes stock-based compensation expense of $103 million and $420 million and restructuring charges of $33 million and $103 million for Q4 and full year 2014, respectively. Non-GAAP results also exclude a gain on Hortonworks equity of $98 million and goodwill impairment charges of $88 million for both Q4 and the full year and the related tax impacts from all of these items. You can find complete reconciliation between the GAAP and non-GAAP results in our earnings slides on our Investor Relations website.
Now starting with the financial highlights for Q4 as seen on Slide 5. As I mentioned earlier, Q4 GAAP revenue was $1.253 billion, and revenue ex-TAC was $1.179 billion. Search revenue ex-TAC was flat year-over-year, while Display revenue ex-TAC was down 5%. The adjusted EBITDA was $409 million in the quarter. Non-GAAP operating income was $256 million, well above our guidance range. And earnings and equity interest was $102 million, down versus prior year as we no longer accounted for Alibaba investment under the equity method.
Non-GAAP EPS was $0.30, and our Q4 average fully diluted share count decreased 7% versus the prior year to 963 million shares. Free cash flow was $78 million for the quarter. Decline was primarily caused by temporary shifts in working capital relative to the prior year, including prepaid and accrued expenses and also the impact of the BrightRoll acquisition.
Our cash and marketable securities balance was $10.2 billion, which was down from the prior year quarter as a result of a significant buyback activity in Q4. 
And lastly, our headcount ended the quarter at approximately 12,500, with no significant increase from Q3 despite adding the headcount from the BrightRoll acquisition. We will aggressively manage our headcount and operating expenses with the goals of increasing profitability and EBITDA over time.
Now moving to the full year review as seen on Slide 6. 2014 revenue ex-TAC was $4.4 billion, slightly down from 2013. Search revenue ex-TAC grew 5% year-over-year, while Display revenue ex-TAC declined 4% year-over-year. The adjusted EBITDA was $1.36 billion, decline of 13% versus prior year as we made investments in our sales and product organizations to support our growth initiatives in the MVNS area.
As we have stated previously, managing our cost structure is important to us, and then as we see it, continuous attention throughout the year. I am particularly pleased with our ongoing efforts to unlock value in our IP assets with patent sales and licensing programs in 2014 that resulted in $98 million of total cost benefits and a Q2 transaction for patent licenses resulting in $400 million of fee revenue, which is being recognized over a 5-year period, actually, nearly $500 million in total value. We recognized $103 million of restructuring expenses for the year related to office consolidations and cost initiatives to improve our operating efficiency and reduce expenses.
In Q4, we announced several initiatives in our EMEA and Asia Pac regions to streamline our operations and improve our functional collaboration. Non-GAAP operating income was $755 million, down 19% from the prior year. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.57, a 3% improvement over 2013. And finally, free cash flow was $590 million for the year, which was down due to the decline in EBITDA and increase in capital expenses and working capital adjustments as noted.
Now let me walk through the financial results for Q4. Beginning with Search, GAAP revenue grew 1%, while revenue ex-TAC was flat year-over-year.  Click-driven revenue grew 18% year-over-year, representative of our gross revenue growth. We saw a large percentage of our TAC traffic coming from channels that incur a higher TAC, including mobile and other distribution partners. Bridging from quick-driven revenue growth to revenue ex-TAC year-over-year, approximately 13% of the delta was due to the increase in TAC and 5% due to other factors.
Global Paid Clicks returned to double-digit growth, up 10%. This was mostly driven by the Americas region where we saw accelerated growth in the holiday season through monetization initiatives, including product ads which ramped significantly in Yahoo properties. Global PPC was up 7%. We continue to see favorable traffic mix coming from higher monetizing segments.
Some of this acceleration was caused by lower PPC in the Americas as our Q4 monetization efforts optimized toward clicks.
Regarding the Mozilla deal, we are very pleased with the significant impact it has had to our Search volume share. The Americas region saw Search click-driven revenue increase 20% year-over-year, driven by clicks growing 23%, offset by a PPC decline modestly of 2%. Much of this growth came from the higher TAC distribution partners.
Moving -- now moving to Display. GAAP Display revenue declined 4% and revenue ex-TAC declined 5% year-over-year in the quarter. The GAAP revenue trend showed improvement as we gained revenue momentum from our transformative investments. Our programmatic audience buying platform, YAM Plus, is now globally available, while our native ads continue to show strong growth in the quarter.
Ads sold showed healthy growth in Q4 at 17% as we continue to increase our native and mobile inventory year-over-year. The PPA declined at 20% offset the volume increases in Q4. The year-over-year decline is mainly the result of the mixed shift away from higher price premium inventory.
Native ads continue to grow and accounted for 43% of ads sold in the quarter. Our native ads PPA grew over 20% from Q3 to Q4, driven by improved optimizations of our format and placements.
We closed the acquisition of BrightRoll in the late Q4 and expect positive contributions to our video and display growth in 2015.
The Flurry team continues to execute on mobile advertising, and we look forward to sharing additional plans at our upcoming mobile developer conference next month.
For revenue detail by region, please refer to Slide 10. Americas revenue ex-TAC was flat year-over-year. APAC revenue ex-TAC was down 7%, or 4% on a constant currency basis. And EMEA revenue ex-TAC declined 7%, or 5% on a constant currency basis.
Now moving to expenses. Traffic acquisition costs were up 12% compared to the prior year. The main drivers for this increased TAC were TAC payments for acquired properties and the continued rollout of our Gemini Search platform. Non-GAAP total operating expenses were $923 million for the quarter, which were up 6% versus the prior year. Depreciation and amortization has remained consistent with the past several quarters at approximately $150 million per quarter.
Our cash operating expense was $770 million, an improvement of $30 million versus our expectation and $19 million less than the prior quarter. However, excluding the impact of patent sales from both years, our cash operating expense is up a modest 2% year-over-year.
Workforce continues to drive expenses as we invest in a technical workforce. We have worked hard to find ways to offset our investments with prudent cost initiatives in other areas. For example, in Q4, we realized significant savings in data center efficiencies and continued reduction in contractors and other outside service providers, totaling approximately $40 million.
For GAAP total operating expenses in Q4, stock-based compensation was $103 million, $3 million lower versus prior quarter, and restructuring costs were $33 million, and we had a goodwill impairment charge of $88 million. EBITDA, as I noted, was $409 million in Q4, with a margin of 35% based upon -- based on revenue ex-TAC. And non-GAAP operating income was $256 million for the quarter, resulting in a margin of 22% on a revenue ex-TAC basis.
Quickly running out the income statement. We had a gain of $98 million resulting from our investment in Hortonworks. Earnings and equity interest was $102 million. As a reminder, reduction from last quarter is due to removal of Alibaba earnings and equity interest for our new IPO and is more indicative of the forward look.
Turning to the balance sheet. At the end of the Q4, end of the year, we had $10.2 billion in cash and marketable securities. And as I stated previously, cash taxes related to the Alibaba IPO proceeds are expected to be approximately $3.3 billion and will be paid in Q1. Adjusting for this tax payment and convertible and other debt of $1.3 billion, our net cash balance at the end of the year was approximately $5.7 billion.
The change in cash balance from Q3 to Q4 was primarily driven by free cash flow of $78 million, adversely impacted by working capital movement in the accounting for BrightRoll; acquisitions of $545 million primarily for BrightRoll; and cash utilized for share repurchases activity for the quarter of $1.6 billion.
Now let me cover guidance. As we look to the first quarter of the year and going forward, we are committed to sustainably growing our business. I am pleased with the plans we have in place to drive shareholder value both through our Alibaba investment as well as through our MVNS businesses. We also recognize we have much work ahead to sustainably grow both revenues and profit going forward. Our guidance assumes that we continue to make steady progress on our core business into Q1 and over 2015. We will increase our focus on GAAP revenue, and expect this to lead to growth in revenue ex-TAC as we decide more partnerships and grow our business in BrightRoll and Gemini Search.
In the short term, our guidance accounts for: in the Americas, we brought our new sales leadership and realigned our efforts to some near-term transitionary effects. Additionally, the Olympics in 2014 makes for a tougher comp in Q1. In EMEA, we announced the restructuring of our organization, reducing nearly 1/3 of our headcount, which will lead to longer-term efficiencies, but does pose some near-term challenges. And we expect to be tracking to comparable revenue levels in Asia Pacific, with the exception of foreign exchanges.
Q4 non-GAAP cash expenses were approximately $800 million on a normalized basis. We expect Q1 to be comparable but with the addition of BrightRoll, resulting in a somewhat -- a number somewhat higher.
Looking ahead, we would like to get back to the quarterly range of $800 million or less, inclusive of our recent acquisitions. Specifically, for Q1 guidance, we expect the following: GAAP revenue range of $1.11 billion to $1.15 billion; revenue ex-TAC in the range of $1.02 billion to $1.06 billion; EBITDA in the range of $200 million to $240 million; and non-GAAP operating income in the range of $50 million to $90 million.
We have taken significant steps to deliver shareholder value. We have made progress in our transformative investments to set up a strong platform for growth while continuing to demonstrate our disciplined stewardship of capital. I will now turn it back to Marissa."

If I had to take a look at what I think we need to accomplish in 2015, one, we need better targeting. The more personalized these ads are, their price on a CPC basis, the more clicks we get on those ads, the better they perform for both our advertisers and for us in terms of revenue. We also need to explore additional formats. When we started off with Gemini, we were doing text-only ads. We since have been adding various image ads, now some product ads as well as some video ads. And I think that these new formats are something that has really helped us take the Gemini ads and adapt them into something that's really truly native as we move across different products and platforms. And finally, I also think it's important for us to get distribution since that we don't run Gemini ads nor native ads only on Yahoo and Tumblr, but we also can run them across other sites. And Flurry is a great distribution channel for us here. We're really looking forward to integrating Gemini into the Flurry SDK. So when a new app developer brings to the market a new app, first question they ask is analytics, the next question that they ask is really, how can I make money from my application? And so if we actually have that ad network easily and readily available in the APIs and the Flurry SDK, we think this is an easy way for us to distribute more Gemini ads as well as our BrightRoll video ads. And native and video ads are really the way that people prefer to monetize mobile, particularly apps. And more broadly on the Search reorganization point, we're really excited to have Lisa and Cathy and Kevin onboard. I don't think that the reorganization that we have deployed there in those new hires really changes things with regard to native ads, other than native ads are trends that are here to stay. They're not a big part of our product portfolio. And there's been some adjustment as our sales force has really gotten familiar with the product and understood which advertisers to bring that product to, how to optimize them and ultimately, provide better -- better performance on the campaigns. But we've really made a lot of progress there. And so overall, I think that the re-org, from my viewpoint, is I would say somewhat perpendicular to our progress on native ads. Obviously, I think the team has already done a great job transitioning."

And I guess, Marissa, the question for you is, is this an opportunity for Yahoo to really reengage in Search? There's a lot of turns here, but there's a lot of different directions. Do you want to make much more of an investment push into Search than we've seen from Yahoo in the last 2 or 3 years?"

So we thought, given the different aspects of YJ, the different facts that we have operating relationships with them, joint venture relationships with them, they are non-U.S. therefore, non-SEC registrants.

I would say that overall, what we've seen is the MVNS businesses are not cannibalistic to traditional PC advertising. Generally, these types of advertisers who buy a mobile, video, native or social ad, the type of ad production they need to do, the type of audience they're looking for, the way they want to interact with those users is pretty fundamentally different than banner ads. What we have seen that has been applying pressure and is somewhat cannibalistic to that traditional PC business is the move towards programmatic. And so when an advertisement, for example, moves from being sold through premium channel to a programmatic channel, that certainly causes some cannibalization overall of revenue. And we have seen, particularly on Search, not as much on Display, that when we move a user from a PC search to a mobile search, they do -- that search monetizes at a slightly lower rate. We've been making improvements there, but we still aren't to a point on Search where mobile search has the same revenue per search in, say, a PC search. We're getting closer to that on Display, but I think that overall, in terms of the cannibalistic movement of the MVNS, certainly on the Display side, it's much more about programmatic versus premium."

And one of the reasons we work well with them is because we try to be as flexible in our approach to partnerships as we can be. We really, especially when approaching a search partnership, we acknowledge that these users belong to that distribution partner, and they should be able to present search the way that they really want search ultimately presented. And so we work with the partner, as we did with Mozilla, to redesign the best possible user experience that they feel really suits their users, their value, their environment. And I think overall, we've been really investing in features on top of web search. And so when you look at things like search my world, results may take, for example, data from your email and bring those results right onto your search results page. I've given examples on past calls, like for example, of flight itineraries. It's really great to see those kinds of features on the search results page. And that's something that Yahoo can do reasonably exclusively because of our large base of Yahoo Mail users. And I would also look towards and think about what mobile search should be in the future. Because while we've done a lot to optimize PC search, the place that we're really investing the most is in mobile search. And there, today we have a very traditional HTML-based approach. But we've really been trying to think about how do we do the best possible job answering queries on the phone. And when you look at, for example, acquisitions like Aviate, which is growing nicely, we have that offered as an application, we really think that mobile search should take into much more account your contacts, your location, your particular information. And so we're really hoping, as we push into mobile search, to come up with a more app-based experience and one that suits the mobile area better, and we think that, that's a name that partners will respond to."

We think that the sequential growth in users that we saw on Tumblr is really because we have much better composition tools. If you look back at Tumblr's growth graphs, what you tend to see is every time there's been an improvement in terms of how well you can compose or how well you can present your blog, we saw a real burst in this in mobile. Last year, at Tumblr, we did our mobile app to make composing on the phone much easier and much more beautiful so that you could actually be mobile only. Previously, it was really something where you'd set up your blog on PC and then work on it on mobile. So we know whenever we make changes and improvements to the composition tool there, it not only causes users to use the platform more if they're already on it, but it also attracts new users to it. In terms of mobile usage, we haven't -- I don't have and we haven't just broken out in the past mobile-only users, but I can say that what we have today is more than half of the users on Tumblr use mobile to engage and participate on Tumblr. And we have internal goals this year that are really around trying to grow that number significantly such that most users, the vast majority of users on Tumblr at least engage at some point using mobile. And on the native ads and what it will take to ultimately improve the targeted thing and, therefore, stop the price-per-click erosion. What we've really been doing is accessing more information sources. The more we understand about you, the better job we can do targeting ads towards you. And so over the past year, for example, if you look at our stream on the home page, we use the same targeting technology for those articles as we do for the ads contained therein. And over the past year, we've gotten a lot of new information sources. So for example, the sports teams I follow, the businesses I follow on Yahoo Finance, pulling that data over. And we're also looking for signed-in users, can we access with their permission some of the information coming from Yahoo Mail. These are all things that we are working on as well as retargeting off of other sites. And so these are all areas of investment and each of them has brought with it a gain in native Price-per-Ad. And I should note that we're starting to see this turnaround. Native price -- the native Price-per-Ad actually grew 20% quarter-over-quarter from Q3 to Q4. Gemini really over-performed our expectations in Q4 and that's what really -- we were saying at the end of last -- at the end of Q3 that we had about $0.25 billion business, plus or minus 10%, and we actually closed the year about $300 million of revenue. And that nice upside surprise really was driven in part because of the improvement in Price-per-Ad in Gemini, which is driven by these targeting improvements."

And so that's really where the focus is, how can we get better off-network distribution through Flurry and also how can we improve our engagement on applications that will naturally drive up native, mobile and social on the core Yahoo platform. And on Tumblr, what we are referring to there in terms of 50% of the people who use our dashboard view, who basically blog posts are actually now doing so through the application. And so the audience numbers, that 460 million actually include blog readers as opposed to blog posters. And so there -- we could look at it. It basically maps the overall trend of how much traffic is on PC versus mobile as a whole because, in essence, as a blog reader, you're simply reading a web page and reading that content. We're proud to have that contributor that brought you that Tumblr page on our network. But when we think about mobile users, it's really about the very engaged bloggers that are on Tumblr. And more than half of those are using the app to do their blog posts and to read the dashboard."

The fact that we have basically grown to more than $1.1 billion of revenue and from essentially nothing in just 2 years makes us incredibly proud. So we're really happy with our position overall in terms of how well our applications are performing, how well these new ad formats are performing. I think when I look out across the acquisition space or even what we might allocate people to internally, our goal is we want to make sure that we have at least 1 app for each user and for each user, it might be different, where it's a go-to app. You heard us talk about on past calls that we're really working to grow our daily active users in comparison to monthly active users. We want to have fewer, what we would call in sort of a marketing segmentation exercise, fewer tourists and more fanatics who are using the product all the time. And so when we look across the space of what we might invest in, we look not only at our core competencies in the past, which of course, are around search, communications, digital content and what we might do in that space to really become part of the users' every day. But we also want to think about what is something that we might build or acquire anew? So that could be something ultimately in the messaging space. Obviously, we've had Yahoo Messenger for a number of years. What does that look like in the mobile space? We made some nice small acquisitions in Q4 of MessageMe and Cooliris, both of which have very good technology and just great user interfaces in the messaging space. And so we'd like to see how we might build out our communications offering more there. And that's really what I would say the goal is, how do we get more DAUs and improve our DAU to MAU ratio. And the obvious ways to do that are to build on our core competencies but in particular, to build on communication which of course has a native aspect, a social aspect and a mobile aspect in all parts of today and builds on our strength of email and some of our client base messaging on the PC."

Ken and I are excited to share our Q1 results today as well as our recent developments in our business and our outlook for Q2. For my portion, I'll go over where we are in our transformation as well",3026,"Good afternoon, and welcome to our Q1 earnings livecast. Ken and I are excited to share our Q1 results today as well as our recent developments in our business and our outlook for Q2. For my portion, I'll go over where we are in our transformation as well as recent progress, including our amended partnership with Microsoft, our Search partnership with Mozilla and changes to our cost basis. 
As you know, Yahoo is amidst a multiyear transformation to return an iconic company to greatness. We have said in the past that we anticipated GAAP revenue growth occurring ahead of revenue ex-TAC and EBITDA growth, and that's precisely what we saw this quarter. Our Display revenue grew modestly this quarter, 2% on a GAAP basis. This is the first Q1 growth in Display since 2011. 
Search revenue grew 20% on a GAAP basis. And our overall revenue grew 8% year-over-year on a GAAP basis. For the next phase of the transformation, we will focus on accelerating GAAP revenue growth while balancing costs and enhancing margins and EBITDA. 
For my update today, we will use the framework of our virtuous cycle: people, products, traffic and revenue. We believe with the right people, you build great products that the market responds to, to increase traffic and engagement, leading to greater revenue. This is one of the key operating principles in our transformation and one reason we focus on hiring and retaining the right people and really improving the user experience and product features we offer. 
Starting with people. Today, approximately 11,400 full-time employees and 830 contractors work for the company. This represents a significant sharpening of how we align people to our strategy and priorities. Before I arrived, we had approximately 14,200 employees and 2,800 contractors. Over the past 2 years -- 2.5 years, we have retooled our culture to be extremely performance-oriented, concentrated our efforts in high productivity locations, closing 17 office locations in total, sunset approximately 80 products, reduced the number of contractors by nearly 2,000 and reduced our full-time employee count by nearly 3,000 people, including a recent reduction of about 1,100 full-time employees this past quarter. 
During that same 2.5-year period, we became a mobile-first company, and grew our MaVeNS businesses, referring to mobile, video, native and social from essentially nonexistence to more than $1 billion in annual revenue in 2014. We created beautiful, heavily-engaged native mobile applications, which span everything from Yahoo Mail to News Digest and Weather. And we have added Tumblr, BrightRoll and Flurry to our product portfolio. And revenue streams like our Gemini Native Ad business and Yahoo Ad Manager Plus to evolve our Display ad business. Today, more than half, 51% of our full-time employees are new under this management team. 
And it's safe to say that we really are a new Yahoo, moving with greater purpose, building much more robust and modern products and executing with greater productivity. I want to take a moment to compliment the people here at Yahoo for their resilience throughout these changes and priorities and roles. Although a transformation in this scale is not easy, it's been amazing to see record levels of engagement and energy across the company. Examples include a record 4,000 Yahoos participating directly in user research in Q1, higher engagement and participation in our company meetings like our FYI meetings on Fridays, and of course, resetting the Guinness Book's world record for largest simultaneous [indiscernible] in honor of Yahoo's 20th birthday on March 2.
And interest in working at Yahoo is at an all-time high. In Q1, we received nearly 43,000 applications, 150 for each person we hired and an increase of 47% quarter-over-quarter. In the area of talent, we made perhaps our most important people-related hire, welcoming Brian Power as our SVP of Human Resources. 
Brian joined us from Square and Google and is already doing a tremendous job. In terms of top-notch editorial talent, we hired Jason Collins as our Yahoo Sports NCAA and NBA analyst just in time for March Madness. And we also hired Andy as Editor-in-Chief for Yahoo Finance. Those in the financial community will be very familiar with Andy's background as he previously served as the Managing Editor of Fortune. 
Across-the-board on people, we made outstanding progress and is very important to gain such momentum as we move forward towards growth. Great people build great products, and we pride ourselves on being an indispensable guide to digital information. Being an indispensable guide means focusing on informing, connecting and entertaining our users, which maps to 3 key strategic areas: search, communications and digital content.
On Search, we entered a partnership with Mozilla in November and started to ramp their traffic on our systems in December. Q1 marks the first full quarter of our Mozilla partnership and it was terrific. Mozilla is not only a high-quality deal for us, it is a profitable deal for us. 
For volume and long-term health of the partnership, introducing Mozilla users to and retaining them on Yahoo Search is key. And we surpassed all expectations for new users and retention. We knew this was a landmark deal for both companies. From today's vantage point, we would enter in partnership even more readily. 
In Q1, we saw healthy Search metrics, with Search clicks up 21% and Price-per-Click up 3% and Search growing on a GAAP revenue basis by 20%. Revenue ex-TAC dipped slightly by 3%. Please note though that revenue ex-TAC would have grown modestly if not for a few onetime issues that our acute in Q1. We'll continue to work hard to grow Search on both a GAAP and a revenue ex-TAC basis.
We are excited last week to announce a renewed and amended partnership with Microsoft. This renewed partnership allows us greater flexibility and enhances competitiveness by allowing us to iterate and experiment more with our user experience and monetization. The amended agreement has a 5-year remaining term and is distinct some of the prior arrangement, except that it reduces [indiscernible] our commitments on PC to 51%, addresses the traffic acquisition cost we pay Microsoft on a gross basis rather than a net basis and lets Yahoo call Microsoft for search-only, ads-only or both together, paying a fixed cost rather than a revenue share for items that we discard without Display. 
I'd like to thank Sacha and his team for the very constructive time and attention they dedicated to designing our go-forward partnership. We were very pleased with the renewed relationship, which improves the search experience for users, creates value for advertisers and establishes ongoing stability for partners. We anticipate it will take several quarters to operationalize the new amendment, so our Q2 forecast contemplates the current arrangement.
In terms of our communication products, Yahoo Mail accelerated its velocity, launching tons of new features in the quarter, including custom smart views, on-demand passwords, folder search, enhanced context as well as a few Valentine's Day features like auto-composing at Valentines or Stationary in partnership with Paperless Post. All the while, we focused on improved stability and reducing spam. 
Yahoo Mail continues to be a powerhouse of user retention, both in terms of signed-in users and as a mobile app. In digital content, at the end of Q1, we had 13 Digital Magazines on Yahoo, 3 of which launched in the quarter: TV, politics and autos. We're extremely excited about our digital magazine franchise. In just over 1 year, we created 13 magazines, 5 of which style, beauty, movies, parenting and travel, are #1 in their respective categories according to comScore. 
On the Yahoo homepage, we introduced autoplay video. These videos automatically play without sound. The sound starts only when you mouse over them. Autoplay increased engagement with our home page and caused our average number of daily streams to grow 16% [ph] quarter-over-quarter. In total, worldwide video streams almost doubled quarter-over-quarter, up 89%. 
In the U.S. in particular, video streams grew 262% year-over-year and almost 150% quarter-over-quarter. At the same time, watch time per unique user, which in some instances decreases with autoplay, actually grew 50% quarter-over-quarter. We are gaining traction in video and we plan to do even more here over the course of the year.
We also enhanced our news partnership with ABC. Yahoo News will now collaborate with ABC News on major news events, including the 2016 presidential election, and the ABC Evening News will feature segments by Katie Couric, Yahoo's Global Anchor. Yahoo Your Day will be a new daily feature on Good Morning America, bringing the television Yahoo's top editors and experts from our digital magazines and additional exclusive ABC and Disney content will be available on Yahoo. This expanded coupling nicely brings together ABC's exclusive high-quality content and Yahoo's reach. 
Finally on digital content, let's turn to Sports. For more than 16 years, we've built the best Fantasy Sports experiences for our fans. Our users spend nearly 30 billion minutes a year playing Fantasy Sports on Yahoo, and nearly all of those experiences have involved traditional seasonal and fantasy games. 
Recently, there is a rising trend around daily fantasy Games. We believe this is an area where Yahoo can and should compete. Over the past year, we have been working hard to create our daily fantasy offering, a unique take on this game's genre to bolster our leadership in Fantasy Sports. Normally, we do not announce products before launch, but this has been such an area of interest for our fantasy players and for our investors that we wanted to announce that we have a new daily fantasy offering in the works that will launch this summer.
Tumblr continues to drive incredible growth, and we continue to be aggressive and thoughtful in our approach to monetization. Today, more than 360 of the world's top brands not only blog on Tumblr but also advertise and spend on the platform, up approximately 13% quarter-over-quarter. Most notably, we launched our Creators Network in Q1, which lets friends find incredible Tumblr artists and bloggers to commission unique content. And we saw immediate traction there with more than 35 brands spending on creators to date.
Turning to Flurry, we continue to see strong adoption. The number of applications that include the Flurry software development kit has surpassed 700,000. In February, we hosted our first Yahoo Mobile Developer Conference. It was attended by over 1,000 developers whose applications are collectively used for 2 billion hours each month. 
At the conference, we launched the Yahoo Mobile Developer Suite to help developers measure, monetize, advertise and improve their applications. Highlights of our new developer offering include a powerful new Explorer interface for our widely adopted Flurry Analytics, the integration of native ads powered by Yahoo Gemini and Yahoo Search in Apps, extending our own Search capabilities to any app developer. 
The conference was well received by the developer community and exemplified Yahoo's technical and commercial leadership in mobile. In the first 5 weeks since the conference, Yahoo Search in Apps had been launched in partner applications that reach more than 60 million users. And a number of top-tier publishers, including Tango, have integrated our native ads with strong revenue momentum. Yahoo is investing passionately in the developer ecosystem to improve the quality and the monetization of our partners' applications.
Finally, over the last quarter, we worked hard to integrate BrightRoll and made excellent progress. We now have Yahoo demographic and behavioral data integrated into the BrightRoll marketplace along with Yahoo-owned and operated video inventory and Flurry marketplace video inventory. 
Next, let's turn to traffic. Most notably in Q1, we hit more than 600 million monthly active users on Mobile, more than 20% growth year-over-year. With more than 1 billion users across desktop and mobile in total, Yahoo's transformation to being a mobile-first company is apparent. 
Tumblr traffic continues to grow. The Tumblr audience is approaching the 0.5 billion mark, with an audience of more than 474 million monthly people. And we saw tremendous mobile engagement with users on the mobile app up more than 10% quarter-over-quarter.
Moving from people, products and traffic to revenue. We are hard at work on monetizing our products and traffic to drive revenue. Yahoo Gemini's native ad offering has continued growing tremendously, delivering terrific value to advertisers. 
Last year across all 4 quarters, Yahoo Gemini native made more than $250 million. In Q1 alone, Gemini native ads made $110 million. We could not be more thrilled with our bet on native ads and how well it is working for the company. Our native ads, of course, are foundational to our mobile monetization. This quarter, we saw mobile gross revenue of $391 million and GAAP revenue of $234 million, representing growth of 61% year-over-year on a GAAP basis. We are proud of being a mobile-first company, and we will continue to work hard to grow our engagement with new mobile products and features to drive mobile forward.
Now let's broaden from Mobile and Native to take a look at MaVeNS, which also includes not only Mobile and Native but also video and social. Our Q1 MaVeNS GAAP revenue was $363 million, up 58% year-over-year. We are well on track for a substantial MaVeNS growth in 2015. 
BrightRoll has been integrating and growing nicely on the video front. And on the social front, Tumblr has continued to grow users and time spent, and we remain committed and optimistic about our annual goal of $100 million in revenue. With such a passionate user community behind the growth of this product, we're being thoughtful in our approach to monetization and advertisers are responding. 
As I've talked about before, our MaVeNS strategy is core to our growth because it counteracts declines in our legacy businesses as we reinvent in new more modern Yahoo. We'll continue to grow these business lines as fast as we can. 
Turning now to legacy -- to our legacy business. We continue to see steep year-over-year declines in premium and programmatic PC advertising. This has accelerated in Q4 and Q1 where we have seen more than $100 million of decline in each quarter. Our premium advertising declined 40% year-over-year, mostly due to the decline in sales but directly to our properties. 
Audience declined 19% year-over-year due to lower prices paid per ad through programmatic pricing. We continue to do everything we can to stabilize and slow this decline, but new more attractive formats like mobile, native and video are key to offsetting it. 
Yahoo Ad Manager Plus is an important element in modernizing our legacy PC Display business and creating continuity with MaVeNS. The majority of our audience business globally now runs on YAM Plus, and the platform continues to scale well to support business needs. Advertisers not only can buy ads across traditional display native and video but also across mobile and desktop on YAM Plus, and they have the ability to use it on a self-serve basis for greater visibility and control over their campaigns. 
Finally, on revenue, let's look at our Display metrics. Given the increasing financial contribution from our Affiliate business, our Display metrics have been updated to be more comprehensive over our entire business, including all countries where we operate and the network beyond our Yahoo properties. 
Over the quarter, Display ads sold grew 29% as we continue to build our Native and Mobile inventory and added inventory from the BrightRoll network. Display PPA declined 17%, driven by declines in our audience Price-per-Ad as well as unfavorable mix shifts. 
Before I hand over to Ken to discuss our financial results, I want to touch on capital allocation. As you know, the company prioritizes and is exceptionally proud of being a good steward of capital. To date, we have returned $9.4 billion to shareholders over my tenure, delivering well beyond any public commitments we have made and reducing our share count by nearly 22%. 
We expect in Q4 this year that our shareholders will see a historic return of capital through the tax-efficient spinoff of our remaining Alibaba stake. Following the announcement of our planned Alibaba spin, shareholders have expressed interest in how we will handle our stake in Yahoo Japan. 
To prioritize value and tax efficiencies around our Alibaba stake and to reduce complexity around the planned spin, we were advised to not place our Yahoo Japan stake into the proposed SpinCo. That said, we do prioritize maximizing the value of our Yahoo Japan holdings for our shareholders. We have retained advisers to determine the most promising opportunities to maximize value and is currently a key priority to explore those options thoroughly. 
As with the proposed Alibaba spin, the options for our Yahoo Japan investment require careful study. Our joint venture with Softbank is a nearly 20-year-old multinational, multijurisdictional licensing and operating arrangement, over which both Yahoo and Softbank maintain certain approval rights. When we have more to share on our plan for Yahoo Japan, we will do so on future earnings calls.
We also look rigorously at assets on our balance sheet to find opportunities to free up capital and produce revenue. As one of the Internet's industry -- Internet industry's pioneering companies, Yahoo and its innovative employees have developed a valuable intellectual property portfolio. We have been and will continue to look for sensible ways to realize the value of those assets. 
For example, within the past 2 years, we've secured patent sales or licenses worth nearly $600 million, all without litigation. We're proud of our efforts to date and will continue look for ways to realize the value of our intellectual property investment. 
Pursuing these types of opportunities has helped us invest in the business and build for the long term. As our shareholders know, all of our M&A activity to date during my tenure, about $2.1 billion [ph] has been funded through our own free cash flow. We will continue to be vigilant about thoughtfully returning capital to our shareholders, whether it be through share repurchases, spinoffs, monetizing previously unmonetized assets or through return on invested capital. 
Overall, I'm very pleased with the progress we have made on people, products, traffic and revenue. And I will now hand over to Ken to address the financial elements in more detail."
91800,290250071,791444,"Yahoo! Inc., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2015",2015-04-21,"Earnings Calls","Altaba Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Marissa, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. I plan to cover a summary of our first quarter and several of the pressing topics on the minds of our top shareholders. We also [indiscernible] financial results, overall, we met our financia",1933,"Thanks, Marissa, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. I plan to cover a summary of our first quarter and several of the pressing topics on the minds of our top shareholders. We also [indiscernible] financial results, overall, we met our financial guidance and expectations, including in the areas of management cost and headcount. 
It's also important that we achieve sustainable GAAP revenue growth this year, ultimately leading to revenue ex-TAC growth. I am confident that our team is up to this challenge. 
Let me talk about 4 points of progress I want to refer to: first, on the SpinCo update, we are pleased with the progress to date against our internal milestones and timelines for the proposed spinoff transaction for Alibaba shares. We have submitted requests for a Private Letter Ruling to the IRS. We continue to work toward our previously announced Q4 target for completion of the transaction. And a number of actions remain to be completed, including selecting the board and management team, determining capital structure, divesting Yahoo Small Business, obtaining favorable tax opinions, filings with the SEC and satisfaction of other closing conditions. 
Our board and management team remain extremely focused on completing this transaction and tax-efficiently distributing potentially $32 billion of value to our shareholders, which is usually Monday's closing Alibaba share price.
Second on capital allocation. In Q1, we increased our stock buyback program by an additional $2 billion, bringing the outstanding authorization to $2.7 billion. We will be thoughtful and opportunistic in our buyback activity in light of the anticipated spinoff transaction time to ensure appropriate flexibility in the business and optimized long-term value creation for Yahoo's shareholders.
As noted in this management team, we have demonstrated a strong and disciplined track record of capital allocation. Our significant buyback activity of 327 million shares totaling $9.4 billion since July 2012 represents a 27% gross reduction in our initial share base. With an initial purchase price of $28.64, this has been extremely accretive to our shareholders. And our ending diluted share count was also 948 million, down approximately 22% under this management team.
When factoring in the potential $32 billion of value from the proposed spinoff transaction and the stock buyback since 2012, this management team post-spin will have distributed as much as $41 billion of value to its shareholders, truly a historic amount for a company our size. 
In addition, we have the stock buyback authorization of $2.7 billion, additional value and cash flow created from our ongoing IP monetization efforts to patent licensing and patent sales of nearly $600 million over the past 2 years and cash settlement of yen hedges of nearly 540 million [ph] since 2012 has further supported our buyback activity. 
We expect additional monetization here as we explore our reasonable opportunities. And over the same period of time, we spent $2.1 billion on M&A, which means we returned over 4x the amount of cash to our shareholders through buybacks as a cash used for acquisitions over the same time period. 
And as we shift our business forward to our growth areas, we will continue our focused and disciplined approach to M&A that aligns with our strategic priorities. 
Third, EBITDA and cost. We are tightly managing our headcount and overall cost structure as EBITDA remains a key measurement for us. As Marissa mentioned, we took actions to optimize functions, remove inefficiencies and align resources to help focus our organizations on top priorities. Our current headcount figure of around 11,400 declined approximately 1,100 versus Q4, resulting in an improved cost base as our non-GAAP cash expenses were $9 million lower than our expectations for the quarter. 
With our contractors also reduced 830, our total headcount has reduced from nearly 17,000 before this team arrived to approximately 12,200 today, down 28% and especially noteworthy as this is inclusive of acquisitions we have made. 
While our operating costs increased somewhat over time, it is important to understand that our historical expenses benefited from capitalized labor and other reimbursements totaling between $200 million and $300 million in 2011 and 2012 that are relatively minimal today. We will continue to actively manage our cost base to sustainably grow profitability and EBITDA over time.
Fourth, regarding Yahoo Japan, you have heard from Marissa our expectations and plans there. And as noted, we remain focused on maximizing value of our stake. 
Then in summary, as a management team, we are relentlessly focused on transforming the company and are driving long-term value creation. We have consistently delivered significant shareholder value through our asset monetization strategies, capital allocation decisions and operational -- operating efficiency improvements. We remain steadfast in our commitment to deliver value to our shareholders and return our company to growth. We also recognize and are mindful that we have much more work ahead of us and are more committed than ever to take the necessary actions to grow both top and bottom lines.
With that, let's run through our first quarter financial results. Once again, I will focus most of the discussion around non-GAAP results, which excludes stock-based compensation expense of $116 million. Restructuring expenses this quarter are $51 million and a $12 million noncash loss on our [indiscernible], which are marked to market each quarter. 
While we exclude stock-based compensation from our non-GAAP financial results, we do take the stock dilution seriously, including shares granted and the resulting compensation expense. As a reminder, you can find complete reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP results in our earnings slides on our Investor Relations website.
I'll also limit my discussion here to the more salient points for the quarter and thus somewhat briefer than my prior prepared remarks. Our financial highlights for Q1 can be seen on Slide 5. GAAP revenue was $1.226 billion, up 8% in the other midpoint of our guidance after adjusting for the Mozilla TAC. 
Based on the terms of the agreement, including becoming the default search provider, we have concluded that revenues from Mozilla traffic will be recognized on a gross basis. As a result, the payments to Mozilla are reflected in TAC. Revenue ex-TAC was $1.043 billion, down 4% year-over-year and above the midpoint of our guidance. Excluding FX impacts, revenue ex-TAC was down 2% year-over-year. 
Traffic acquisition costs were up $137 million, approximately 300% compared to the prior year due to our Mozilla partnership, BrightRoll and Mobile syndication. 
Now taking a close look at Search. GAAP search revenue was $532 million, up 20% year-over-year. Search revenue ex-TAC declined 3%. And overall, we saw increases in partner revenue shares in the quarter that out past -- outpaced our click-driven revenue growth, resulting in a decline in revenue ex-TAC. 
The Americas region search ex-TAC revenue declined 1% in the quarter driven by revenue share payments to our major distribution partners such as Mozilla. Excluding onetime items in the RPS guarantee, which is being lapped this quarter from Q1 '14, America search revenue ex-TAC would have been up 4%. International search revenues ex-TAC declined 9% year-over-year, but excluding foreign exchange headwinds, international search revenue ex-TAC would be flat. 
Now moving to Display. GAAP Display revenue was $463 million, up 2% year-over-year, the first GAAP revenue growth in Q1 Display since 2011. Display revenue ex-TAC declined 7% year-over-year as a result of the declines in legacy Display business. And as we said previously, we expect to see growth in GAAP revenues first ultimately into growth in revenue ex-TAC.
In our MaVeNS businesses of mobile, video, native and social, we continue to see strong performance with 58% GAAP revenue growth year-over-year for those areas in aggregate. MaVeNS now contributes 33% to our traffic-driven revenue, up from 22% from the prior year. 
Mobile GAAP revenue grew 61% year-over-year, driven by strong Mobile Display growth from our native ad formats and Affiliate business. In Q1, we announced at our Mobile Developer Conference an enhanced analytics and monetization platform to improve revenue opportunities for app developers and ecosystem at large. 
And Native revenue continued to grow with over $110 million in the quarter driven by volume growth and syndication. We also completed the migration of the Flurry advertising business to the Gemini platform. 
Now let's take a couple of minutes to go through our expenses and income in a bit more detail. Non-GAAP total operating expenses were up 3% versus prior year. DNA has remained consistent over the past several quarters at approximately $150 million. Our noncash -- non-GAAP cash expenses, inclusive of BrightRoll for the first quarter, were better than prior expectations at $811 million, up $31 million year-over-year, primarily driven by increases in workforce expense and our growth businesses. As Marissa shared, headcount is now at 11,400, reflecting our diligent management of resources and operating expenses with the goals of increasing profitability and EBITDA over time.
EBITDA was $231 million in Q1, with a margin of 22% based on [indiscernible] revenue ex-TAC. The year-over-year revenue decline is a result of lower revenue ex-TAC and additional costs resulting from growth in investments.
Non-GAAP operating income was $80 million for the quarter. Rounding out the income statement, earnings and equity interest were $100 million, down 67% year-over-year. As a reminder, this now relates primarily to Yahoo Japan, while the prior year included Alibaba earnings and equity interest. It has been relatively consistent over a number of quarters. 
Non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.15, down 60% [ph] year-over-year. Our Q1 average fully diluted share count decreased year-over-year by 8% as noted to 948 million shares. It was down approximately 15 million from Q4. 
Now let me turn to the balance sheet. At the end of Q1, we had $6.9 billion in cash and marketable securities, following the taxes paid in Q1 related to the Alibaba IPO. Our $5.6 billion net of our convertible debt and other debt. Our Alibaba investment was $32 billion, reflecting the stock price at the end of Q1 as this is marked to market. The change in cash balance from Q4 to Q1 was primarily driven by: reported free cash flow of negative $3 billion, resulting from the settlement of $3.3 billion in taxes related to the Alibaba IPO; acquisition of the $23 million and cash utilized for share repurchase activity for the quarter was $204 million.
This completes our commitment to return at least half of the after-tax Alibaba IPO proceeds to shareholders. However, we repurchased over 3 billion [ph] of our shares. 
Now let me cover guidance. Our guidance assumes that we continue to make steady progress on our revenue growth and EBITDA into Q2. We will continue to drive GAAP revenue growth and expect this to lead to growth in revenue ex-TAC as we execute successfully on our growth plans. 
Looking ahead and taking account the actions we have taken, we expect to lower non-GAAP cash expense to a quarterly range of approximately $780 million. And we will continue executing on efficiencies throughout the organization. 
Please note that earnings and equity interest has historically been approximately $100 million each quarter when excluding the impact of Alibaba. For Q2 guidance, we expect the following: GAAP revenue range of $1.21 billion to $1.25 billion; revenue ex-TAC in the range of $1.01 billion to $1.05 billion; adjusted EBITDA in the range of $240 million to $260 million; and non-GAAP operating income in the range of $90 million to $110 million. 
Thanks again for your time. In closing, we remain committed on transforming the company on driving long-term value for our shareholders and are more committed than ever to taking the necessary actions. And with that, Marissa and I will be glad to take your questions."

And so that's really where we've been putting a lot of our innovation on the user search experience side. On the monetization side, as people are familiar with, we've had our Gemini platform that's now been live for more than 1 year. And we've actually been monetizing a percentage of our mobile traffic through Gemini already to date. And now the new agreement with Microsoft allows us to do more of that both on mobile and some on PC. And so that's really where I think we see the innovation. We believe that people respond to great search but what great search means is changing. And that's really where we want to play. And it has a different profile in terms of investment than classic web search does."

We do assess and build models for each partnership we look at as to whether or not they can way we achieve profitability there. And this quarter, while it was a slight disappointment to see Search ex-TAC slip year-over-year by 3%, it was really more attributable to the acute things that we felt in Q1 like the Search revenue guarantee being lapped. And so we anticipate that we'll be able to see greater revenue growth on Search on both a GAAP basis and ideally an ex-TAC basis over the course of the year regardless of the different partnerships that are added."

So I really don't want to add to that to create speculation. Relative to EBITDA, we have actually gone to approach of guiding 1 quarter. I do think we are taking actions from an expense point of view that we'll have a significant impact from Q1 to Q2 in expense. Obviously, we're very mindful of a couple of things: one is of EBITDA itself and driving expense as we know we certainly control expense. And as we watch the turnaround, if you will, from growing GAAP revenue to is the time for ex-TAC revenue, then obviously that will -- have a much bigger impact on EBITDA. But right now, I don't want to go much further than Q2 in terms of -- and just really state that expenses in headcount are clearly in our minds right now."

We see opportunities to take some of our new acquisitions like Tumblr or Flurry or BrightRoll into these markets Tumblr obviously being an end-user product but Flurry really benefiting a lot of end user products and BrightRoll on the video ad network side. And so we're looking at how can we take some of those investments we've made and really help -- use them to help us achieve the footprint we want internationally. And as to the monetization gap between Microsoft and Google, I think it's really hard for us to speculate. I think it is very clear that there is still is a gap, but I wouldn't want to talk about trending over time. I think that's really for those 2 companies to reveal in their metrics."

My earlier comment is that I really think that there are 2 types of products that are developed -- that are emerging. There's classic web Search, call it deep reference web search, which is classic Google Search, Bing Search. And there's a new class of products that's really arising with Cortana, Siri, Google Now. And those products are really heavily differentiated both from each other as well as from the historic legacy products. And so that's really where we see an opportunity to play. It's something that's mobile and as moves to, for example, the watch and onto television screens and video, we think that there's a really interesting place to play there to help people make better sense of the content they already have access to, content in their mail, using more context to actually provide higher-quality results. I've given examples of things that, for example, searching for JFK producing my boarding pass and the gate number on a search results page en route to the airport rather than producing the John F. Kennedy page use an example like that in previous calls. But that's really where we see a big opportunity. And the profile for searching people's personal information, pulling in contacts, searching entities and making search more action-oriented is a very different problem than crawling 1 trillion or more URLs and perfectly ordering millions of results. And we think that, that's something that's potentially more relevant to users of technology as we move forward. And that's really where we're excited to invest, and that's why we've worked on things like Aviate, like Search My World we have been making business there and the like to do more with them. And that's what I'm referring to the classic web has a different cost profile than that future-oriented mobile search is more personal. And what was the second part of your question?"

And so I think that we feel like we've hit an inflection point on GAAP growth, and we're going to continue to try and see that trend through. And we're working very hard to return -- for example, Display to growth over the course of 2015. We want 2015 in Display to be a growth year over 2014. We think that we can achieve that. And on the management team structure, I think it was more than actually probably as merited. As you'll note, actually, all the executives are were already in the company so a little bit more innovate reshuffle. The structure that I put in place when I arrived here 2.5 years ago, had really just gotten to a point where some of the lines between different organizations were just not drawn in the most efficient way. We want to, for example, take our Mobile organization that have grown so nicely and name for themselves and native applications and really take their efforts and those teams in place them such that the Mobile Mail app works directly with the Yahoo Mail PC team and so and so forth for Homepage & Verticals and overall was a good change that infuse a lot of Mobile energy into the company. And I also think that allows us to focus on areas of the MaVeNS, including video moving forward, where we really like to see more growth and we see more opportunity. And so that's really what those management changes were about. But they were more evolutionary than radical from my viewpoint and inside the company."

But it made the dynamics in the partnership somewhat strained. And so we basically said, ""Look, these are deals we're entering into. We want to take responsibility for the full gross revenue, and it makes sense for the revenue share to be built off of that."" And so that's really why we made that adjustment. And in terms of ad sales, but we have really talented ad sales team here.

Native, as I mentioned, is [indiscernible] growth pace, $110 million in Q1 alone. And overall, the ecosystem is performing really well. We have -- we haven't quantified it but we certainly have thousands of advertisers in Gemini. They're incredibly well-targeted ads because those ads are great for advertisers because they can create them really easily. They're text ads, they can have a picture or not, and you can actually quantify the return on investment really easily because you pay on a cost-per-click model. One of the things to recognize is we actually lever that back from a cost per click revenue to a CPM when you put it into our Display metrics. And so it does change a bit there. But in both counts, both on a Price-per-Click model paid by the advertiser or on a Price-per-Ad model, Gemini is actually nicely up year-over-year in terms of the pricing. The intent -- we see that trend continuing throughout the year. And so implies a really vibrant marketplace. The one place where we pricing pressure is in our programmatic sector, where we see a lot of advertiser demand both for native and for programmatic advertising. And that programmatic ad marketplace is very efficient in terms of targeting and placing ads in favor of the advertiser, which we think is great. It delivers good value, but it has put increased pricing pressure on our programmatic ads and implicitly the premium ads that are moving into the programmatic sector."

And that means essentially hiring people to work on new products and new revenue streams and making those hires inside the company. And our goals with this remix, we really want to find a way to work more productively and with greater efficiency and excellence. And I really think that with this current footprint, we are more streamlined and we've made ourselves a lot more efficient. I think the more notable thing is aside from the headcount overall changes to the number, we've actually done a lot of reallocations inside the company to make sure that we have people focused on what's new and what's going to help us build and grow over time. And if I had to look at the company when I arrived, we quantified, it was about [ph] 17,000 people working on that business. Today, if I had to estimate, I think we probably have less than 1/3 of that, somewhere between 5,000 and 6,000 people that are working on those legacy businesses even in terms of partial times, sum together de-duplicated because we've added so much to the business, be it from Digital Magazines or Gemini ads over Search efforts to our acquisitions to mobile to video. And all those pieces are new things that we're doing. In addition, we've certainly done some shutdowns of some of our legacy operations. But it's really been about remixing and pivoting the company to not only operate efficiently and with excellence but really get focused on that future that we built for ourselves. I mean, the big task when we got to Yahoo was saying, ""Okay, we have several revenue streams that are in decline."" In fact, most of the revenue streams were in decline. And that meant that we had to build ourselves a future, one that was growing fast enough at scale and would grow long enough to really build the future to move into. That's what represents for us. And so making sure that we have the majority of our team. And I think [indiscernible] at about half really focused on how do we bring our product offerings that are supported by MaVeNS as well as the MaVeNS offerings forward to the future and make sure that they're well staffed. That's one of the things that keeps me up at night and I do think that the headcount changes were overall well-done and complement the team for how they are executing, how they were received. The bigger piece has been changing the priorities to really put that future in focus."

Ken and I are excited to share our Q1 results today as well as our recent developments in our business and our outlook for Q2. For my portion, I'll go over where we are in our transformation as well",3037,"Good afternoon, and welcome to our Q1 earnings livecast. Ken and I are excited to share our Q1 results today as well as our recent developments in our business and our outlook for Q2. For my portion, I'll go over where we are in our transformation as well as recent progress, including our amended partnership with Microsoft, our Search partnership with Mozilla and changes to our cost bases.
As you know, Yahoo is amidst a multiyear transformation to return an iconic company to greatness. We have said in the past that we anticipated GAAP revenue growth occurring ahead of revenue ex-TAC and EBITDA growth, and that's precisely what we saw this quarter. Our Display revenue grew modestly this quarter, 2% on a GAAP basis. This is the first Q1 growth in Display since 2011. Search revenue grew 20% on a GAAP basis. And our overall revenue grew 8% year-over-year on a GAAP basis. For the next phase of the transformation, we will focus on accelerating GAAP revenue growth while balancing costs and enhancing margins and EBITDA.
For my update today, we will use the framework of our virtuous cycle: people, products, traffic and revenue. We believe with the right people, you build great products that the market responds to, to increase traffic and engagement, leading to greater revenue. This is one of the key operating principles in our transformation and one reason we focus on hiring and retaining the right people and really improving the user experience and product features we offer. 
Starting with people. Today, approximately 11,400 full-time employees and 830 contractors work for the company. This represents a significant sharpening of how we align people to our strategy and priorities. Before I arrived, we had approximately 14,200 employees and 2,800 contractors. Over the past 2 years -- 2.5 years, we have retooled our culture to be extremely performance-oriented, concentrated our efforts in high productivity locations, closing 17 office locations in total, sunset approximately 80 products, reduced the number of contractors by nearly 2,000 and reduced our full-time employee count by nearly 3,000 people, including a recent reduction of about 1,100 full-time employees this past quarter.
During that same 2.5-year period, we became a mobile-first company and grew our Mavens businesses, referring to mobile, video, native and social, from essentially nonexistence to more than $1 billion in annual revenue in 2014. We created beautiful, heavily engaged native mobile applications, which span everything from Yahoo Mail to News Digest and Weather. And we have added Tumblr, BrightRoll and Flurry to our product portfolio and invented and grew new revenue streams like our Gemini native ad business and Yahoo Ad Manager Plus to evolve our Display ad business. Today, more than half, 51%, of our full-time employees are new under this management team. And it's safe to say that we really are a new Yahoo, moving with greater purpose, building much more robust and modern products and executing with greater productivity. 
I want to take a moment to compliment the people here at Yahoo for their resilience throughout these changes in priorities and roles. Although a transformation in this scale is not easy, it's been amazing to see record levels of engagement and energy across the company. Examples include a record 4,000 Yahoos participating directly in user research in Q1, higher engagement and participation in our company meetings like our FYI meetings on Fridays, and of course, resetting the Guinness Book's world record for largest simultaneous yodel in honor of Yahoo's 20th birthday on March 2.
And interest in working at Yahoo is at an all-time high. In Q1, we received nearly 43,000 applications, 150 for each person we hired and an increase of 47% quarter-over-quarter. In the area of talent, we made perhaps our most important people-related hire, welcoming Bryan Power as our SVP of Human Resources. Bryan joined us from Square and Google and is already doing a tremendous job. In terms of top-notch editorial talent, we hired Jason Collins as our Yahoo Sports NCAA and NBA analyst just in time for March Madness. And we also hired Andy Serwer as Editor-in-Chief for Yahoo Finance. Those in the financial community will be very familiar with Andy's background as he previously served as the Managing Editor of Fortune.
Across the board on people, we made outstanding progress, and it's very important to gain such momentum as we move forward towards growth. Great people build great products, and we pride ourselves on being an indispensable guide to digital information. Being an indispensable guide means focusing on informing, connecting and entertaining our users, which maps to 3 key strategic areas: search, communications and digital content.
On Search, we entered a partnership with Mozilla in November and started to ramp their traffic on our systems in December. Q1 marks the first full quarter of our Mozilla partnership and it was terrific. Mozilla is not only a high-quality deal for us. It is a profitable deal for us. For volume and long-term health of the partnership, introducing Mozilla users to and retaining them on Yahoo Search is key. And we surpassed all expectations for new users and retention. We knew this was a landmark deal for both companies. From today's vantage point, we would enter the partnership even more readily. 
In Q1, we saw healthy Search metrics, with Search clicks up 21% and Price-per-Click up 3% and Search growing on a GAAP revenue basis by 20%. Revenue ex-TAC dipped slightly by 3%. Please note though that revenue ex-TAC would have grown modestly if not for a few onetime issues that are acute in Q1. We will continue to work hard to grow Search on both a GAAP and a revenue ex-TAC basis.
We were excited last week to announce a renewed and amended partnership with Microsoft. This renewed partnership allows us greater flexibility and enhances competitiveness by allowing us to iterate and experiment more with our user experience and monetization. The amended agreement has a 5-year remaining term and is distinctly similar to the prior arrangement except that it reduces our exclusivity commitments on PC to 51%, addresses the traffic acquisition cost we pay Microsoft on a gross basis rather than a net basis and lets Yahoo call on Microsoft for search only, ads only or both together, paying a fixed cost rather than a revenue share for items that we discard without Display.
I'd like to thank Satya and his team for the very constructive time and attention they dedicated to designing our go-forward partnership. We were very pleased with the renewed relationship, which improves the search experience for users, creates value for advertisers and establishes ongoing stability for partners. We anticipate it will take several quarters to operationalize the new amendment, so our Q2 forecast contemplates the current arrangement.
In terms of our communication products, Yahoo Mail accelerated its velocity, launching tons of new features in the quarter, including custom Smart Views, on-demand passwords, folder search, enhanced contacts as well as a few Valentine's Day features like auto-composing at Valentines or stationery in partnership with Paperless Post. All the while, we focused on improved stability and reducing spam.  Yahoo Mail continues to be a powerhouse of user retention, both in terms of signed-in users and as a mobile app. 
In digital content, at the end of Q1, we had 13 digital magazines on Yahoo, 3 of which launched in the quarter: TV, Politics and Autos. We're extremely excited about our digital magazine franchise. In just over 1 year, we created 13 magazines, 5 of which, Style, Beauty, Movies, Parenting and Travel, are #1 in their respective categories according to comScore.
On the Yahoo homepage, we introduced autoplay video. These videos automatically play without sound. The sound starts only when you mouse over them. Autoplay increased engagement with our homepage and caused our average number of daily streams to grow 16% quarter-over-quarter. In total, worldwide video streams almost doubled quarter-over-quarter, up 89%. In the U.S. in particular, video streams grew 262% year-over-year and almost 150% quarter-over-quarter. At the same time, watch time per unique user, which in some instances decreases with autoplay, actually grew 50% quarter-over-quarter. We are gaining traction in video and we plan to do even more here over the course of the year.
We also enhanced our news partnership with ABC. Yahoo News will now collaborate with ABC News on major news events, including the 2016 presidential election, and the ABC Evening News will feature segments by Katie Couric, Yahoo's Global Anchor. Yahoo Your Day will be a new daily feature on Good Morning America, bringing to television Yahoo's top editors and experts from our digital magazines, and additional exclusive ABC and Disney content will be available on Yahoo. This expanded coupling nicely brings together ABC's exclusive high-quality content and Yahoo's reach.
Finally on digital content, let's turn to Sports. For more than 16 years, we've built the best Fantasy Sports experiences for our fans. Our users spend nearly 30 billion minutes a year playing Fantasy Sports on Yahoo, and nearly all of those experiences have involved traditional, seasonal and fantasy games. Recently, there is a rising trend around daily fantasy games. We believe this is an area where Yahoo can and should compete. Over the past year, we have been working hard to create our daily fantasy offering, a unique take on this game genre to bolster our leadership in Fantasy Sports. Normally, we do not announce products before launch, but this has been such an area of interest for our fantasy players and for our investors that we wanted to announce that we have a new daily fantasy offering in the works that will launch this summer.
Tumblr continues to drive incredible growth, and we continue to be aggressive and thoughtful on our approach to monetization. Today, more than 360 of the world's top brands not only blog on Tumblr but also advertise and spend on the platform, up approximately 13% quarter-over-quarter. Most notably, we launched our Creatrs Network in Q1, which lets friends find incredible Tumblr artists and bloggers to commission unique content. And we saw immediate traction there with more than 35 brands spending on creators to date.
Turning to Flurry. We continue to see strong adoption. The number of applications that include the Flurry software development kit has surpassed 700,000. In February, we hosted our first Yahoo Mobile Developer Conference. It was attended by over 1,000 developers whose applications are collectively used for 2 billion hours each month.
At the conference, we launched the Yahoo Mobile Developer Suite to help developers measure, monetize, advertise and improve their applications. Highlights of our new developer offering include a powerful new Explorer interface for our widely adopted Flurry Analytics, the integration of native ads powered by Yahoo Gemini and Yahoo Search in Apps, extending our own Search capabilities to any app developer.
The conference was well received by the developer community and exemplified Yahoo's technical and commercial leadership in mobile. In the first 5 weeks since the conference, Yahoo Search in Apps has been launched in partner applications that reach more than 60 million users. And a number of top-tier publishers, including Tango, have integrated our native ads with strong revenue momentum. Yahoo is investing passionately in the developer ecosystem to improve the quality and the monetization of our partners' applications.
Finally, over the last quarter, we worked hard to integrate BrightRoll and made excellent progress. We now have Yahoo demographic and behavioral data integrated into the BrightRoll marketplace along with Yahoo-owned and operated video inventory and Flurry marketplace video inventory.
Next, let's turn to traffic. Most notably in Q1, we hit more than 600 million monthly active users on Mobile, more than 20% growth year-over-year. With more than 1 billion users across desktop and mobile in total, Yahoo's transformation to being a mobile-first company is apparent.
Tumblr traffic continues to grow. The Tumblr audience is approaching the 0.5 billion mark, with an audience of more than 474 million monthly people. And we saw tremendous mobile engagement with users on the mobile app, up more than 10% quarter-over-quarter.
Moving from people, products and traffic to revenue. We are hard at work on monetizing our products and traffic to drive revenue. Yahoo Gemini's native ad offering has continued growing tremendously, delivering terrific value to advertisers.
Last year, across all 4 quarters, Yahoo Gemini native made more than $0.25 billion. In Q1 alone, Gemini native ads made $110 million. We could not be more thrilled with our bet on native ads and how well it is working for the company. Our native ads, of course, are foundational to our mobile monetization. This quarter, we saw mobile gross revenue of $391 million and GAAP revenue of $234 million, representing growth of 61% year-over-year on a GAAP basis. We are proud of being a mobile-first company, and we will continue to work hard to grow our engagement with new mobile products and features to drive mobile forward.
Now let's broaden from mobile and native to take a look at Mavens, which also includes not only mobile and native but also video and social. Our Q1 Mavens GAAP revenue was $363 million, up 58% year-over-year. We are well on track for a substantial Mavens growth in 2015.
BrightRoll has been integrating and growing nicely on the video front. And on the social front, Tumblr has continued to grow users and time spent, and we remain committed and optimistic about our annual goal of $100 million in revenue. With such a passionate user community behind the growth of this product, we're being thoughtful in our approach to monetization, and advertisers are responding.
As I've talked about before, our Mavens strategy is core to our growth because it counteracts declines in our legacy businesses as we reinvent in new, more modern Yahoo. We will continue to grow these business lines as fast as we can. 
Turning now to legacy -- to our legacy business. We continue to see steep year-over-year declines in premium and programmatic PC advertising. This has accelerated in Q4 and Q1 where we have seen more than $100 million of decline in each quarter. Our premium advertising declined 40% year-over-year, mostly due to the decline in sales booked directly to our properties. 
Audience declined 19% year-over-year due to lower prices paid per ad through programmatic pricing. We continue to do everything we can to stabilize and slow this decline, but new more attractive formats like mobile, native and video are key to offsetting it.
Yahoo Ad Manager Plus is an important element in modernizing our legacy PC Display business and creating continuity with Mavens. The majority of our Audience business globally now runs on YAM Plus, and the platform continues to scale well to support business needs. Advertisers not only can buy ads across traditional display, native and video but also across mobile and desktop on YAM Plus. And they have the ability to use it on a self-serve basis for greater visibility and control over their campaigns.
Finally, on revenue, let's look at our Display metrics. Given the increasing financial contribution from our Affiliate business, our Display metrics have been updated to be more comprehensive over our entire business, including all countries where we operate and the network beyond our Yahoo properties.
Over the quarter, Display ads sold grew 29% as we continue to build our native and mobile inventory and added inventory from the BrightRoll network. Display PPA declined 17%, driven by declines in our Audience Price-per-Ad as well as unfavorable mix shifts.
Before I hand over to Ken to discuss our financial results, I want to touch on capital allocation. As you know, the company prioritizes and is exceptionally proud of being a good steward of capital. To date, we have returned $9.4 billion to shareholders over my tenure, delivering well beyond any public commitments we have made and reducing our share count by nearly 22%.
We expect in Q4 this year that our shareholders will see a historic return of capital through the tax-efficient spinoff of our remaining Alibaba stake. Following the announcement of our planned Alibaba spin, shareholders have expressed interest in how we will handle our stake in Yahoo Japan.
To prioritize value and tax efficiencies around our Alibaba stake and to reduce complexity around the planned spin, we were advised to not place our Yahoo Japan stake into the proposed SpinCo. That said, we do prioritize maximizing the value of our Yahoo Japan holdings for our shareholders. We have retained advisers to determine the most promising opportunities to maximize value, and it is currently a key priority to explore those options thoroughly.
As with the proposed Alibaba spin, the options for our Yahoo Japan investment require careful study. Our joint venture with Softbank is a nearly 20-year-old multinational, multijurisdictional licensing and operating arrangement, over which both Yahoo and Softbank maintain certain approval rights. When we have more to share on our plan for Yahoo Japan, we will do so on future earnings calls.
We also look rigorously at assets on our balance sheet to find opportunities to free up capital and produce revenue. As one of the Internet's industry -- Internet industry's pioneering companies, Yahoo and its innovative employees have developed a valuable intellectual property portfolio. We have been and will continue to look for sensible ways to realize the value of those assets.
For example, within the past 2 years, we've secured patent sales or licenses worth nearly $600 million, all without litigation. We're proud of our efforts to date and will continue look for ways to realize the value of our intellectual property investment.
Pursuing these types of opportunities has helped us invest in the business and build for the long term. As our shareholders know, all of our M&A activity to date during my tenure, about $2.1 billion has been funded through our own free cash flow. We will continue to be vigilant about thoughtfully returning capital to our shareholders, whether it be through share repurchases, spinoffs, monetizing previously unmonetized assets or through return on invested capital.
Overall, I'm very pleased with the progress we have made on people, products, traffic and revenue. 
And I will now hand over to Ken to address the financial elements in more detail."
91800,290250071,791541,"Yahoo! Inc., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2015",2015-04-21,"Earnings Calls","Altaba Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Marissa, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. I plan to cover a summary of our first quarter and several of the pressing topics on the minds of our top shareholders. Relative to our financial results, overall, we met our financial guid",1930,"Thanks, Marissa, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. I plan to cover a summary of our first quarter and several of the pressing topics on the minds of our top shareholders. 
Relative to our financial results, overall, we met our financial guidance and expectations, including in the areas of managing cost and headcount. It's also important that we achieve sustainable GAAP revenue growth this year, ultimately leading to revenue ex-TAC growth. I am confident that our team is up to this challenge.
Let me talk about 4 points of progress I want to refer to. First, on the SpinCo update, we are pleased with the progress to date against our internal milestones and timelines for the proposed spinoff transaction for Alibaba shares. We have submitted requests for a private letter ruling to the IRS. We continue to work toward our previously announced Q4 target for completion of the transaction. And a number of actions remain to be completed, including selecting the board and management team, determining capital structure, divesting Yahoo Small Business, obtaining favorable tax opinions, filings with the SEC and satisfaction of other closing conditions.
Our board and management team remain extremely focused on completing this transaction and tax efficiently distributing potentially $32 billion of value to our shareholders, which is usually Monday's closing Alibaba share price.
Second, on capital allocation. In Q1, we increased our stock buyback program by an additional $2 billion, bringing the outstanding authorization to $2.7 billion. We will be thoughtful and opportunistic in our buyback activity in light of the anticipated spinoff transaction timing to ensure appropriate flexibility in the business and optimized long-term value creation for Yahoo's shareholders.
As noted in this management team, we have demonstrated a strong and disciplined track record of capital allocation. Our significant buyback activity of 327 million shares totaling $9.4 billion since July 2012 represents a 27% gross reduction in our initial share base. With an initial purchase price of $28.64, this has been extremely accretive to our shareholders. And our ending diluted share count was also 948 million, down approximately 22% under this management team. When factoring in the potential $32 billion of value from the proposed spinoff transaction and the stock buyback since 2012, this management team post-spin will have distributed as much as $41 billion of value to its shareholders, truly a historic amount for a company our size.
In addition, we have the stock buyback authorization of $2.7 billion. Additional value and cash flow created from our ongoing IP monetization efforts through patent licensing and patent sales of nearly $600 million over the past 2 years and cash settlement of yen hedges of nearly 540 million since 2012 has further supported our buyback activity. We expect additional monetization here as we explore our reasonable opportunities. 
And over the same period of time, we spent $2.1 billion on M&A, which means we returned over 4x the amount of cash to our shareholders through buybacks as the cash used for acquisitions over the same time period. And as we shift our business forward to our growth areas, we will continue our focused and disciplined approach to M&A that aligns with our strategic priorities.
Third, EBITDA and cost. We are tightly managing our headcount and overall cost structure as EBITDA remains a key measurement for us. As Marissa mentioned, we took actions to optimize functions, remove inefficiencies and align resources to help focus our organizations on top priorities. 
Our current headcount figure of around 11,400 declined approximately 1,100 versus Q4, resulting in an improved cost base as our non-GAAP cash expenses were $9 million lower than our expectations for the quarter. With our contractors also reduced 830, our total headcount has reduced from nearly 17,000 before this team arrived to approximately 12,200 today, down 28% and especially noteworthy as this is inclusive of acquisitions we have made.
While our operating costs increased somewhat over time, it is important to understand that our historical expenses benefited from capitalized labor and other reimbursements totaling between $200 million and $300 million in 2011 and 2012 that are relatively minimal today. We will continue to actively manage our cost base to sustainably grow profitability and EBITDA over time.
Fourth, regarding Yahoo Japan, you have heard from Marissa our expectations and plans there. And as noted, we remain focused on maximizing the value of our stake.
Then in summary, as a management team, we are relentlessly focused on transforming the company and on driving long-term value creation. We have consistently delivered significant shareholder value through our asset monetization strategies, capital allocation decisions and operational -- operating efficiency improvements. We remain steadfast in our commitment to deliver value to our shareholders and return our company to growth. We also recognize and are mindful that we have much work ahead of us and are more committed than ever to take the necessary actions to grow both top and bottom lines.
With that, let's run through our first quarter financial results. Once again, I will focus most of the discussion around non-GAAP results, which exclude stock-based compensation expense of $116 million, restructuring expenses this quarter of $51 million and a $12 million noncash loss on our Hortonworks warrants, which are marked to market each quarter. While we exclude stock-based compensation from our non-GAAP financial results, we do take the stock dilution seriously, including shares granted and the resulting compensation expense. As a reminder, you can find complete reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP results in our earnings slides on our Investor Relations website.
I'll also limit my discussion here to the more salient points for the quarter and thus somewhat briefer than my prior prepared remarks. Our financial highlights for Q1 can be seen on Slide 5. 
GAAP revenue was $1.226 billion, up 8% and near the midpoint of our guidance after adjusting for the Mozilla TAC. Based on the terms of the agreement, including becoming the default search provider, we have concluded that revenues from Mozilla traffic will be recognized on a gross basis. As a result, the payments to Mozilla are reflected in TAC. Revenue ex-TAC was $1.043 billion, down 4% year-over-year and above the midpoint of our guidance. Excluding FX impacts, revenue ex-TAC was down 2% year-over-year.
Traffic acquisition costs were up $137 million, approximately 300% compared to the prior year due to our Mozilla partnership, BrightRoll and Mobile syndication.
Now taking a close look at Search. GAAP Search revenue was $532 million, up 20% year-over-year. Search revenue ex-TAC declined 3%. And overall, we saw increases in partner revenue shares in the quarter that out past -- outpaced our click-driven revenue growth, resulting in a decline in revenue ex-TAC.
The Americas region Search revenue ex-TAC declined 1% in the quarter, driven by revenue share payments to our major distribution partners such as Mozilla. Excluding onetime items in the RPS guarantee, which is being lapped this quarter from Q1 '14, America Search revenue ex-TAC would have been up 4%. International Search revenues ex-TAC declined 9% year-over-year, but excluding foreign exchange headwinds, international Search revenue ex-TAC would be flat.
Now moving to Display. GAAP Display revenue was $463 million, up 2% year-over-year, the first GAAP revenue growth in Q1 Display since 2011. Display revenue ex-TAC declined 7% year-over-year as a result of the declines in legacy Display business. And as we said previously, we expect to see growth in GAAP revenues first ultimately into growth in revenue ex-TAC.
In our Mavens businesses of mobile, video, native and social, we continue to see strong performance with 58% GAAP revenue growth year-over-year for those areas in aggregate. Mavens now contributes 33% to our traffic-driven revenue, up from 22% from the prior year.
Mobile GAAP revenue grew 61% year-over-year, driven by strong Mobile Display growth from our native ad formats and Affiliate business. In Q1, we announced at our Mobile Developer Conference an enhanced analytics and monetization platform to improve revenue opportunities for app developers and ecosystem at large.
And native revenue continued to grow with over $110 million in the quarter, driven by volume growth and syndication. We also completed the migration of the Flurry advertising business to the Gemini platform.
Now let's take a couple of minutes to go through our expenses and income in a bit more detail. Non-GAAP total operating expenses were up 3% versus prior year. D&A has remained consistent over the past several quarters at approximately $150 million. Our noncash -- non-GAAP cash expenses, inclusive of BrightRoll for the first quarter, were better than prior expectations at $811 million, up $31 million year-over-year, primarily driven by increases in workforce expense in our growth businesses. As Marissa shared, headcount is now at 11,400, reflecting our diligent management of resources and operating expenses with the goals of increasing profitability and EBITDA over time.
EBITDA was $231 million in Q1, with a margin of 22% based upon revenue ex-TAC. The year-over-year revenue decline is a result of lower revenue ex-TAC and additional costs resulting from growth in investments.
Non-GAAP operating income was $80 million for the quarter. Rounding out the income statement, earnings and equity interest were $100 million, down 67% year-over-year. As a reminder, this now relates primarily to Yahoo Japan, while the prior year included Alibaba earnings and equity interest. It has been relatively consistent over a number of quarters.
Non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.15, down 60% year-over-year. Our Q1 average fully diluted share count decreased year-over-year by 8%, as noted, to 948 million shares. It was down approximately 15 million from Q4.
Now let me turn to the balance sheet. At the end of Q1, we had $6.9 billion in cash and marketable securities, following the taxes paid in Q1 related to the Alibaba IPO, our $5.6 billion net of our convertible debt and other debt. Our Alibaba investment was $32 billion, reflecting the stock price at the end of Q1, as this is marked to market. The change in cash balance from Q4 to Q1 was primarily driven by: reported free cash flow of negative $3 billion, resulting from the settlement of $3.3 billion in taxes related to the Alibaba IPO; acquisition of $23 million; and cash utilized for share repurchase activity for the quarter was $204 million.
This completes our commitment to return at least half of the after-tax Alibaba IPO proceeds to shareholders. However, we repurchased over 3 billion of our shares.
Now let me cover guidance. Our guidance assumes that we continue to make steady progress on our revenue growth and EBITDA into Q2. We will continue to drive GAAP revenue growth and expect this to lead to growth in revenue ex-TAC as we execute successfully on our growth plans.
Looking ahead and taking account the actions we have taken, we expect to lower non-GAAP cash expense to a quarterly range of approximately $780 million. And we will continue executing on efficiencies throughout the organization. Please note that earnings and equity interest has historically been approximately $100 million each quarter when excluding the impact of Alibaba. 
For Q2 guidance, we expect the following: GAAP revenue range of $1.21 billion to $1.25 billion; revenue ex-TAC in the range of $1.01 billion to $1.05 billion; adjusted EBITDA in the range of $240 million to $260 million; and non-GAAP operating income in the range of $90 million to $110 million.
Thanks again for your time. In closing, we remain committed on transforming the company and driving long-term value for our shareholders and are more committed than ever to taking the necessary actions. 
And with that, Marissa and I will be glad to take your questions."

Well, what we talked about on past calls here is we do deeply believe in Search. It's deep in Yahoo's DNA from the very start of the company. That said, we are particularly interested in Search in the mobile sector, what happens when you involve context, what happens when you involve personal information from -- such that -- from things like email. And so that's really where we've been putting a lot of our innovation on the user search experience side. On the monetization side, as people are familiar with, we've had our Gemini platform that's now been live for more than 1 year. And we've actually been monetizing a percentage of our mobile traffic through Gemini already to date. And now the new agreement with Microsoft allows us to do more of that both on mobile and some on PC. And so that's really where I think we see the innovation. We believe that people respond to great search, but what great search means is changing. And that's really where we want to play. And it has a different profile in terms of investment than classic web search does."

So we like to see really high volume in Search, and partnerships are certainly one way for us to achieve greater volume and greater distribution. That said, as we look at those deals, it's very important to us that they are profitable. And so Mozilla is a profitable deal for us. We do assess and build models for each partnership. We look at as to whether or not we can really achieve profitability there. And this quarter, while it was a slight disappointment to see Search ex-TAC slip year-over-year by 3%, it was really more attributable to the acute things that we felt in Q1 like the Search revenue guarantee being lapped. And so we anticipate that we'll be able to see greater revenue growth on Search on both a GAAP basis and ideally an ex-TAC basis over the course of the year regardless of the different partnerships that are added."

I do think we are taking actions from an expense point of view that we'll have a significant impact from Q1 to Q2 in expense. And obviously, we're very mindful of a couple of things. One is of EBITDA itself and driving expenses because we know we certainly control expense. And as we watch the turnaround, if you will, from growing GAAP revenue to is it time for ex-TAC revenue, then obviously that will have a much bigger impact on EBITDA.

My earlier comment is that I really think that there are 2 types of products that are developed -- that are emerging. There's classic web search, call it deep reference web search, which is classic Google Search, Bing Search. And there's a new class of products that's really arising with Cortana, Siri, Google Now. And those products are really heavily differentiated both from each other as well as from the historic legacy products. And so that's really where we see an opportunity to play. It's something that's mobile, and as it moves to, for example, the watch and onto television screens and video, we think that there's a really interesting place to play there to help people make better sense of the content they already have access to, content in their mail, using more context to actually provide higher-quality results. I've given examples of things like, for example, searching for JFK, producing essentially my boarding pass and the gate number on a Search results page en route to the airport rather than just producing the John F. Kennedy Wikipedia page. I've used an example like that on previous calls. So that's really where we see a big opportunity. And the profile for searching people's personal information, pulling in contacts, searching entities and making search more action-oriented is a very different problem than crawling 1 trillion or more URLs and perfectly ordering millions of results. And we think that, that's something that's potentially more relevant to users of technology as we move forward. And that's really where we're excited to invest, and that's why we've worked on things like Aviate, like Search My World. And we've been making investments there and we'd like to do more with that. And that's what I'm referring to, that classic web search has a different cost profile than -- that future-oriented mobile search is more personal. And what was the second part of your question?"

And this is from our investments in Tumblr,",419,"Sure. I think that when you look at Mavens, we feel really good about the GAAP revenue growth that we not only saw on Search as part of the Mozilla deal primarily but also the GAAP growth that we saw on Display. And this is from our investments in Tumblr, in BrightRoll for video as well as in mobile and native. And so while it is sometimes hard to pinpoint an exact quarter, overall when we look at 2015, we see that we think we're going to be able to continue that GAAP growth. And now it's really time to focus on margin, traffic acquisition costs, so we can start to see that growth, and we feel that growth in revenue ex-TAC and EBITDA. And that's ultimately where we're really going to focus for the next few quarters. And so I think that we feel like we've hit an inflection point on GAAP growth, and we're going to continue to try and see that trend through. And we're working very hard to return, for example, Display to growth over the course of 2015. We want 2015 in Display to be a growth year over 2014. We think that we can achieve that. And on the management team structure, I think it was more [indiscernible] than actually probably as merited. As you'll note, actually, all the executives are [indiscernible] roles. They were already in the company. So it's a little bit more of a shuffle. The structure that I put in place when I arrived here 2.5 years ago had really just gotten to a point where some of the lines between different organizations were just not drawn in the most efficient way. We wanted, for example, to take our Mobile organization that had grown so nicely and had built such a name for themselves in native applications and really take their efforts and those teams and place them such that the Mobile Mail app works directly with the Yahoo Mail PC team and so on and so forth for Homepage & Verticals, et cetera. And I think that overall is a good change that infuses a lot of Mobile energy into the company. And I also think that this allows us to focus on areas of the Mavens, including video moving forward, where we really like to see more growth and we see more opportunity. And so that's really what those management changes were about. But they were more evolutionary than radical from my viewpoint and inside the company."

And so to me, that's really ultimately where we want to be. As we see new formats appear, be it phones, tablets, watches, televisions, we think that, that ability to play the role of a guide and really inform, connect and entertain users will stand the test of time. And these new areas of revenue for us in mobile, video, native and social can really go the distance."

Overall, it doesn't change how we actually make the decisions because we ultimately would decide to do a deal only if it was a really good deal in terms of net and gross as you see with Mozilla. But it made the dynamics in the partnership somewhat strained. And so we basically said, ""Look, these are deals we're entering into. We want to take responsibility for the full gross revenue, and it makes sense for the revenue share to be built off of that."" And so that's really why we made that adjustment. And in terms of ad sales, obviously we have really talented ad sales team here. They've been doing a terrific job selling Gemini and growing it as fast as you've seen in our overall numbers and financial results, as well as our Display ad folks. And so our goal, of course, is to continue. And our intention and plan is to continue to sell our own ads that said if we can find someone to partner with, be it in a marketplace dynamic like we have for programmatic with real-time bidding or more directly, we always welcome being able to provide the highest-quality, best monetizing ads to our users and to our advertisers that really deliver the most value."

Native, as I mentioned, is just [indiscernible] growth pace, $110 million in Q1 alone. And overall, the ecosystem is performing really well. We have -- we haven't quantified it, but we certainly have thousands of advertisers in Gemini. They're incredibly well-targeted ads because those ads are great for advertisers because they can create them really easily. They're text ads. They can have a picture or not. And you can actually quantify the return on investment really easily because you pay on a cost-per-click model. One of the things to recognize is we actually convert that back from a cost-per-click revenue to a CPM when we put it into our Display metrics. And so it does change a bit there. But in both counts, both on a Price-per-Click model paid by the advertiser or on a Price-per-Ad model, Gemini is actually nicely up year-over-year in terms of the pricing. We intend -- we see that trend continuing throughout the year. And so it implies a really vibrant marketplace. The one place where we're really seeing pricing pressure is in our programmatic sector where we see a lot of advertiser demand both for native and for programmatic advertising. And that programmatic ad marketplace is very efficient in terms of targeting and placing ads in favor of the advertiser, which we think is great. It delivers good value, but it has put increased pricing pressure on our programmatic ads and implicitly the premium ads that are moving into the programmatic sector."

And that means essentially hiring people to work on new products and new revenue streams, and some is actually making those hires inside the company. And in our goals with this remix, we really want to find a way to work more productively and with greater efficiency and excellence. And I really think that with this current footprint, we are more streamlined and we've made ourselves a lot more efficient. I think the more notable thing is aside from the headcount overall changes to the number, we've actually done a lot of reallocations inside the company to make sure that we have people focused on what's new and what's going to help us build and grow over time. And if I had to look at the company when I arrived, we quantified it was about 17,000 people working on that business. Today, if I had to estimate, I think we probably have less than 1/3 of that, somewhere between 5,000 and 6,000 people that are working on those legacy businesses even in terms of partial time, some together de-duplicated because we've added so much to the business, be it from digital magazines or Gemini and some of our search efforts to our acquisitions to mobile to video. And all those pieces are new things that we're doing. In addition, we've certainly done some shutdowns of some of our legacy operations. But it's really been about remixing and pivoting the company to not only operate efficiently and with excellence but really get focused on that future that we built for ourselves. I mean, the big task when we got to Yahoo was saying, ""Okay, we have several revenue streams that are in decline."" In fact, most of the revenue streams were in decline. And that meant that we had to build ourselves a future, one that was growing fast enough at scale and would grow long enough to really build the future to move into. And that's what it [ph] really represents for us. And so making sure that we have the majority of our team. And I think it's probably we're about -- at about half really focused on how do we bring our product offerings that are supported by Mavens as well as the Mavens offerings forward into the future and make sure that they're well staffed. That's one of the things that keeps me up at night. And I do think that the headcount changes were overall well done. I want to again compliment the team for how they were executing, how they were received. And the bigger piece has been changing the priorities to really put that future in focus."

For my portion, I'll go over where we are in our transformation as well as recent progress, including our amended partnership with Microsoft, our Search partnership with Mozilla and changes to our cost bases.
As you know, Yahoo is amidst a multiyear transformation to return an iconic company to greatness. We have said in the past that we anticipated GAAP revenue growth occurring ahead of revenue ex-TAC and EBITDA growth, and that's precisely what we saw this quarter. Our display revenue grew modestly this quarter, 2% on a GAAP basis. This is the first Q1 growth in display since 2011. Search revenue grew 20% on a GAAP basis. And our overall revenue grew 8% year-over-year on a GAAP basis. For the next phase of the transformation, we will focus on accelerating GAAP revenue growth while balancing costs and enhancing margins and EBITDA.
For my update today, we will use the framework of our virtuous cycle: people, products, traffic and revenue. We believe with the right people, you build great products that the market responds to, to increase traffic and engagement, leading to greater revenue. This is one of the key operating principles in our transformation and one reason we focus on hiring and retaining the right people and really improving the user experience and product features we offer. 
Starting with people. Today, approximately 11,400 full-time employees and 830 contractors work for the company. This represents a significant sharpening of how we align people to our strategy and priorities. Before I arrived, we had approximately 14,200 employees and 2,800 contractors. Over the past 2 years -- 2.5 years, we have retooled our culture to be extremely performance-oriented, concentrated our efforts in high productivity locations, closing 17 office locations in total, sunset approximately 80 products, reduced the number of contractors by nearly 2,000 and reduced our full-time employee count by nearly 3,000 people, including a recent reduction of about 1,100 full-time employees this past quarter.
During that same 2.5-year period, we became a mobile-first company and grew our Mavens businesses, referring to mobile, video, native and social, from essentially nonexistence to more than $1 billion in annual revenue in 2014. We created beautiful, heavily engaged native mobile applications, which span everything from Yahoo Mail to News Digest and Weather. And we have added Tumblr, BrightRoll and Flurry to our product portfolio and invented and grew new revenue streams like our Gemini native ad business and Yahoo Ad Manager Plus to evolve our Display ad business. Today, more than half, 51%, of our full-time employees are new under this management team. And it's safe to say that we really are a new Yahoo, moving with greater purpose, building much more robust and modern products and executing with greater productivity. 
I want to take a moment to compliment the people here at Yahoo for their resilience throughout these changes in priorities and roles. Although a transformation in this scale is not easy, it's been amazing to see record levels of engagement and energy across the company. Examples include a record 4,000 Yahoos participating directly in user research in Q1, higher engagement and participation in our company meetings like our FYI meetings on Fridays, and of course, resetting the Guinness Book's world record for largest simultaneous yodel in honor of Yahoo's 20th birthday on March 2.
And interest in working at Yahoo is at an all-time high. In Q1, we received nearly 43,000 applications, 150 for each person we hired and an increase of 47% quarter-over-quarter. In the area of talent, we made perhaps our most important people-related hire, welcoming Bryan Power as our SVP of Human Resources. Bryan joined us from Square and Google and is already doing a tremendous job. In terms of top-notch editorial talent, we hired Jason Collins as our Yahoo Sports NCAA and NBA analyst just in time for March Madness. And we also hired Andy Serwer as Editor-in-Chief for Yahoo Finance. Those in the financial community will be very familiar with Andy's background as he previously served as the Managing Editor of Fortune.
Across the board on people, we made outstanding progress, and it's very important to gain such momentum as we move forward towards growth. Great people build great products, and we pride ourselves on being an indispensable guide to digital information. Being an indispensable guide means focusing on informing, connecting and entertaining our users, which maps to 3 key strategic areas; search, communications and digital content.
On Search, we entered a partnership with Mozilla in November and started to ramp their traffic on our systems in December. Q1 marks the first full quarter of our Mozilla partnership and it was terrific. Mozilla is not only a high-quality deal for us. It is a profitable deal for us. For volume and long-term health of the partnership, introducing Mozilla users to and retaining them on Yahoo Search is key. And we surpassed all expectations for new users and retention. We knew this was a landmark deal for both companies. From today's vantage point, we would enter the partnership even more readily. 
In Q1, we saw healthy Search metrics, with Search clicks up 21% and Price-per-Click up 3% and Search growing on a GAAP revenue basis by 20%. Revenue ex-TAC dipped slightly by 3%. Please note though that revenue ex-TAC would have grown modestly if not for a few onetime issues that are acute in Q1. We will continue to work hard to grow Search on both a GAAP and a revenue ex-TAC basis.
We were excited last week to announce a renewed and amended partnership with Microsoft. This renewed partnership allows us greater flexibility and enhances competitiveness by allowing us to iterate and experiment more with our user experience and monetization. The amended agreement has a 5-year remaining term and is distinctly similar to the prior arrangement except that it reduces our exclusivity commitments on PC to 51%, addresses the traffic acquisition cost we pay Microsoft on a gross basis rather than a net basis and lets Yahoo call on Microsoft for search only, ads only or both together, paying a fixed cost rather than a revenue share for items that we discard without Display.
I'd like to thank Satya and his team for the very constructive time and attention they dedicated to designing our go-forward partnership. We were very pleased with the renewed relationship, which improves the search experience for users, creates value for advertisers and establishes ongoing stability for partners. We anticipate it will take several quarters to operationalize the new amendment, so our Q2 forecast contemplates the current arrangement.
In terms of our communication products, Yahoo Mail accelerated its velocity, launching tons of new features in the quarter, including custom Smart Views, on-demand passwords, folder search, enhanced contacts, as well as a few Valentine's Day features like auto-composing at Valentines or stationery in partnership with Paperless Post. All the while, we focused on improved stability and reducing spam.  Yahoo Mail continues to be a powerhouse of user retention, both in terms of signed-in users and as a mobile app. 
In digital content, at the end of Q1, we had 13 digital magazines on Yahoo, 3 of which launched in the quarter: TV, Politics and Autos. We're extremely excited about our digital magazine franchise. In just over 1 year, we created 13 magazines, 5 of which, Style, Beauty, Movies, Parenting and Travel, are #1 in their respective categories according to comScore.
On the Yahoo homepage, we introduced autoplay video. These videos automatically play without sound. The sound starts only when you mouse over them. Autoplay increased engagement with our homepage and caused our average number of daily streams to grow 16% quarter-over-quarter. In total, worldwide video streams almost doubled quarter-over-quarter, up 89%. In the U.S. in particular, video streams grew 262% year-over-year and almost 150% quarter-over-quarter. At the same time, watch time per unique user, which in some instances decreases with autoplay, actually grew 50% quarter-over-quarter. We are gaining traction in video and we plan to do even more here over the course of the year.
We also enhanced our news partnership with ABC. Yahoo News will now collaborate with ABC News on major news events, including the 2016 presidential election, and the ABC Evening News will feature segments by Katie Couric, Yahoo's Global Anchor. Yahoo Your Day will be a new daily feature on Good Morning America, bringing to television Yahoo's top editors and experts from our digital magazines, and additional exclusive ABC and Disney content will be available on Yahoo. This expanded coupling nicely brings together ABC's exclusive high-quality content and Yahoo's reach.
Finally on digital content, let's turn to Sports. For more than 16 years, we've built the best Fantasy Sports experiences for our fans. Our users spend nearly 30 billion minutes a year playing Fantasy Sports on Yahoo, and nearly all of those experiences have involved traditional, seasonal and fantasy games. Recently, there is a rising trend around daily fantasy games. We believe this is an area where Yahoo can and should compete. Over the past year, we have been working hard to create our daily fantasy offering, a unique take on this game genre to bolster our leadership in Fantasy Sports. Normally, we do not announce products before launch, but this has been such an area of interest for our fantasy players and for our investors that we wanted to announce that we have a new daily fantasy offering in the works that will launch this summer.
Tumblr continues to drive incredible growth, and we continue to be aggressive and thoughtful on our approach to monetization. Today, more than 360 of the world's top brands not only blog on Tumblr but also advertise and spend on the platform, up approximately 13% quarter-over-quarter. Most notably, we launched our Creatrs Network in Q1, which lets friends find incredible Tumblr artists and bloggers to commission unique content. And we saw immediate traction there with more than 35 brands spending on creators to date.
Turning to Flurry. We continue to see strong adoption. The number of applications that include the Flurry software development kit has surpassed 700,000. In February, we hosted our first Yahoo Mobile Developer Conference. It was attended by over 1,000 developers whose applications are collectively used for 2 billion hours each month.
At the conference, we launched the Yahoo Mobile Developer Suite to help developers measure, monetize, advertise and improve their applications. Highlights of our new developer offering include a powerful new Explorer interface for our widely adopted Flurry Analytics, the integration of native ads powered by Yahoo Gemini and Yahoo Search in Apps, extending our own Search capabilities to any app developer.
The conference was well received by the developer community and exemplified Yahoo's technical and commercial leadership in mobile. In the first 5 weeks since the conference, Yahoo Search in Apps has been launched in partner applications that reach more than 60 million users. And a number of top-tier publishers, including Tango, have integrated our native ads with strong revenue momentum. Yahoo is investing passionately in the developer ecosystem to improve the quality and the monetization of our partners' applications.
Finally, over the last quarter, we worked hard to integrate BrightRoll and made excellent progress. We now have Yahoo demographic and behavioral data integrated into the BrightRoll marketplace along with Yahoo-owned and operated video inventory and Flurry marketplace video inventory.
Next, let's turn to traffic. Most notably in Q1, we hit more than 600 million monthly active users on Mobile, more than 20% growth year-over-year. With more than 1 billion users across desktop and mobile in total, Yahoo's transformation to being a mobile-first company is apparent.
Tumblr traffic continues to grow. The Tumblr audience is approaching the 0.5 billion mark, with an audience of more than 474 million monthly people. And we saw tremendous mobile engagement with users on the mobile app up more than 10% quarter-over-quarter.
Moving from people, products and traffic to revenue. We are hard at work on monetizing our products and traffic to drive revenue. Yahoo Gemini's native ad offering has continued growing tremendously, delivering terrific value to advertisers.
Last year, across all 4 quarters, Yahoo Gemini native made more than $0.25 billion. In Q1 alone, Gemini native ads made $110 million. We could not be more thrilled with our bet on native ads and how well it is working for the company. 
Our native ads, of course, are foundational to our mobile monetization. This quarter, we saw mobile gross revenue of $391 million and GAAP revenue of $234 million, representing growth of 61% year-over-year on a GAAP basis. We are proud of being a mobile-first company, and we will continue to work hard to grow our engagement with new mobile products and features to drive mobile forward.
Now let's broaden from mobile and native to take a look at Mavens, which also includes not only mobile and native, but also video and social. Our Q1 Mavens GAAP revenue was $363 million, up 58% year-over-year. We are well on track for a substantial Mavens growth in 2015.
BrightRoll has been integrating and growing nicely on the video front. And on the social front, Tumblr has continued to grow users and time spent, and we remain committed to and optimistic about our annual goal of $100 million in revenue. With such a passionate user community behind the growth of this product, we're being thoughtful in our approach to monetization, and advertisers are responding.
As I've talked about before, our Mavens strategy is core to our growth because it counteracts declines in our legacy businesses as we reinvent in new, more modern Yahoo. We will continue to grow these business lines as fast as we can. 
Turning now to legacy -- to our legacy business. We continue to see steep year-over-year declines in premium and programmatic PC advertising. This has accelerated in Q4 and Q1 where we have seen more than $100 million of decline in each quarter. Our premium advertising declined 40% year-over-year, mostly due to a decline in sales booked directly to our properties. 
Audience declined 19% year-over-year due to lower prices paid per ad through programmatic pricing. We continue to do everything we can to stabilize and slow this decline, but new more attractive formats like mobile, native and video are key to offsetting it.
Yahoo Ad Manager Plus is an important element in modernizing our legacy PC Display business and creating continuity with Mavens. The majority of our Audience business globally now runs on YAM Plus, and the platform continues to scale well to support business needs. Advertisers not only can buy ads across traditional display, native and video but also across mobile and desktop on YAM Plus. And they have the ability to use it on a self-serve basis for greater visibility and control over their campaigns.
Finally, on revenue, let's look at our Display metrics. Given the increasing financial contribution from our Affiliate business, our Display metrics have been updated to be more comprehensive over our entire business, including all countries where we operate and the network beyond our Yahoo properties.
Over the quarter, Display ads sold grew 29% as we continue to build our native and mobile inventory and added inventory from the BrightRoll network. Display PPA declined 17%, driven by declines in our Audience Price-per-Ad as well as unfavorable mix shifts.
Before I hand over to Ken to discuss our financial results, I want to touch on capital allocation. As you know, the company prioritizes and is exceptionally proud of being a good steward of capital. To date, we have returned $9.4 billion to shareholders over my tenure, delivering well beyond any public commitments we have made and reducing our share count by nearly 22%.
We expect in Q4 this year that our shareholders will see a historic return of capital through the tax-efficient spinoff of our remaining Alibaba stake. Following the announcement of our planned Alibaba spin, shareholders have expressed interest in how we will handle our stake in Yahoo Japan.
To prioritize value and tax efficiencies around our Alibaba stake and to reduce complexity around the planned spin, we were advised to not place our Yahoo Japan stake into the proposed SpinCo. That said, we do prioritize maximizing the value of our Yahoo Japan holdings for our shareholders. We have retained advisers to determine the most promising opportunities to maximize value, and it is currently a key priority to explore those options thoroughly.
As with the proposed Alibaba spin, the options for our Yahoo Japan investment require careful study. Our joint venture with Softbank is a nearly 20-year-old multinational, multijurisdictional licensing and operating arrangement, over which both Yahoo and Softbank maintain certain approval rights. When we have more to share on our plan for Yahoo Japan, we will do so on future earnings calls.
We also look rigorously at assets on our balance sheet to find opportunities to free up capital and produce revenue. As one of the Internet's industry -- Internet industry's pioneering companies, Yahoo and its innovative employees have developed a valuable intellectual property portfolio. We have been and will continue to look for sensible ways to realize the value of those assets.
For example, within the past 2 years, we've secured patent sales or licenses worth nearly $600 million, all without litigation. We're proud of our efforts to date and will continue look for ways to realize the value of our intellectual property investment.
Pursuing these types of opportunities has helped us invest in the business and build for the long term. As our shareholders know, all of our M&A activity to date during my tenure, about $2.1 billion, has been funded through our own free cash flow. We will continue to be vigilant about thoughtfully returning capital to our shareholders, whether it be through share repurchases, spinoffs, monetizing previously unmonetized assets or through return on invested capital.
Overall, I'm very pleased with the progress we have made on people, products, traffic and revenue. 
And I will now hand over to Ken to address the financial elements in more detail."
91800,290250071,791573,"Yahoo! Inc., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2015",2015-04-21,"Earnings Calls","Altaba Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Marissa, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. I plan to cover a summary of our first quarter and several of the pressing topics on the minds of our top shareholders. Relative to our financial results, overall, we met our financial guid",1928,"Thanks, Marissa, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. I plan to cover a summary of our first quarter and several of the pressing topics on the minds of our top shareholders. 
Relative to our financial results, overall, we met our financial guidance and expectations, including in the areas of managing cost and headcount. It's also important that we achieve sustainable GAAP revenue growth this year, ultimately leading to revenue ex-TAC growth. I am confident that our team is up to this challenge.
Let me talk about 4 points of progress I want to refer to. First, on the SpinCo update, we are pleased with the progress to date against our internal milestones and timelines for the proposed spinoff transaction for Alibaba shares. We have submitted requests for a private letter ruling to the IRS. We continue to work toward our previously announced Q4 target for completion of the transaction. And a number of actions remain to be completed, including: Selecting the board and management team; determining capital structure; divesting Yahoo Small Business; obtaining favorable tax opinions; filings with the SEC; and satisfaction of other closing conditions.
Our board and management team remain extremely focused on completing this transaction and tax efficiently distributing potentially $32 billion of value to our shareholders, which is using Monday's closing Alibaba share price.
Second, on capital allocation. In Q1, we increased our stock buyback program by an additional $2 billion, bringing the outstanding authorization to $2.7 billion. We will be thoughtful and opportunistic in our buyback activity in light of the anticipated spinoff transaction timing to ensure appropriate flexibility in the business and optimized long-term value creation for Yahoo's shareholders.
As noted, in this management team, we have demonstrated a strong and disciplined track record of capital allocation. Our significant buyback activity of 327 million shares, totaling $9.4 billion since July 2012, represents a 27% gross reduction in our initial share base. With an initial purchase price of $28.64, this has been extremely accretive to our shareholders. And our ending diluted share count was also 948 million, down approximately 22% under this management team. When factoring in the potential $32 billion of value from the proposed spinoff transaction and the stock buyback since 2012, this management team post-spin will have distributed as much as $41 billion of value to its shareholders, truly an historic amount for a company our size.
In addition, we have the stock buyback authorization of $2.7 billion. Additional value and cash flow created from our ongoing IP monetization efforts through patent licensing and patent sales of nearly $600 million over the past 2 years and cash settlement of yen hedges of nearly $540 million since 2012 has further supported our buyback activity. We expect additional monetization here as we explore all reasonable opportunities. 
And over the same period of time, we spent $2.1 billion on M&A, which means we returned over 4x the amount of cash to our shareholders through buybacks as the cash used for acquisitions over the same time period. And as we shift our business forward toward growth areas, we will continue our focused and disciplined approach to M&A that aligns with our strategic priorities.
Third, EBITDA and cost. We are tightly managing our headcount and overall cost structure as EBITDA remains a key measurement for us. As Marissa mentioned, we took actions to optimize functions, remove inefficiencies and align resources to help focus our organizations on top priorities. 
Our current headcount figure of around 11,400 declined approximately 1,100 versus Q4, resulting in an improved cost base as our non-GAAP cash expenses were $9 million lower than our expectations for the quarter. With our contractors also reduced 830, our total headcount has reduced from nearly 17,000 before this team arrived to approximately 12,200 today, down 28% and especially noteworthy as this is inclusive of acquisitions we have made.
While our operating costs increased somewhat over time, it is important to understand that our historical expenses benefited from capitalized labor and other reimbursements totaling between $200 million and $300 million in 2011 and 2012 that are relatively minimal today. We will continue to actively manage our cost base to sustainably grow profitability and EBITDA over time.
Fourth, regarding Yahoo Japan, you have heard from Marissa our expectations and plans there. And as noted, we remain focused on maximizing the value of our stake.
Then in summary, as a management team, we are relentlessly focused on transforming the company and on driving long-term value creation. We have consistently delivered significant shareholder value through our asset monetization strategies, capital allocation decisions and operational -- operating efficiency improvements. We remain steadfast in our commitment to deliver value to our shareholders and return our company to growth. We also recognize and are mindful that we have much work ahead of us and are more committed than ever to take the necessary actions to grow both top and bottom lines.
With that, let's run through our first quarter financial results. Once again, I will focus most of the discussion around non-GAAP results, which exclude: Stock-based compensation expense of $116 million; restructuring expenses this quarter of $51 million; and a $12 million noncash loss on our Hortonworks warrants, which are marked to market each quarter. 
While we exclude stock-based compensation from our non-GAAP financial results, we do take the stock dilution seriously, including shares granted and the resulting compensation expense. As a reminder, you can find complete reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP results in our earnings slides on our Investor Relations website. I'll also limit my discussion here to the more salient points for the quarter and thus somewhat briefer than my prior prepared remarks. 
Our financial highlights for Q1 can be seen on Slide 5. GAAP revenue was $1.226 billion, up 8% and near the midpoint of our guidance after adjusting for the Mozilla TAC. Based on the terms of the agreement, including becoming the default search provider, we have concluded that revenues from Mozilla traffic will be recognized on a gross basis. 
As a result, the payments to Mozilla are reflected in TAC. Revenue ex-TAC was $1.043 billion, down 4% year-over-year and above the midpoint of our guidance. Excluding FX impacts, revenue ex-TAC was down 2% year-over-year. Traffic acquisition costs were up $137 million, approximately 300% compared to the prior year due to our Mozilla partnership, BrightRoll and Mobile syndication.
Now taking a close look at Search. GAAP Search revenue was $532 million, up 20% year-over-year. Search revenue ex-TAC declined 3%. And overall, we saw increases in partner revenue shares in the quarter that out past -- outpaced our click-driven revenue growth, resulting in a decline in revenue ex-TAC.
The Americas region Search revenue ex-TAC declined 1% in the quarter, driven by revenue share payments to our major distribution partners such as Mozilla. Excluding onetime items in the RPS guarantee, which is being lapped this quarter from Q1 '14, America Search revenue ex-TAC would have been up 4%. International Search revenues ex-TAC declined 9% year-over-year, but excluding foreign exchange headwinds, international Search revenue ex-TAC would be flat.
Now moving to Display. GAAP Display revenue was $463 million, up 2% year-over-year, the first GAAP revenue growth in Q1 Display since 2011. Display revenue ex-TAC declined 7% year-over-year as a result of declines in the legacy Display business. And as we said previously, we expect to see growth from GAAP revenues first, ultimately leading to growth in revenue ex-TAC.
In our Mavens businesses of mobile, video, native and social, we continue to see strong performance, with 58% GAAP revenue growth year-over-year for those areas in aggregate. Mavens now contributes 33% to our traffic-driven revenue, up from 22% from the prior year.
Mobile GAAP revenue grew 61% year-over-year, driven by strong Mobile Display growth from our native ad formats and Affiliate business. In Q1, we announced at our Mobile Developer Conference an enhanced analytics and monetization platform to improve revenue opportunities for app developers and ecosystem at large.
And native revenue continued to grow with over $110 million in the quarter, driven by volume growth and syndication. We also completed the migration of the Flurry advertising business to the Gemini platform.
Now let's take a couple of minutes to go through our expenses and income in a bit more detail. Non-GAAP total operating expenses were up 3% versus prior year. D&A has remained consistent over the past several quarters at approximately $150 million. Our non-GAAP cash expenses, inclusive of BrightRoll for the first quarter, were better than prior expectations at $811 million, up $31 million year-over-year, primarily driven by increases in workforce expense in our growth businesses. As Marissa shared, headcount is now at 11,400, reflecting our diligent management of resources and operating expenses with the goals of increasing profitability and EBITDA over time.
EBITDA was $231 million in Q1, with a margin of 22% based upon revenue ex-TAC. The year-over-year revenue decline is a result of lower revenue ex-TAC and the additional costs resulting from growth investments.
Non-GAAP operating income was $80 million for the quarter. Rounding out the income statement, earnings and equity interest were $100 million, down 67% year-over-year. As a reminder, this now relates primarily to Yahoo Japan. While the prior year included Alibaba earnings and equity interest, it has been relatively consistent over a number of quarters.
Non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.15, down 60% year-over-year. Our Q1 average fully diluted share count decreased year-over-year by 8%, as noted, to 948 million shares. It was down approximately 15 million from Q4.
Now let me turn to the balance sheet. At the end of Q1, we had $6.9 billion in cash and marketable securities, following the taxes paid in Q1 related to the Alibaba IPO, up $5.6 billion net of our convertible debt and other debt. Our Alibaba investment was $32 billion, reflecting the stock price at the end of Q1, as this is marked to market. The change in cash balance from Q4 to Q1 was primarily driven by: Reported free cash flow of negative $3 billion, resulting from the settlement of $3.3 billion in taxes related to the Alibaba IPO; acquisition of $23 million; and cash utilized for share repurchase activity for the quarter was $204 million.
This completes our commitment to return at least half of the after-tax Alibaba IPO proceeds to shareholders, having repurchased over 3 billion of our shares.
Now let me cover guidance. Our guidance assumes that we continue to make steady progress on our revenue growth and EBITDA into Q2. We will continue to drive GAAP revenue growth and expect this to lead to growth in revenue ex-TAC as we execute successfully on our growth plans.
Looking ahead and taking into account the actions we have taken, we expect to lower non-GAAP cash expense to a quarterly range of approximately $780 million. And we will continue executing on efficiencies throughout the organization. Please note that earnings and equity interest has historically been approximately $100 million each quarter when excluding the impact of Alibaba. 
For Q2 guidance, we expect the following: GAAP revenue range of $1.21 billion to $1.25 billion; revenue ex-TAC in the range of $1.01 billion to $1.05 billion; adjusted EBITDA in the range of $240 million to $260 million; and non-GAAP operating income in the range of $90 million to $110 million.
Thanks again for your time. In closing, we remain committed on transforming the company on driving long-term value for our shareholders and are more committed than ever to taking the necessary actions. 
And with that, Marissa and I will be glad to take your questions."

And so that's really where we've been putting a lot of our innovation on the user search experience side. On the monetization side, as people are familiar with, we've had our Gemini platform that's now been live for more than 1 year. And we've actually been monetizing a percentage of our mobile traffic through Gemini already to date. And now the new agreement with Microsoft allows us to do more of that both on mobile and some on PC. And so that's really where I think we see the innovation. We believe that people respond to great search, but what great search means is changing. And that's really where we want to play.

On Mozilla, as I said, we are even more excited about that partnership today than we were when we signed it, and we were already very excited then. Overall, we think it's really important to maintain volume. That's an indication of how our users are valuing the Search, that it's actually meeting their needs. So we like to see really high volume in Search, and partnerships are certainly one way for us to achieve greater volume and greater distribution. That said, as we look at those deals, it's very important to us that they are profitable. And so Mozilla is a profitable deal for us. We do assess and build models for each partnership we look at, as to whether or not we can really achieve profitability there. And this quarter, while it was a slight disappointment to see Search ex-TAC slip year-over-year by 3%, it was really more attributable to the acute things that we felt in Q1 like the Search revenue guarantee being lapped. And so we anticipate that we'll be able to see greater revenue growth on Search on both a GAAP basis and ideally an ex-TAC basis over the course of the year regardless of the different partnerships that are added."

I do think we are taking actions from an expense point of view that we'll have a significant impact from Q1 to Q2 in expense. And obviously, we're very mindful of a couple of things. One is of EBITDA itself and driving expenses because we know we certainly control expense. And as we watch the turnaround, if you will, from growing GAAP revenue to is it time for ex-TAC revenue, then obviously that will have a much bigger impact on EBITDA.

We see opportunities to take some of our new acquisitions like Tumblr or Flurry or BrightRoll into these markets, Tumblr obviously being an end-user product, but Flurry really benefiting a lot of end-user products and BrightRoll on the video ad network side. And so we're looking at how can we take some of those investments we've made and really help -- use them to help us achieve the footprint we want internationally.

My earlier comment is that I really think that there are 2 types of products that are developed -- that are emerging. There's classic web search, call it deep reference web search, which is classic Google Search, Bing Search. And there's a new class of products that's really arising with Cortana, Siri, Google Now. And those products are really heavily differentiated, both from each other as well as from the historic legacy products. And so that's really where we see an opportunity to play; in something that's mobile, and as it moves to, for example, the watch and onto television screens and video, we think that there's a really interesting place to play there to help people make better sense of the content they already have access to, content in their mail, using more context to actually provide higher-quality results. I've given examples of things like, for example, searching for JFK, producing essentially my boarding pass and the gate number on a Search results page en route to the airport rather than just producing the John F. Kennedy Wikipedia page. I've used an example like that on previous calls. So that's really where we see a big opportunity. And the profile for searching people's personal information, pulling in context, searching entities and making search more action-oriented is a very different problem than crawling 1 trillion or more URLs and perfectly ordering millions of results. And we think that that's something that's potentially more relevant to users of technology as we move forward. And that's really where we're excited to invest, and that's why we've worked on things like Aviate, like Search My World. And we've been making investments there and we'd like to do more with that. And that's what I'm referring to, that classic web search has a different cost profile than that future-oriented mobile search that's more personal. And what was the second part of your question?"

And so while it is sometimes hard to pinpoint an exact quarter, overall when we look at 2015, we see that we think we're going to be able to continue that GAAP growth. And now it's really time to focus on margin, traffic acquisition costs, so we can start to see that growth, really feel that growth in revenue ex-TAC and in EBITDA. And that's ultimately where we're really going to focus for the next few quarters. And so I think that we feel like we've hit an inflection point on GAAP growth, and we're going to continue to try and see that trend through. And we're working very hard to return, for example, Display to growth over the course of 2015. We want 2015 in Display to be a growth year over 2014. We think that we can achieve that. And on the management team structure, I think it was more made of it than actually probably as merited. As you'll note, actually, all the executives are playing roles they were already in the company, so it's a little bit more of a shuffle. The structure that I put in place when I arrived here 2.5 years ago had really just gotten to a point where some of the lines between different organizations were just not drawn in the most efficient way. We wanted, for example, to take our Mobile organization that had grown so nicely and had built such a name for themselves in native applications and really take their efforts and those teams and place them such that the Mobile Mail app works directly with the Yahoo Mail PC team and so on, so forth for Homepage & Verticals, et cetera. And I think that overall is a good change that infused a lot of Mobile energy into the company. And I also think that this allows us to focus on areas of the Mavens, including video moving forward, where we'd really like to see more growth and we see more opportunity. And so that's really what those management changes were about. But they were more evolutionary than radical from my viewpoint and inside the company."

Overall, it doesn't change how we actually make the decisions because we ultimately would decide to do a deal only if it was a really good deal in terms of net and gross, as you see with Mozilla. But it made the dynamics in the partnership somewhat strained. And so we basically said, ""Look, these are deals we're entering into. We want to take responsibility for the full gross revenue, and it makes sense for the revenue share to be built off of that."" And so that's really why we made that adjustment.

We have -- we haven't quantified it, but we certainly have thousands of advertisers in Gemini. They're incredibly well-targeted ads because those ads are great for advertisers because they can create them really easily. They're text ads. They can have a picture or not. And you can actually quantify the return on investment really easily because you pay on a cost-per-click model. One of the things to recognize is we actually convert that back from a cost-per-click revenue to a CPM when we put it into our Display metrics. And so it does change a bit there. But in both counts, both on a Price-per-Click model paid by the advertiser or on a Price-per-Ad model, Gemini is actually nicely up year-over-year in terms of the pricing. We intend -- we see that trend continuing throughout the year. And so it implies a really vibrant marketplace. The one place where we're really seeing pricing pressure is in our programmatic sector where we see a lot of advertiser demand both for native and for programmatic advertising. And that programmatic ad marketplace is very efficient in terms of targeting and placing ads in favor of the advertiser, which we think is great. It delivers good value, but it has put increased pricing pressure on our programmatic ads and implicitly, the premium ads are moving into the programmatic sector."

And that means essentially hiring people to work on new products and new revenue streams, and some of it's actually making those hires inside the company. And in our goals with this remix, we really wanted to find a way to work more productively and with greater efficiency and excellence. And I really think that with this current footprint, we are more streamlined and we've made ourselves a lot more efficient. I think the more notable thing is aside from the headcount overall changes to the number, we've actually done a lot of reallocations inside the company to make sure that we have people focused on what's new and what's going to help us build and grow over time. And I had to look at the company when I arrived. We now have quantified it was about 17,000 people working on that business. Today, if I had to estimate, I think we probably have less than 1/3 of that, somewhere between 5,000 and 6,000 people that are working on those legacy businesses even in terms of partial time, summed together, de-duplicated, because we've added so much to the business, be it from the digital magazines or Gemini and some of our search efforts to our acquisitions to mobile, to video. And all those pieces are new things that we're doing. In addition, we've certainly done some shutdowns of some of our legacy operations. But it's really been about remixing and pivoting the company to not only operate efficiently and with excellence but really get focused on that future that we built for ourselves. I mean, the big task when we got to Yahoo was saying, ""Okay, we have several revenue streams that are in decline."" In fact, most of the revenue streams were in decline. And that meant that we had to build ourselves a future, one that was growing fast enough at scale and would grow long enough to really build a future to move into. And that's what the Mavens represents for us and so making sure that we have the majority of our team. And I think at this point, we're about -- at about half really focused on how do we bring our product offerings that are supported by Mavens as well as the Mavens offerings forwards into the future and make sure that they're well-staffed. That's one of the things that keeps me up at night. And I do think that the headcount changes were overall well done. I want to again compliment the team for how they were executed and how they were received. And the bigger piece has been changing the priorities to really put that future in focus."

Ken and I are excited to share our Q2 results with you as well as recent developments in the business. For my portion of today's call, I will provide an update on where we are on our transformation, the spin-off of our Alibaba stake as well as recent progress across the core pillars of our business, including our strategies and investments to return Yahoo to long-term sustainable growth. 
I'm extremely pleased to share that Q2 has a good quarter. We landed the high end of guidance across both revenue and adjusted EBITDA. Also we consider GAAP revenue a strong leading indicator of our business performance and I'm thrilled to report that in Q2, we delivered GAAP revenue of 15% year-over-year. That's the highest level of GAAP revenue growth that Yahoo has seen in almost 9 years. On a revenue ex-TAC basis, our revenue in Q2 is up slightly year-over-year and our adjusted EBITDA came in at $262 million. In terms of Display revenue, we saw the highest Display revenue growth since 2010. We're pleased with the momentum in the Display business with double-digit growth of 15% year-over-year on a GAAP basis and 3% growth on a revenue ex-TAC basis. 
In Search, our revenue grew 22% on a GAAP basis and was down slightly due to foreign currency issues on a revenue ex-TAC basis. For the next phase of our transformation, we will continue to focus on sustaining GAAP revenue growth while we make thoughtful investments, manage costs and strive to grow adjusted EBITDA. 
Before I dive deeper into the core business, I want to touch on the planned spin-off of our Alibaba stake as I know it is top of mind for our investors. We continue to make progress on the work needed to complete the spin-off in Q4, and I want to recognize the internal teams and external advisers who have been working so hard to ensure the timely, successful creation of the new company, which we call Abaco holdings. Ken will provide further details on the process to date, including the registration statement filed last Friday. 
Now let's turn to the core business. For my update today, we will again use the framework of our virtuous cycle: People, products, traffic and revenue. As I said before, with the right people, we will build great products. Those products will drive increased traffic, leading to greater advertiser interest and demand, and ultimately, revenue. This is a key operating principle in our transformation and the reason we continue to hire and retain great people while simultaneously improving our products for our users and advertisers. 
Let's start with people. This past quarter, we have increased the percentage of our workforce, dedicated to sales and technology. This helps us build better products, grow revenue and align the company towards areas of growth. As of the end of Q2, we had just under 11,000 full-time employees and 780 contractors work for the company. This is down approximately 13% year-over-year and roughly 31% over my tenure. The work of our employees are doing has shifted dramatically over the past 3 years, moving from legacy declining businesses to focus on new growth investments. These changes have been an incredible undertaking and I'm proud of what we've been able to do in terms of pivoting the energy of our employees so effectively. 
Turning to products. Our business is built around Search, communications and digital content offerings that inform, connect and entertain our users. I'd like to share some of the exciting things we're working on across these 3 areas, let's starts with Search. Search is a core part of Yahoo and we continue to innovate the Search experience. In Q2, we saw healthy Search metrics with Search clicks up 13% and Price-per-Click up 4%. Search grew by 22% on a GAAP revenue basis and while revenue ex-TAC dipped slightly by 3%, it would've been flat year-over-year on a currency-neutral basis, means in our Search business, we will continue to work hard to grow both GAAP and ex-TAC Search revenue. 
As our investors know, Mobile has fundamentally changed the Search landscape. Mobile search enables us to use context and location to deliver the most relevant action-oriented results for our users. Over the past 2 years, we've thoughtfully invested in and developed our own mobile search with more action-oriented search results rather than endless, we believe we can deliver a better, more intuitive experience. For example, searching for a movie's title returns a beautiful card with a summary, ratings, trailer and nearby showtimes for that movie and when searching for a restaurant, we leveraged our partnership with Yelp to bring reviews, reservations and directions to our users. 
In Q2, we launched our new Mobile Search on the majority of our U.S. mobile search traffic. We will continue to innovate here and we're very excited about the future. On Search monetization the new flexibility in our amended partnership with Microsoft, lets us further enhance the Search experience for our users, advertisers and partners. Search has and will continue to be incredibly important to Yahoo and our renewed partnership with Microsoft represents a major stop in our Renaissance as we drive our generalized Search marketplace forward. We want to provide the best quality Search position for our users and advertisers. 
In Q2, we grew Gemini Search revenue 66% quarter-over-quarter, focusing on key verticals and expanding the platform to PC traffic. Let's turn to communications. As a key driver engagement for our users innovating on the inbox is very important for Yahoo. Recently, we have introduced several new features that let users easily add photos, gifts, files and links to e-mails with 1 click and instantly share webpages in Yahoo Mail when using Firefox Share. We also integrated Twitter and LinkedIn information in our contacts cards and offer Breaking News notifications inside the mail experience. All the while, we continue to protect our Mail users with new investments in spam and phishing detection. 
Since some of our key product communications, we've also been hard at work at Flickr. In Q2, we rolled out a reflash Flickr experience for you to easily upload, organize, edit and share a lifetime of photos and videos across both mobile and desktop. Our Flickr community continues to grow and we're go excited to have led the industry with this redesign. 
Now turning to digital content. Throughout Q2, we have had several exciting launches and announcements in this space. In June, we announced that the NFL selected Yahoo as its exclusive partner to deliver the first global, live stream of an NFL game. Through this partnership, the NFL leverages our global audience of over 1 billion uses, our diverse portfolio of digital advertising capabilities and our delivery platforms across all devices to ensure that fans can watch the game wherever they are. On October 25, the Buffalo Bills and Jacksonville Jaguars will face-off in the NFL international Series in London and it will be streamed live and for free exclusively on Yahoo. We're confident that our partnership provides the ultimate football experience. 
During last quarter's earnings call, I shared that we were working on a daily Fantasy Sports offering with our users already spending more than 30 billion minutes playing Fantasy Sports and Yahoo! each year. Daily Fantasy Sports provides a new opportunity to extend our massive scale. Two weeks ago, we launched our Daily Fantasy offering on Yahoo Sports, unifying our daily and seasonal sports experiences into a single app and we're the only company that offer daily Fantasy Sports as well as full season Fantasy Sports with real-time news and scores all in 1 experience. In the 2 weeks since launch, over 1.3 million users have tried daily Fantasy Sports and the number of players on an our daily games has already exceeded our early expectations. What's more, approximately half of all the users who play Yahoo Daily Fantasy Sports are paying users and we see this percentage increasing over time. 
Beyond exciting developments in Sports, we continue to expand our digital magazines portfolio in Q2 by launching Yahoo Style, Yahoo Movies and Yahoo Celebrity Magazines across nearly a dozen markets in EMEA and APAC. By the end of the quarter, our digital magazines saw approximately 65 million unique users a month, a 10% increase over Q1. Turning to Tumblr. We introduced new discovery consumption and community experiences in Q2 that create new ways for users to enjoy the service. GIFs search and Tumblr TV now gets more immersive and shareable and time for our to the Tumblr community where users can interact with their favorite artists, musicians, creators and celebrities. 
Beyond our direct consumer offerings, we're also working hard to deliver industry-leading tools to developers. Ultimately, this is about syndicating things we're really good at and scaling them to continue our growth. Our Flurry acquisition has gone incredibly well. Following our February launch of the Yahoo Network Development Suite, more than 225,000 developers and their 700,000 apps are reaching 1.8 billion devices. 
During Q2, we added the Apple Watch to Flurry Analytics, enabling developers to understand user behavior in their watch extensions. We also see promising interests and engagement from developers with Yahoo Search and apps. In June, we shared that Touch Pal, one of the most popular Mobile keywords in the industry will integrate Yahoo Search into its app. Through this partnership, users will access Yahoo Search directly from their keyboard without switching to a browser. Following the success of our first Mobile Developer Conference in February, this quarter, we'll host our second Mobile Developer Conference along with our first Mobile Hackathon in New York on August 26. 
Next, let's turn to traffic. An overall network level including Tumblr, we continue to see that more than 1 billion users across desktop and Mobile use Yahoo with more than 600 million monthly active users accessing Yahoo through mobile. Our Mobile user base is up more than 14% year-over-year, still showing strong growth on top of one of the largest Mobile audiences in the world. Our Mobile app investment aligned with the Mobile trends we're seeing for Flurry. We found that Mobile addicts, people who use apps more than 60 times a day, currently account for more than 280 million for all Mobile users and are growing at an incredible rate of 59% year-over-year. 
Taking a closer look at Tumblr, we continue to see great momentum with Mobile monthly active users up 36% since Q2 last year, and overall Tumblr mobile usage is up nearly 70% year-on-year. Now let's turn to revenue. As I mentioned earlier, our GAAP revenue grew 15% year-over-year representing the highest GAAP revenue growth in the company in 9 years. Our Mavens businesses, which include mobile, video, native and social, delivered Q2 GAAP revenue of approximately $400 million, up 60% year-over-year. Nearly 1/3 of overall GAAP revenue. These businesses represent the fastest-growing areas of digital advertising and will continue to be strategic for us. For example, I'm delighted to report that in Q2, Mobile revenues had a $1 billion annualized GAAP revenue run rate, exceeding $250 million in GAAP revenue, up 55% year-over-year. This equates to gross revenue of more than $415 million. 
Mobile now contributes 22% of our traffic-driven revenue. Now let's turn to video. Online video ads are one of the fastest growing areas of digital advertising, with industry experts expecting growth of over 30% in the U.S. in 2015. And video will be an imported growth engine as we reinvent our large legacy Display business. In Q2, we saw video revenue growth of approximately 60%. During this quarter, we did a lot of work to integrate and transition our video business to BrightRoll's platform. Our unified video sales efforts create additional value for Yahoo and its advertisers. Moreover, we continue to integrate Yahoo's proprietary audience data into the BrightRoll demand platform, resulting in a more efficient, effective campaign execution. In keeping with my strong belief that ads should delight and engage users as much as the best content on the Web, we innovated on 2 new ad formats: Native video ads and video app install ads, to help advertisers connect with their audiences. With native video ads, Yahoo combines 2 of the most engaging digital formats, so brand content can be as compelling as the video and is seamlessly integrated into Yahoo Properties as our Gemini native ads. A recent study show that viewing native ads on Yahoo -- video native ads on Yahoo, increase brand favorability up to 50% and purchase intent up to 28%. 
With video app install ads, app marketers and developers can show how their apps work for the video and then urge users to install. This enables them to promote their apps across Yahoo and thousands of other applications through Yahoo Gemini. Our research shows that consumers who download an app after watching a video, use the app 40% more often and 20% longer for each session compared with other install ads. Gemini's native ad offering continue to deliver tremendous value to advertisers globally. In Q2 2015, Gemini native ads made over $130 million, an increase of 19% quarter-over-quarter. This $0.5 billion revenue run rate makes us 1 of the largest native ad networks. Part of this growth is driven by significantly supply through syndication near the Flurry platform. In particular, Yahoo app publishing from the Mobile Developer Suite lets developers monetize their apps using native ads powered by Yahoo Gemini. This has gained significant traction since the launch in February and accounts for 19% of total Mobile Gemini supply in Q2. 
Partner apps like Tango and Pinger have integrated Yahoo app publishing and can now reach 0.25 billion users every day. Moving on to social, we continue to explore innovate yet thoughtful monetizations through and Tumblr. As mentioned on our last call, we launched the Creatrs program in Q4 of 2014 and are seeing solid revenue growth from it. In Q2 2015, the Creatrs program drove 25% of total Tumblr revenue, an increase of approximately 60% since launch. We continue to work hard at Tumblr monetization in a thoughtful, sustainable manner. The opportunity here, given Tumblr's massive engagement is substantial. We've managed growing 60% year-over-year, making up roughly 1/3 of our GAAP revenue, we believe that these areas are the future of Yahoo and we remain committed to their growth. 
I would like to take a moment to discuss our broader Display business. As I mentioned last quarter, our Display metrics have been updated to be more comprehensive in our entire business to include all countries where we operate and the network beyond Yahoo Properties. We have the strongest growth in this place since 2010, 15% GAAP revenue growth and 3% revenue ex-TAC. I really want to complement our sales teams on their efforts here, they executed extremely well this quarter. Our revenue is bolstered by the underlying metrics. Display ads sold grew 9% year-over-year as we continue to build native inventory, especially in the EMEA and APAC regions and added video ad inventory from BrightRoll network. In terms of Price-per-Ad, we saw an increase of 10% year-over-year, primarily driven by increases in native as well as video, which has a higher Price-per-Ad. I also want to highlight that during the first half of the year, we continue to operate efficiently by focusing on products and services that align best with Yahoo's vision and our users needs. Over the coming quarters, we will continue to invest thoughtfully in our business. On that note, before I hand over to Ken, I wanted to discuss some of the trends that we see in our business outlook for the next few quarters. 
You may recall in Q3 of last year, we had a number of beneficial factors that led to a very good quarter. It included the World Cup, new patent license royalties and some accelerated fees around the Alibaba IPO. As a result, we expect to see some pressure in terms of year-over-year trends in Q3. We expect we will continue to show strong, top line revenue growth in terms of GAAP, but our revenue ex-TAC and adjusted EBITDA will likely be under pressure year-over-year. We're also making some important investments for the long-term. We're investing heavily to grow market share through both traffic acquisition and marketing. Two examples are our recently announced partnerships with Mozilla and Oracle. Both our large Search deals that we believe will enhance and stabilize our market share, but they obviously, run at a lower margin than our organic traffic. As we innovate in Search on both Mobile and PC, these types of deals are important distribution and marketing vehicles for our products. They place our enhanced Search in front of millions of users and help keep our Search marketplace vibrant. 
The other critical investment that I'd like to note going into Q3 is Mobile Search. Mobile Search is key to Yahoo's future. Search is half of our business. Users, more and more transition from desktop Search to mobile search and we think it is fertile ground for innovation. We've been investing modestly here over the past 2 years in both algorithmic and paid search technologies. As we unveiled these technologies, it'll be important to give our Gemini platform, which powers our Mobile Search enough investment, traffic and user data to be able to fully optimize our ad system. 
In Q3, we feel that the Gemini Search platform is able to take on increased traffic. Since this is not yet optimized, as we increased traffic to the Gemini Search platform, it will take time to train our algorithms and build-out our marketplace, resulting in pricing pressure and reduce revenue per Search in the short-term. I point this out because this is a big counterintuitive that our investment in the vibrant, Mobile focus Search marketplace will not come in the form of increased operating expense, but instead it will come in the form of pressure on revenue. Ultimately, by allowing our systems to train and by on boarding sufficient advertiser demand, we believe we can achieve superior revenue per Search especially since powering an independent Search marketplace reduces fees paid to third-party Search providers. Developing our own core technology in this area increases our autonomy and control over this critical piece of our business. 
You will see these trends in critical investments reflected in our business outlook, which Ken will take you through quantitatively. In closing, Yahoo's focus can clearly be seen in this quarter's financial, in the quality of the products we deliver and the energy and enthusiasm in purpose that permeate our workforce. Yahoo's transformation is well underway and overall, I'm very pleased with our progress across people, products, traffic and revenue. Now I will hand over to Ken to discuss our financial results in greater detail."
91800,306141520,835354,"Yahoo! Inc., Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 21, 2015",2015-07-21,"Earnings Calls","Altaba Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Melissa. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, I plan to cover highlights from our second quarter results and also update on key initiatives from our prior earnings call. In Q2, our core business delivered good results r",2300,"Thanks, Melissa. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, I plan to cover highlights from our second quarter results and also update on key initiatives from our prior earnings call. 
In Q2, our core business delivered good results relative to our financial guidance and expectations. GAAP revenue grew 15% to 1.243 billion as both Search and Display saw healthy, double-digit growth year-over-year. This led to revenue ex-TAC of 1.043 billion for the quarter. We also continue to drive operational efficiencies resulting in adjusted EBITDA of $262 million and non-GAAP operating income of $108 million. Across all these financial metrics, the company delivered results at the high end of our guidance range. Now before getting into additional details for the quarter, let me provide a progress report on some of our key priorities in driving value for our shareholders. 
First, the spin-off. As many of you know, we filed a registration statement Form N-2 with the SEC in connection with our plan to spin-off our remaining shares in Alibaba, together with Yahoo Small Business, into an independent publicly-traded investment company named Abaco Holdings. This filing is available on the SEC website, using the name Abaco Holdings. The registry statement for the newly formed company provides information about Abaco and the spin, including Abaco's investment objective, capitalization and risk factors and describes key agreements for the planned transaction. While much work does lie ahead, this filing signifies a key milestone. We believe there are strong and legitimate business purposes for the separation and we remain committed to cooperating with relevant regulatory buyers to take the steps necessary to execute this spin-off in Q4. 
We are pleased with the progress to date and are focused on completing this transaction and it's distributing significant value to our shareholders. 
Second, Yahoo Japan. With regard to Yahoo Japan, our board along with the management team, have met with our advisers to review a number of alternatives to maximize shareholder value. Yahoo Japan is an important partner and we see a number of ways to maximize value. While I have no specific conclusion to share today as our work continues, our highest priority is to execute Abaco's spinoff this year and that will receive our highest attention. 
Third, on capital allocation. We have gathered feedback from many of our shareholders and continue to be thoughtful on our capital allocation policy. With the buyback authorization of $2.7 billion, we plan to be flexible as the appropriate timing of any activity. In Q2, we did continue to realize value from our IP portfolio and hedging program to creating additional capital. We realized $9 million from patent sales and this brings us ongoing IP monetization efforts to almost 600 million over the past 3 years. We also received proceeds of $38 million from yen hedges, which cumulatively of approximately $575 million since 2012. We will continue to execute on all types of value creation programs in providing additional capital. 
And fourth, on EBITDA. We are pleased to deliver adjusted EBITDA in excess of our guidance range for the quarter. In this revenue outperformance, we reduced $30 million of sequential cash operating expenses, driven by strategic reductions in headcount and footprint, tight management of our discretionary costs and the benefit from the IP monetization. And as you can see from the headcounts chart over time, we have continued to realign our resources to become more efficient as a business. Our full-time employee base is down by approximately 1,500 from year-end and 10,970 employees. And factory and contractors, our total workforce has been reduced by approximately 31% since the beginning of 2012. We have achieved these efficiencies while integrating acquisitions and increasing the tactical and sales resources to support Mavens' growth. We have taken a number of actions to reduce cost and we are committed to further reducing cost in nonessential areas while reprioritizing investments and several product growth initiatives. 
And in summary, we produced an enormous effort in driving revenue growth and managing cost tightly to discipline and increased accountability throughout the company. At the same time, we have taken significant steps in our asset monetization strategies and capital allocation decision to deliver significant shareholder return. We're now seeing GAAP revenue growth in addition to a more efficient workplace. We also recognize we are not where we want to be, returning to sustainable revenue and EBITDA growth while we focus on a few initiatives, which are already resulting in accelerating GAAP revenue growth. We will continue to drive efficiency and cost management to support our future operating performance. 
Now let's run through our second quarter financial results in more detail. Once again, I will focus most of the discussion around non-GAAP results, which excludes stock-based compensation expense of $125 million, restructuring charges of $20 million, advisory fees of $8 million and a $5 million noncash gain on our work. Please see our earnings slides on the Investor Relations website for a complete reconciliation to our GAAP and non-GAAP results. 
Our financial results for Q2 can be seen on Slide 5. GAAP revenues, as you know is $1.243 billion, which was up 15% in above and midpoint of our guidance. Traffic acquisition costs were $200 million, up $156 million compared to prior year, primarily due to our Mozilla partnerships. The BrightRoll and Flurry business acquired last year and continued momentum in Mobile syndication. And despite negative foreign exchange impacts, revenue ex-TAC grew slightly to $1.043 billion. When excluding FX, revenue ex-TAC was actually up 3% year-over-year. 
Now taking a closer look at Search. GAAP Search revenues was $521 million, up 22% year-over-year. Click-driven revenue in the Americas was up 24% year-over-year, resulting from Paid Click growth to 24% to Mozilla distribution and other Mobile partners. Price-per-Click was flat year-over-year in Americas. Search revenue ex-TAC declined 3%, but would have been flat excluding FX impact. The Americas region Search revenue ex-TAC declined 1% as we saw increases of partner revenue shares that outpaced our Click driven revenue growth, resulting in a decline in revenue ex-TAC. Results of our first quarter without any Microsoft revenue guarantee headwind that we had in the U.S. as that wager expired at the end of Q1 last year. In the Search revenue ex-TAC and may that back together, declined 9% year-over-year, but excluding foreign exchange was up 2%. As most discussed, we are very focused on improving our Search business, taking advantage of flexibility allowed by the recent Microsoft amendment and to optimize our partner deals while innovating our Search offering for our users and advertisers. This means we'll likely have additional quarters where we see top line revenues grow faster than ex-TAC revenue. 
Now moving to Display, we saw a strong acceleration of business from the prior quarter. GAAP Display revenue was $500 million, up 15% year-over-year and is noted the fastest growth since 2010. Display revenue ex-TAC grew 3% year-over-year, [indiscernible] 7% excluding the FX impact. Improved sales alignment, resulted in more stabilization for our legacy PC businesses business and delivered solid execution in our investment areas. In fact, Americas Display revenue ex-TAC increased 11% year-over-year. As Marissa has noted, Display PPA increased 10%, driven by increases in both native and premium as well as an improved mix of video inventory. The Americas saw strong PPA increase of 29% year-over-year. Native PPA saw significant growth from prior year and premium experienced a strong quarter in the U.S. home page. And our Mavens business, our mobile, video, native and social, we are encouraged by an increased momentum of 60% [ph] GAAP revenue growth year-over-year for those areas in aggregate. Mavens has now contributed 35% to our traffic driven revenue, up from 25% from the prior year. We saw a strong sequential growth in video as our integrated BrightRoll plus Yahoo sales efforts are resulting in new wins from large agencies and advertisers. Starting significant sponsorship deals for many of the new video programs showcased in new fronts. Mobile GAAP revenue grew 55% year-over-year, and the Flurry network has enabled us to drive native ad growth through our Mobile Developer Suite launch in the first quarter. Our native Display revenue reached over 130 million in the quarter driven by both volume and pricing growth year-over-year. We have seen increased advertising demand from nearly all verticals. For revenue detail of our region, please refer to Slide 10. The Americas GAAP revenue grew 23% year-over-year due to strong growth in Search of 30% and Display of 25%. APAC GAAP revenue was down 9%, but excluding foreign exchange headwinds, GAAP revenue is down 2% and EMEA GAAP revenue was down 12%, but again, excluding foreign exchange headwinds, GAAP revenue would've been up 3%. Now I'll save a couple of minutes and go through our expenses and income in a bit more detail. Non-GAAP total operating expenses were up 10% year-over-year as we had a net $52 million additional expense benefit from patent sales in the prior year quarter. D&A, depreciation and amortization has remained consistent over the past several quarters at approximately $150 million. Our non-GAAP cash expense for the full quarter were in line with our expectations at $781 million. Excluding patent sales benefits from both years, these cash expenses grew 4%, a $28 million year-over-year, including one, a net increase of workforce expense due to capitalized labor headwind, which was partially offset by headcount reductions of 1,300 year-over-year. Somewhere I would actually lower cost locations as we consolidate facilities around the world; two, marketing expense increased related to brand buildings that will support our growth initiatives; and three, additional bandwidth and algorithm serving cost, partially resulting from the BrightRoll business and Microsoft partnership, partially offset by data center footprint reductions. On EBITDA. EBITDA was $262 million in the quarter where the margin of 25% based on revenue ex-TAC, excluding the benefits from patent sales in both years, EBITDA was down $25 million year-over-year. Non-GAAP operating income was $108 million for the quarter. Running out the income statement, earnings and equity interest were $96 million, although down 63% year-over-year and as a reminder, this now relates primarily to Yahoo Japan's results, 1 quarter in arrears while the prior year included Alibaba results. Our non-GAAP tax ratio is 35% and this is the estimate we expect to use for all of our 2015 non-GAAP presentations. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.16. Our Q2 average fully diluted share count decreased year-over-year by 7% to 948 million shares. Ending share count for the period was also 948 million. Quickly turning to the balance sheet, at the end of the second quarter, we had $7 billion in cash and marketable securities while approximately $5.7 billion net of a convertible and other debt. Our Alibaba investment was $32 billion in the balance sheet, which reflects the Alibaba ADS price at the end of Q2 as this is mark-to-market. Reported free cash flow in the quarter was negative $25 million, which was adversely affected by approximately 47 million [indiscernible] cash used for restructuring and capital spending of $155 million related to our products in Mail, Search and Mavens investment. We do continue to target approximately 500 million for capital spending for the year. Now let me transition and talk about guidance. Before I walk through the outlook, please note that we'll be moving our discussion to focus on GAAP revenue and TAC to better reflect our overall business and product investment we outlined earlier. We will continue to also provide ex-TAC guidance this quarter, but moving forward, our discussion will focus more on GAAP revenue and TAC, like others in our industry. The guidance I'm about to enumerate includes discussion from Marissa's prepared remarks. We expect to continue to grow GAAP revenue as we gain scale and market share in the core advertising businesses. We expect TAC to grow for the next few quarters as we acquire traffic and invest in scaling and optimizing our businesses and partnerships, including Gemini, BrightRoll, Mozilla and others syndication partners. Historically, a sequential revenues ex-TAC trends for Q2 and Q3 have been comparable. Looking at last year, we benefited from other revenue increase of approximately $30 million from prior license revenue and Alibaba-related fees from Q2 to Q3. This, combined with a reduction of typical revenue by $9 million this quarter, results in approximately 40 million of sequential revenue headwind from Q2 to Q3 compared to prior year. Lastly, our Display business was relatively softer in the second quarter 2014 compared to the stronger Q2 we experienced this year. And as our typical amortization ends in Q3, we will see a fairly [ph] sequential 60 million headwind in Q4 and additionally, we may see an impact to Q4 financial results from the separation of Yahoo Small Business. Q2 non-GAAP cash expenses were approximately 790 million excluding the patent sale benefit. We expect some modest increase in cash operating expenses due to investments in marketing to support our Search efforts and several other priority areas, offset by continued efficiencies and other functions. For our Q3 guidance, we expect the following: GAAP revenue in the range of $1.23 billion to $1.27 billion; TAC in the range of $230 million to $270 million, and revenue ex-TAC in the range of $1.0 billion to $1.04 billion. Adjusted EBITDA in the range of $200 million to $240 million and non-GAAP operating income in the range of $50 million to $90 million. 
Thanks again for your time. In closing, we are now seeing top line revenue growth, reflecting the hard work of our business transformation. We remain committed to taking the actions necessary to translate the ad and to invest in stabilization and growth. In building a strong core business, we are best positioned to create return value to our shareholders. With that, Marissa and I would like to take your questions. Lauren?"

Now as because our Gemini native marketplace is really paying off, we also are very hardened when we saw Tumblr as well as BrightRoll. In terms of the increase in TAC in the Display side of the business, some of that is driven by BrightRoll, but we've also had a recent success that really picked up in Q2 around our Gemini syndication. So this is dovetailing our Gemini marketplace with our Flurry acquisition from last summer, but that Flurry SDK is integrated to now more than 700,000 applications. We've now taken those Gemini ads and made those available to all of those advertisers and onboarding some significant partners. So I believe that today, what we saw was 19% of our Gemini native supply in Q2, it was actually through that syndication piece and that also does come with increased TAC. And so you're going to see increased TAC being driven by both BrightRoll and Gemini syndication through Flurry on the Display side of the business."

The new partnership gives us increased flexibility and that we've been excited to explore and we've looked at both what we can do with additional partnerships as well as what we could build on our own. And overall, I do think it will take some time because of all the different changes that happen in our Search business from Mozilla to Oracle, the change in our Microsoft partnership as well as all the different things we're trying on our Mobile Search to ultimately stabilize the business and really get it growing across all the key financial metrics. But overall, what we are seeing is our new mobile search experience is showing terrific results with users. We have a lot less query reformulation, which generally indicates much higher and accurate results and ultimately, save users a lot of time. And we're really heartened by our Gemini Search platform. Whenever there is a new marketplace opening up for Search, it will always have surprised revenue per Search at first, but even where we are starting, overall, I'm really happy within this one, we think it's giving us confidence to really invest in that area this coming quarter, which we are excited about. In terms of what would cause us to fully build-out a Search experience or a Search engine on our platform, we've been pretty clear that I actually think that desktop Search is a reasonably well understood problem, it has good solutions that are available in market and it comes with a lot of user expectations. There's not a lot of room enough for innovation there in our estimation. We think all of the interesting innovation is going to happen on the Mobile Search side and that's why we've been investing heavily in Yahoo Gemini Search, which is where we're focused on. On Mobile, it can also be run on desktop, but its focused on mobile as well as our mobile search efforts, we shouldn't have to improve our algorithmic results on the Search side. And finally, on the percentage of Mobile advertising delivered to logged in users versus logged out users. Our most active applications on the web are around Yahoo Mail. Obviously, all of our users there are logged in. One thing I see just across different reports and analysis is people, I think do underestimate how many users are logged in at Yahoo, in large part driven by Mail. And so I don't have the exact break out of the Mobile percentage. I'm not sure that we would break it out right now, but it's the larger percentage than I think most people would expect because so many of our Mobile ads are delivered either into the mail experience itself or the users who are logged in through that Mail experience."

This is the first Price-per-Ad increase we've had in some time. We're very happy about it, and is driven by a number of different sectors of our business. One, we sold many more of our ads this quarter through premium and while we still are experiencing a legacy drag from our legacy Display business, the Display numbers is $172 million. This quarter, it was down from over $100 million in Q1. So our -- the legacy drag beyond is slow, but also, we just saw great participation across our home page, across sponsorship and a lot are very high-priced ads. They're not necessarily sold programmatically. The other factors we saw was our native pricing is showing really nice improvement year-over-year, and we now do clear so much of our inventory through native ads, but that kind of improvement can really be felt in large gains year-over-year and also the introduction on more in video ads through both the BrightRoll platform as well as through our own Yahoo ONO. Overall, we see much higher CPM's from video, so cross more premium ads being sold, native pricing improving and the enhancement of video pricing being added to the mix, that's really what drove a lot of that 10%. I will say on programmatic, we are Yahoo Ad Manager Plus is performing very well. We are actually seeing improvement or at least stability in pricing to modest improvements in Yahoo Ad Manager Plus year-over-year. The other thing is we've begun to work with some third-party exchanges in areas that are known as pillar campaigns. So for example, when we go to places, the classic Display ad, it follows through tiers of our system. We first try and fill it with a premium advertiser. We then try and fill it with our demand-side platform of Yahoo Ad Manager Plus and the bidding that comes in through that. And for users who are either not identified or an impression that doesn't get sold as some of its other tiers, they essentially move into a system with what we call filler inventory where it's difficult to know what the right ad to target what that user is. But traditionally, we have run our own Yahoo ad exchange for that and we still do. It's a very vibrant platform, but we've now begun taking bids from other third-party exchanges to make sure that we get the optimal price for that unclaimed impression."

And so we're working a lot of these partnerships that we talked about and new investments in growing first GAAP revenue and over time, they will grow engagement -- ex-TAC revenue. And from that, as we continue to invest and become more efficient, we can then see sustainable EBITDA growth. And so where every bidder is confident of what we're doing today than we were in previous time, but it is -- it will take us some time to go through that. We then looked at some of the real positive, we had a -- in my opinion, a very good quarter in Display this quarter, particularly in Americas. We do a lot of things in Search. We have a lot more flexibility as Marissa talked about in terms of growing Search and having more control of the Search, and so we're undertaking that as we go forward, had a number of great partnerships that we've done over the last few quarters. And then the next thing will be to really grow -- have a much more substantive impact from international. So I think we're all on those things. And again, our ability to continue to grow EBITDA is going to be really from growing first GAAP revenue, then ex-TAC revenue, then continue to be very, very efficient in our expense management."

We're demonstrating that. We'll continue demonstrating that, and then over time, we need to demonstrate we can grow the ex-TAC because ex-TAC much more directly drives profit, EBITDA, as well as operating profit. And we will -- we made a lot of good progress on expenses. We will continue to do that. At the same time, we have to sort of thread a needle between really investing and investing in several areas, whether it's Search, whether it's certain areas in marketing and so forth, so we will continue to do that. And so we're going to manage this in a way that we grow revenues and overtime, we manage expense away that we can grow EBITDA, so I'm not going to give guidance here specifically, but we recognize that we have I guess, our best way of saying is we recognize that we do need to grow EBITDA over time. We're fully committed to doing that and frankly, I have a lot more to say about that when we develop our plans for 2016."

For us, GAAP revenue, revenue ex-TAC and EBITDA are all 3 very important measures. We have inherited a business that was in decline and we knew it would take investment and perhaps lower margins over time to really get the business growing the way we would like it to grow. We think that 15% year-over-year GAAP revenue growth shows really strong topline growth. We're doing that at lower margins and that's affecting us both in terms of increased TAC and in increased cost, so that's ultimately driving down EBITDA. Plus, we also have some year-over-year headwinds with regard to the lack of World Cup in this Q3, the Alibaba IPO fees as well as some patent licensings where we're now anniversary-ing them. So in terms of all those headwinds, we are going to see some pressure on ex-TAC and EBITDA, and some of those pressures actually extend into Q4. And so overall, we are very focused on growing all 3 measures. We're proud of the fact that we've grown our GAAP revenue to date and we will now turn our focus to returning revenue ex-TAC and EBITDA to growth. And as you know, we only guide quarter by quarter, so I wouldn't want to speculate beyond Q3 of this year."

We want to be really careful and mindful around that principle. In terms of universal IDs and deblinking, these are things that we welcome. We have a strong sense of user identity here at Yahoo, based on both user behavior across our site as well as our mail data, and I think we're doing a good job leveraging that with advertisers to help them better target their advertising. And Flurry is a remarkable platform that really is allowing us to syndicate ad formats that work in that new types of ad formats, and I wouldn't be surprised if we start seeing some experiments and innovations in deblinking in that platform, overall. And then in terms of local. We think that local is key to Mobile Search.

Ken and I are excited to share our Q2 results with you as well as recent developments in the business. For my portion of today's call, I will provide an update on where we are on our transformation, the spin-off of our Alibaba stake as well as recent progress across the core pillars of our business, including our strategies and investments to return Yahoo to long-term sustainable growth.
I'm extremely pleased to share that Q2 was a good quarter. We landed the high end of guidance across both revenue and adjusted EBITDA. Also we consider GAAP revenue as strong leading indicator of our business performance, and I'm thrilled to report that in Q2, we delivered GAAP revenue growth of 15% year-over-year. That's the highest level of GAAP revenue growth Yahoo has seen in almost 9 years. On a revenue ex-TAC basis, our revenue in Q2 is up slightly year-over-year and our adjusted EBITDA came in at $262 million. In terms of Display revenue, we saw the highest Display revenue growth since 2010. We're pleased with the momentum in the Display business, with double-digit growth of 15% year-over-year on a GAAP basis and 3% growth on a revenue ex-TAC basis.
In Search, our revenue grew 22% on a GAAP basis and was down slightly due to foreign currency issues on a revenue ex-TAC basis. For the next phase of our transformation, we will continue to focus on sustaining GAAP revenue growth while we make thoughtful investments, manage costs and strive to grow adjusted EBITDA.
Before I dive deeper into the core business, I want to touch on the planned spin-off of our Alibaba stake as I know it is top of mind for our investors. We continue to make progress on the work needed to complete the spin-off in Q4, and I want to recognize the internal teams and external advisers who've been working so hard to ensure the timely, successful creation of the new company, which we call Aabaco Holdings. Ken will provide further details on the process to date, including the registration statement filed last Friday.
Now let's turn to the core business. For my update today, we will again use the framework of our virtuous cycle: people, products, traffic and revenue. As I've said before, with the right people, we will build great products. Those products will drive increased traffic, leading to greater advertiser interest and demand and, ultimately, revenue. This is a key operating principle in our transformation and the reason we continue to hire and retain great people while simultaneously improving our products for our users and advertisers.
Let's start with people. This past quarter, we have increased the percentage of our workforce dedicated to sales and technology. This helps us build better products, grow revenue and align the company towards areas of growth. As of the end of Q2, we had just under 11,000 full-time employees and 780 contractors work for the company. This is down approximately 13% year-over-year and roughly 31% over my tenure. The work our employees are doing has shifted dramatically over the past 3 years, moving from legacy declining businesses to focus on new growth investments. These changes have been an incredible undertaking and I'm proud of what we've been able to do in terms of pivoting the energy of our employees so effectively.
Turning to products. Our business is built around Search, communications and digital content offerings that inform, connect and entertain our users. I'd like to share some of the exciting things we're working on across these 3 areas. Let's start with Search. Search is a core part of Yahoo, and we continue to innovate the Search experience. In Q2, we saw healthy Search metrics, with Search clicks up 13% and Price-per-Click up 4%. Search grew by 22% on a GAAP revenue basis, and while revenue ex-TAC dipped slightly by 3%, it would've been flat year-over-year on a currency-neutral basis. With the many new developments in our Search business, we will continue to work hard to grow both GAAP and ex-TAC Search revenue.
As our investors know, Mobile has fundamentally changed the Search landscape. Mobile search enables us to use context and location to deliver the most relevant action-oriented results for our users. Over the past 2 years, we've thoughtfully invested in and developed our own mobile search. With more action-oriented search results rather than endless blue links, we believe we can deliver a better, more intuitive experience. For example, searching for a movie's title returns a beautiful card with a summary, ratings, trailer and nearby showtimes for that movie, and when searching for a restaurant, we leverage our partnership with Yelp to bring reviews, reservations and directions to our users.
In Q2, we launched our new Mobile Search on the majority of our U.S. mobile Search traffic. We'll continue to innovate here and we're very excited about the future. On Search monetization, the new flexibility in our amended partnership with Microsoft lets us further enhance the Search experience for our users, advertisers and partners. Search has and will continue to be incredibly important to Yahoo, and our renewed partnership with Microsoft represents a major step in our renaissance as we drive our generalized Search marketplace forward. We want to provide the best quality Search solution for our users and advertisers.
In Q2, we grew Gemini Search revenue 66% quarter-over-quarter, focusing on key verticals and expanding the platform to PC traffic. Let's turn to communications. As a key driver of engagement for our users, innovating on the inbox is very important for Yahoo. Recently, we have introduced several new features that let users easily add photos, GIFs, files and links to e-mails with 1 click and instantly share web pages in Yahoo Mail when using Firefox Share. We also integrated Twitter and LinkedIn information in our contacts cards and offered Breaking News notifications inside the mail experience. All the while, we continue to protect our Mail users with new investments in spam and phishing detection.
Since photos are a key form of communication, we've also been hard at work on Flickr. In Q2, we rolled out a refreshed Flickr experience for users to easily upload, organize, edit and share a lifetime of photos and videos across both mobile and desktop. Our Flickr community continues to grow, and we're excited to have led the industry with this redesign.
Now turning to digital content. Throughout Q2, we have had several exciting launches and announcements in this space. In June, we announced that the NFL selected Yahoo as its exclusive partner to deliver the first global live stream of an NFL game. Through this partnership, the NFL leverages our global audience of over 1 billion users, our diverse portfolio of digital advertising capabilities and our delivery platforms across all devices to ensure that fans can watch the game wherever they are. On October 25, the Buffalo Bills and Jacksonville Jaguars will face-off in the NFL International Series in London, and it will be streamed live and for free exclusively on Yahoo. We're confident that our partnership provides the ultimate football experience.
During last quarter's earnings call, I shared that we were working on a daily Fantasy Sports offering, with our users already spending more than 30 billion minutes playing Fantasy Sports on Yahoo each year. Daily Fantasy Sports provides a new opportunity to extend our massive scale. Two weeks ago, we launched our daily fantasy offering on Yahoo Sports, unifying our daily and seasonal Fantasy Sports experiences into a single app, and we are the only company that offer daily Fantasy Sports as well as full season Fantasy Sports with real-time news and scores all in one experience. In the 2 weeks since launch, over 1.3 million users have tried daily Fantasy Sports, and the number of players on our daily games has already exceeded our early expectations. What's more, approximately half of all the users who play Yahoo daily Fantasy Sports are paying users and we see this percentage increasing over time.
Beyond the exciting developments in Sports, we continue to expand our digital magazines portfolio in Q2 by launching Yahoo Style, Yahoo Movies and Yahoo Celebrity magazine across nearly a dozen markets in EMEA and APAC. By the end of the quarter, our digital magazines saw approximately 65 million unique users a month, a 10% increase over Q1. Turning to Tumblr. We introduced new discovery consumption and community experiences in Q2 that create new ways for users to enjoy the service. GIF search and Tumblr TV made GIFs more immersive and shareable, and Answer Time brought Q&A to the Tumblr community, where users can interact with their favorite artists, musicians, creators and celebrities.
Beyond our direct consumer offerings, we're also working hard to deliver industry-leading tools to developers. Ultimately, this is about syndicating things we're really good at and scaling them to continue our growth. Our Flurry acquisition has gone incredibly well. Following our February launch of the Yahoo Mobile Developer Suite, more than 225,000 developers and their 700,000 apps are reaching 1.8 billion devices.
During Q2, we added the Apple Watch to Flurry Analytics, enabling developers to understand user behavior in their watch extensions. We also see promising interests and engagement from developers with Yahoo Search in Apps. In June, we shared that TouchPal, one of the most popular mobile keyboards in the industry, will integrate Yahoo Search into its app. Through this partnership, users will access Yahoo Search directly from their keyboard without switching to a browser. Following the success of our first Mobile Developer Conference in February, this quarter, we'll host our second Mobile Developer Conference along with our first mobile hackathon in New York on August 26. 
Next, let's turn to traffic. In an overall network level including Tumblr, we continue to see that more than 1 billion users across desktop and mobile use Yahoo, with more than 600 million monthly active users accessing Yahoo through mobile. Our Mobile user base is up more than 14% year-over-year, still showing strong growth on top of one of the largest mobile audiences in the world. Our Mobile app investments align with the mobile trends we're seeing through Flurry. We found that mobile addicts, people who use apps more than 60 times a day, currently account for more than 280 million of all mobile users and are growing at an incredible rate of 59% year-over-year.
Taking a closer look at Tumblr, we continue to see great momentum, with Mobile monthly active users up 36% since Q2 last year and overall Tumblr mobile usage is up nearly 70% year-on-year. Now let's turn to revenue. As I mentioned earlier, our GAAP revenue grew 15% year-over-year, representing the highest GAAP revenue growth in the company in 9 years. Our MaVeNS businesses, which include mobile, video, native and social, delivered Q2 GAAP revenue of approximately $400 million, up 60% year-over-year, nearly 1/3 of overall GAAP revenue. These businesses represent the fastest-growing areas of digital advertising and will continue to be strategic for us. For example, I'm delighted to report that in Q2, Mobile revenues had a $1 billion annualized GAAP revenue run rate, exceeding $250 million in GAAP revenue, up 55% year-over-year. This equates to gross revenue of more than $415 million.
Mobile now contributes 22% of our traffic-driven revenue. Now let's turn to video. Online video ads are one of the fastest growing areas of digital advertising, with industry experts expecting growth of over 30% in the U.S. in 2015. And video will be an important growth engine as we reinvent our large legacy Display business. In Q2, we saw video revenue growth of approximately 60%. During this quarter, we did a lot of work to integrate and transition our video business to BrightRoll's platform. Our unified video sales efforts create additional value for Yahoo and its advertisers. Moreover, we continue to integrate Yahoo's proprietary audience data into the BrightRoll demand side platform, resulting in a more efficient, effective campaign execution. In keeping with my strong belief that ads should delight and engage users as much as the best content on the web, we innovated on 2 new ad formats, native video ads and video app install ads, to help advertisers connect with their audiences. With native video ads, Yahoo combines 2 of the most engaging digital formats, so brand content can be as compelling as a video and as seamlessly integrated into Yahoo's properties as our Gemini native ads. A recent study showed that viewing native ads on -- video native ads on Yahoo increase brand favorability up to 50% and purchase intent up to 28%.
With video app install ads, app marketers and developers can show how their app works for the video and then urge users to install. This enables them to promote their apps across Yahoo and thousands of other applications through Yahoo Gemini. Our research shows that consumers who download an app after watching a video, use the app 40% more often and 20% longer for each session compared with other install ads. Gemini's native ad offering continue to deliver tremendous value to advertisers globally. In Q2 2015, Gemini native ads made over $130 million, an increase of 19% quarter-over-quarter. This $0.5 billion revenue run rate makes us one of the largest native ad networks. Part of this growth is driven by significant supply through syndication via the Flurry platform. In particular, Yahoo App Publishing from the Mobile Developer Suite lets developers monetize their apps using native ads powered by Yahoo Gemini. This has gained significant traction since the launch in February and accounts for 19% of total Mobile Gemini supply in Q2. 
Partner apps like Tango and Pinger have integrated Yahoo App Publishing and can now reach nearly 0.25 billion users every day. Moving on to social, we continue to explore innovative yet thoughtful monetizations solutions on Tumblr. As mentioned on our last call, we launched the Creatrs program in Q4 of 2014 and are seeing solid revenue growth from it. In Q2 2015, the Creatrs program drove 25% of total Tumblr revenue, an increase of approximately 60% since launch. We continue to work hard at Tumblr monetization in a thoughtful, sustainable manner. The opportunity here, given Tumblr's massive engagement, is substantial. We've managed growing 60% year-over-year, making up roughly 1/3 of our GAAP revenue. We believe that these areas are the future of Yahoo, and we remain committed to their growth. 
I'd now like to take a moment to discuss our broader Display business. As I mentioned last quarter, our Display metrics have been updated to be more comprehensive of our entire business to include all countries where we operate and the network beyond Yahoo Properties. We have the strongest growth in this place since 2010, 15% GAAP revenue growth and 3% revenue ex-TAC. I really want to complement our sales teams on their efforts here. They executed extremely well this quarter. Our revenue is bolstered by the underlying metrics. Display ads sold grew 9% year-over-year as we continue to build native inventory, especially in the EMEA and APAC regions and added video ad inventory from BrightRoll network. In terms of Price-per-Ad, we saw an increase of 10% year-over-year, primarily driven by increases in native as well as video, which has a higher Price-per-Ad. I also want to highlight that during the first half of the year, we continue to operate efficiently by focusing on products and services that align best with Yahoo's vision and our users needs'. Over the coming quarters, we will continue to invest thoughtfully in our business. On that note, before I hand over to Ken, I wanted to discuss some of the trends we see in our business outlook for the next few quarters.
You may recall, in Q3 of last year, we had a number of beneficial factors that led to a very good quarter. This included the World Cup, new patent license royalties and some accelerated fees around the Alibaba IPO. As a result, we expect to see some pressure in terms of year-over-year trends in Q3. We expect we will continue to show strong, top line revenue growth in terms of GAAP, but our revenue ex-TAC and adjusted EBITDA will likely be under pressure year-over-year. We're also making some important investments for the long-term. We are investing heavily to grow market share through both traffic acquisition and marketing. Two examples are our recently announced partnerships with Mozilla and Oracle. Both are large Search deals that we believe will enhance and stabilize our market share, but they obviously run at a lower margin than our organic traffic. As we innovate in Search on both Mobile and PC, these types of deals are important distribution and marketing vehicles for our Search products. They place our enhanced Search in front of millions of users and help keep our Search marketplace vibrant.
The other critical investment that I'd like to note going into Q3 is Mobile Search. Mobile Search is key to Yahoo's future. Search is half of our business. Users more and more are transitioning from desktop search to mobile search, and we think it is fertile ground for innovation. We've been investing modestly here over the past 2 years in both algorithmic and paid search technologies. As we unveiled these technologies, it'll be important to give our Gemini platform, which powers our Mobile Search, enough investment, traffic and user data to be able to fully optimize our ad system.
In Q3, we feel that the Gemini Search platform is able to take on increased traffic. Since this is not yet optimized, as we increased traffic to the Gemini Search platform, it will take time to train our algorithms and build-out our marketplace, resulting in pricing pressure and reduce revenue per Search in the short-term. I point this out because this is a big counterintuitive that our investment in a vibrant, mobile-focused Search marketplace will not come in the form of increased operating expense, but instead it will come in the form of pressure on revenue. Ultimately, by allowing our systems to train and by on-boarding sufficient advertiser demand, we believe we can achieve superior revenue per search, especially since powering an independent Search marketplace reduces fees paid to third-party search providers. Developing our own core technology in this area increases our autonomy and control over this critical piece of our business.
You will see these trends and critical investments reflected in our business outlook, which Ken will take you through quantitatively. In closing, Yahoo's focus can clearly be seen in this quarter's financials, in the quality of the products we deliver and in the energy, enthusiasm and purpose that permeate our workforce. Yahoo's transformation is well underway and, overall, I'm very pleased with our progress across people, products, traffic and revenue. Now I will hand over to Ken to discuss our financial results in greater detail."

Today, I plan to cover highlights from our second quarter results and also update on key initiatives from our prior earnings call.In Q2, our core business delivered good results re",2316,"Thanks, Marissa. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, I plan to cover highlights from our second quarter results and also update on key initiatives from our prior earnings call.
In Q2, our core business delivered good results relative to our financial guidance and expectations. GAAP revenue grew 15% to 1.243 billion as both Search and Display saw healthy, double-digit growth year-over-year. This led to revenue ex-TAC of 1.043 billion for the quarter. We also continue to drive operational efficiencies resulting in adjusted EBITDA of $262 million and non-GAAP operating income of $108 million. Across all these financial metrics, the company delivered results at the high end of our guidance range. Now before getting into additional details for the quarter, let me provide a progress report on some of our key priorities in driving value for our shareholders.
First, the spinoff. As many of you know, we filed a registration statement, or Form N-2, with the SEC in connection with our plan to spin-off our remaining shares in Alibaba, together with Yahoo Small Business, into an independent publicly-traded investment company named Aabaco Holdings. This filing is available on the SEC website, using the name Aabaco Holdings. The registration statement for the newly formed company provides information about Aabaco and the spin, including Aabaco's investment objective, capitalization and risk factors, and describes key agreements to the planned transaction. While much work does lie ahead, this filing signifies a key milestone. We believe there are strong and legitimate business purposes for other separation and remain committed to cooperating with relevant regulatory buyers to take the steps necessary to execute this spin-off in Q4.
We are pleased with the progress to date and are focused on completing this transaction and is distributing significant value to our shareholders.
Second, Yahoo Japan. With regard to Yahoo Japan, our board, along with the management team, have met with our advisers to review a number of alternatives to maximize shareholder value. Yahoo Japan is an important partner, and we see a number of ways to maximize value. While I have no specific conclusion to share today as our work continues, our highest priority is to execute Aabaco's spinoff this year end -- this year, and that will receive our highest attention.
Third, on capital allocation. We have gathered feedback from many of our shareholders and continue to be thoughtful on our capital allocation policy. With the buyback authorization of $2.7 billion, we plan to be flexible as to the appropriate timing of any activity. In Q2, we did continue to realize value from our IP portfolio and hedging programs in creating additional capital. We realized $9 million from patent sales, and this brings our ongoing IP monetization efforts to almost 600 million over the past 3 years. We also received proceeds of $38 million from yen hedges, which cumulatively totals to approximately $575 million since 2012. We will continue to execute on all types of value-creation programs in providing additional capital.
And fourth, on EBITDA. We are pleased to deliver adjusted EBITDA in excess of our guidance range for the quarter. In addition to revenue outperformance, we reduced $30 million of sequential cash operating expenses, driven by strategic reductions in headcount and footprint, tight management of our discretionary costs and the benefit from the IP monetization. And as you can see from the headcount chart over time, we have continued to realign our resources to become more efficient as a business. Our full-time employee base is down by approximately 1,500 from year-end and 10,970 employees. And factoring in contractors, our total workforce has been reduced by approximately 31% since the beginning of 2012. We have achieved these efficiencies while integrating acquisitions and increasing the technical and sales resources to support MaVeNS' growth. We have taken a number of actions to reduce costs, and we are committed to further reducing costs in nonessential areas while reprioritizing investments in several product growth initiatives.
In summary, we put an enormous energy and effort into driving revenue growth and managing our cost tightly through financial discipline and increased accountability throughout the company. And at the same time, we have taken significant steps in our asset monetization strategies and capital allocation decisions to deliver significant shareholder return. We are now seeing GAAP revenue growth in addition to a more efficient workplace. We also recognize we are not where we want to be, returning to sustainable revenue and EBITDA growth, while we focus on a few product initiatives, which are already resulting in accelerating GAAP revenue growth, we will continue to drive efficiency and cost management to support our future operating performance.
Now let's run through our second quarter financial results in more detail. Once again, I will focus most of the discussion around non-GAAP results, which excludes stock-based compensation expense of $125 million, restructuring charges of $20 million, advisory fees of $8 million and a $5 million noncash gain on our Hortonworks warrants. Please see our earnings slides on our Investor Relations website for a complete reconciliation toward our GAAP and non-GAAP results.
Our financial results for Q2 can be seen on Slide 5. GAAP revenues, as noted, was $1.243 billion, which was up 15% and above the midpoint of our guidance. Traffic acquisition costs were $200 million, up $156 million compared to prior year, primarily due to our Mozilla partnerships, the BrightRoll and Flurry businesses acquired last year and continued momentum in Mobile syndication. And despite negative foreign exchange impacts, revenue ex TAC grew slightly to $1.043 billion. When excluding FX, revenue ex TAC was actually up 3% year-over-year.
Now taking a closer look at Search. GAAP Search revenues was $521 million, up 22% year-over-year. Click-driven revenue in the Americas was up 24% year-over-year, resulting from Paid Click growth of 24% through Mozilla distribution and other Mobile partners. Price-per-Click was flat year-over-year in the Americas. Search revenue ex TAC declined 3% but would have been flat excluding FX impact. The Americas region Search revenue ex TAC declined 1% as we saw increases in partner revenue shares that outpaced our Click-driven revenue growth, resulting in the decline in revenue ex TAC. It's also our first quarter without any Microsoft revenue guarantee headwind that we had in the U.S. as that arrangement expired the end of Q1 last year. International Search revenue ex TAC, in EMEA and APAC together, declined 9% year-over-year but, excluding foreign exchange, was up 2%. As Marissa discussed, we are very focused on improving our Search business, taking advantage of flexibility allowed by the recent Microsoft amendment and to optimize our partner deals while innovating our Search offering for our users and advertisers. This means we'll likely have additional quarters where we see top line revenues grow faster than ex-TAC revenue.
Now moving to Display, we saw a strong acceleration of business from the prior quarter. GAAP Display revenue was $500 million, up 15% year-over-year and as noted, the fastest growth since 2010. Display revenue ex TAC grew 3% year-over-year or 7% excluding the FX impact. Improved sales alignment resulted in more stabilization for our legacy PC businesses and delivered solid execution in our investment areas. In fact, Americas Display revenue ex TAC increased 11% year-over-year. As Marissa noted, Display PPA increased 10%, driven by increases in both native and premium as well as an improved mix of video inventory. The Americas saw strong PPA increase of 29% year-over-year. Native PPA saw a significant growth from prior year and premium experienced a strong quarter in the U.S. home page. In our MaVeNS businesses, mobile, video, native and social, we are encouraged by the increased momentum of 60% GAAP revenue growth year-over-year for those areas in aggregate. MaVeNS now contributes 35% to our traffic-driven revenue, up from 25% from the prior year. We saw a strong sequential growth on video as our integrated BrightRoll plus Yahoo sales efforts are resulting in new wins from large agencies and advertisers, signing up significant sponsorship deals for many of the new video programs showcased in new fronts. Mobile GAAP revenue grew 55% year-over-year, and the Flurry network has enabled us to drive native ad growth through our Mobile Developer Suite launch in the first quarter. Our native Display revenue reached over 130 million in the quarter, driven by both volume and pricing growth year-over-year. We have seen increased advertising demand from nearly all verticals. For revenue detail per region, please refer to Slide 10. The Americas GAAP revenue grew 23% year-over-year due to strong growth in Search of 30% and Display of 25%. APAC GAAP revenue was down 9%, but excluding foreign exchange headwinds, GAAP revenue was down 2%. And EMEA GAAP revenue was down 12%, but again, excluding foreign exchange headwinds, GAAP revenue would've been up 3%.
Now let's take a couple of minutes to go through our expenses and income in a bit more detail. Non-GAAP total operating expenses were up 10% year-over-year as we had a net $52 million additional contra expense benefit from patent sales in the prior year quarter. D&A, or depreciation and amortization, has remained consistent over the past several quarters at approximately $150 million. Our non-GAAP cash expense for the full quarter were in line with our expectations at $781 million. Excluding patent sales benefits from both years, these cash expenses grew 4% or $28 million year-over-year, including one, a net increase of workforce expense due to capitalized labor headwind, which was partially offset by headcount reductions of 1,300 year-over-year, similar reductions [ph] at our lower cost locations as we consolidate facilities around the world; two, marketing expense increased related to brand buildings that will support our growth initiatives; and three, additional bandwidth and algo-serving cost, partially resulting from the BrightRoll business and the Microsoft partnership and partly offset by data center footprint reductions. 
On EBITDA. EBITDA was $262 million in the quarter, where the margin of 25% based on revenue ex TAC. Excluding the benefit from patent sales in both years, EBITDA was down $25 million year-over-year. Non-GAAP operating income was $108 million for the quarter. Running out the income statement, earnings and equity interests were $96 million, although down 63% year-over-year and as a reminder, this now relates primarily to Yahoo Japan's results 1 quarter in arrears while the prior year included Alibaba results. Our non-GAAP tax rate is 35%, and this is the estimate we expect to use for all of our 2015 non-GAAP presentations. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.16. Our Q2 average fully diluted share count decreased year-over-year by 7% to 948 million shares. Ending diluted share count for the period was also 948 million. Quickly turning to the balance sheet, at the end of the second quarter, we had $7 billion in cash and marketable securities while approximately $5.7 billion net of a convertible and other debt. Our Alibaba investment was $32 billion in the balance sheet, which reflects the Alibaba ADS price at the end of Q2 as this is mark-to-market. Reported free cash flow in the quarter was negative $25 million, which was adversely affected by approximately $47 million related cash used for restructuring and capital spending of $155 million related to our products in Mail, Search and MaVeNS investment. We do continue to target approximately $500 million for capital spending for the year.
Now let me transition and talk about guidance. Before I walk through the outlook, please note that we'll be moving our discussion to focus on GAAP revenue and TAC to better reflect our overall business and product investments we outlined earlier. We will continue to also provide revenue ex-TAC guidance this quarter, but moving forward, our discussion will focus more on GAAP revenue and TAC like others in our industry. The guidance I'm about to enumerate includes discussion from Marissa's prepared remarks. We expect to continue to grow GAAP revenue as we gain scale and market share in our core advertising businesses. We expect TAC to grow for the next few quarters as we acquire traffic and invest in scaling and optimizing our businesses and partnerships, including Gemini, BrightRoll, Mozilla and others syndication partners. Historically, a sequential revenue ex TAC trends for Q2 and Q3 have been comparable. Looking at last year, we benefited from other revenue increases of approximately $30 million from license revenue and Alibaba-related fees from Q2 to Q3. This, combined with a reduction of typical revenue by $9 million this quarter, results in approximately $40 million sequential revenue headwind from Q2 to Q3 compared to prior year. Lastly, our Display business was relatively softer in the second quarter 2014 compared to the stronger Q2 we experienced this year. And as our typical amortization ends in Q3, we will see a fairly sequential 60 million headwind in Q4 and additionally, we may see an impact to Q4 financial results from the separation of Yahoo Small Business. Q2 non-GAAP cash expenses were approximately $790 million excluding the patent sale benefit. We expect some modest increase in cash operating expenses due to investments in marketing to support our Search efforts and several other priority areas, offset by continued efficiencies and other functions. For our Q3 guidance, we expect the following: GAAP revenue in the range of $1.23 billion to $1.27 billion; TAC in the range of $230 million to $270 million and revenue ex TAC in the range of $1.0 billion to $1.04 billion; adjusted EBITDA in the range of $200 million to $240 million; and non-GAAP operating income in the range of $50 million to $90 million.
Thanks again for your time. In closing, we now are seeing top line revenue growth, reflecting the hard work of our business transformation. We remain committed to taking the actions necessary to translate that into EBITDA stabilization and growth. In building a strong core business, we are best positioned to create return value to our shareholders. With that, Marissa and I would like to take your questions. Lauren?"

In terms of the increase in TAC from the Display side of the business, some of that is driven by BrightRoll, but we've also had a recent success that really picked up in Q2 around our Gemini syndication. So this is dovetailing our Gemini marketplace with our Flurry acquisition from last summer, but that Flurry SDK is integrated into now more than 700,000 applications. We've now taken those Gemini ads and made those available to all of those advertisers, and we've onboarded some significant partners. And so I believe that today, what we saw was 19% of our Gemini native supply in Q2, it was actually through that syndication piece and that also does come with increased TAC.

The new partnership gives us increased flexibility and that we've been excited to explore and we've looked at both what we could do with additional partnerships as well as what we could build on our own. And overall, I do think it will take some time because of all the different changes that have happened in our Search business, from Mozilla to Oracle, the change in, right, in our Microsoft partnership as well as all the different things we're trying on our Mobile Search to ultimately stabilize the business and really get it growing across all the key financial metrics. But overall, what we are seeing is our new mobile search experience is showing terrific results with users. We have a lot less query reformulation, which generally indicates much higher and more accurate results and ultimately, save users a lot of time. And we're really heartened by our Gemini Search platform. Whenever there's a new marketplace opening up for Search, it will always have a suppressed revenue per Search at first. But even where we are starting, we're overall really happy with it. And it's one of the many things that give us confidence to really invest in that area this coming quarter, which we are excited about. In terms of what would cause us to fully build-out a Search experience or a Search engine on our platform, we've been pretty clear that I actually think that desktop Search is a reasonably well-understood problem, it has -- good solutions are available in the market and it comes with a lot of user expectations. There's not a lot of room left for innovation there in our estimation. We think all of the interesting innovation is going to happen on the Mobile Search side, and that's why we've been investing heavily in Yahoo Gemini Search, which is where we focused on, on Mobile. It can also be run on desktop, but it's focused on mobile, as well as our mobile search efforts. We shouldn't have to improve our algorithmic results on the Search side. And finally, on the percentage of Mobile advertising delivered to logged in users versus logged out users, our most active applications on the web are around Yahoo Mail. Obviously, all of our users there are logged in. One thing I see just across different reports and analyses is people, I think, actually do underestimate how many users are logged in at Yahoo, in large part driven by Mail. And so I don't have the exact break out of the Mobile percentage. I'm not sure that we would break it out right now, but it's a larger percentage than I think most people would expect because so many of our Mobile ads are delivered either into the Mail experience itself or the users who are logged in through that Mail experience."

I just wonder if I heard that correctly and what those issues are.

This is the first Price-per-Ad increase we've had in some time. We're very happy about it, and it's driven by a number of different sectors of our business. One, we sold many more of our ads this quarter through premium. And while we still are experiencing, a legacy drag from our legacy Display business, this Display number, this $172 million, this quarter, that's down from over $100 million in Q1. So our -- that legacy drag beyond is slow, but also, we just saw great participation across our home page, across sponsorships and a lot are very high-priced ads. They aren't necessarily sold programmatically. The other factors we saw was our native pricing is showing really nice improvement year-over-year, and we now cleared so much of our inventory through native ads, but that kind of improvement can really be felt in large gains year-over-year and also the introduction of more video ads through both the BrightRoll platform as well as through our own Yahoo O&O. Overall, we see much higher CPMs from video, so across more premium ads being sold, native pricing improving and the enhancement of video pricing being added to the mix, that's really what drove a lot of that 10%. I will say on programmatic, we are -- Yahoo Ad Manager Plus is performing very well. We are actually seeing improvement or at least stability in pricing to modest improvements in Yahoo Ad Manager Plus year-over-year. The other thing is we've begun to work with some third-party exchanges in areas that are known as pillar campaigns. And so for example, when we go to place a classic Display ad, it falls through tiers of our system. We first try and fill it with a premium advertiser. We then try and fill it with our demand-side platform of Yahoo Ad Manager Plus and the bidding that comes in through that. And for users who are either not identified or an impression that doesn't get sold at some of these other tiers, they essentially move into a system of what we would call filler inventory, where it's difficult to know what the right ad to target that user is. We traditionally have run our own Yahoo Ad Exchange for that, and we still do, it's a very vibrant platform. But we've now begun taking bids from other third-party exchanges to make sure that we get the optimal price for that unclaimed impression."

We've always said we were going to focus on people and in engagement or -- and products, or products engagement revenue. In terms of revenue, we're very, very pleased with the GAAP revenue increase, and you saw that. And we said it would take some time before we got the ex-TAC revenue also growing. And so we're working a lot of these partnerships that we talked about and new investments of growing, first, GAAP revenue and, over time, they will grow engagement -- ex-TAC revenue. And from that, as we continue to invest and become more efficient, we can then see sustainable EBITDA growth. And so we're every bit as confident of what we're doing today as we were in previous time, but it is -- it will take us some time to go through that. We then look at some of the real positive. We had, in my opinion, a very good quarter in Display this quarter, particularly in Americas. We're doing a lot of things in Search. We have a lot more flexibility, as Marissa talked about, in terms of growing Search and having more control over Search. And so we're undertaking that as we go forward, had a number of great partnerships that we've done over the last few quarters. And then the next thing will be to really grow -- have a much more substantive impact from international. So I think we're all on those things. And again, our ability to continue to grow EBITDA is going to be really from growing, first, GAAP revenue, then ex-TAC revenue, and continue to be very, very efficient in our expense management."

For us, GAAP revenue, revenue ex-TAC and EBITDA are all 3 very important measures. We have inherited a business that was in decline, and we knew it would take investment and perhaps lower margins over time to really get the business growing the way we'd like it to grow. We think that 15% year-over-year GAAP revenue growth shows really strong top line growth. We're doing that at lower margins, and that's affecting us both in terms of increased TAC and in increased cost, that are ultimately driving down EBITDA. Plus we also have some year-over-year headwinds with regard to the lack of World Cup in this Q3, the Alibaba IPO fees as well as some patent licenses where we're now anniversary-ing them. And so in terms of all those headwinds, we are going to see some pressure on ex-TAC and EBITDA, and some of those pressures actually extend into Q4. And so overall, we are very focused on growing all 3 measures. We're proud of the fact that we've grown our GAAP revenue to date, and we will now turn our focus to returning revenue ex-TAC and EBITDA to growth.

We think that local is something that's really important in terms of people Search needs overall, but we've chosen to rely on partnerships. We've got a great partnership with Yelp, and we have a few other key partnerships in the local space that we think serve our users very well."

Ken and I are excited to share our Q2 results with you as well as recent developments in the business. For my portion of today's call, I will provide an update on where we are on our transformation, the spin-off of our Alibaba stake as well as recent progress across the core pillars of our business, including our strategies and investments to return Yahoo to long-term sustainable growth.
I'm extremely pleased to share that Q2 was a good quarter. We landed the high end of guidance across both revenue and adjusted EBITDA. Also we consider GAAP revenue as strong leading indicator of our business performance, and I'm thrilled to report that in Q2, we delivered GAAP revenue growth of 15% year-over-year. That's the highest level of GAAP revenue growth Yahoo has seen in almost 9 years. On a revenue ex-TAC basis, our revenue in Q2 is up slightly year-over-year and our adjusted EBITDA came in at $262 million. In terms of Display revenue, we saw the highest Display revenue growth since 2010. We're pleased with the momentum in the Display business, with double-digit growth of 15% year-over-year on a GAAP basis and 3% growth on a revenue ex-TAC basis.
In Search, our revenue grew 22% on a GAAP basis and was down slightly due to foreign currency issues on a revenue ex-TAC basis. For the next phase of our transformation, we will continue to focus on sustaining GAAP revenue growth while we make thoughtful investments, manage costs and strive to grow adjusted EBITDA.
Before I dive deeper into the core business, I want to touch on the planned spin-off of our Alibaba stake as I know it is top of mind for our investors. We continue to make progress on the work needed to complete the spin-off in Q4, and I want to recognize the internal teams and external advisers who've been working so hard to ensure the timely, successful creation of the new company, which we call Aabaco Holdings. Ken will provide further details on the process to date, including the registration statement filed last Friday.
Now let's turn to the core business. For my update today, we will again use the framework of our virtuous cycle: people, products, traffic and revenue. As I've said before, with the right people, we will build great products. Those products will drive increased traffic, leading to greater advertiser interest and demand and, ultimately, revenue. This is a key operating principle in our transformation and the reason we continue to hire and retain great people while simultaneously improving our products for our users and advertisers.
Let's start with people. This past quarter, we have increased the percentage of our workforce dedicated to sales and technology. This helps us build better products, grow revenue and align the company towards areas of growth. As of the end of Q2, we had just under 11,000 full-time employees and 780 contractors work for the company. This is down approximately 13% year-over-year and roughly 31% over my tenure. The work our employees are doing has shifted dramatically over the past 3 years, moving from legacy declining businesses to focus on new growth investments. These changes have been an incredible undertaking and I'm proud of what we've been able to do in terms of pivoting the energy of our employees so effectively.
Turning to products. Our business is built around Search, communications and digital content offerings that inform, connect and entertain our users. I'd like to share some of the exciting things we're working on across these 3 areas. Let's start with Search. Search is a core part of Yahoo, and we continue to innovate the Search experience. In Q2, we saw healthy Search metrics, with Search clicks up 13% and Price-per-Click up 4%. Search grew by 22% on a GAAP revenue basis, and while revenue ex-TAC dipped slightly by 3%, it would've been flat year-over-year on a currency-neutral basis. With the many new developments in our Search business, we will continue to work hard to grow both GAAP and ex-TAC Search revenue.
As our investors know, Mobile has fundamentally changed the Search landscape. Mobile search enables us to use context and location to deliver the most relevant action-oriented results for our users. Over the past 2 years, we've thoughtfully invested in and developed our own mobile search. With more action-oriented search results rather than endless blue links, we believe we can deliver a better, more intuitive experience. For example, searching for a movie's title returns a beautiful card with a summary, ratings, trailer and nearby showtimes for that movie, and when searching for a restaurant, we leverage our partnership with Yelp to bring reviews, reservations and directions to our users.
In Q2, we launched our new Mobile Search on the majority of our U.S. Mobile Search traffic. We'll continue to innovate here and we're very excited about the future. On Search monetization, the new flexibility in our amended partnership with Microsoft lets us further enhance the Search experience for our users, advertisers and partners. Search has and will continue to be incredibly important to Yahoo, and our renewed partnership with Microsoft represents a major step in our renaissance as we drive our Gemini Search marketplace forward. We want to provide the best quality Search solution for our users and advertisers.
In Q2, we grew Gemini Search revenue 66% quarter-over-quarter, focusing on key verticals and expanding the platform to PC traffic. Let's turn to communications. As a key driver of engagement for our users, innovating on the inbox is very important for Yahoo. Recently, we have introduced several new features that let users easily add photos, GIFs, files and links to e-mails with 1 click and instantly share web pages in Yahoo Mail when using Firefox Share. We also integrated Twitter and LinkedIn information in our contacts cards and offered Breaking News notifications inside the mail experience. All the while, we continue to protect our Mail users with new investments in spam and phishing detection.
Since photos are a key form of communication, we've also been hard at work on Flickr. In Q2, we rolled out a refreshed Flickr experience for users to easily upload, organize, edit and share a lifetime of photos and videos across both mobile and desktop. Our Flickr community continues to grow, and we're excited to have led the industry with this redesign.
Now turning to digital content. Throughout Q2, we have had several exciting launches and announcements in this space. In June, we announced that the NFL selected Yahoo as its exclusive partner to deliver the first global live stream of an NFL game. Through this partnership, the NFL leverages our global audience of over 1 billion users, our diverse portfolio of digital advertising capabilities and our delivery platforms across all devices to ensure that fans can watch the game wherever they are. On October 25, the Buffalo Bills and Jacksonville Jaguars will face-off in the NFL International Series in London, and it will be streamed live and for free exclusively on Yahoo. We're confident that our partnership provides the ultimate football experience.
During last quarter's earnings call, I shared that we were working on a daily Fantasy Sports offering, with our users already spending more than 30 billion minutes playing Fantasy Sports on Yahoo each year. Daily Fantasy Sports provides a new opportunity to extend our massive scale. Two weeks ago, we launched our daily fantasy offering on Yahoo Sports, unifying our daily and seasonal Fantasy Sports experiences into a single app, and we are the only company to offer daily Fantasy Sports as well as full season Fantasy Sports with real-time news and scores all in one experience. In the 2 weeks since launch, over 1.3 million users have tried daily Fantasy Sports, and the number of players on our daily games has already exceeded our early expectations. What's more, approximately half of all the users who play Yahoo daily Fantasy Sports are paying users and we see this percentage increasing over time.
Beyond the exciting developments in Sports, we continue to expand our digital magazines portfolio in Q2 by launching Yahoo Style, Yahoo Movies and Yahoo Celebrity magazines across nearly a dozen markets in EMEA and APAC. By the end of the quarter, our digital magazines saw approximately 65 million unique users a month, a 10% increase over Q1. Turning to Tumblr. We introduced new discovery consumption and community experiences in Q2 that create new ways for users to enjoy the service. GIF search and Tumblr TV made GIFs more immersive and shareable, and Answer Time brought Q&A to the Tumblr community, where users can interact with their favorite artists, musicians, creators and celebrities.
Beyond our direct consumer offerings, we're also working hard to deliver industry-leading tools to developers. Ultimately, this is about syndicating things we're really good at and scaling them to continue our growth. Our Flurry acquisition has gone incredibly well. Following our February launch of the Yahoo Mobile Developer Suite, more than 225,000 developers and their 700,000 apps are reaching 1.8 billion devices.
During Q2, we added the Apple Watch to Flurry Analytics, enabling developers to understand user behavior in their watch extensions. We also see promising interest and engagement from developers with Yahoo Search in Apps. In June, we shared that TouchPal, one of the most popular mobile keyboards in the industry, will integrate Yahoo Search into its app. Through this partnership, users will access Yahoo Search directly from their keyboard without switching to a browser. Following the success of our first Mobile Developer Conference in February, this quarter, we'll host our second Mobile Developer Conference along with our first mobile hackathon in New York on August 26. 
Next, let's turn to traffic. In an overall network level including Tumblr, we continue to see that more than 1 billion users across desktop and mobile use Yahoo, with more than 600 million monthly active users accessing Yahoo through mobile. Our Mobile user base is up more than 14% year-over-year, still showing strong growth on top of one of the largest mobile audiences in the world. Our Mobile app investments align with the mobile trends we're seeing through Flurry. We found that mobile addicts, people who use apps more than 60 times a day, currently account for more than 280 million of all mobile users and are growing at an incredible rate of 59% year-over-year.
Taking a closer look at Tumblr, we continue to see great momentum, with Mobile monthly active users up 36% since Q2 last year and overall Tumblr mobile usage is up nearly 70% year-on-year. Now let's turn to revenue. As I mentioned earlier, our GAAP revenue grew 15% year-over-year, representing the highest GAAP revenue growth in the company in 9 years. Our MaVeNS businesses, which include mobile, video, native and social, delivered Q2 GAAP revenue of approximately $400 million, up 60% year-over-year, nearly 1/3 of overall GAAP revenue. These businesses represent the fastest-growing areas of digital advertising and will continue to be strategic for us. For example, I'm delighted to report that in Q2, Mobile revenues had a $1 billion annualized GAAP revenue run rate, exceeding $250 million in GAAP revenue, up 55% year-over-year. This equates to gross revenue of more than $415 million.
Mobile now contributes 22% of our traffic-driven revenue. Now let's turn to video. Online video ads are one of the fastest growing areas of digital advertising, with industry experts expecting growth of over 30% in the U.S. in 2015. And video will be an important growth engine as we reinvent our large legacy Display business. In Q2, we saw video revenue growth of approximately 60%. During this quarter, we did a lot of work to integrate and transition our video business to BrightRoll's platform. Our unified video sales efforts create additional value for Yahoo and its advertisers. Moreover, we continue to integrate Yahoo's proprietary audience data into the BrightRoll demand side platform, resulting in a more efficient, effective campaign execution. In keeping with my strong belief that ads should delight and engage users as much as the best content on the web, we innovated on 2 new ad formats, native video ads and video app install ads, to help advertisers connect with their audiences. With native video ads, Yahoo combines 2 of the most engaging digital formats, so brand content can be as compelling as a video and as seamlessly integrated into Yahoo's properties as our Gemini native ads. A recent study showed that viewing native ads on -- video native ads on Yahoo increased brand favorability up to 50% and purchase intent up to 28%.
With video app install ads, app marketers and developers can show how their app works for the video and then urge users to install. This enables them to promote their apps across Yahoo and thousands of other applications through Yahoo Gemini. Our research shows that consumers who download an app after watching a video, use the app 40% more often and 20% longer for each session compared with other install ads. Gemini's native ad offering continued to deliver tremendous value to advertisers globally. In Q2 2015, Gemini native ads made over $130 million, an increase of 19% quarter-over-quarter. This $0.5 billion revenue run rate makes us one of the largest native ad networks. Part of this growth is driven by significant supply through syndication via the Flurry platform. In particular, Yahoo App Publishing from the Mobile Developer Suite lets developers monetize their apps using native ads powered by Yahoo Gemini. This has gained significant traction since the launch in February and accounts for 19% of total Mobile Gemini supply in Q2. 
Partner apps like Tango and Pinger have integrated Yahoo App Publishing and can now reach nearly 0.25 billion users every day. Moving on to social, we continue to explore innovative yet thoughtful monetizations solutions on Tumblr. As mentioned on our last call, we launched the Creatrs program in Q4 of 2014 and are seeing solid revenue growth from it. In Q2 2015, the Creatrs program drove 25% of total Tumblr revenue, an increase of approximately 60% since launch. We continue to work hard at Tumblr monetization in a thoughtful, sustainable manner. The opportunity here, given Tumblr's massive engagement, is substantial. With MaVeNS growing 60% year-over-year, making up roughly 1/3 of our GAAP revenue. We believe that these areas are the future of Yahoo, and we remain committed to their growth. 
I'd now like to take a moment to discuss our broader Display business. As I mentioned last quarter, our Display metrics have been updated to be more comprehensive of our entire business to include all countries where we operate and the network beyond Yahoo Properties. We have the strongest growth in this Display since 2010, 15% GAAP revenue growth and 3% revenue ex-TAC. I really want to compliment our sales teams on their efforts here. They executed extremely well this quarter. Our revenue is bolstered by the underlying metrics. Display ads sold grew 9% year-over-year as we continue to build native inventory, especially in the EMEA and APAC regions and added video ad inventory from BrightRoll network. In terms of Price-per-Ad, we saw an increase of 10% year-over-year, primarily driven by increases in native as well as video, which has a higher Price-per-Ad. I also want to highlight that during the first half of the year, we continue to operate efficiently by focusing on products and services that align best with Yahoo's vision and our users needs'. Over the coming quarters, we will continue to invest thoughtfully in our business. On that note, before I hand over to Ken, I wanted to discuss some of the trends we see in our business outlook for the next few quarters.
You may recall, in Q3 of last year, we had a number of beneficial factors that led to a very good quarter. This included the World Cup, new patent license royalties and some accelerated fees around the Alibaba IPO. As a result, we expect to see some pressure in terms of year-over-year trends in Q3. We expect we will continue to show strong, top line revenue growth in terms of GAAP, but our revenue ex-TAC and adjusted EBITDA will likely be under pressure year-over-year. We're also making some important investments for the long-term. We are investing heavily to grow market share through both traffic acquisition and marketing. Two examples are our recently announced partnerships with Mozilla and Oracle. Both are large Search deals that we believe will enhance and stabilize our market share, but they obviously run at a lower margin than our organic traffic. As we innovate in Search on both Mobile and PC, these types of deals are important distribution and marketing vehicles for our Search products. They place our enhanced Search in front of millions of users and help keep our Search marketplace vibrant.
The other critical investment that I'd like to note going into Q3 is Mobile Search. Mobile Search is key to Yahoo's future. Search is half of our business. Users more and more are transitioning from desktop search to mobile search, and we think it is fertile ground for innovation. We've been investing modestly here over the past 2 years in both algorithmic and paid search technologies. As we unveil these technologies, it'll be important to give our Gemini platform, which powers our Mobile Search, enough investment, traffic and user data to be able to fully optimize our ad system.
In Q3, we feel that the Gemini Search platform is able to take on increased traffic. Since this is not yet optimized, as we increased traffic to the Gemini Search platform, it will take time to train our algorithms and build-out our marketplace, resulting in pricing pressure and reduced revenue per Search in the short-term. I point this out because this is a big counterintuitive that our investment in a vibrant, mobile-focused Search marketplace will not come in the form of increased operating expense, but instead it will come in the form of pressure on revenue. Ultimately, by allowing our systems to train and by on-boarding sufficient advertiser demand, we believe we can achieve superior revenue per search, especially since powering an independent Search marketplace reduces fees paid to third-party search providers. Developing our own core technology in this area increases our autonomy and control over this critical piece of our business.
You will see these trends and critical investments reflected in our business outlook, which Ken will take you through quantitatively. In closing, Yahoo's focus can clearly be seen in this quarter's financials, in the quality of the products we deliver and in the energy, enthusiasm and purpose that permeate our workforce. Yahoo's transformation is well underway and, overall, I'm very pleased with our progress across people, products, traffic and revenue. Now I will hand over to Ken to discuss our financial results in greater detail."

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, I plan to cover highlights from our second quarter results and also update on key initiatives from our prior earnings call.In Q2, our core business delivered good results re",2316,"Thanks, Marissa. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, I plan to cover highlights from our second quarter results and also update on key initiatives from our prior earnings call.
In Q2, our core business delivered good results relative to our financial guidance and expectations. GAAP revenue grew 13% to 1.243 billion as both Search and Display saw healthy, double-digit growth year-over-year. This led to revenue ex-TAC of 1.043 billion for the quarter. We also continue to drive operational efficiencies resulting in adjusted EBITDA of $262 million and non-GAAP operating income of $108 million. Across all these financial metrics, the company delivered results at the high end of our guidance range. Now before getting into additional details for the quarter, let me provide a progress report on some of our key priorities in driving value for our shareholders.
First, the spinoff. As many of you know, we filed a registration statement, or Form N-2, with the SEC in connection with our plan to spin-off our remaining shares in Alibaba, together with Yahoo Small Business, into an independent publicly-traded investment company named Aabaco Holdings. This filing is available on the SEC website, using the name Aabaco Holdings. The registration statement for the newly formed company provides information about Aabaco and the spin, including Aabaco's investment objective, capitalization and risk factors, and describes key agreements to the planned transaction. While much work does lie ahead, this filing signifies a key milestone. We believe there are strong and legitimate business purposes for the separation and remain committed to cooperating with relevant regulatory bias to take the steps necessary to execute this spin-off in Q4.
We are pleased with the progress to date and are focused on completing this transaction and is distributing significant value to our shareholders.
Second, Yahoo Japan. With regard to Yahoo Japan, our board, along with the management team, have met with our advisers to review a number of alternatives to maximize shareholder value. Yahoo Japan is an important partner, and we see a number of ways to maximize value. While I have no specific conclusion to share today as our work continues, our highest priority is to execute Aabaco's spinoff this year end -- this year, and that will receive our highest attention.
Third, on capital allocation. We have gathered feedback from many of our shareholders and continue to be thoughtful on our capital allocation policy. With the buyback authorization of $2.7 billion, we plan to be flexible as to the appropriate timing of any activity. In Q2, we did continue to realize value from our IP portfolio and hedging programs in creating additional capital. We realized $9 million from patent sales, and this brings our ongoing IP monetization efforts to almost 600 million over the past 2 years. We also received proceeds of $38 million from yen hedges, which cumulatively totals to approximately $575 million since 2012. We will continue to execute on all types of value-creation programs in providing additional capital.
And fourth, on EBITDA. We are pleased to deliver adjusted EBITDA in excess of our guidance range for the quarter. In addition to revenue outperformance, we reduced $30 million of sequential cash operating expenses, driven by strategic reductions in headcount and footprint, tight management of our discretionary costs and the benefit from the IP monetization. And as you can see from the headcount chart over time, we have continued to realign our resources to become more efficient as a business. Our full-time employee base is down by approximately 1,500 from year-end and 10,970 employees. And factoring in contractors, our total workforce has been reduced by approximately 31% since the beginning of 2012. We have achieved these efficiencies while integrating acquisitions and increasing the technical and sales resources to support MaVeNS' growth. We have taken a number of actions to reduce costs, and we are committed to further reducing costs in nonessential areas while reprioritizing investments in several product growth initiatives.
In summary, we put an enormous energy and effort into driving revenue growth and managing our cost tightly through financial discipline and increased accountability throughout the company. And at the same time, we have taken significant steps in our asset monetization strategies and capital allocation decisions to deliver significant shareholder return. We are now seeing GAAP revenue growth in addition to a more efficient workplace. We also recognize we are not where we want to be, returning to sustainable revenue and EBITDA growth, while we focus on a few product initiatives, which are already resulting in accelerating GAAP revenue growth, we will continue to drive efficiency and cost management to support our future operating performance.
Now let's run through our second quarter financial results in more detail. Once again, I will focus most of the discussion around non-GAAP results, which excludes stock-based compensation expense of $125 million, restructuring charges of $20 million, advisory fees of $8 million and a $5 million noncash gain on our Hortonworks warrants. Please see our earnings slides on our Investor Relations website for a complete reconciliation toward our GAAP and non-GAAP results.
Our financial results for Q2 can be seen on Slide 5. GAAP revenues, as noted, was $1.243 billion, which was up 15% and above the midpoint of our guidance. Traffic acquisition costs were $200 million, up $156 million compared to prior year, primarily due to our Mozilla partnerships, the BrightRoll and Flurry businesses acquired last year and continued momentum in Mobile syndication. And despite negative foreign exchange impacts, revenue ex TAC grew slightly to $1.043 billion. When excluding FX, revenue ex TAC was actually up 3% year-over-year.
Now taking a closer look at Search. GAAP Search revenues was $521 million, up 22% year-over-year. Click-driven revenue in the Americas was up 24% year-over-year, resulting from Paid Click growth of 24% through Mozilla distribution and other Mobile partners. Price-per-Click was flat year-over-year in the Americas. Search revenue ex TAC declined 3% but would have been flat excluding FX impact. The Americas region Search revenue ex TAC declined 1% as we saw increases in partner revenue shares that outpaced our Click-driven revenue growth, resulting in the decline in revenue ex TAC. It's also our first quarter without any Microsoft revenue guarantee headwind that we had in the U.S. as that arrangement expired the end of Q1 last year. International Search revenue ex TAC, in EMEA and APAC together, declined 9% year-over-year but, excluding foreign exchange, was up 2%. As Marissa discussed, we are very focused on improving our Search business, taking advantage of flexibility allowed by the recent Microsoft amendment and to optimize our partner deals while innovating our Search offering for our users and advertisers. This means we'll likely have additional quarters where we see top line revenues grow faster than ex-TAC revenue.
Now moving to Display, we saw a strong acceleration of business from the prior quarter. GAAP Display revenue was $500 million, up 15% year-over-year and as noted, the fastest growth since 2010. Display revenue ex TAC grew 3% year-over-year or 7% excluding the FX impact. Improved sales alignment resulted in more stabilization for our legacy PC businesses and delivered solid execution in our investment areas. In fact, Americas Display revenue ex TAC increased 11% year-over-year. As Marissa noted, Display PPA increased 10%, driven by increases in both native and premium as well as an improved mix of video inventory. The Americas saw strong PPA increase of 29% year-over-year. Native PPA saw a significant growth from prior year and premium experienced a strong quarter in the U.S. home page. In our MaVeNS businesses, mobile, video, native and social, we are encouraged by the increased momentum of 60% GAAP revenue growth year-over-year for those areas in aggregate. MaVeNS now contributes 35% to our traffic-driven revenue, up from 25% from the prior year. We saw a strong sequential growth on video as our integrated BrightRoll plus Yahoo sales efforts are resulting in new wins from large agencies and advertisers, signing up significant sponsorship deals for many of the new video programs showcased in NewFront. Mobile GAAP revenue grew 55% year-over-year, and the Flurry network has enabled us to drive native ad growth through our Mobile Developer Suite launch in the first quarter. Our native Display revenue reached over 130 million in the quarter, driven by both volume and pricing growth year-over-year. We have seen increased advertising demand from nearly all verticals. For revenue detail per region, please refer to Slide 10. The Americas GAAP revenue grew 23% year-over-year due to strong growth in Search of 30% and Display of 25%. APAC GAAP revenue was down 9%, but excluding foreign exchange headwinds, GAAP revenue was down 2%. And EMEA GAAP revenue was down 12%, but again, excluding foreign exchange headwinds, GAAP revenue would've been up 3%.
Now let's take a couple of minutes to go through our expenses and income in a bit more detail. Non-GAAP total operating expenses were up 10% year-over-year as we had a net $52 million additional contra expense benefit from patent sales in the prior year quarter. D&A, or depreciation and amortization, has remained consistent over the past several quarters at approximately $150 million. Our non-GAAP cash expense for the full quarter were in line with our expectations at $781 million. Excluding patent sales benefits from both years, these cash expenses grew 4% or $28 million year-over-year, including one, a net increase of workforce expense due to capitalized labor headwind, which was partially offset by headcount reductions of 1,300 year-over-year, similar reductions [ph] at our lower cost locations as we consolidate facilities around the world; two, marketing expense increased related to brand buildings that will support our growth initiatives; and three, additional bandwidth and algo-serving cost, partially resulting from the BrightRoll business and the Microsoft partnership and partly offset by data center footprint reductions. 
On EBITDA. EBITDA was $262 million in the quarter, where the margin of 25% based on revenue ex TAC. Excluding the benefit from patent sales in both years, EBITDA was down $25 million year-over-year. Non-GAAP operating income was $108 million for the quarter. Running out the income statement, earnings and equity interests were $96 million, although down 63% year-over-year and as a reminder, this now relates primarily to Yahoo Japan's results 1 quarter in arrears while the prior year included Alibaba results. Our non-GAAP tax rate is 35%, and this is the estimate we expect to use for all of our 2015 non-GAAP presentations. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.16. Our Q2 average fully diluted share count decreased year-over-year by 7% to 948 million shares. Ending diluted share count for the period was also 948 million. Quickly turning to the balance sheet, at the end of the second quarter, we had $7 billion in cash and marketable securities while approximately $5.7 billion net of a convertible and other debt. Our Alibaba investment was $32 billion in the balance sheet, which reflects the Alibaba ADS price at the end of Q2 as this is mark-to-market. Reported free cash flow in the quarter was negative $25 million, which was adversely affected by approximately $47 million related cash used for restructuring and capital spending of $155 million related to our products in Mail, Search and MaVeNS investment. We do continue to target approximately $500 million for capital spending for the year.
Now let me transition and talk about guidance. Before I walk through the outlook, please note that we'll be moving our discussion to focus on GAAP revenue and TAC to better reflect our overall business and product investments we outlined earlier. We will continue to also provide revenue ex-TAC guidance this quarter, but moving forward, our discussion will focus more on GAAP revenue and TAC like others in our industry. The guidance I'm about to enumerate includes discussion from Marissa's prepared remarks. We expect to continue to grow GAAP revenue as we gain scale and market share in our core advertising businesses. We expect TAC to grow for the next few quarters as we acquire traffic and invest in scaling and optimizing our businesses and partnerships, including Gemini, BrightRoll, Mozilla and other syndication partners. Historically, a sequential revenue ex TAC trends for Q2 and Q3 have been comparable. Looking at last year, we benefited from other revenue increases of approximately $30 million from patent license revenue and Alibaba-related fees from Q2 to Q3. This, combined with a reduction of typical revenue by $9 million this quarter, results in approximately $40 million sequential revenue headwind from Q2 to Q3 compared to prior year. Lastly, our Display business was relatively softer in the second quarter 2014 compared to the stronger Q2 we experienced this year. And as our typical amortization ends in Q3, we will see a fairly sequential 60 million headwind in Q4 and additionally, we may see an impact to Q4 financial results from the separation of Yahoo Small Business. Q2 non-GAAP cash expenses were approximately $790 million excluding the patent sale benefit. We expect some modest increase in cash operating expenses due to investments in marketing to support our Search efforts and several other priority areas, offset by continued efficiencies in other functions. For our Q3 guidance, we expect the following: GAAP revenue in the range of $1.23 billion to $1.27 billion; TAC in the range of $230 million to $270 million and revenue ex TAC in the range of $1.0 billion to $1.04 billion; adjusted EBITDA in the range of $200 million to $240 million; and non-GAAP operating income in the range of $50 million to $90 million.
Thanks again for your time. In closing, we now are seeing top line revenue growth, reflecting the hard work of our business transformation. We remain committed to taking the actions necessary to translate that into EBITDA stabilization and growth. In building a strong core business, we are best positioned to create return value to our shareholders. With that, Marissa and I would like to take your questions. Lauren?"

Now because our Gemini native marketplace is really paying off, we also were very heartened around what we saw at Tumblr as well as BrightRoll. In terms of the increase in TAC from the Display side of the business, some of that is driven by BrightRoll, but we've also had a recent success that really picked up in Q2 around our Gemini syndication. So this is dovetailing our Gemini marketplace with our Flurry acquisition from last summer, but that Flurry SDK is integrated into now more than 700,000 applications. We've now taken those Gemini ads and made those available to all of those advertisers, and we've onboarded some significant partners. And so I believe that today, what we saw was 19% of our Gemini native supply in Q2, it was actually through that syndication piece and that also does come with increased TAC. And so you're going to see increased TAC being driven by both BrightRoll and Gemini syndication through Flurry on the Display side of the business."

But what you can see in our Search metrics is clicks as well as queries are up year-over-year as is our Price-per-Click. So we're seeing overall, very healthy trends across all of our different Search metrics, though it is coming with increased TAC and we hope to improve margins over time."

The new partnership gives us increased flexibility and that we've been excited to explore and we've looked at both what we could do with additional partnerships as well as what we could build on our own. And overall, I do think it will take some time because of all the different changes that have happened in our Search business, from Mozilla to Oracle, the change in, right, in our Microsoft partnership as well as all the different things we're trying on our Mobile Search to ultimately stabilize the business and really get it growing across all the key financial metrics. But overall, what we are seeing is our new mobile search experience is showing terrific results with users. We have a lot less query reformulation, which generally indicates much higher and more accurate results and ultimately, save users a lot of time. And we're really heartened by our Gemini Search platform. Whenever there's a new marketplace opening up for Search, it will always have a suppressed revenue per Search at first. But even where we are starting, we're overall really happy with it. And it's one of the many things that give us confidence to really invest in that area this coming quarter, which we are excited about. In terms of what would cause us to fully build-out a Search experience or a Search engine on our platform, we've been pretty clear that I actually think that desktop Search is a reasonably well-understood problem, it has -- good solutions are available in the market and it comes with a lot of user expectations. There's not a lot of room left for innovation there in our estimation. We think all of the interesting innovation is going to happen on the Mobile Search side, and that's why we've been investing heavily in Yahoo Gemini Search, which is very focused on, on Mobile. It can also be run on desktop, but it's focused on mobile, as well as our mobile search efforts which attempt to improve our algorithmic results on the Search side. And finally, on the percentage of Mobile advertising delivered to logged in users versus logged out users, our most active applications on the web are around Yahoo Mail. Obviously, all of our users there are logged in. One thing I see just across different reports and analyses is people, I think, actually do underestimate how many users are logged in at Yahoo, in large part driven by Mail. And so I don't have the exact break out of the Mobile percentage. I'm not sure that we would break it out right now, but it's a larger percentage than I think most people would expect because so many of our Mobile ads are delivered either into the Mail experience itself or the users who are logged in through that Mail experience."

This is the first Price-per-Ad increase we've had in some time. We're very happy about it, and it's driven by a number of different sectors of our business. One, we sold many more of our ads this quarter through premium. And while we still are experiencing, a legacy drag from our legacy Display business, this Display number, this $172 million, this quarter, that's down from over $100 million in Q1. So our -- that legacy drag began to slow, but also, we just saw great participation across our home page, across sponsorships and a lot are very high-priced ads. They aren't necessarily sold programmatically. The other factors we saw was our native pricing is showing really nice improvement year-over-year, and we now cleared so much of our inventory through native ads, but that kind of improvement can really be felt in large gains year-over-year and also the introduction of more video ads through both the BrightRoll platform as well as through our own Yahoo O&O. Overall, we see much higher CPMs from video, so across more premium ads being sold, native pricing improving and the enhancement of video pricing being added to the mix, that's really what drove a lot of that 10%. I will say on programmatic, we are -- Yahoo Ad Manager Plus is performing very well. We are actually seeing improvement or at least stability in pricing to modest improvements in Yahoo Ad Manager Plus year-over-year. The other thing is we've begun to work with some third-party exchanges in areas that are known as filler campaigns. And so for example, when we go to place a classic Display ad, it falls through tiers of our system. We first try and fill it with a premium advertiser. We then try and fill it with our demand-side platform of Yahoo Ad Manager Plus and the bidding that comes in through that. And for users who are either not identified or an impression that doesn't get sold at some of these other tiers, they essentially move into a system of what we would call filler inventory, where it's difficult to know what the right ad to target that user is. We traditionally have run our own Yahoo Ad Exchange for that, and we still do, it's a very vibrant platform. But we've now begun taking bids from other third-party exchanges to make sure that we get the optimal price for that unclaimed impression."

In terms of revenue, we're very, very pleased with the GAAP revenue increase, and you saw that. And we said it would take some time before we got the ex-TAC revenue also growing. And so we're working a lot of these partnerships that we talked about and new investments of growing, first, GAAP revenue and, over time, they will grow engagement -- ex-TAC revenue. And from that, as we continue to invest and become more efficient, we can then see sustainable EBITDA growth. And so we're every bit as confident of what we're doing today as we were in previous time, but it is -- it will take us some time to go through that. We then look at some of the real positives. We had, in my opinion, a very good quarter in Display this quarter, particularly in Americas. We're doing a lot of things in Search. We have a lot more flexibility, as Marissa talked about, in terms of growing Search and having more control over Search. And so we're undertaking that as we go forward, had a number of great partnerships that we've done over the last few quarters. And then the next thing will be to really grow -- have a much more substantive impact from international. So I think we're all on those things. And again, our ability to continue to grow EBITDA is going to be really from growing, first, GAAP revenue, then ex-TAC revenue, and continue to be very, very efficient in our expense management."

If I say too much, I'll have my marketing folks talking to me right after this call, so I'm not going to go too far beyond that, but there are a number of things that we feel are important. But in the main, we do have to -- we are watching expenses overall because, to an earlier question, we are also extremely mindful of what we need to do to execute on our operating profits as well as our EBITDA growth over time."

And then I guess, as related to that, so how far are we from potentially seeing the ex-TAC revenue starting to show growth? Is that a 2016 number or is that maybe later? And then just on the Alibaba deal, I know you're not going to see a whole lot, but mechanically, is there a said date by which you guys will know whether the Alibaba spin will be completely tax-free or not?

For us, GAAP revenue, revenue ex-TAC and EBITDA are all 3 very important measures. We have inherited a business that was in decline, and we knew it would take investment and perhaps lower margins over time to really get the business growing the way we'd like it to grow. We think that 15% year-over-year GAAP revenue growth shows really strong top line growth. We're doing that at lower margins, and that's affecting us both in terms of increased TAC and in increased cost, that are ultimately driving down EBITDA. Plus we also have some year-over-year headwinds with regard to the lack of World Cup in this Q3, the Alibaba IPO fees as well as some patent licenses where we're now anniversary-ing them. And so in terms of all those headwinds, we are going to see some pressure on ex-TAC and EBITDA, and some of those pressures actually extend into Q4. And so overall, we are very focused on growing all 3 measures. We're proud of the fact that we've grown our GAAP revenue to date, and we will now turn our focus to returning revenue ex-TAC and EBITDA to growth. And as you know, we only guide quarter by quarter, so I wouldn't want to speculate beyond Q3 of this year."

So that will be behind us. So we recognize that, and again, I think I sort of colored how we think about we are growing GAAP revenue, we do want to see over time revenue ex TAC growing, and then obviously, with good expense management, we want to show EBITDA growth. I'm really not going to add -- I think I've said it about 3 times, but I think for all good reasons, we will limit our discussion on the spin and everything to do with the spin with our public filings.

Obviously, that's one of the things that attracts advertisers to programmatic pricing. We want to be really careful and mindful around that principle. In terms of universal IDs and deep linking, these are things that we welcome. We have a strong sense of user identity here at Yahoo, based on both user behavior across our site as well as our mail data, and I think we're doing a good job leveraging that with advertisers to help them better target their advertising. And Flurry is a remarkable platform that really is allowing us to syndicate ad formats that work, invent new types of ad formats, and I wouldn't be surprised if we start seeing some experiments and innovation in deep linking in that platform overall. And in terms of local, we think that local is key to Mobile Search. We think that local is something that's really important in terms of people Search needs overall, but we've chosen to rely on partnerships. We've got a great partnership with Yelp, and we have a few other key partnerships in the local space that we think serve our users very well."

For my portion of today's call, I will discuss our quarterly performance, our planned spinoff of Aabaco Holdings as well as the core of our business. Let's begin with a su",2927,"Good afternoon, and welcome to our live earnings webcast hosted on Yahoo Finance. For my portion of today's call, I will discuss our quarterly performance, our planned spinoff of Aabaco Holdings as well as the core of our business. 
Let's begin with a summary of our financial performance. We delivered $1,226,000,000 of GAAP revenue, up 7% year-over-year. In terms of revenue ex-TAC, we delivered $1,002,000,000, down 8% year-over-year. Throughout the quarter, we continued to balance our investments and costs, delivering $244 million of adjusted EBITDA. 
Our Display revenue continues to see double-digit growth of 14% year-over-year on a GAAP basis and 2% growth on a revenue ex-TAC basis. On the Search side, our revenue -- our GAAP revenue grew 13% and was down about 13% on an ex-TAC basis due to investments in our Yahoo Gemini platform and traffic acquisition costs. 
Looking ahead, our Q4 outlook, which Ken will return to later, is not indicative of the performance we want. While there are some well-known headwinds year-over-year and even quarter-over-quarter like the loss of the Alibaba TIPLA, we are also experiencing continued revenue headwinds in our core business, especially in the legacy portions. 
With the spinoff of Aabaco Holdings pending and our annual planning for next year in full swing, we see a unique moment and opportunity for Yahoo as we move into 2016 to narrow our strategy and focus on fewer products with higher quality to achieve better growth and better results. We will share the details of this plan, in which we aim to delineate our focus, improve our execution and define our relevance to users at our next earnings release, if not before.
I'd like to now speak about our Q3 results in the context of the key drivers of our business: people, products, traffic and revenue. Starting with people. We ended the quarter with 10,700 full-time employees and just under 800 contractors, bringing our overall headcount down 14% year-over-year and down 32% over the current management's tenure. We will continue to be disciplined on our headcount, and our thoughtful work on this area has helped appreciably on expenses. 
In Q3, we maintained our focus on attracting and retaining a strong sales and technical workforce to accelerate our growth. In all, roughly 7 out of every 10 new employees were hired into sales or engineering. Our hiring process continues to be rigorous and primarily focused on the talent that will help us drive user engagement and revenue growth.
Recently, there has been external interest and speculation in the few shifts amidst our management team. The design and changes in Yahoo's leadership team are the results of careful planning to achieve the necessary skills, passion and the ability to execute growth in our business. Our leadership team today is unequivocally the strongest during my tenure.
Turning to our product progress. We continue to pride ourselves on being the indispensable guide to digital information across search, communications and digital content. Ultimately, this is about informing, connecting and entertaining our users. 
Let's start with Search. Yahoo has a healthy search market share today, and our Q3 numbers reflect some of the growth levers we're exploring. As our investors know, we've made large strategic changes to the business to improve the quality of our traffic and our partners, investing in our own Search marketplace while introducing even more competitive monetization choices. This long-term strategy will not be defined by a single quarter. Over the next few quarters, we're working to differentiate our product across both algorithmic and paid search results. 
We will also continue the momentum needed to drive our Gemini platform forward by moving additional demand to the system and building robust marketplace. As we discussed in our last earnings call, this investment will suppress revenue in the short term but will result in better monetization over the long term. 
Mobile search continues to be a critical area of investment for us, and one of the key ways we are investing is by moving additional traffic and advertisers to the Gemini platform in order to fully optimize and train our ad system. Overall, we remain optimistic about growth opportunities in Search. 
As you know in April, we amended our Search alliance with Microsoft, which provide us with significant additional flexibility. Our relationship with Microsoft remains strong and vibrant, and the teams have been working through the changes in our relationship and marketplace very effectively. I'd like to thank Satya and his team for their terrific efforts and partnership. 
In addition, today, I'm pleased to announce that we have signed a 3-year partnership with Google to bolster our Search capabilities. This partnership will be supplementary to our existing relationship with Microsoft. The partnership with Google is nonexclusive and does not have minimum volume commitments. It covers both desktop and mobile traffic in the United States and many of our primary international markets. It is subject to a voluntary regulatory review by the Department of Justice and will only be implemented after that. 
Overall, we believe that by establishing partnerships with both leaders in the search space, we can achieve a competitive search dynamic that will provide a better experience for our users and advertisers and will improve our monetization.
Looked at our Search monetization in Q3, we saw click-driven revenue growth 3% year-over-year. In terms of click volume, we saw 5% growth, driven primarily by our distribution partners. Meanwhile, we saw Price-per-Click decline 2%. At an overall level, while we saw the Search revenue grow 13% on a GAAP basis decline by 13% on a revenue ex-TAC basis. We will continue to work hard to grow Search on both a GAAP and revenue ex-TAC basis. 
On the product side, our teams continue to iterate and innovate across mobile and desktop search to deliver enhanced experiences to all of our users. On the consumer side, we launched a new hotel search experience in partnership with TripAdvisor, which offers details on hotel ratings, reviews and photos directly on the search page. 
We're also seeing that mobile devices are transforming shopping behaviors, and we want to leverage the power of mobile search and native ads to help advertisers connect which shoppers. In Q3, we rolled out Gemini product listing ads, giving merchants access to Yahoo smartphone search inventory to help them drive even more shoppers to their products. 
And with the launch of click-to-call ads, advertisers can now add a call button to their native search ad that brings users 1 tap away from a conversation with them. Overall, we have significantly changed the business in ways that are strategically advantageous. But these changes will take a few quarters to translate into higher growth and margins. Achieving those improved margins and higher growth in Search is a key priority for us.
Next, communications. For the past 18 years, Yahoo Mail has been a key driver of engagement for our users, and creating the most innovative inbox experience remains an important goal for us. In Q3, our product teams were hard at work improving the design and differentiation of Yahoo Mail, to grow engagement and to bring new users to the product. 
Just last week, we launched the new Yahoo Mail mobile application to an extremely positive reception. In addition to focusing on back-end improvements to improve speed and performance, we also refreshed the design, making Mail more beautiful and intuitive. We introduced multiple account support, making it easier for users to access their other email accounts directly from Yahoo Mail. And we took an industry-leading step towards a password-free future with the announcement of Yahoo Account Key, which pushes notifications to your phone to provide fast, convenient and secure way to access your Yahoo accounts without having to memorize a password. This also makes it significantly easier to protect our users going forward -- accounts going forward. Overall, we are optimistic about our prospects in the communications space.
Digital content is all about entertaining our users across their interests. During our last earnings call, we announced that we had launched our Yahoo Sports Daily Fantasy Product for Major League Baseball. And in September, we kicked off the NFL season. We've been in the Fantasy Sports business for 18 years, and these most recent launches have helped Yahoo improve the overall fantasy experience for our users. 
To date, our Daily Fantasy Sports offerings have exceeded our expectations in engagement and revenue. Daily Fantasy Sports is still a nascent industry, and we're monitoring industry trends and events closely. Daily Fantasy Sports is an exciting and evolving space, and we've been really pleased with how our product has been received.
Last quarter, we also announced our partnership with the NFL to deliver the first free global live streamed NFL game. We invite you to tune in this coming Sunday, October 25, when the Buffalo Bills and the Jacksonville Jaguars face off in the NFL International Series game in London, streams live across Yahoo's properties globally, including Yahoo Sports and Tumblr. We know our users will be very excited to see this game, and our advertisers have been too. We've already sold out all of our game day advertisements. 
This quarter, we acquired Polyvore, a leading social commerce site that lets users across the globe discover and shop for their favorite products in fashion, beauty and home decor. This acquisition brings Polyvore's expertise and community-driven experiences and retailer-supported commerce to Yahoo and is aligned with our Mavens businesses. Already, the Polyvore team has hit the ground running, successfully integrating more than 400 of our advertisers with Yahoo product listing ads. These ads have started appearing in Yahoo's Search results, and while the integration is still in the early stages, we see great promise.
Let's turn to Tumblr. We're pleased with the growth of mobile engagement on Tumblr, with mobile usage increasing at the industry rate, if not faster. We now see 81% of Tumblr daily active users coming through mobile devices. 
On the product front, we refreshed the user interface for re-blogging to improve readability of conversations and better utilize screen space on Mobile. Continuing to lift Tumblr engagement in mobile through new and engaging features has been and will continue to be an important priority. 
Finally, we're continuing our commitment to mobile growth with our developer offerings. In August, we hosted over 500 developers at Yahoo -- at the Yahoo Mobile Developer Conference in New York, where we announced new additions to the Yahoo Mobile Developer Suite. 
With Tumblr In-App Sharing, developers can now integrate Tumblr's share buttons into their applications, giving users the ability to post content to Tumblr and link back to the source application. We also announced an update to Flurry Analytics that will allow developers to have instant insight into their app's real-time activity, and developers interested in monetization can integrate native video ad into their apps. We have found native video ads to be one of the best performing ad formats.
Our overall network, including Tumblr, continued to serve a global user base of more than 1 billion monthly active users. Yahoo's mobile audience of over 600 [ph] users continues to show growth. We already have substantial user scale so one of our key focuses heading into 2016 is improving user engagement on our products, especially on mobile. 
Now turning to revenue. As we endeavor to build a truly global advertising business, it's critical for us to create a unified global effort for our customers. To that end, in Q3, Lisa Utzschneider was promoted to Chief Revenue Officer. As part of this change, we have aligned our sales team under Lisa's leadership to sync our efforts more closely and to create a unified global voice for our advertisers. Lisa's operational rigor and client-centric thinking is exactly what we need in order to grow revenue.
Our Mavens businesses, which include mobile, video, native and social, delivered Q3 GAAP revenue of approximately $420 million, up 43% year-over-year, nearly 35% of overall GAAP revenue. These businesses represent the fastest-growing areas of digital advertising and will continue to be strategic to our transformation.
Mobile has been our biggest win for our -- the company so far. I'm delighted to report that in Q3, mobile revenues generated approximately $270 million in GAAP revenue, up 31% year-over-year. This equates to gross revenue of more than $420 million. Mobile now contributes at least 24% of our traffic-driven revenue. 
Now let's turn to video. Our video GAAP revenue has more than doubled year-over-year, and video Price-per-Ad is helping drive our overall Price-per-Ad growth. Global video streams nearly doubled year-over-year, and time spent watching videos is up 82% year-over-year across our original, editorial and partner content. 
Native video ads are also performing well on both mobile and desktop, with revenue up approximately 40% quarter-over-quarter. This quarter, we announced our plans to unify all of our programmatic advertising technology under the BrightRoll brand, which we acquired last year as part of our M&A strategy. 
The BrightRoll DSP is our efficient programmatic buying platform for video display and native advertising. And the BrightRoll Exchange is our marketplace that can to sellers and video and display inventory to be run across Yahoo and other premium publishers. This exchange is integrated with more than 100 DSPs and enables access to thousands of sites and applications via Real-Time Bidding, private marketplaces and programmatic direct. With the video advertising industry continuing to grow significantly, we're excited to catch this wave.
Online advertising is also continuing an aggressive shift towards native ads, especially as they continue to prove their effectiveness. On average, native ads get 3x more attention than other display ads and about 50% more emotional resonance than traditional ads. 
Tapping into this industry shift, we introduced our Gemini platform, the first unified marketplace for mobile search and native advertising. And the native side of Gemini's platform is showing terrific momentum. In Q3 2015, Gemini native ads delivered an increase of over 90% year-over-year and 10% quarter-over-quarter. 
A large driver of this growth is syndicated supply through the Flurry network, which was up approximately 65% year-over-year in the United States. Particular -- in particular, Yahoo App Publishing from our mobile developer suite now makes up nearly 40% of the total mobile Gemini revenue and more than 1/4 of the total Gemini supply. Also, we saw international supply increase by approximately 35% over last quarter as we deployed new ad units on Gemini internationally.
Turning to social. Tumblr continues to be a long-term strategic play for us. Over the quarter, we have worked hard to integrate the sales and operations teams and continued to make enhancements to the ad products to drive monetization. 
In Q2, we launched a new ad format, the Tumblr Sponsored Day, that allows brands to advertise at the top of the Tumblr dashboard for 24 hours. And in Q3, we enhanced the Sponsored Day visual experience with a big beautiful banner and extended this ad unit to our mobile experiences, where most of our daily active users engage with us. 
We're also ramping -- we're also focused on ramping up app install ads on Tumblr. With apps comprising 90% of time spent on mobile, we think there's a lot of promise, especially for millennials. We're seeing demand from advertisers as Tumblr's client base for app install ads grew more than 60% last quarter. Our sponsored video ads have also grown to be a significant portion of Tumblr's business. Revenue from these ads are up 35% quarter-over-quarter and nearly 60% since launching in Q4 of last year.
Moving on to the Mavens businesses, I'd also like to take a moment to discuss our broader Display trends. Over the quarter, ads sold were up 8% year-over-year, driven in part by syndicated native ads as well as video inventory growth from BrightRoll. This was partially offset by a decrease in premium and Audience Ads. Price-per-Ad was up 8% year-over-year, driven by increases in native globally and video representing a larger share of the inventory mix.
Before I hand it over to Ken to discuss our financial results in greater depth, I wanted to take a moment to comment on the planned spinoff of Aabaco Holdings. We continue to make good progress and strive to complete the spin in Q4. We do want to note that due to the time needed to satisfy certain conditions, including completing the required SEC process, the final approval of both the Yahoo and Aabaco boards, compliance with the notice requirements under the convertible note indenture and taking into consideration holiday market closures at the end of the quarter, the transaction may ultimately conclude in January. I also want to take this opportunity to thank everyone who's been working tirelessly on the spin. It's an important moment for the company, for our investors and a significant event in Yahoo's history.
Overall, I have very aggressive expectations for Yahoo's core business. We have the right talent, the right strategy and the right assets to drive long-term sustainable growth for our investors. As we look towards a post-spin 2016, we think there's a unique opportunity to reset and realign against the most impactful areas of focus. This will require us to simplify our structure, improve expense discipline and prioritize our investments to improve growth and profitability. 
We remain deeply committed to doing what's best for Yahoo and delivering the most value to our shareholders. And we believe more strongly than ever that continued focus will help us accelerate our long-term growth and set us up for future success. Now I'd like to turn it over to Ken to talk more about Q3."

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Today, I'd like to review our third quarter operation results in more detail and also provide an update on the Aabaco spinoff transaction and later close with the outlook for the upcoming quarter.
We continued to grow GAAP revenue in Q3 to $1.226 billion, representing a 7% increase year-over-year. Through additional partnership and affiliates, we increased the total advertising dollars in our ecosystem, leading to the Search and Display revenue growth of 13% and 14%, respectively. 
Traffic acquisition costs increased by $169 million year-over-year to $223 million due to the additional contribution of off-network traffic and affiliate revenue. This resulted in revenue ex-TAC of $1.002 billion. In Q3, we effectively managed our cost base to deliver EBITDA of $244 million and non-GAAP operating income of $92 million. 
We allocated appropriate resources and capital for growth initiatives while also realizing operating efficiencies through office consolidations and workforce expenses to reduce our cash operating costs to $758 million in the quarter. 
And similar to prior trends, our full-time employee base declined by approximately 300 in the quarter, ending in 10,700. This results in a year-over-year reduction of 1,800, up 14%, even after including the acquisitions of BrightRoll and Polyvore. Our technical headcount remains steady at approximately half our employee base, while G&A-related personnel costs have decreased. As we continue to remix and align resource to focus on key growth areas, we are mindful of our overall cost structure and improving operation efficiencies to focus on sustainably improving our EBITDA margins over time.
Before diving further into the financial details of the quarter, let me make a couple of comments on the Aabaco spinoff transaction. After carefully considering the company's options and feedback we received from our shareholders, our board authorized the company to continue to pursue the planned spinoff without a private letter ruling on the basis of the receipt of a favorable tax opinion from council. As Marissa noted, there are a number of factors to consider as we drive the transaction to conclusion, including regulatory processes, respective board approvals, requirements and holiday market closures. 
We remain focused on executing the transaction as soon as possible and look forward to updating you on the complete spinoff as well as our go-forward plan for core Yahoo on our Q4 earnings call. 
I am focusing on the following for Q4: one, we're working diligently to complete the spinoff transaction; two, build a 2016 financial and operational plan that is realistic and executable and achieving our goals for revenue, earnings, EBITDA and free cash flow; three, develop a plan and strategy to communicate to our investors our core company direction post-spin, which includes how best to optimize our investment in Yahoo Japan; and finally, finish 2015 financially as strong as possible to set the stage for 2016.
Now let's run through our third quarter financial results in more detail. Once again, I will focus most of the discussion around the non-GAAP results, which excludes stock-based compensation expense of $110 million, restructuring charge of $26 million and asset impairment charge of $42 million and $13 million noncash loss on our Hortonworks warrants. Please see our earnings slides on our Investor Relations website for a complete reconciliation between our GAAP and non-GAAP results.
Our financial highlights for Q3 can be seen on Slide 5. GAAP revenue was $1.226 billion, up 7% year-over-year or 10%, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Traffic acquisition costs were $223 million, which were up $169 million compared to the prior year, primarily due to our Mozilla partnership, Gemini Search and growth in Affiliate Mobile Display from our BrightRoll platform and Flurry business Yahoo App Publishing. Revenue ex-TAC was $1.002 billion, which includes a negative foreign exchange impact of approximately $30 million on a year-over-year basis. 
Taking a closer look at Search, GAAP search revenue was $509 million, up 13% year-over-year. Search revenue ex-TAC declined 13% year-over-year, driven by increasing partner payments click-driven revenue growth of 3% as well as our investment in Gemini as Marissa has discussed. 
We are making good progress on our internal search efforts under Gemini. Our sales teams have already secured thousands [ph] of accounts on the Gemini Search platform, and we fully expect to drive more advertisers and traffic onto the platform over the next quarter. 
Now moving to Display. We saw a continuation of growth trends from the prior quarter. GAAP Display revenue was also $509 million, up 14% year-over-year as a result of our growing affiliate partnerships and video business. Display ads sold and PPA each increased 8% year-over-year. The Americas saw a strong PPA increase of 24%, driven by native and improved mix of video inventory. 
Native PPA continued to see meaningful growth from the prior year. Our advertisers are seeing success in mobile by leveraging targeting capabilities available to Flurry. Display revenue ex-TAC grew 2% year-over-year or 6% excluding the impact of foreign exchange. 
In our Mavens businesses, we saw 43% GAAP revenue growth year-over-year for those areas in aggregate. Mavens now contributes 38% to our traffic-driven revenue, up from 29% in the prior year. 
Video enjoyed a good quarter of growth as we continue to increase supply and demand across all areas of video business. For example, a fast-growing autoplay video supply is now fully available in the unified BrightRoll platform. We're also looking forward to delivering premium video content in our upcoming webcast of the London NFL game this Sunday, October 25. 
Mobile GAAP revenue grew 31% year-over-year. We held a second Mobile Developer Conference in New York City this past quarter and continue to see strong native growth through Yahoo App Publishing in our international regions. Our native display revenue across all devices reached approximately $145 million in the quarter, driven by growth in both volume and pricing year-over-year.
For Tumblr, our priority remains user growth and engagements, which will lead to improved monetization. We are pursuing multiple paths to achieve increased monetization through our unified Yahoo sales force, including deeper integration with our rapidly growing Gemini marketplace. We expect to update the financial performance for Tumblr at the end of the year.
Other revenue ex-TAC declined 6% year-over-year due primarily to the decline in Alibaba-related fees of $14 million, Time Warner e-commerce and other operation declines across [indiscernible] listing of fees. 
For revenue detail by region, please refer to Slide 10. Americas GAAP revenue grew 13% year-over-year due to the strong growth in Search of 20%, Display of 22%. APAC GAAP revenue was down 15%. Excluding FX headwinds, GAAP revenue is down 6%. EMEA GAAP revenue was down 11% but excluding FX, GAAP revenue was up 2%. 
Now let's take a couple of minutes to go through our expenses and income in a bit more detail. Non-GAAP total operating expenses were down 3% year-over-year. DNA has remained consistent over the past several quarters at approximately $150 million. Our non-GAAP cash expense for the full quarter came in better than expectation at $758 million, declining 4% year-over-year. This was the result of our ongoing improvements to drive operating efficiencies for the company: one, a $38 million decrease in workforce expenses achieved through a reduction in full-time employees while integrating acquisitions and redeploying resources to our strategic areas; two, a $10 million decrease in facilities as we see the continued benefits of our office consolidations; and three, the $8 million reduction in our discretionary expenses and outside service providers to tight budget controls. At the same time, we have offset with marketing investment key partnerships and product launches.
Included in that GAAP total operating expenses, we incurred an asset impairment charge of $42 million related to a change of strategy on certain original long-form video content. Construction costs of $26 million related to resource realignment location consolidations as noted and stock-based compensation of $110 million. 
Our effective cost management helped to deliver EBITDA of $244 million in Q3, with a margin of 24% based on revenue ex-TAC. Non-GAAP operating income was $92 million for the quarter. 
income statement, earnings and equity interests were $95 million. Our non-GAAP tax rate is 35% and this is the estimate we expect to use for all of our 2015 non-GAAP presentations. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.15, and our Q3 average fully diluted share count decreased year-over-year by 6% to 947 million shares. And our ending diluted share count for the period was also 947 million. 
Quickly turning to the balance sheet. Our Alibaba investment was $23 billion in the balance sheet, Alibaba share price at the end of Q3 as this is mark-to-market. At the end of Q3, we had $6.8 billion in cash and marketable securities, up $5.5 billion net of our convertible and other debt. The change in cash balance from Q2 to Q3 was primarily driven by: free cash flow of $18 million, which includes capital spending of $150 million related to our products and Mail, Search and Mavens; acquisitions of $153 million; and proceeds -- proceeds of $50 million from yen hedges, which actually brings a cumulative total to approximately $630 million since 2012. 
So let me cover guidance. Before I walk through the outlook, the guidance I'm about to enumerate includes discussion from our earlier remarks. We expect to continue to grow GAAP revenue before revenue ex-TAC as we gain scale and market share in our core advertising businesses. Although we have historically seen a sequential increase in revenue ex-TAC in Q4, the typical amortization has now ended, resulting in a headwind of $60 million from Q3 to Q4. 
Additionally, the anniversaries of Mozilla and BrightRoll, together with our continued investments in Gemini, will put pressure on our GAAP and ex-TAC revenue growth. TAC increase will continue to reflect the growth of our Affiliate Display platforms and BrightRoll and App Publishing, as well as the increase in Search traffic flowing through our own Gemini platform. For non-GAAP cash expenses, we will continue our tight control of headcount and spending. 
For Q4 guidance, we expect the following: GAAP revenue range of $1.16 billion to $1.2 billion; TAC of approximately $240 million; revenue ex-TAC in the range of $920 million to $960 million; adjusted EBITDA in the range of $160 million to $200 million; and non-GAAP operating income in the range of $10 million to $50 million. 
In closing, as we prepare for the upcoming Aabaco transaction, we are also working through a multiyear transformation to position Yahoo to win in a highly competitive marketplace. We look forward to the opportunity at hand. We will be a more focused company in 2016, with the anticipated spin of Aabaco behind us as well as Alibaba-related revenue. 
While we have incurred challenges this year and have achieved financial results of performance we had hoped for, we are committed as a management team to improved execution in Q4 in 2016. We remain committed to executing toward EBITDA stabilization and growth over time. We have already executed a number of partnerships investments to both Search and our Display properties, which we believe establish a good foundation for the upcoming year. At our Q4 earnings call, we look forward to sharing additional information on our plans for the core Yahoo business post-spin been. 
With that, Marissa and I would like to take your questions. Lauren?"

And so we see some opportunities in terms of providing coverage of more ads on more queries. We also see some opportunities in different international regions to achieve different blending. And I would also say, we're very confident in our Yahoo Gemini platform for Search. And when we look at mobile, we actually, as you know, have a different view terms of what mobile search should be over time and what the best possible ways to monetize really provide value to advertisers.

And about half of that decline is also from our investment in Gemini, which largely manifests in terms of Price-per-Click. Obviously, this is something under our control, and we discussed on our last earnings call it wasn't an investment we feel is important to make. But as we optimize that system, we're bringing new verticals on. It's not exactly how AdSense overuse of the Search traffic to learn but that doesn't mean when first doing our ad placements, we don't get them exactly right.

As I said, we see a lot of new exciting formats in Search, both on mobile and on desktop. And this is an area where we can see a really nice dovetailing between our Gemini Search offering as well as Gemini native. A lot of the same formats worked very well in either location or in either setting. And so we really want to help -- have both of those marketplaces go together and also strengthen each other. In terms of the investment at the way that it works, a lot of people expected to show up as investment in short-term operating expense. But the way it actually works is it shows up as suppressed revenue. The analogy that works particularly well here is one of a class. If you're given for the final exam of a class on the first day of the course, you don't do very well. But by the time you've actually learned over the course of the class, you can do much better. Each of our search queries is essentially a test. And whether or not we can place those ads in appropriate order in terms of quality and the ability to monetize and targeting is really the challenge. And so when we first start trying that, we don't necessarily place all of those correctly, which results in slightly lower monetization. But each interaction with the user and each click in terms of where it lands teaches us something. And over the course of the learning, we actually can improve our performance in terms of monetization. improve our performance on the test. And that's the process we're going through now. We've been transitioning our advertisers through the Gemini platform vertical by vertical at this point. We have thousands of advertisers on the Gemini Search platform. It's been really excited position way, and we've been really heartened by the way, Search advertisers have been willing to adopt this platform and learn with us. It's been really exciting. And as we transition each vertical, we anticipated it would be 2 to 3 quarters of learning until we really got to optimal but when they got to optimum, it ultimately yields better monetization and improved margins."

On the new partnership with Google, we are filing an 8-K, and we will disclose what we intend to disclose there in terms of some of the financial relationships. What I can say that overall very enthusiastic about it. Within that by having partnerships with both leading search providers provides for greater competition. It really improves search in terms of the user experience as well as in terms of the business. And it really allows us as we think about how we want to evolve our Search, to build and really being able to invest in differentiating our product, particularly on Mobile. And so overall, we are happy to have achieved this by having 3 different search marketplaces available to us. It really does allow for greater competition and provides greater stability as well as choice and better user experience."

We did make a couple of comments. Marissa said it, I said it. We do take EBITDA very, very important, so we are looking at that very clearly in how we can optimize EBITDA and grow EBITDA going forward. So we will develop expense plan, in conjunction with as we develop our revenue plan. And in conjunction how we focus on those products in those regions that make the most sense for us to win and succeed in. We will do that. Same time I can tell you, we have a very good clamp, if you will, on discretionary expenses where we don't have to spend, so we're working very, very hard on those expenses. Facilities expenses, travel entertainment, and so forth working very tightly in those. I didn't talk about before we are working tightly on CapEx and how we manage that sort expect capital spending to go down a bit here also in Q4 from Q2 or Q3. So we're working all of the aspects, if you will, on expenses because again, we take to heart the fact that we need to be nicely profitable. We need to be strongly EBITDA growth, and so we are financing through that as with our plans and our revenue for '16."

The primary investment for Gemini comes in the form of suppressed revenue in order for our system delivery basically need to receive the Search, decide that we might be willing to make less money on it, rank the odds ourselves, got the user feedback and ultimately, learn from it because of these are reinforced learning systems, and so they basically need to see how users interact and respond to some options that we have in order to actually improve over time. And so the investment really does come in the form of suppressed revenue as opposed to in short-term operating expense or capital expense. And in terms of mobile search, overall, we really want to think about what enhances the user experience. We've been really excited to be introducing rich card experiences into our algorithmic Search on Mobile any fact today, we actually power more than half of our experiences, our searches, our Search results organic results on Mobile with our old technology that within provides a richer, more action oriented site of experiences onto Mobile. You want the ads to match that. We really ultimately want that experience. One of the things that's good about Search ads a lot improve the search experience and provide you with a better results. Who want to figure out through the Gemini but from how to make the ads equally actionable, perhaps oriented towards applications and/or [indiscernible], et cetera. And they having our own platform, it really allows us the opportunity to experiment. And so I would think that we will swing or of our traffic on Mobile towards the investment piece for learning.

For my portion of today's call, I will discuss our quarterly performance, our planned spinoff of Aabaco Holdings as well as the core of our business.Let's begin with a sum",2928,"Good afternoon, and welcome to our live earnings webcast hosted on Yahoo Finance. For my portion of today's call, I will discuss our quarterly performance, our planned spinoff of Aabaco Holdings as well as the core of our business.
Let's begin with a summary of our financial performance. We delivered $1,226,000,000 of GAAP revenue, up 7% year-over-year. In terms of revenue ex-TAC, we delivered $1,002,000,000, down 8% year-over-year. Throughout the quarter, we continued to balance our investments and costs, delivering $244 million of adjusted EBITDA.
Our Display revenue continues to see double-digit growth of 14% year-over-year on a GAAP basis and 2% growth on a revenue ex-TAC basis. On the Search side, our revenue -- our GAAP revenue grew 13% and was down about 13% on an ex-TAC basis due to investments in our Yahoo Gemini platform and traffic acquisition costs.
Looking ahead, our Q4 outlook, which Ken will return to later, is not indicative of the performance we want. While there are some well-known headwinds year-over-year and even quarter-over-quarter like the loss of the Alibaba TIPLA, we are also experiencing continued revenue headwinds in our core business, especially in the legacy portions.
With the spinoff of Aabaco Holdings pending and our annual planning for next year in full swing, we see a unique moment an opportunity for Yahoo as we move into 2016 to narrow our strategy and focus on fewer products with higher quality to achieve better growth and better results. We will share the details of this plan, in which we aim to delineate our focus, improve our execution and define our relevance to users, at our next earnings release, if not before.
I'd like to now speak about our Q3 results in the context of the key drivers of our business: people, products, traffic and revenue. Starting with people. We ended the quarter with 10,700 full-time employees and just under 800 contractors, bringing our overall headcount down 14% year-over-year and down 32% over the current management's tenure. We will continue to be disciplined on our headcount, and our thoughtful work on this area has helped appreciably on expenses.
In Q3, we maintained our focus on attracting and retaining a strong sales and technical workforce to accelerate our growth. In all, roughly 7 out of every 10 new employees were hired into sales or engineering. Our hiring process continues to be rigorous and primarily focus on the talent that will help us drive user engagement and revenue growth.
Recently, there has been external interest and speculation in a few shifts amidst our management team. The design and changes in Yahoo's leadership team are the results of careful planning to achieve the necessary skills, passion and the ability to execute growth in our business. Our leadership team today is unequivocally the strongest during my tenure.
Turning to our product progress. We continue to pride ourselves on being the indispensable guide to digital information across search, communications and digital content. Ultimately, this is about informing, connecting and entertaining our users.
Let's start with Search. Yahoo has a healthy search market share today, and our Q3 numbers reflect some of the growth levers we're exploring. As our investors know, we have made large strategic changes to the business to improve the quality of our traffic and our partners, investing in our own Search marketplace while introducing even more competitive monetization choices. This long-term strategy will not be defined by a single quarter. Over the next few quarters, we're working to differentiate our product across both algorithmic and paid search results.
We'll also continue the momentum needed to drive our Gemini platform forward by moving additional demand to the system and building robust marketplace. As we discussed in our last earnings call, this investment will suppress revenue in the short term but will result in better monetization over the long term.
Mobile search continues to be a critical area of investment for us, and one of the key ways we are investing is by moving additional traffic and advertisers to the Gemini platform in order to fully optimize and train our ad system. Overall, we remain optimistic about growth opportunities in Search.
As you know in April, we amended our Search Alliance with Microsoft, which provide us with significant additional flexibility. Our relationship with Microsoft remains strong and vibrant, and the teams have been working through the changes in our relationship and marketplace very effectively. I'd like to thank Satya and his team for their terrific efforts and partnership.
In addition, today, I'm pleased to announce that we have signed a 3-year partnership with Google to bolster our Search capabilities. This partnership will be supplementary to our existing relationship with Microsoft. The partnership with Google is nonexclusive and does not have minimum volume commitments. It covers both desktop and mobile traffic in the United States and many of our primary international markets. It is subject to a voluntary regulatory review by the Department of Justice and will only be implemented after that.
Overall, we believe that by establishing partnerships with both leaders in the search space, we can achieve a competitive search dynamic that will provide a better experience for our users and advertisers and will improve our monetization.
Looking at our Search monetization in Q3, we saw click-driven revenue growth 3% year-over-year. In terms of click volume, we saw 5% growth, driven primarily by our distribution partners. Meanwhile, we saw Price-per-Click decline 2%. At an overall level, while we saw the Search revenue grow 13% on a GAAP basis, decline by 13% on a revenue ex-TAC basis. We will continue to work hard to grow Search on both a GAAP and revenue ex-TAC basis.
On the product side, our teams continue to iterate and innovate across mobile and desktop search to deliver enhanced experiences to all of our users. On the consumer side, we launched a new hotel search experience in partnership with TripAdvisor, which offers details on hotel ratings, reviews and photos directly on the search page.
We're also seeing that mobile devices are transforming shopping behaviors, and we want to leverage the power of mobile search and native ads to help advertisers connect which shoppers. In Q3, we rolled out Gemini product listing ads, giving merchants access to Yahoo's smartphone search inventory to help them drive even more shoppers to their products.
And with the launch of click-to-call ads, advertisers can now add a call button to their native search ad that brings users one tap away from a conversation with them. Overall, we have significantly changed the business in ways that are strategically advantageous. But these changes will take a few quarters to translate into higher growth and margins. Achieving those improved margins and higher growth in Search is a key priority for us.
Next, communications. For the past 18 years, Yahoo Mail has been a key driver of engagement for our users, and creating the most innovative inbox experience remains an important goal for us. In Q3, our product teams were hard at work improving the design and differentiation of Yahoo Mail, to grow engagement and to bring new users to the product.
Just last week, we launched the new Yahoo Mail mobile application to an extremely positive reception. In addition to focusing on back-end improvements to improve speed and performance, we also refreshed the design, making mail more beautiful and intuitive. We introduced multiple account support, making it easier for users to access their other email accounts directly from Yahoo Mail, and we took an industry-leading step towards a password-free future with the announcement of Yahoo Account Key, which pushes notifications to your phone to provide fast, convenient and secure way to access your Yahoo accounts without having to memorize a password. This also makes it significantly easier to protect our users going -- accounts going forward. Overall, we are optimistic about our prospects in the communications space.
Digital content is all about entertaining our users across their interests. During our last earnings call, we announced that we had launched our Yahoo Sports Daily Fantasy product for Major League Baseball. And in September, we kicked off the NFL season. We've been in the Fantasy Sports business for 18 years, and these most recent launches have helped Yahoo improve the overall Fantasy experience for our users.
To date, our Daily Fantasy Sports offerings have exceeded our expectations in engagement and revenue. Daily Fantasy Sports is still a nascent industry, and we're monitoring industry trends and events closely. Daily Fantasy Sports is an exciting and evolving space, and we've been really pleased with how our product has been received.
Last quarter, we also announced our partnership with the NFL to deliver the first free global live stream of an NFL game. We invite you to tune in this coming Sunday, October 25, when the Buffalo Bills and the Jacksonville Jaguars face off in the NFL International Series game in London streams live across Yahoo's properties globally, including Yahoo Sports and Tumblr. We know our users will be very excited to see this game, and our advertisers have been too. We've already sold out all of our game day advertisements.
This quarter, we acquired Polyvore, a leading social commerce site that lets users across the globe discover and shop for their favorite products in fashion, beauty and home decor. This acquisition brings Polyvore's expertise and community-driven experiences and retailer-supported commerce to Yahoo and is aligned with our Mavens businesses. Already, the Polyvore team has hit the ground running, successfully integrating more than 400 of our advertisers with Yahoo product listing ads. These ads have started appearing in Yahoo's Search results, and while the integration is still in the early stages, we see great promise.
Let's turn to Tumblr. We're pleased with the growth of mobile engagement on Tumblr, with mobile usage increasing at the industry rate, if not faster. We now see 81% of Tumblr daily active users coming through mobile devices.
On the product front, we refreshed the user interface for re-blogging to improve readability of conversations and better utilize screen space on mobile. Continuing to lift Tumblr engagement in mobile through new and engaging features has been and will continue to be an important priority.
Finally, we're continuing our commitment to mobile growth with our developer offerings. In August, we hosted over 500 developers at Yahoo -- at the Yahoo Mobile Developer Conference in New York, where we announced new additions to the Yahoo Mobile Developer Suite.
With Tumblr In-App Sharing, developers can now integrate Tumblr's share buttons into their applications, giving users the ability to post content to Tumblr and link back to the source application. We also announced an update to Flurry Analytics that will allow developers to have instant insight into their app's real-time activity, and developers interested in monetization can integrate native video ad into their apps. We have found native video ads to be one of the best performing ad formats.
Our overall network, including Tumblr, continued to serve a global user base of more than 1 billion monthly active users. Yahoo's mobile audience of over 600 users continues to show growth. We already have substantial user scale so one of our key focuses heading into 2016 is improving user engagement on our products, especially on mobile.
Now turning to revenue. As we endeavor to build a truly global advertising business, it's critical for us to create a unified global effort for our customers. To that end, in Q3, Lisa Utzschneider was promoted to Chief Revenue Officer. As part of this change, we have aligned our sales team under Lisa's leadership to sync our efforts more closely and create a unified global voice for our advertisers. Lisa's operational rigor and client-centric thinking is exactly what we need in order to grow revenue.
Our Mavens businesses, which include mobile, video, native and social, delivered Q3 GAAP revenue of approximately $420 million, up 43% year-over-year, nearly 35% of overall GAAP revenue. These businesses represent the fastest-growing areas of digital advertising and will continue to be strategic to our transformation.
Mobile has been our biggest win for our -- the company so far. I'm delighted to report that in Q3, mobile revenues generated approximately $270 million in GAAP revenue, up 31% year-over-year. This equates to gross revenue of more than $420 million. Mobile now contributes at least 24% of our traffic-driven revenue.
Now let's turn to video. Our video GAAP revenue has more than doubled year-over-year, and video Price-per-Ad is helping drive our overall Price-per-Ad growth. Global video streams have nearly doubled year-over-year, and time spent watching videos is up 82% year-over-year across our original, editorial and partner content.
Native video ads are also performing well on both mobile and desktop, with revenue up approximately 40% quarter-over-quarter. This quarter, we announced our plans to unify all of our programmatic advertising technology under the BrightRoll brand, which we acquired last year as part of our M&A strategy.
The BrightRoll DSP is our efficient programmatic buying platform for video display and native advertising. And the BrightRoll Exchange is our marketplace that connects buyers and sellers of video and display inventory to be run across Yahoo and other premium publishers. This exchange is integrated with more than 100 DSPs and enables access to thousands of sites and applications via real-time bidding, private marketplaces and programmatic direct. With the video advertising industry continuing to grow significantly, we're excited to catch this wave.
Online advertising is also continuing an aggressive shift towards native ads, especially as they continue to prove their effectiveness. On average, native ads get 3x more attention than other display ads and about 50% more emotional resonance than traditional ads. Tapping into this industry shift, we introduced our Gemini platform, the first unified marketplace for mobile search and native advertising. And the native side of Gemini's platform is showing terrific momentum. In Q3 2015, Gemini native ads delivered an increase of over 90% year-over-year and 10% quarter-over-quarter.
A large driver of this growth is syndicated supply through the Flurry network, which was up approximately 65% year-over-year in the United States. Particular -- in particular, Yahoo App Publishing from our mobile developer suite now makes up nearly 40% of the total mobile Gemini revenue and more than 1/4 of the total Gemini supply. Also, we saw international supply increase by approximately 35% over last quarter as we deployed new ad units on Gemini internationally.
Turning to social. Tumblr continues to be a long-term strategic play for us. Over the quarter, we have worked hard to integrate the sales and operations teams and continued to make enhancements to the ad products to drive monetization. In Q2, we launched a new ad format, the Tumblr Sponsored Day, that allows brands to advertise at the top of the Tumblr dashboard for 24 hours. And in Q3, we enhanced the Sponsored Day visual experience with a big beautiful banner and extended this ad unit to our mobile experiences where most of our daily active users engage with us. 
We're also ramping -- we're also focused on ramping up app install ads on Tumblr. With apps comprising 90% of time spent on mobile, we think there's a lot of promise, especially for millennials. We're seeing demand from advertisers as Tumblr's client base for app install ads grew more than 60% last quarter. Our sponsored video ads have also grown to be a significant portion of Tumblr's business. Revenue from these ads are up 35% quarter-over-quarter and nearly 60% since launching in Q4 of last year.
Moving on from the Mavens businesses, I'd also like to take a moment to discuss our broader Display trends. Over the quarter, ads sold were up 8% year-over-year, driven in part by syndicated native ads as well as video inventory growth from BrightRoll. This was partially offset by a decrease in premium and Audience Ads. Price-per-Ad was up 8% year-over-year, driven by increases in native globally and video representing a larger share of the inventory mix.
Before I hand it over to Ken to discuss our financial results in greater depth, I wanted to take a moment to comment on the planned spinoff of Aabaco Holdings. We continue to make good progress and strive to complete the spin in Q4. We do want to note that due to the time needed to satisfy certain conditions, including completing the required SEC process, the final approval of both the Yahoo and Aabaco boards, compliance with the notice requirements under the convertible note indenture and taking into consideration holiday market closures at the end of the quarter, the transaction may ultimately conclude in January. I also want to take this opportunity to thank everyone who's been working tirelessly on the spin. It's an important moment for the company, for our investors and a significant event in Yahoo's history.
Overall, I have very aggressive expectations for Yahoo's core business. We have the right talent, the right strategy and the right assets to drive long-term sustainable growth for our investors. As we look towards a post-spin 2016, we think there's a unique opportunity to reset and realign against the most impactful areas of focus. This will require us to simplify our structure, improve expense discipline and prioritize our investments to improve growth and profitability.
We remain deeply committed to doing what's best for Yahoo and delivering the most value to our shareholders. And we believe more strongly than ever that continued focus will help us accelerate our long-term growth and set us up for future success.
Now I'd like to turn it over to Ken to talk more about Q3."

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Today, I plan to review our third quarter operation results in more detail and also provide an update on the Aabaco spinoff transaction and later close with the outlook for the upcoming quarter.
We continued to grow GAAP revenue in Q3 to $1.226 billion, representing a 7% increase year-over-year. Through additional partnership and affiliates, we increased the total advertising dollars in our ecosystem, leading to the Search and Display revenue growth of 13% and 14%, respectively.
Traffic acquisition costs increased by $169 million year-over-year to $223 million due to the additional contribution of off-network traffic and affiliate revenue. This resulted in revenue ex-TAC of $1.002 billion. In Q3, we effectively managed our cost base to deliver EBITDA of $244 million and non-GAAP operating income of $92 million.
We allocated appropriate resources and capital for growth initiatives while also realizing operating efficiencies through office consolidations and workforce expenses to reduce our cash operating cost to $758 million in the quarter.
And similar to prior trends, our full-time employee base declined by approximately 300 in the quarter, ending in 10,700. This results in a year-over-year reduction of 1,800, up 14%, even after including the acquisitions of BrightRoll and Polyvore. Our technical headcount remains steady at approximately half our employee base, while our G&A-related personnel costs have decreased. As we continue to remix and align resource to focus on key growth areas, we are mindful of our overall cost structure in improving operational efficiencies to focus on sustainably improving our EBITDA margins over time.
Before diving further into the financial details of the quarter, let me make a couple of comments on the Aabaco spinoff transaction. After carefully considering the company's options and feedback we received from our shareholders, our board authorized the company to continue to pursue the planned spinoff without a private letter ruling on the basis of a receipt of a favorable tax opinion from counsel. As Marissa noted, there are a number of factors to consider as we drive the transaction to conclusion, including regulatory processes, respective board approvals, notice requirements and holiday market closures. We remain focused on executing the transaction as soon as possible and look forward to updating you on the completed spinoff as well as our go-forward plan for core Yahoo on our Q4 earnings call.
I am focusing on the following for Q4: one, working diligently to complete the spinoff transaction; two, build a 2016 financial and operational plan that is realistic and executable and achieving our goals for revenue, earnings, EBITDA and free cash flow; three, develop a plan and strategy to communicate to our investors our core company direction post-spin, which includes how best to optimize our investment in Yahoo Japan; and finally, finish 2015 financially as strong as possible to set the stage for 2016.
Now let's run through our third quarter financial results in more detail. Once again, I will focus most of the discussion around the non-GAAP results, which excludes stock-based compensation expense of $110 million, restructuring charge of $26 million, an asset impairment charge of $42 million and $13 million noncash loss on our Hortonworks warrants. Please see our earnings slides on our Investor Relations website for a complete reconciliation between our GAAP and non-GAAP results.
Our financial highlights for Q3 can be seen on Slide 5. GAAP revenue was $1.226 billion, up 7% year-over-year or 10%, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Traffic acquisition costs were $223 million, which were up $169 million compared to the prior year, primarily due to our Mozilla partnership, Gemini search and growth in affiliate mobile display from our BrightRoll platform and Flurry business or Yahoo App Publishing. Revenue ex-TAC was $1.002 billion, which includes a negative foreign exchange impact of approximately $30 million on a year-over-year basis.
Taking a closer look at Search, GAAP Search revenue was $509 million, up 13% year-over-year. Search revenue ex-TAC declined 13% year-over-year, driven by increasing partner payments relative to click-driven revenue growth of 3% as well as our investment in Gemini, as Marissa has discussed.
We are making good progress on our internal search efforts under Gemini. Our sales teams have already secured a thousand of accounts on the Gemini Search platform, and we fully expect to drive more advertisers and traffic onto the platform over the next quarter.
Now moving to Display. We saw a continuation of growth trends from the prior quarter. GAAP Display revenue was also $509 million, up 14% year-over-year as a result of our growing affiliate partnerships and video business. Display ads sold and PPA each increased 8% year-over-year. The Americas saw a strong PPA increase of 24%, driven by native and improved mix of video inventory.
Native PPA continued to see meaningful growth from the prior year. Our advertisers are seeing success in mobile by leveraging targeting capabilities available to Flurry. Display revenue ex-TAC grew 2% year-over-year or 6%, excluding the impact of foreign exchange.
In our Mavens businesses, we saw a 43% GAAP revenue growth year-over-year for those areas in aggregate. Mavens now contributes 38% to our traffic-driven revenue, up from 29% in the prior year.
Video enjoyed a good quarter of growth as we continue to increase supply and demand across all areas of video business. For example, a fast-growing autoplay video supply is now fully available in the unified BrightRoll platform. We're also looking forward to delivering premium video content in our upcoming webcast of the London NFL game this Sunday, October 25.
Mobile GAAP revenue grew 31% year-over-year. We held a second Mobile Developer Conference in New York City this past quarter and continue to see strong native growth through Yahoo App Publishing in our international regions. Our native display revenue across all devices reached approximately $145 million in the quarter, driven by growth in both volume and pricing year-over-year.
For Tumblr, our priority remains user growth and engagements, which will lead to improved monetization. We are pursuing multiple paths to achieve increased monetization through our unified Yahoo sales force, including deeper integration with our rapidly growing Gemini marketplace. We expect to update the financial performance for Tumblr at the end of the year.
Other revenue ex-TAC declined 6% year-over-year due primarily to the decline in Alibaba-related fees of $14 million, Taiwan e-commerce and other operational declines across lease listing fees.
For revenue detail by region, please refer to Slide 10. Americas GAAP revenue grew 13% year-over-year due to the strong growth in Search of 20%, Display of 22%. APAC GAAP revenue was down 15%. Excluding FX headwinds, GAAP revenue was down 6%. EMEA GAAP revenue was down 11% but excluding FX, GAAP revenue was up 2%.
Now let's take a couple of minutes to go through our expenses and income in a bit more detail. Non-GAAP total operating expenses were down 3% year-over-year. D&A has remained consistent over the past several quarters at approximately $150 million. Our non-GAAP cash expenses for the full quarter came in better than our expectations at $758 million, declining 4% year-over-year. This was the result of our ongoing improvements to drive operating efficiencies for the company: one, a $38 million decrease in workforce expenses achieved through reduction in full-time employees while integrating acquisitions and redeploying resources to our strategic areas; two, a $10 million decrease in facilities as we see the continued benefits of our office consolidation; and three, the $8 million reduction in our discretionary expenses and outside service providers through tight budget controls. At the same time, we have offset with marketing investments in key partnerships and product launches.
Included in our that GAAP total operating expenses, we incurred an asset impairment charge of $42 million related to a change of strategy on certain original long-form video content. Restructuring costs of $26 million related to resource realignment and location consolidations, as noted, and stock-based compensation of $110 million.
Our effective cost management helped to deliver EBITDA of $244 million in Q3, with a margin of 24% based on revenue ex-TAC. Non-GAAP operating income was $92 million for the quarter.
Running at the income statement, earnings and equity interests were $95 million. Our non-GAAP tax rate is 35%, and this is the estimate we expect to use for all of our 2015 non-GAAP presentations. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.15, and our Q3 average fully diluted share count decreased year-over-year by 6% to 947 million shares. And our ending diluted share count for the period was also 947 million.
Quickly turning to the balance sheet. Our Alibaba investment was $23 billion in the balance sheet, affected by the Alibaba share price at the end of Q3 as this is mark-to-market. At the end of Q3, we had $6.8 billion in cash and marketable securities, up $5.5 billion net of our convertible and other debt. The change in cash balance from Q2 to Q3 was primarily driven by: free cash flow of $18 million, which includes capital spending of $150 million related to our products in Mail, Search and Mavens; acquisitions of $153 million and proceeds -- positive proceeds of $50 million from yen hedges which actually brings the cumulative total to approximately $630 million since 2012. 
Now let me cover guidance. Before I walk through the outlook, the guidance I'm about to enumerate includes discussion from our earlier remarks. We expect to continue to grow GAAP revenue before revenue ex-TAC as we gain scale and market share in our core advertising businesses. Although we have historically seen a sequential increase in revenue ex-TAC in Q4, the typical amortization has now ended, resulting in a headwind of $60 million from Q3 to Q4. 
Additionally, the anniversaries of Mozilla and BrightRoll, together with our continued investments in Gemini, will put pressure on our GAAP and ex-tax revenue growth. TAC increase will continue to reflect the growth of our Affiliate Display platforms and BrightRoll and App Publishing, as well as the increase in Search traffic flowing through our own Gemini platform. For non-GAAP cash expenses, we will continue our tight control of headcount and spending. 
For Q4 guidance, we expect the following: GAAP revenue range of $1.16 billion to $1.2 billion; TAC of approximately $240 million; revenue ex-TAC in the range of $920 million to $960 million; adjusted EBITDA in the range of $160 million to $200 million; and non-GAAP operating income in the range of $10 million to $50 million. 
In closing, as we prepare for the upcoming Aabaco transaction, we are also working through a multiyear transformation to position Yahoo to win in a highly competitive marketplace. We look forward to the opportunity at hand. We will be a more focused company in 2016, with the anticipated spin of Aabaco behind us as well as Alibaba-related revenue. 
While we have incurred challenges this year and have not achieved financial results or performance we had hoped for, we are committed as a management team to improve execution in Q4 and 2016. We remain committed to executing toward EBITDA stabilization and growth over time. We have already executed a number of partnerships investments to both Search and our Display properties which we believe establish a good foundation for the upcoming year. At our Q4 earnings call, we look forward to sharing additional information on our plans for the core Yahoo business post-spin. 
With that, Marissa and I would like to take your questions. Lauren?"

And so we see some opportunities in terms of providing coverage of more ads on more queries. We also see some opportunities in different international regions to just achieve a different blending. And I would also say, we're very confident in our Yahoo Gemini platform for Search. And when we look at mobile, we actually, as you know, have a different view in terms of what mobile search should be over time and what the best possible ways to monetize there are to really provide value to advertisers. And so for us, the Yahoo Gemini platform is really where we want to invest, particularly on mobile and new formats, new ideas.

And about half of that decline is also from our investment in Gemini which largely manifests in terms of Price-per-Click. And obviously, this is something under our control and we discussed on our last earnings call, it was an investment we feel is important to make. But as we optimize that system, we're bringing new verticals on, it's not exactly clear how to rank our ads and so we use the Search traffic to learn, but that doesn't mean when we're first doing our ad placements, we don't get them exactly right.

As I said, we see a lot of new exciting formats in Search, both on mobile and on desktop. And this is an area where we can see a really nice dovetailing between our Gemini Search offering as well as Gemini native. A lot of the same formats work very well in either location or in either setting. And so we really want to help have both of those marketplaces grow together and ultimately strengthen each other. In terms of the investment and the way that it works, a lot of people is expected to show up as an investment in short-term operating expense. But the way it actually works is that it shows up as suppressed revenue. The analogy that works particularly well here is one of a class. If you're given for the final exam in the class on the first day of the course, you don't do very well. But by the time you've actually learned over the course of the class, you can do much better. Each of our search queries is essentially a test. And whether or not we can place those ads in appropriate order in terms of quality and the ability to monetize and targeting is really the challenge. And so when we first start trying that, we don't necessarily place all of those correctly which results in slightly in the lower monetization. But each interaction with the user and each click in terms of where it lands teaches us something. And over the course of learning, we actually can improve our performance in terms of monetization vis-à-vis, improve our performance on the test. And that's the process we're going through now. We've been transitioning our advertisers to the Gemini platform vertical by vertical. At this point, we have thousands of advertisers on the Gemini Search platform. It's been a really exciting transition, and we've been really heartened by the way search advertisers have been willing to adopt this platform and learn with us, and it's been really exciting. And as we transition each vertical, we anticipate that it would be 2 to 3 quarters of learning until we really got to optimum. But when we get to optimum, it ultimately yields better monetization and improved margins."

Clearly, as Marissa noted, we are going to look at, as we position for 2016, what products and regions make the most sense to really focus on that can be strong winners for them, for us and really focus on those. In some others, we may basically disinvest, if you will, and so de-focus. And so some of that will affect Q4 as well. And so as we look at it and then Marissa also talked about Search. And so Search in terms of some of the things that we have to concern ourselves how the Q3 to Q4 relates to some of the investments we're making and some of the changes as we go forward. So we looked at Search and how that may not grow as much as we would normally see Q3 to Q4. In Display, while it grows, it may also not grow quite as much because again, some of the focus we're making in terms of the key products we want to drive and work on or some other products or regions for that matter, that maybe, we don't want to put as much focus on, and how that works and how we sort of thought about developing the guidance, if you will, for Q4. And probably as importantly, how we think about how we can set the stage for 2016."

We will develop our plans as we think about 2016. We did make a couple of comments. Marissa said it, I said it, we do take EBITDA very, very important, so we are looking at that very clearly and how we can optimize EBITDA and grow EBITDA going forward. So we will develop an expense plan in conjunction with as we develop our revenue plan. And in conjunction, how we focus on those products in those regions that make the most sense for us to win and succeed in, we'll do that. Same time I can tell you, we have a very good clamp, if you will, on discretionary expenses where we don't have to spend. So we're working very, very hard on those expenses. Facilities expenses, travel entertainment, and so forth, working very tightly in those. I didn't talk about before we're working tightly on CapEx and how we manage that so I expect capital spending to go down a bit here also in Q4 from Q2 or Q3. So we're working all of the aspects, if you will, on expenses because again, we take to heart the fact that we need to be nicely profitable, we need to be strongly EBITDA growth, and so we are going to think through that as we think about our plans and our revenue for 2016."

The Gemini investment, there's a modest investment in servers, there's a reasonable investment in engineers but that's been in place now for some quarters as we've been building the overall Gemini marketplace. The primary investment for Gemini comes in the form of suppressed revenue. In order for our system to learn, we basically need to receive the search, decide that we might be willing to make less money on it, rank the odds ourselves, get the user feedback and ultimately, learn from it. Because these are reinforced learning systems and so they basically need to see how users interact and respond to some options that we have in order to actually improve over time. And so the investment really does come in the form of suppressed revenue as opposed to in short-term operating expense or capital expense. And in terms of mobile search, overall, we really want to think about what enhances the user experience. We've been really excited to be introducing rich card experiences into our algorithmic search on Mobile. And in fact today, we actually power more than half of our experiences or searches, our search results through organic results on Mobile with our own technology that we think provides a richer, more action-oriented kind of experiences on Mobile. We want the ads to match that. We really ultimately want that experience. One of the things that's great about search ads is it allows us to actually improve the search experience and provide you with the better results. We want to figure out through the Gemini platform, how to make the ads equally actionable, perhaps oriented towards applications and/or deep linking, et cetera. And by having our own platform, it really allows us the opportunity to experiment. And so I would think that we will swing more of our traffic on Mobile towards the investment piece for learning. But obviously, we want to have a strong and vibrant business. And so we are going to hold all of this in balance with the partnerships with Microsoft and Google."

And one of the key challenges for Yahoo really to achieve the level of success that I hope it does, and I'm sure all of our investors and board and company hope it does, is around engagement. We ultimately need to work to improve our relevance to end users and how many times they come to us. With more than 1 billion users, we essentially have most people who are online over the course of a month or any given day coming to Yahoo either on the web or on Mobile. And as we move forward, the focus will shift even more towards Mobile and really getting more usage per user everyday which is essentially engagement. And so we think it's important going into 2016, to get very focused on what will ultimately drive engagement because well, there's always many different business areas to focus on and optimize that ultimately will drive long-term growth."

Data in terms of overall user habits and trends as well as analyses in terms of what their interests are that are unique to Yahoo.

And I say that when I think about we lose basically with no expenses, the full TIPLA revenue which was close to $70 million year-over-year.

From an expense point of view, yes, we think the Q4 expense is consistent with Q3. We have always talked about expenses, they are pretty much sequentially thought. I mean, there are some seasonal expenses you have like benefits. Sometimes, they're higher in Q1 but generally expenses fall pretty much sequentially. And so Q4 is pretty consistent with our Q3 and that's taking into account some of the comments I made before. But really, the EBITDA margin percentage for Q4 is primarily driven by revenue. Now as we think about '16, we'll be thoughtful and mindful that we are focused on EBITDA, we are focused on profitability and we have to think about mix and match between what's realistic from a revenue point of view, as I talked about earlier, and then what we can do on expenses so that we get a competitive EBITDA and frankly, operating profit margin and free cash flow."

That's a very insightful question because I do think there's a lot of common threads that run across the Polyvore acquisition as well as TripAdvisor and Yelp. Overall, we feel that search results, especially on Mobile, need to involve a lot more. They need to be richer, they need to be more graphical, they need to be more action-oriented. Our Flurry Analytics which is the largest analytic system in the world now monitors more than 2 billion devices or sees more than 2 billion devices. Overall, it has measured that more than 90% of time on phones is being spent in apps as opposed to in the browser. And that really means that users are expecting an app-like experience. And so we're constantly looking at Search both in terms of how it behaves in the browser as well as opportunities in apps which we do through our Mobile developer offerings and our Mobile developer suite. We try to make our Search available. But by having these rich content sources, one is about the extra content and visuals that we can put on the page. They have people on more informed answer on their search. They've been more serious about empowering them in terms of actions. Can they book a restaurant on Yelp? Can they book a flight or a hotel on TripAdvisor with Polyvore? Can they move on to a site or into an application where they can directly buy the product that they're looking at and liking? And so we really think that on the mobile phones, Search becomes that much more action-oriented. And by having these strong partnership with the leaders in their spaces, this is something that allows us to really create a differentiated product that we think is something that can set us apart over time."

For my portion of today's call, I will discuss our quarterly performance, our planned spinoff of Aabaco Holdings as well as the core of our business.Let's begin with a sum",2933,"Good afternoon, and welcome to our live earnings webcast hosted on Yahoo Finance. For my portion of today's call, I will discuss our quarterly performance, our planned spinoff of Aabaco Holdings as well as the core of our business.
Let's begin with a summary of our financial performance. We delivered $1,226,000,000 of GAAP revenue, up 7% year-over-year. In terms of revenue ex-TAC, we delivered $1,002,000,000, down 8% year-over-year. Throughout the quarter, we continued to balance our investments and costs, delivering $244 million of adjusted EBITDA.
Our Display revenue continues to see double-digit growth of 14% year-over-year on a GAAP basis and 2% growth on a revenue ex-TAC basis. On the Search side, our revenue -- our GAAP revenue grew 13% and was down about 13% on an ex-TAC basis due to investments in our Yahoo Gemini platform and traffic acquisition costs.
Looking ahead, our Q4 outlook, which Ken will return to later, is not indicative of the performance we want. While there are some well-known headwinds year-over-year and even quarter-over-quarter like the loss of the Alibaba TIPLA, we are also experiencing continued revenue headwinds in our core business, especially in the legacy portions.
With the spinoff of Aabaco Holdings pending and our annual planning for next year in full swing, we see a unique moment, an opportunity for Yahoo, as we move into 2016 to narrow our strategy and focus on fewer products with higher quality to achieve better growth and better results. We will share the details of this plan, in which we aim to delineate our focus, improve our execution and define our relevance to users, at our next earnings release, if not before.
I'd like to now speak about our Q3 results in the context of the key drivers of our business: people, products, traffic and revenue. Starting with people. We ended the quarter with 10,700 full-time employees and just under 800 contractors, bringing our overall headcount down 14% year-over-year and down 32% over the current management's tenure. We will continue to be disciplined on our headcount, and our thoughtful work on this area has helped appreciably on expenses.
In Q3, we maintained our focus on attracting and retaining a strong sales and technical workforce to accelerate our growth. In all, roughly 7 out of every 10 new employees were hired into sales or engineering. Our hiring process continues to be rigorous and primarily focus on the talent that will help us drive user engagement and revenue growth.
Recently, there has been external interest and speculation in a few shifts amidst our management team. The design and changes in Yahoo's leadership team are the results of careful planning to achieve the necessary skills, passion and the ability to execute growth in our business. Our leadership team today is unequivocally the strongest during my tenure.
Turning to our product progress. We continue to pride ourselves on being the indispensable guide to digital information across search, communications and digital content. Ultimately, this is about informing, connecting and entertaining our users.
Let's start with Search. Yahoo has a healthy search market share today, and our Q3 numbers reflect some of the growth levers we're exploring. As our investors know, we have made large strategic changes to the business to improve the quality of our traffic and our partners, investing in our own Search marketplace while introducing even more competitive monetization choices. This long-term strategy will not be defined by a single quarter. Over the next few quarters, we're working to differentiate our product across both algorithmic and paid search results.
We'll also continue the momentum needed to drive our Gemini platform forward by moving additional demand to the system and building robust marketplace. As we discussed in our last earnings call, this investment will suppress revenue in the short term but will result in better monetization over the long term.
Mobile search continues to be a critical area of investment for us, and one of the key ways we are investing is by moving additional traffic and advertisers to the Gemini platform in order to fully optimize and train our ad system. Overall, we remain optimistic about growth opportunities in Search.
As you know in April, we amended our Search Alliance with Microsoft, which provided us with significant additional flexibility. Our relationship with Microsoft remains strong and vibrant, and the teams have been working through the changes in our relationship and marketplace very effectively. I'd like to thank Satya and his team for their terrific efforts and partnership.
In addition, today, I'm pleased to announce that we have signed a 3-year partnership with Google to bolster our Search capabilities. This partnership will be supplementary to our existing relationship with Microsoft. The partnership with Google is nonexclusive and does not have minimum volume commitments. It covers both desktop and mobile traffic in the United States and many of our primary international markets. It is subject to a voluntary regulatory review by the Department of Justice and will only be implemented after that.
Overall, we believe that by establishing partnerships with both leaders in the search space, we can achieve a competitive search dynamic that will provide a better experience for our users and advertisers and will improve our monetization.
Looking at our Search monetization in Q3, we saw click-driven revenue grow 3% year-over-year. In terms of click volume, we saw 5% growth, driven primarily by our distribution partners. Meanwhile, we saw Price-per-Click decline 2%. At an overall level, while we saw the Search revenue grow 13% on a GAAP basis, decline by 13% on a revenue ex-TAC basis. We will continue to work hard to grow Search on both a GAAP and revenue ex-TAC basis.
On the product side, our teams continue to iterate and innovate across mobile and desktop search to deliver enhanced experiences to all of our users. On the consumer side, we launched a new hotel search experience in partnership with TripAdvisor, which offers details on hotel ratings, reviews and photos directly on the search page.
We're also seeing that mobile devices are transforming shopping behaviors, and we want to leverage the power of mobile search and native ads to help advertisers connect with shoppers. In Q3, we rolled out Gemini product listing ads, giving merchants access to Yahoo's smartphone search inventory to help them drive even more shoppers to their products.
And with the launch of click-to-call ads, advertisers can now add a call button to their native search ad that brings users one tap away from a conversation with them. Overall, we have significantly changed the business in ways that are strategically advantageous. But these changes will take a few quarters to translate into higher growth and margins. Achieving those improved margins and higher growth in Search is a key priority for us.
Next, communications. For the past 18 years, Yahoo Mail has been a key driver of engagement for our users, and creating the most innovative inbox experience remains an important goal for us. In Q3, our product teams were hard at work improving the design and differentiation of Yahoo Mail, to grow engagement and to bring new users to the product.
Just last week, we launched the new Yahoo Mail mobile application to an extremely positive reception. In addition to focusing on back-end improvements to improve speed and performance, we also refreshed the design, making mail more beautiful and intuitive. We introduced multiple account support, making it easier for users to access their other email accounts directly from Yahoo Mail, and we took an industry-leading step towards a password-free future with the announcement of Yahoo Account Key, which pushes notifications to your phone to provide fast, convenient and secure way to access your Yahoo accounts without having to memorize a password. This also makes it significantly easier to protect our users going -- accounts going forward. Overall, we are optimistic about our prospects in the communications space.
Digital content is all about entertaining our users across their interests. During our last earnings call, we announced that we had launched our Yahoo Sports Daily Fantasy product for Major League Baseball. And in September, we kicked off the NFL season. We've been in the Fantasy Sports business for 18 years, and these most recent launches have helped Yahoo improve the overall Fantasy experience for our users.
To date, our Daily Fantasy Sports offerings have exceeded our expectations in engagement and revenue. Daily Fantasy Sports is still a nascent industry, and we're monitoring industry trends and events closely. Daily Fantasy Sports is an exciting and evolving space, and we've been really pleased with how our product has been received.
Last quarter, we also announced our partnership with the NFL to deliver the first free global live stream of an NFL game. We invite you to tune in this coming Sunday, October 25, when the Buffalo Bills and the Jacksonville Jaguars face off in the NFL International Series game in London, streamed live across Yahoo's properties globally, including Yahoo Sports and Tumblr. We know our users will be very excited to see this game, and our advertisers have been too. We've already sold out all of our game day advertisements.
This quarter, we acquired Polyvore, a leading social commerce site that lets users across the globe discover and shop for their favorite products in fashion, beauty and home decor. This acquisition brings Polyvore's expertise and community-driven experiences and retailer-supported commerce to Yahoo and is aligned with our Mavens businesses. Already, the Polyvore team has hit the ground running, successfully integrating more than 400 of our advertisers with Yahoo product listing ads. These ads have started appearing in Yahoo's Search results, and while the integration is still in the early stages, we see great promise.
Let's turn to Tumblr. We're pleased with the growth of mobile engagement on Tumblr, with mobile usage increasing at the industry rate, if not faster. We now see 81% of Tumblr daily active users coming through mobile devices.
On the product front, we refreshed the user interface for re-blogging to improve readability of conversations and better utilize screen space on mobile. Continuing to lift Tumblr engagement in mobile through new and engaging features has been and will continue to be an important priority.
Finally, we're continuing our commitment to mobile growth with our developer offerings. In August, we hosted over 500 developers at Yahoo -- at the Yahoo Mobile Developer Conference in New York, where we announced new additions to the Yahoo Mobile Developer Suite.
With Tumblr In-App Sharing, developers can now integrate Tumblr's share buttons into their applications, giving users the ability to post content to Tumblr and link back to the source application. We also announced an update to Flurry Analytics that will allow developers to have instant insight into their app's real-time activity, and developers interested in monetization can integrate native video ads into their apps. We have found native video ads to be one of the best performing ad formats.
Our overall network, including Tumblr, continued to serve a global user base of more than 1 billion monthly active users. Yahoo's mobile audience of over 600 (sic) [ 600 million ] users continues to show growth. We already have substantial user scale so one of our key focuses heading into 2016 is improving user engagement on our products, especially on mobile.
Now turning to revenue. As we endeavor to build a truly global advertising business, it's critical for us to create a unified global effort for our customers. To that end, in Q3, Lisa Utzschneider was promoted to Chief Revenue Officer. As part of this change, we have aligned our sales team under Lisa's leadership to sync our efforts more closely and create a unified global voice for our advertisers. Lisa's operational rigor and client-centric thinking is exactly what we need in order to grow revenue.
Our Mavens businesses, which include mobile, video, native and social, delivered Q3 GAAP revenue of approximately $420 million, up 43% year-over-year, nearly 35% of overall GAAP revenue. These businesses represent the fastest-growing areas of digital advertising and will continue to be strategic to our transformation.
Mobile has been our biggest win for our -- the company so far. I'm delighted to report that in Q3, mobile revenues generated approximately $270 million in GAAP revenue, up 31% year-over-year. This equates to gross revenue of more than $420 million. Mobile now contributes at least 24% of our traffic-driven revenue.
Now let's turn to video. Our video GAAP revenue has more than doubled year-over-year, and video Price-per-Ad is helping drive our overall Price-per-Ad growth. Global video streams have nearly doubled year-over-year, and time spent watching videos is up 82% year-over-year across our original, editorial and partner content.
Native video ads are also performing well on both mobile and desktop, with revenue up approximately 40% quarter-over-quarter. This quarter, we announced our plans to unify all of our programmatic advertising technology under the BrightRoll brand, which we acquired last year as part of our M&A strategy.
The BrightRoll DSP is our efficient programmatic buying platform for video display and native advertising. And the BrightRoll Exchange is our marketplace that connects buyers and sellers of video and display inventory to be run across Yahoo and other premium publishers. This exchange is integrated with more than 100 DSPs and enables access to thousands of sites and applications via real-time bidding, private marketplaces and programmatic direct. With the video advertising industry continuing to grow significantly, we're excited to catch this wave.
Online advertising is also continuing an aggressive shift towards native ads, especially as they continue to prove their effectiveness. On average, native ads get 3x more attention than other display ads and about 50% more emotional resonance than traditional ads. Tapping into this industry shift, we introduced our Gemini platform, the first unified marketplace for mobile search and native advertising. And the native side of Gemini's platform is showing terrific momentum. In Q3 2015, Gemini native ads delivered an increase of over 90% year-over-year and 10% quarter-over-quarter.
A large driver of this growth is syndicated supply through the Flurry network, which was up approximately 65% year-over-year in the United States. Particular -- in particular, Yahoo App Publishing from our mobile developer suite now makes up nearly 40% of the total mobile Gemini revenue and more than 1/4 of the total Gemini supply. Also, we saw international supply increase by approximately 35% over last quarter as we deployed new ad units on Gemini internationally.
Turning to social. Tumblr continues to be a long-term strategic play for us. Over the quarter, we have worked hard to integrate the sales and operations teams and continued to make enhancements to the ad products to drive monetization. In Q2, we launched a new ad format, the Tumblr Sponsored Day, that allows brands to advertise at the top of the Tumblr dashboard for 24 hours. And in Q3, we enhanced the Sponsored Day visual experience with a big beautiful banner and extended this ad unit to our mobile experiences where most of our daily active users engage with us. 
We're also ramping -- we're also focused on ramping up app install ads on Tumblr. With apps comprising 90% of time spent on mobile, we think there's a lot of promise, especially for millennials. We're seeing demand from advertisers as Tumblr's client base for app install ads grew more than 60% last quarter. Our sponsored video ads have also grown to be a significant portion of Tumblr's business. Revenue from these ads are up 35% quarter-over-quarter and nearly 60% since launching in Q4 of last year.
Moving on from the Mavens businesses, I'd also like to take a moment to discuss our broader Display trends. Over the quarter, ads sold were up 8% year-over-year, driven in part by syndicated native ads as well as video inventory growth from BrightRoll. This was partially offset by a decrease in premium and Audience Ads. Price-per-Ad was up 8% year-over-year, driven by increases in native globally and video representing a larger share of the inventory mix.
Before I hand it over to Ken to discuss our financial results in greater depth, I wanted to take a moment to comment on the planned spinoff of Aabaco Holdings. We continue to make good progress and strive to complete the spin in Q4. We do want to note that due to the time needed to satisfy certain conditions, including completing the required SEC process, the final approval of both the Yahoo and Aabaco boards, compliance with the notice requirements under the convertible note indenture and taking into consideration holiday market closures at the end of the quarter, the transaction may ultimately conclude in January. I also want to take this opportunity to thank everyone who's been working tirelessly on the spin. It's an important moment for the company, for our investors and a significant event in Yahoo's history.
Overall, I have very aggressive expectations for Yahoo's core business. We have the right talent, the right strategy and the right assets to drive long-term sustainable growth for our investors. As we look towards a post-spin 2016, we think there's a unique opportunity to reset and realign against the most impactful areas of focus. This will require us to simplify our structure, improve expense discipline and prioritize our investments to improve growth and profitability.
We remain deeply committed to doing what's best for Yahoo and delivering the most value to our shareholders. And we believe more strongly than ever that continued focus will help us accelerate our long-term growth and set us up for future success.
Now I'd like to turn it over to Ken to talk more about Q3."

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Today, I plan to review our third quarter operation results in more detail and also provide an update on the Aabaco spinoff transaction and later close with the outlook for the upcoming quarter.
We continued to grow GAAP revenue in Q3 to $1.226 billion, representing a 7% increase year-over-year. Through additional partnerships and affiliates, we increased the total advertising dollars in our ecosystem, leading to the Search and Display revenue growth of 13% and 14%, respectively.
Traffic acquisition costs increased by $169 million year-over-year to $223 million due to the additional contribution of off-network traffic and affiliate revenue. This resulted in revenue ex-TAC of $1.002 billion. In Q3, we effectively managed our cost base to deliver EBITDA of $244 million and non-GAAP operating income of $92 million.
We allocated appropriate resources and capital for growth initiatives while also realizing operating efficiencies through office consolidations and workforce expenses to reduce our cash operating cost to $758 million in the quarter.
And similar to prior trends, our full-time employee base declined by approximately 300 in the quarter, ending at 10,700. This results in a year-over-year reduction of 1,800, up 14%, even after including the acquisitions of BrightRoll and Polyvore. Our technical headcount remains steady at approximately half our employee base, while our G&A-related personnel costs have decreased. As we continue to remix and align resources to focus on key growth areas, we are mindful of our overall cost structure in improving operational efficiencies to focus on sustainably improving our EBITDA margins over time.
Before diving further into the financial details of the quarter, let me make a couple of comments on the Aabaco spinoff transaction. After carefully considering the company's options and feedback we received from our shareholders, our board authorized the company to continue to pursue the planned spinoff without a private letter ruling on the basis of a receipt of a favorable tax opinion from counsel. As Marissa noted, there are a number of factors to consider as we drive the transaction to conclusion, including regulatory processes, respective board approvals, notice requirements and holiday market closures. We remain focused on executing the transaction as soon as possible and look forward to updating you on the completed spinoff as well as our go-forward plan for core Yahoo on our Q4 earnings call.
I am focusing on the following for Q4: one, working diligently to complete the spinoff transaction; two, build a 2016 financial and operational plan that is realistic and executable in achieving our goals for revenue, earnings, EBITDA and free cash flow; three, develop a plan and strategy to communicate to our investors our core company direction post-spin, which includes how best to optimize our investment in Yahoo Japan; and finally, finish 2015 financially as strong as possible to set the stage for 2016.
Now let's run through our third quarter financial results in more detail. Once again, I will focus most of the discussion around the non-GAAP results, which excludes stock-based compensation expense of $110 million, restructuring charge of $26 million, an asset impairment charge of $42 million and $13 million noncash loss on our Hortonworks warrants. Please see our earnings slides on our Investor Relations website for a complete reconciliation between our GAAP and non-GAAP results.
Our financial highlights for Q3 can be seen on Slide 5. GAAP revenue was $1.226 billion, up 7% year-over-year or 10%, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Traffic acquisition costs were $223 million, which were up $169 million compared to the prior year, primarily due to our Mozilla partnership, Gemini search and growth in affiliate mobile display from our BrightRoll platform and Flurry business or Yahoo App Publishing. Revenue ex-TAC was $1.002 billion, which includes a negative foreign exchange impact of approximately $30 million on a year-over-year basis.
Taking a closer look at Search, GAAP Search revenue was $509 million, up 13% year-over-year. Search revenue ex-TAC declined 13% year-over-year, driven by increasing partner payments relative to click-driven revenue growth of 3% as well as our investment in Gemini, as Marissa has discussed.
We are making good progress on our internal search efforts under Gemini. Our sales teams have already secured thousands of accounts on the Gemini Search platform, and we fully expect to drive more advertisers and traffic onto the platform over the next quarter.
Now moving to Display. We saw a continuation of growth trends from the prior quarter. GAAP Display revenue was also $509 million, up 14% year-over-year as a result of our growing affiliate partnerships and video business. Display ads sold and PPA each increased 8% year-over-year. The Americas saw a strong PPA increase of 24%, driven by native and improved mix of video inventory.
Native PPA continued to see meaningful growth from the prior year. Our advertisers are seeing success in mobile by leveraging targeting capabilities available to Flurry. Display revenue ex-TAC grew 2% year-over-year or 6%, excluding the impact of foreign exchange.
In our Mavens businesses, we saw 43% GAAP revenue growth year-over-year for those areas in aggregate [ph]. Mavens now contributes 38% to our traffic-driven revenue, up from 29% in the prior year.
Video enjoyed a good quarter of growth as we continue to increase supply and demand across all areas of video business. For example, a fast-growing autoplay video supply is now fully available in the unified BrightRoll platform. We're also looking forward to delivering premium video content in our upcoming webcast of the London NFL game this Sunday, October 25.
Mobile GAAP revenue grew 31% year-over-year. We held a second Mobile Developer Conference in New York City this past quarter and continue to see strong native growth through Yahoo App Publishing in our international regions. Our native display revenue across all devices reached approximately $145 million in the quarter, driven by growth in both volume and pricing year-over-year.
For Tumblr, our priority remains user growth and engagements, which will lead to improved monetization. We are pursuing multiple paths to achieve increased monetization through our unified Yahoo sales force, including deeper integration with our rapidly growing Gemini marketplace. We expect to update financial performance for Tumblr at the end of the year.
Other revenue ex-TAC declined 6% year-over-year due primarily to the decline in Alibaba-related fees of $14 million, Taiwan e-commerce and other operational declines across lease [ph] listing of fees.
For revenue detail by region, please refer to Slide 10. Americas GAAP revenue grew 13% year-over-year due to the strong growth in Search of 20%, Display of 22%. APAC GAAP revenue was down 15%. Excluding FX headwinds, GAAP revenue was down 6%. EMEA GAAP revenue was down 11% but excluding FX, GAAP revenue was up 2%.
Now let's take a couple of minutes to go through our expenses and income in a bit more detail. Non-GAAP total operating expenses were down 3% year-over-year. D&A has remained consistent over the past several quarters at approximately $150 million. Our non-GAAP cash expenses for the full quarter came in better than our expectations at $758 million, declining 4% year-over-year. This was the result of our ongoing improvements to drive operating efficiencies for the company: one, a $38 million decrease in workforce expenses achieved through reduction in full-time employees while integrating acquisitions and redeploying resources to our strategic areas; two, a $10 million decrease in facilities as we see the continued benefits of our office consolidation; and three, the $8 million reduction in our discretionary expenses and outside service providers through tight budget controls. At the same time, we have offset with marketing investments in key partnerships and product launches.
Included in our GAAP total operating expenses, we incurred an asset impairment charge of $42 million related to a change of strategy on certain original long-form video content. Restructuring costs are $26 million related to resource realignment and location consolidations, as noted, and stock-based compensation of $110 million.
Our effective cost management helped to deliver EBITDA of $244 million in Q3, with a margin of 24% based on revenue ex-TAC. Non-GAAP operating income was $92 million for the quarter.
Running at the income statement, earnings and equity interests were $95 million. Our non-GAAP tax rate is 35%, and this is the estimate we expect to use for all of our 2015 non-GAAP presentations. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.15, and our Q3 average fully diluted share count decreased year-over-year by 6% to 947 million shares. And our ending diluted share count for the period was also 947 million.
Quickly turning to the balance sheet. Our Alibaba investment was $23 billion on the balance sheet, affected [ph] the Alibaba share price at the end of Q3 as this is mark-to-market. At the end of Q3, we had $6.8 billion in cash and marketable securities, a $5.5 billion net of our convertible and other debt. The change in cash balance from Q2 to Q3 was primarily driven by: free cash flow of $18 million, which includes capital spending of $150 million related to our products in Mail, Search and Mavens; acquisitions of $153 million; and proceeds -- positive proceeds of $50 million from yen hedges which actually brings a cumulative total to approximately $630 million since 2012. 
Now let me cover guidance. Before I walk through the outlook, the guidance I'm about to enumerate includes discussion from our earlier remarks. We expect to continue to grow GAAP revenue before revenue ex-TAC as we gain scale and market share in our core advertising businesses. Although we have historically seen a sequential increase in revenue ex-TAC in Q4, the typical amortization has now ended, resulting in a headwind of $60 million from Q3 to Q4. 
Additionally, the anniversaries of Mozilla and BrightRoll, together with our continued investments in Gemini, will put pressure on our GAAP and ex-TAC revenue growth. TAC increases will continue to reflect the growth of our Affiliate Display platforms and BrightRoll and App Publishing, as well as the increase in Search traffic flowing through our own Gemini platform. For non-GAAP cash expenses, we will continue our tight control of headcount and spending. 
For Q4 guidance, we expect the following: GAAP revenue range of $1.16 billion to $1.2 billion; TAC of approximately $240 million; revenue ex-TAC in the range of $920 million to $960 million; adjusted EBITDA in the range of $160 million to $200 million; and non-GAAP operating income in the range of $10 million to $50 million. 
In closing, as we prepare for the upcoming Aabaco transaction, we are also working through a multiyear transformation to position Yahoo to win in a highly competitive marketplace. We look forward to the opportunity at hand. We will be a more focused company in 2016, with the anticipated spin of Aabaco behind us as well as Alibaba-related revenue. 
While we have incurred challenges this year and have not achieved financial results or performance we had hoped for, we are committed as a management team to improve the execution in Q4 and 2016. We remain committed to executing toward EBITDA stabilization and growth over time. We have already executed a number of partnerships, investments in both Search and our Display properties which we believe establish a good foundation for the upcoming year. At our Q4 earnings call, we look forward to sharing additional information on our plans for the core Yahoo business post-spin. 
With that, Marissa and I would like to take your questions. Lauren?"

It is still subject to the regulatory review and we won't be implementing the partnership with Google until after that. And as part of this process, we're going to be investing in understanding how to balance the marketplace of our Search queries in terms of how to provide the best results as well as the best monetization. And so we see some opportunities in terms of providing coverage of more ads on more queries. We also see some opportunities in different international regions to just achieve a different blending. And I would also say, we're very confident in our Yahoo Gemini platform for Search. And when we look at mobile, we actually, as you know, have a different view in terms of what mobile search should be over time and what the best possible ways to monetize that are, to really provide value to advertisers. And so for us, the Yahoo Gemini platform is really where we want to invest, particularly on mobile and new formats, new ideas. And so I think you should expect to see a lot of our mobile traffic move to Yahoo Gemini and for us to basically develop a technology that does a good job competitively the balancing both the Bing and Google opportunities in terms of monetization."

And so when we look at the overall impact on the click-driven revenue in Search and why we saw a bit of a decline this quarter, about half of that comes from click volume which is a result of us both adding some high-quality partners, but also reducing some partners where we felt the quality really wasn't what we wanted. And about half of that decline is also from our investment in Gemini which largely manifests in terms of Price-per-Click. And obviously, this is something under our control and we discussed on our last earnings call. It was an investment we feel is important to make. But as we optimize that system, we're bringing new verticals on. It's not exactly clear how to rank our ads and so we use the Search traffic to learn, but that does mean when we're first doing our ad placements, we don't get them exactly right.

As I said, we see a lot of new exciting formats in Search, both on mobile and on desktop. And this is an area where we can see a really nice dovetailing between our Gemini Search offering as well as Gemini native. A lot of the same formats work very well in either location or in either setting. And so we really want to help -- have both of those marketplaces grow together and ultimately strengthen each other. In terms of the investment and the way that it works, a lot of people would expect it to show up as an investment in short-term operating expense. But the way it actually works is that it shows up as suppressed revenue. The analogy that works particularly well here is one of a class. If you're given for the final exam of a class on the first day of the course, you don't do very well. But by the time you've actually learned over the course of the class, you can do much better. Each of our search queries is essentially a test. And whether or not we can place those ads in the appropriate order in terms of quality and the ability to monetize and targeting is really the challenge. And so when we first start trying that, we don't necessarily place all of those correctly which results in slightly in the lower monetization. But each interaction with the user and each click in terms of where it lands teaches us something. And over the course of learning, we actually can improve our performance in terms of monetization vis-à-vis, improve our performance on the test. And that's the process we're going through now. We've been transitioning our advertisers to the Gemini platform vertical by vertical. At this point, we have thousands of advertisers on the Gemini Search platform. It's been a really exciting transition, and we've been really heartened by the way search advertisers have been willing to adopt this platform and learn with us, and it's been really exciting. And as we transition each vertical, we anticipate that it would be 2 to 3 quarters of learning until we really got to optimum. But when we get to optimum, it ultimately yields better monetization and improved margins."

Clearly, as Marissa noted, we are going to look at, as we position for 2016, what products and regions make the most sense to really focus on that can be strong winners for them, for us, and really focus on those. In some others, we may basically disinvest, if you will, and so -- or de-focus. And so some of that will affect Q4 as well. And so as we looked at it and then Marissa also talked about Search. And so Search in terms of some of the things that we have to concern ourselves about the Q3 to Q4 relates to some of the investments we're making and some of the changes as we go forward. So we looked at Search and how that may not grow as much as we would normally see Q3 to Q4. In Display, while it grows, it may also not grow quite as much because again, some of the focus we're making in terms of -- here are the key products we want to drive and work on, for some other products or regions for that matter, that maybe, we don't want to put as much focus on, and how that works is how we sort of thought about developing the guidance, if you will, for Q4.

So we will develop our expense plan in conjunction with as we develop our revenue plan.

Same time I can tell you, we have a very good clamp, if you will, on discretionary expenses where we don't have to spend. So we're working very, very hard on those expenses. Facilities expenses, travel entertainment, and so forth, working very tightly in those.

The Gemini investment, there's a modest investment in servers, there's a reasonable investment in engineers but that's been in place now for some quarters as we've been building the overall Gemini marketplace. The primary investment for Gemini comes in the form of suppressed revenue. In order for our system to learn, we basically need to receive the search, decide that we might be willing to make less money on it, rank the odds ourselves, get the user feedback and ultimately, learn from it. Because these are reinforced learning systems and so they basically need to see how users interact and respond to some options that we have in order to actually improve over time. And so the investment really does come in the form of suppressed revenue as opposed to in short-term operating expense or capital expense. And in terms of mobile search, overall, we really want to think about what enhances the user experience. We've been really excited to be introducing rich card experiences into our algorithmic search on Mobile. And in fact today, we actually power more than half of our experiences, our searches, our search results, the organic results, on Mobile with our own technology that we think provides a richer, more action-oriented set of experiences on Mobile. We want the ads to match that. We really ultimately want that experience. One of the things that's great about search ads is, a lot of times, they actually improve the search experience and provide you with a better result. So we want to figure out, through the Gemini platform, how to make the ads equally actionable, perhaps oriented towards applications and/or deep linking, et cetera. And by having our own platform, it really allows us the opportunity to experiment. And so I would think that we will swing more of our traffic on Mobile towards the investment piece for learning. But obviously, we want to have a strong and vibrant business. And so we are going to hold all of this in balance with the partnerships with Microsoft and Google."

We ultimately need to work to improve our relevance to end users and how many times they come to us. With more than 1 billion users, we essentially have most people who are online over the course of a month or any given day coming to Yahoo either on the web or on Mobile.

First, Marissa, I want to talk a little bit about programmatic advertising. I was wondering because this is actually the first time where you actually had a fair amount of discussion in your prepared remarks and the press release. How much of the Display inventory was actually sold programmatically? And just in the big scheme of things when you look at the competitive landscape, how do you position Yahoo in what is becoming a pretty intense environment? And then Ken, just going back to your Q4 guidance, not on the revenue, but on the EBITDA. At the midpoint, it implies about a 19% margin, down from I think 34%, 35% last year. Well, I was just wondering if you can just walk us through the big components of that because it seems a little too much, but I don't know."

We haven't actually provided the exact percentage of how much of our inventory is sold programmatically, but it is the majority. And obviously, that's even accelerating with the introduction of BrightRoll into our offering and obviously, unifying all of our DSP offerings and programmatic offerings under the BrightRoll brand. It really provides for a strong basis. In terms of how do we position ourselves in that programmatic space, it is a very crowded space, but we have an incredibly premium site. Advertisers really like being able to have get access to Yahoo inventory through our programmatic offerings. We also have a lot of data. Data in terms of overall user habits and trends as well as analyses in terms of what their interests are that are unique to Yahoo. And obviously, our reach puts us among one of the top Internet players in terms of how many different people come to Yahoo O&O properties, let alone the broader network. And we do a lot for a lot of different customization for our advertisers in terms of how we report, how we pixel different advertisements and our flexibility there. And so I would really say the things that set us apart are data reach and customization and obviously, we're always working to make our products as easy-to-use and intuitive and as well-integrated as we possibly can across a wide array of products, and so that breadth also helps us."

And I say that when I think about we lose basically with no expenses, the full TIPLA revenue which was close to $70 million year-over-year. So $70 million last year, 0 this year so that sort of falls right to the bottom line. It was noncash but it does fall right to the bottom Line. And then sort of it's really primarily driven by revenue. From an expense point of view, yes, we think the Q4 expense is consistent with Q3. And the way I have always thought about expenses, they are pretty much sequentially thought. I mean, there are some seasonal expenses you have like benefits. Sometimes, they're higher in Q1 but generally expenses fall pretty much sequentially. And so Q4 is pretty consistent with our Q3 and that's taking into account some of the comments I made before. But really, the EBITDA margin percentage for Q4 is primarily driven by revenue. Now as we think about '16, we'll be thoughtful and mindful that we are focused on EBITDA, we are focused on profitability and we have to think about the mix and match between what's realistic from a revenue point of view, as I talked about earlier, and then what we can do on expenses so that we get a competitive EBITDA and, frankly, operating profit margin and free cash flow."

That's a very insightful question because I do think there's a lot of common threads that run across the Polyvore acquisition as well as TripAdvisor and Yelp. Overall, we feel that search results, especially on Mobile, need to evolve a lot more. They need to be richer, they need to be more graphical, they need to be more action-oriented. Our Flurry Analytics system which is the largest analytic system in the world now monitors more than 2 billion devices or sees more than 2 billion devices. Overall, it has measured that more than 90% of time on phones is being spent in apps as opposed to in the browser. And that really means that users are expecting an app-like experience. And so we're constantly looking at Search both in terms of how it behaves in the browser as well as opportunities in apps which we do through our Mobile developer offerings and our Mobile developer suite. We try to make our Search available. But by having these rich content sources, one is about the extra content and visuals that we can put on the page to give people a more informed answer on their search. We're even more serious about empowering them in terms of actions. Can they book a restaurant on Yelp? Can they book a flight or a hotel on TripAdvisor with Polyvore? Can they move on to a site or into an application where they can directly buy the product that they're looking at and liking? And so we really think that on the mobile phone, Search becomes that much more action-oriented. And by having these strong partnerships with the leaders in their spaces, this is something that allows us to really create a differentiated product that we think is something that can set us apart over time."
