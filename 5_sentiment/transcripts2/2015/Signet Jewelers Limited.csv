In the fourth quarter, we delivered solid top line and bottom line results. Signet comp store sales increased by 4.2%, with strong sales performance across all divisions and selling channels.On divisional busin",1479,"Thanks, James, and good morning, everyone. In the fourth quarter, we delivered solid top line and bottom line results. Signet comp store sales increased by 4.2%, with strong sales performance across all divisions and selling channels.
On divisional business, Sterling delivered a same-store sales increase of 3.7%, while delivering record operating profit. Zale also drove an impressive 3.7% comp sales increase. Our U.K. division delivered its highest fourth quarter same-store sales increase in 13 years at 7.5%, its best operating profit in 3 years. From a merchandise view, Signet's bridal and fashion diamond performed very well across the organization. And by selling channel, our broad-based strength was evident with outlets and eCommerce delivering strong results, in addition to our traditional store locations. Signet's eCommerce sales in the fourth quarter were $149.6 million, which is an increase of 89.4%, which is due to the addition of Zale this year. But when you exclude the Zale division, our eCommerce sales were at $94.8 million, which is at a growth rate of 20%. Signet's fourth quarter adjusted EPS was at $3.06, $0.01 higher than our top end of our guidance and up 40.4% from the prior year period due to strong execution of our fourth quarter strategies, but I'd also like to add that Zale favorably impacted EPS by $0.43. So when measured on an apples-to-apples basis versus last year by excluding Zale, Signet's EPS was up $0.35 or 16.1%.
Now let's focus on our performance by division, starting with the Sterling division. We have arrived in drivers behind our fourth quarter Sterling results. Most notably, our sustainable competitive strengths that include our superior guest experience, our exciting merchandise offerings, our creative marketing and our multichannel approach. The customer experience is central to our success, and we're very pleased with our service metrics that was delivered by our store teams in the fourth quarter and for the year. As for merchandise, Sterling's fourth quarter results were driven by our entire bridal category as well as fashion jewelry, especially Le Vian and Diamonds in Rhythm. Marketing also played a crucial role in the fourth quarter with the benefits of new creative, increased impressions and well-placed media. Growth in eCommerce and outlets exceeded the division average, while malls and freestanding stores performed well also. All this led to same-store sales increase of 3.7% in Sterling, and as I said earlier, record operating profit.
Now moving onto our Zale division. Zale delivered a strong fourth quarter due to a variety of planned investments and initiatives around merchandising, marketing and field operations. Let's begin with merchandising. Our branded bridal and Fashion Diamond collection performed very well, led by the Vera Wang LOVE collection, our Celebration Diamond collection and Unstoppable Love. We've been focused on expanding depth versus breadth in the Zale merchandise assortment, and this proved effective in the fourth quarter. We believe we have significant potential to continue to grow our brands along with developing new brands through our innovation process. As for marketing, we increased our TV and online media investment, we strengthened the quality and the placement of our marketing, we focused on Vera, and it worked. We directed more resources towards the flagship sales brand in the U.S. and Peoples brands in Canada and heavily supported their in-store events. Our store teams focused their presentations on features and benefits of our offerings, especially in the context of bridal and the Vera Wang LOVE collection. We also increased payroll for appropriate floor coverage and provided new incentives. In the fourth quarter, there were a variety of successes in the Zale division. We also delivered strong results in Canada in spite of the weaker energy industry, and the Piercing Pagoda and eCommerce businesses performed well. We saw a lot of terrific collaboration between the Zale, Sterling and U.K. teams to enhance our synergies going forward.
As a result of the acquisitions, Signet will realize significant operating profit synergies. We've talked about this before and there are no changes, but it bears repeating where these synergies will come from and how they will flow and why. Of the $150 million to $175 million of net synergies, roughly 20% will be achieved from expense reductions, 30% from services and brand cross-selling and 50% from supply chain and purchasing initiatives. Now shown on the right graph of Slide 6, we expect to see about 20% of the $150 million to $175 million achieved by fiscal year-end 2016, mainly in the second half of this year. By the end of fiscal 2017, another 40% of synergies will be achieved for a total of 60% of our 3-year goal. Then by the end of fiscal 2018, we expect to achieve the final 40% of our synergy goals. We believe the cadence of synergies will flow in these proportions due to the reinvesting of some gross synergies and the time required to deploy and effectively utilize certain information technology.
One final point of synergies. The majority of the operating profit synergies will be achieved within the Zale division, but not all of it. A minority of synergies will fall in the Sterling and U.K. divisions. In the U.K., we delivered our best fourth quarter comp sales in 13 years and our best operating profit in 3 years. The same drivers that we have seen in the first 3 quarters of the year once again led the division's improved results. These include initiatives around diamonds and on omni-channel approach, new marketing and in a focus on sales rather than test. The U.K. results were driven principally by the benefits of strategic moves we've taken around Diamonds based upon a better understanding of our customers and the types of products, pricing and promotions that they require. Store team member training is more focused on diamonds, which by the way, helps all sales training. Point-of-purchase displays are more powerful. More space has been devoted to diamonds. Bridal diamond brands performed very well such as Perfect Fit and Forever Diamonds in H.Samuel stores and Leo, Neil Lane, Le Vian and Tolkowsky in our Ernest Jones stores. And new TV advertising creative with increased impressions has also driven our diamond business.
Our redesigned H.Samuel and Ernest Jones websites as well improved fulfillment processes, strengthened our U.K. income results. In addition, we opened our first 8 Ernest Jones outlet collection stores in the United Kingdom, and we are pleased with their start and intend to open up more this year and into the future.
We've made a variety of store operations improvement that are driving better sales productivity. In general, the focus and our field operations teams have shifted considerably more in favor of engaging customers and selling as opposed to noncustomer-facing tasks.
It was an absolutely incredible year for Signet. And I want -- now want to take a moment to review just some of the more notable accomplishments in fiscal 2015. The acquisition of Zale was the most significant M&A transaction in the history of jewelry retail. Rarely in retail does #1 acquire #2 and still have significant runway for opportunity because of a highly fragmented nature of our marketplace. Our U.K. performance was unprecedented, as I detailed moments ago. We have made great strides in establishing a highly collaborative, team-oriented mindset within and in between all 3 of our organizations. We have also begun to establish the ongoing process of sharing best practices and using them within all of our divisions. We call this being Signet-ized. We continue to find additional ways to unlock the value in or outlet channel. In fiscal 2015, we rolled out [indiscernible] and we've open new Ernest Jones outlet collection stores in the United Kingdom. We became more vertically integrated to secure supplies of diamonds for all of our stores globally. And one of the achievements was becoming a De Beers site holder. We grew our proprietary and exclusive brand penetration by successfully testing and extending compelling merchandise collections. And we continue to innovate and develop new product with the opening of Signet's new design center in New York. We believe more strongly now than ever that an omni-channel approach to jewelry retail is critical. We educate our customers, we communicate with them and merchandise to them through an Internet -- not only to drive eCommerce growth, but also to maximize in-store experiences. We strengthened our digital ecosystem experience by optimizing store brand websites for both desktop and mobile devices, increasing merchandise assortments and investing in social media. And from a financial performance perspective, we hit or exceeded all of our financial metrics, including or excluding Zale. We return value to shareholders by increasing our dividend for the third year in a row, while integrating a major acquisition. And all this led to an important threshold of over $10 billion of market capitalization.
And with that, I'll now turn over to Michele for a look at our financials."

I'm battling a cold, so if I interrupt my commentary with an occasional cough, and I apologize. All right. So to start with, I just want to emphasize my comparison and commentary will be focused on our fourth quarter results.
So let's begin by reviewing sales, which Mark offered a brief overview of these numbers a few moments ago. In the Sterling division, total sales increased 5.5% to $1,358,300,000, which included a same-store sales increase of 3.7%. The average price in Sterling increased by 4.5% and number of transactions decreased by 1.2%. The increase in the average transaction price was driven primarily by bridal and diamond with a number of transactions impacted by a decline of sales associated with lower average selling price units.
Zale division total sales were $636.7 million for the quarter, which included a same-store sales increase of 3.7%. Total sales also included a $12.8 million unfavorable revenue impact due to purchase accounting adjustments related to deferred revenue. As Mark indicated, sales were driven in part by initial synergy initiatives surrounding Zales associate training, merchandise assortment and new marketing creative. Merchandise sales were particularly strong in branded bridal and branded diamond fashion. U.K. division total sales increased 2.1% or 7.7% on a constant exchange basis to $278 million with a comp sales increase of 7.5%. This increase was driven primarily by branded bridal, fashion diamond jewelry and fashion watches. The average transaction price increased by 7% and the number of transactions increased by 1.6%, and that was attributed to strong performance across the entire merchandise portfolio.
Moving on. Over the next couple of slides, I will share with you Signet's consolidated Q4 performance before we turn and analyze Signet's adjusted results. So on Slide 10, the table provides a reconciliation of Signet's adjusted results to consolidated results. Again, the difference between adjusted Signet and Signet are the columns reflecting purchase accounting and transaction cost, which also include integration-related expenses.
On a GAAP basis, EPS was $2.84 per share, and that was $0.01 higher than our guidance. Purchase accounting adjustments, which included a reduction to deferred revenue, amortization related to inventory fair value step-up and amortization of unfavorable contracts were dilutive to EPS by $0.14. Transaction costs, including advisory, accounting and integration costs cost were responsible for $0.08 of dilution.
Signet's effective tax rate for the quarter was 29.6%, and the effective tax rate for fiscal 2015 was 29.5%.
So let's now look at the breakout of operating income by division. Operating income of $331.7 million or 14.6% of sales consisted of the following components: Sterling Jewelers operating income was a record $260 million or 19.1% of division sales, and that is up 140 basis points from last year. Zale division operating income was $36.1 million or 5.7% of division sales. Zale's performance consisted of $32.8 million in profit from Zale jewelry operating segment and $3.3 million from the Piercing Pagoda operating segment. Now that does include costs of $20.8 million related to purchase accounting adjustments, which we just discussed on the previous slide. Excluding the impact from these accounting adjustments, the Zale division operating profit was $56.9 million or 8.7% of division sales. The U.K. operating profit was $53.8 million or 19.4% of the division sales, and that is $2.1 million higher than last year and was the best Q4 operating performance in 3 years. This performance is attributed to a continued focus on growing top line combined with cost control measurements. Other primarily consists of our corporate and administrative expenses and Signet's diamond sourcing subsidiaries. It also includes $9.2 million of transaction costs.
To help provide comparability to last year, we are also presenting our results on an adjusted basis, which excludes the purchase accounting adjustments and transaction costs. The presentation here on Slide 12 takes adjusted Signet, which is shown on the far right side of the slide, and then breaks it into 2 parts. One part is sale operations, which is reflected in the middle column, and the second part on the left-hand column is adjusted Signet excluding Zale. Adjusted Signet excluding Zale is the rest of Signet's inclusive of our financing interest and taxes. From Zale's operating income, this gives you an apples-to-apples comparability to prior year results. In addition, the information is provided to give you visibility as to how the Zale operations performed in the fourth quarter.
Now recall that we have guided for the Zale EPS accretion of $0.36 to $0.40 for the fourth quarter. Our actual accretion from Zale operations was $0.43, resulting from higher margins and lower expenses in the quarter. We anticipate providing this incremental detail for you until we establish precedent for Signet's results, post acquisition, when we will lap these numbers in the third quarter.
So continuing on. Let's review Signet's adjusted P&L results below the sales line. Adjusted gross margin was $936.9 million or 40.9% of adjusted sales, and that was down 60 basis points versus last year. The decrease in rate was driven by the addition of Zale, which impacted the gross margin rate by 110 basis points. Now excluding the Zale division, the adjusted segment gross margin rate would have been 42% and that compares to prior year fourth quarter rate of 41.5%. The Signet adjusted gross margin rate decrease of 60 basis points was partially offset by a higher gross margin rate in the Sterling division of 70 basis points, primarily due to merchandise margin factors including lower commodity costs.
Adjusted SG&A was $629.3 million or 27.5% of adjusted sales, and that was up 30 basis points versus last year. This increase again was driven by the addition of Zale, which impacted the rate by 70 basis points. Excluding the Zale division, the adjusted Signet SG&A rate would've been 26.8%, and that compared to the prior year SG&A rate of 27.2% with SG&A leveraging on higher sales.
Other operating income was $54.1 million. This increase of $6.5 million was due principally to higher interest income earned from higher outstanding receivable balances.
Adjusted operating income in the fourth quarter was $361.7 million or 15, 8% of adjusted sales. Excluding the Zale division, that adjusted Signet operating margin would have been 18.6%, and that's up 130 basis points from prior year operating margin rate of 17.3%.
Adjusted EPS was $3.06 compared to $2.18 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014. On a comparable basis, that is when excluding this year's impact from the newly acquired Zale and the capital structure and financing, EPS was $2.53 or a 16.1% increase over last year.
So let's move on to the balance sheet, and we'll begin with review our inventory levels. Net inventories ended the year at $2.4 billion, and that's an increase of nearly $1 billion or 63.9% over last year. The increase was driven almost entirely by the acquisition of Zale. Now to a lesser extent, inventory levels were also impacted by the Sterling Jewelers division, which increased approximately 4%, and this increase was primarily due to new store growth as well as modest increases among branded bridal and diamond jewelry collections as well as diamonds. Due in part to our strong January, our inventory levels and assortment are well positioned in the first quarter.
So moving on, we'll turn our attention to our in-house credit metrics and statistics. In-house credit remains an important component of our Sterling division's business and competitive advantage. Net accounts are salable increased to $1.57 billion compared to $1.37 billion last year, up 14.1%, and that's driven by higher sales as well as an increase in the credit penetration rate. Our credit participation was 60.5% compared to 57.7% last year. The increase in credit participation is attributed primarily to our credit decision engine improvements made in April of last year as well as higher outlet credit participation and strong guest acceptance of our credit offerings. The average monthly collection rate year-to-date was 11.9% compared to 12.1% last year as guests continued to opt more to our regular credit service, which requires lower monthly payments as opposed to the 12-month interest-free program.
So moving on to credit statistics around our in-house finance programs. Netback debt expense for the year was $160 million compared to $138.3 million last year, an increase of $21.7 million, and that was driven primarily by the growth in our receivable balance from increased credit participation and change in the credit program metrics. Interest income from our in-house program, which makes up the vast majority of our other operating income P&L line item, was $217.9 million and that compares to $186.4 million last year. This was an increase of $31.5 million and is due primarily to more interest income on a higher outstanding receivables as well as the shift away from the interest-free programs.
So the net impact of these 2 items was income of $57.9 million compared to $48.1 million in the prior year or an increase of $9.8 million.
Operating improvements made to our decision engine have helped increase credit penetration and profit without adversely affecting the net impact of our bad debt for the full year.
Now on a quarterly basis, the net impact of bad debt and interest income was about flat, and that's due primarily to the timing of recoveries which have been realized in the first quarter of fiscal 2016. The portfolio continues to perform very strongly for us, and that's evidenced by the allowance as a percentage of our ending accounts receivable, finishing nearly flat to last year.
So let's move onto on to some other highlights of the balance sheet. All right. Capital allocation. In terms of Signet's capital, I'm really excited to share with you our priorities for capital structure and our capital allocation strategy, which have been thoughtfully developed. We have a strong balance sheet, and this will allow us to execute our strategic priorities, invest in the business and return excess cash to shareholders, while ensuring adequate liquidity. We are proud to have an investment-grade rating, and we are also committed to maintaining these ratings. And this is important to us because, long term, we will continue to invest in the organic growth of our powerful store brands as well as pursue value-enhancing acquisitions. Our focus remains growing on a per-share basis.
Among the key tenets of our capital strategy that we'd like to share with you are to achieve an adjusted leverage ratio at or below 3.5x. Now we ended fiscal 2015 at 4x, but keep in mind that this only includes a partial year at Zale. So our business grows in fiscal 2016, we should start fiscal 2017 with a ratio closer to our target, which will allow us to utilize our balance sheet in fiscal 2017 and beyond with available sources of debt. We plan to distribute 70% to 80% of annual free cash flow in the form of stock repurchases or dividends, assuming no other strategic uses of capital. We expect to increase the dividend consistently, which we have been doing over the last several years.
Now in terms of share repurchases, we will repurchase $100 million to $150 million of Signet's stock by the end of fiscal 2016. We have a remaining authorization of $265.6 million. And as this program runs out, we will review and initiate a new program with our board in line with leverage and free cash flow target. And finally, we will evaluate using additional capacity beyond our current $600 million on the asset-backed securitization facility beginning in fiscal 2017.
So now I'd like to just take a quick minute and walk through the calculation behind our adjusted leverage ratio, which is outlined on Slide 18. Our methodology of calculating our leverage ratio is really closely aligned to our more constraining credit rating agency approach and incorporates a captive finance adjustment. Now this adjustment reduces Signet's total debt, inclusive of ABS debt, by 70% of finance receivables and excludes finance income from our EBITDAR. So throughout the calculation, and we'll start at the top of the slide with a captive finance adjustment, this adjustment is simply our net Sterling Jewelers division finance receivables times 70%. And as you can see a few rows down, this amount of $1,087,000,000 will reduce Signet's total adjusted debt. So in the second row on the slide, we add long-term debt, which includes our asset-backed securitization and loans and overdraft to arrive at our total balance sheet debt. To then arrive at Signet's adjusted debt, we add our balance sheet debt and 8x run expense. And from this, we subtract the captive finance figure calculated on the first row. This sums to adjusted debt of $4.1 billion. The denominator or our adjusted EBITDAR on the fourth row is calculated by summing our adjusted EBITDA, expense and share-based compensation. And from this, we subtract our finance income from our finance receivables. This comes to an adjusted EBITDAR of just over $1 billion.
With the full year Zale operations and our expected growth in fiscal 2016, we will be well positioned to evaluate utilizing additional capacity under our ABS facility in fiscal 2017. Our capital allocation policy allows for continued growth in the business, coupled with meaningful returns to our shareholders.
So now we'll move on to our financial guidance. First quarter Signet comparable store sales are expected to increase 3% to 4%. First quarter adjusted EPS is expected to be $1.57 to $1.62. And as a reminder, adjusted EPS is EPS less the $0.02 of adjustments shown on Slide 19, being purchase accounting and transaction cost. Now within adjusted EPS, Zale operations are expected to be accretive in the first quarter by $0.17 to $0.18. And I would also add, only because it's been a hot topic in our space lately, that the impact to EPS from add-backs is expected to be minimal. And I would just remind you that less than 10% of our annual operating profit is earned outside the U.S.
From an effective tax rate standpoint, Signet's fiscal 2016 annual rate is anticipated to be 28% to 29%, and the difference versus our fiscal 2015 is principally the full year effect of owning Zale and having our capital structure in place.
Capital expenditure guidance for the full year is $275 million to $325 million, and net selling square footage is projected to grow approximately 2% to 3%.
So I'd also reference you to our earnings release for further detail by division. That concludes my prepared remarks on the financials. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Mark."

And then, Michele, just wanted you to give us some general comments about how March margin may trend throughout the year by brand? And then you mentioned the ABS additional capacity. If you could help us understand how to think about that, that would be appreciated."

And as of June in our investor conference up in the commercial auto right now, you hear of lot more about that how you're going to segment other brands, our store brands and how are product will support segmentation and transition. But overall, there is a good opportunities for brand cross-selling, but it's still early to really understand where the full opportunity is. As far as the -- I think you said all the non-bridal or non-diamond categories of jewelry, how are we doing? And we're doing better. As you recall, and during that holiday announcement, some of our lower-price point probably did not do as well that well. But right now, we're seeing reverse of that trend. And we have a lot of -- our merchants overcome a lot of exciting new price point opportunities that you more about into the fall season."

And in terms of our growth margin trends, your question around that and breaking that out by brand, we're not forecasting or giving guidance for the year on our gross margin and to break it down by brand. That is to try and give you maybe directionally some color around that. Going back to our synergies, which we talked about a component of our synergies, that incorporates gross margin improvement. So -- and we talked about 20% of our synergies being achieved in fiscal 2016. So that in and of itself would lend to an improved gross margin. Again, it all kind of behaves where it's been you would anticipate that we can continue to see some benefits on benefits the commodity cost side, but can be erratic as you can never know quite went up today to land. Your other comment in terms of how to think through the ABS additional capacity. So a few things there, we have the capital allocation strategy and where we -- and our leverage ratio at the end of fiscal 2015 and again I'll just remind you that that includes only a partial year from Zale. We don't have -- we don't see the immediate capacity in fiscal 2016 to utilize the additional ABS or securitization, but as we move through FY '16, incorporating a full year Zale operation as well as the natural growth in our business well positioned in the end that year in moving into fiscal 2017 to revisit our asset-backed securitization and take advantage of capacity. And I just remind you, our current ABS facility, we have an advanced rate of 65% under that. We currently are at about 60% threshold. So we have an opportunity, one, not only to increase our level of capacity under that, but also to the revisit and increase that 65% to a higher number. So just provide that color to your question."

We have a strong team running that business and they have been enhancing the merchandising programs. They've been putting in more 14-karat gold jewelry. They've been testing some other brands that can engage customers and we are going to have some new design stores that we're testing this year also. So right now in early stages of understanding the Piercing Pagoda business. We like the margins. We have very strong gross margins. And we think this opportunity to get that revenue line moving at a faster pace with fingers and tremendous growth opportunities. Piercing Pagoda.

In the fourth quarter, we delivered solid top line and bottom line results. Signet comp store sales increased by 4.2%, with strong sales performance across all divisions and selling channels.On a divisional bus",1488,"Thanks, James. And good morning, everyone. In the fourth quarter, we delivered solid top line and bottom line results. Signet comp store sales increased by 4.2%, with strong sales performance across all divisions and selling channels.
On a divisional business, Sterling delivered a same-store sales increase of 3.7%, while delivering record operating profit. Zale also drove an impressive 3.7% comp sales increase. Our U.K. division delivered its highest fourth quarter of same-store sales increase in 13 years at 7.5%, and its best operating profit in 3 years. 
From a merchandise view, Signet's bridal and fashion diamonds performed very well across the organization. And by selling channel, our broad-based strength was evident with outlets and eCommerce delivering strong results, in addition to our traditional store locations. 
Signet's eCommerce sales in the fourth quarter were $149.6 million which was an increase of 89.4%, which was due to the addition of Zale this year. But when you exclude the Zale division, our eCommerce sales were at $94.8 million which was at a growth rate of 20%. Signet's fourth quarter adjusted EPS was at $3.06, $0.01 higher than our top end of our guidance, and up 40.4% from the prior year period due to strong execution of our fourth quarter strategies. I would also like to add that Zale favorably impacted EPS by $0.43. So when measured on an apples-to-apples basis versus last year by excluding Zale, Signet's EPS was up $0.35 or 16.1%.
Now let's focus on our performance by division, starting with the Sterling division. We had a variety of drivers behind our fourth quarter Sterling results. Most notably, our sustainable competitive strengths that include: our superior guest experience, our exciting merchandise offerings, our creative marketing and our multichannel approach. 
The customer experience is central to our success and we're very pleased with our service metrics that was delivered by our store teams in the fourth quarter and for the year. As for merchandise, Sterling's fourth quarter results were driven by our entire bridal category as well as fashion jewelry, especially Le Vian and Diamonds in Rhythm. Marketing also played a crucial role in the fourth quarter, with the benefits of new creative increased impressions and well-placed media. Growth in eCommerce and outlets exceeded the division average, while malls and freestanding stores performed well also. All this led to same-store sales increase of 3.7% in Sterling and, as I said earlier, record operating profit.
Now moving on to our Zale division. Zale delivered a strong fourth quarter due to a variety of planned investments and initiatives around merchandising, marketing and field operations. Let's begin with merchandising. Our branded bridal and fashion diamond collection performed very well, led by the Vera Wang LOVE collection, our Celebration Diamond collection and our Unstoppable Love. We've been focused on expanding depth versus breadth in the Zale merchandise assortment, and this proved effective in the fourth quarter. 
We believe we have significant potential to continue to grow our brands along with developing new brands through our innovation process. As for marketing, we increased our TV and online media investment, we strengthened the quality and the placement of our marketing, we focused on Vera and it all worked. We directed more resources towards the flagship Zales brand in the U.S. and Peoples brand in Canada and heavily supported their in-store events. 
Our store teams focused their presentations on features and benefits of our offerings, especially in the context of bridal and the Vera Wang LOVE collection. We also increased payroll for appropriate floor coverage and provided new incentives. In the fourth quarter, there were a variety of successes in the Zale division. We also delivered strong results in Canada in spite of the weaker energy industry, and the Piercing Pagoda and eCommerce businesses performed well. We saw a lot of terrific collaboration between the Zale, Sterling and U.K. teams to enhance our synergies going forward.
As a result of the acquisitions, Signet will realize significant operating profit synergies. We've talked about this before and there are no changes. But it bears repeating, where these synergies will come from and how they will flow and why. Of the $150 million to $175 million of net synergies, roughly 20% will be achieved from expense reductions, 30% from repair services and brand cross-selling, and 50% from supply chain and purchasing initiatives. 
Now as shown on the right graph of Slide 6, we expect to see about 20% of the $150 million to $175 million achieved by fiscal year-end 2016, mainly in the second half of this year. By the end of fiscal 2017, another 40% of synergies will be achieved for a total of 60% of our 3-year goal. Then by the end of fiscal 2018, we expect to achieve the final 40% of our synergy goals. We believe the cadence of the synergies will flow in these proportions due to the reinvesting of some gross synergies and the time required to deploy and effectively utilize certain information technology.
One final point of synergies. The majority of the operating profit synergies will be achieved within the Zale division, but not all of it. A minority of synergies will fall in the Sterling and U.K. divisions. 
In the U.K., we delivered our best fourth quarter comp sales in 13 years and our best operating profit in 3 years. The same drivers that we have seen in the first 3 quarters of the year once again led the division's improved results. These include initiatives around diamonds in an omni-channel approach, new marketing and a focus on sales rather than task. The U.K. results were driven principally by the benefits of strategic moves we've taken around diamonds, based upon a better understanding of our customers and the types of products, pricing and promotions that they require. 
Store team member training is more focused on diamonds which, by the way, helps all sales training. Point-of-purchase displays are more powerful, more space has been devoted to diamonds. Bridal diamond brands performed very well such as Perfect Fit and Forever Diamonds in our H.Samuel stores and Leo, Neil Lane, Le Vian and Tolkowsky in our Ernest Jones stores. And new TV advertising creative with increased impressions has also driven our diamond business.
Our redesigned H.Samuel and Ernest Jones websites as well has improved fulfillment processes, strengthened our U.K. income results. In addition, we opened our first 8 Ernest Jones outlet collection stores in the United Kingdom and we are pleased with their start and intend to open up more this year and into the future.
We've made a variety of store operation improvement that are driving better sales productivity. In general, the focus on our field operations teams have shifted considerably more in favor of engaging customers and selling as opposed to noncustomer-facing tasks.
It was an absolutely incredible year for Signet, and I want -- now want to take a moment to review just some of the more notable accomplishments in fiscal 2015. The acquisition of Zale was the most significant M&A transaction in the history of jewelry retail. Rarely in retail does #1 acquire #2 and still have significant runway for opportunity because of the highly fragmented nature of our marketplace. Our U.K. performance was unprecedented, as I detailed moments ago. 
We have made great strides in establishing a highly collaborative, team-oriented mindset within and between all 3 of our divisions. We've also begun to establish the ongoing process of sharing best practices and using them within all of our divisions. We call this being Signetized. We continue to find additional ways to unlock the value in our outlet channel. 
In fiscal 2015, we rolled out Jared Vault and we opened new Ernest Jones outlet collection stores in United Kingdom. We became more vertically integrated to secure supplies of diamonds for all of our stores globally, and one of the crowning achievements was becoming a De Beers sightholder. We grew our proprietary and exclusive brand penetration by successfully testing and extending compelling merchandise collections. And we continue to innovate and develop new product with the opening of Signet's new design center in New York. 
We believe more strongly, now than ever that an omni-channel approach to jewelry retail is critical. We educate our customers, we communicate with them, and merchandise to them through an Internet, not only to drive eCommerce growth but also to maximize in-store experiences. We strengthened our digital ecosystem experience by optimizing store-brand websites for both desktop and mobile devices, by increasing merchandise assortments and by investing in social media. 
And from a financial performance perspective, we hit or exceeded all of our financial metrics including or excluding Zale. We returned value to shareholders by increasing our dividend for the third year in a row, while integrating a major acquisition. And all this led to an important threshold of over $10 billion of market capitalization.
And with that, I'll now turn over to Michele for a look at our financials."

I apologize in advance, I'm battling a cold so if I interrupt my commentary with an occasional cough, again, I apologize. 
All right. So to start with, I just want to emphasize my comparison and commentary will be focused on our fourth quarter results. So let's begin by reviewing sales, which Mark offered a brief overview of these numbers a few moments ago. In the Sterling division, total sales increased 5.5% to $1,358,300,000, which included a same-store sales increase of 3.7%. The average transaction price in Sterling increased by 4.5% and number of transactions decreased by 1.2%. The increase in the average transaction price was driven primarily by bridal and diamonds, with a number of transactions impacted by a decline in sales associated with lower average selling price units.
Zale division total sales were $636.7 million for the quarter, which included a same-store sales increase of 3.7%. Total sales also included a $12.8 million unfavorable revenue impact due to purchase accounting adjustments related to deferred revenue. As Mark indicated, sales were driven in part by initial synergy initiative surrounding sales associate training, merchandise assortment and new marketing creative. 
Merchandise sales were particularly strong in branded bridal and branded diamond fashion. U.K. division total sales increased 2.1% or 7.7% on a constant exchange basis to $278 million with a comp sales increase of 7.5%. This increase was driven primarily by branded bridal, fashion diamond jewelry and fashion watches. The average transaction price increased by 7% and the number of transactions increased by 1.6% and that was attributed to strong performance across the entire merchandise portfolio.
Moving on. Over the next couple of slides, I will share with you Signet's consolidated Q4 performance before we turn and analyze Signet's adjusted results. So on Slide 10, the table provides a reconciliation of Signet's adjusted results to consolidated results. Again, the difference between adjusted Signet and Signet are the columns reflecting purchase accounting and transaction cost, which also include integration-related expenses.
On a GAAP basis, EPS was $2.84 per share and that was $0.01 higher than our guidance. Purchase accounting adjustments, which include a reduction to deferred revenue, amortization related to inventory fair value step-up and amortization of unfavorable contracts were dilutive to EPS by $0.14. Transaction costs, including advisory, accounting and integration costs cost were responsible for $0.08 of dilution. Signet's effective tax rate for the quarter was 29.6% and the effective tax rate for fiscal 2015 was 29.5%.
So let's now look at the breakout of operating income by division. Operating income of $331.7 million or 14.6% of sales consisted of the following components: Sterling Jewelers operating income was a record $260 million or 19.1% of division sales, and that is up 140 basis points from last year. Zale division operating income was $36.1 million or 5.7% of division sales. 
Zale's performance consisted of $32.8 million in profit from Zales Jewelry operating segment and $3.3 million from the Piercing Pagoda operating segment. Now that does include costs of $20.8 million related to purchase accounting adjustments, which we just discussed on the previous slide. Excluding the impact from these accounting adjustments, the Zale division operating profit was $56.9 million or 8.7% of division sales. The U.K. operating profit was $53.8 million or 19.4% of division sales and that is $2.1 million higher than last year and was the best Q4 operating performance in 3 years. This performance is attributed to a continued focus on growing top line combined with cost control measurements. 
Other primarily consists of our corporate and administrative expenses and Signet's diamond sourcing subsidiary, it also included $9.2 million of transaction costs.
To help provide comparability to last year, we're also presenting our results on an adjusted basis which excludes the purchase accounting adjustments and transaction costs. The presentation here on Slide 12 takes adjusted Signet, which is shown on far right side of the slide, and then breaks it into 2 parts: one part is Zale operations, which is reflected in the middle column; and the second part, in the left-hand column, is adjusted Signet excluding Zale. Adjusted Signet excluding Zale is the rest of Signet's inclusive of our finance, interest and taxes. 
From sales to operating income, this gives you an apples-to-apples comparability to prior year results. In addition, the information is provided to give you visibility as to how the Zale operations performed in the fourth quarter. Now recall that we had guided for the Zale EPS accretion of $0.36 to $0.40 for the fourth quarter. Our actual accretion from Zale operations was $0.43, resulting from higher margins and lower expenses in the quarter. We anticipate providing this incremental detail for you until we establish precedent for Signet's results, post acquisition, when we'll add these numbers in the third quarter.
So continuing on, let's review Signet's adjusted P&L results below the sales line. Adjusted gross margin was $936.9 million or 40.9% of adjusted sales and that was down 60 basis points versus last year. The decrease in rate was driven by the addition of Zale, which impacted the gross margin rate by 110 basis points. Now excluding the Zale division, the adjusted Signet gross margin rate would have been 42% and that compares to prior year fourth quarter rate of 41.5%. The Signet adjusted gross margin rate decrease of 60 basis points was partially offset by a higher gross margin rate in the Sterling division of 70 basis points, primarily due to merchandise margin factors including lower commodity cost.
Adjusted SG&A was $629.3 million or 27.5% of adjusted sales, and that was up 30 basis points versus last year. This increase, again, was driven by the addition of Zale which impacted the rate by 70 basis points. Excluding the Zale division, the adjusted Signet SG&A rate would've been 26.8%, and that compares to the prior year SG&A rate of 27.2% with SG&A leveraging on higher sales.
Other operating income was $54.1 million. This increase of $6.5 million was due principally to higher interest income earned from higher outstanding receivable balances. Adjusted operating income in the fourth quarter was $361.7 million or 15.8% of adjusted sales. Excluding the Zale division, the adjusted Signet operating margin would've been 18.6% and that's up 130 basis points from prior year operating margin rate of 17.3%.
Adjusted EPS was $3.06 compared to $2.18 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014. On a comparable basis, that is when excluding this year's impact from the newly acquired Zale and the capital structure and financing, EPS was $2.53 or a 16.1% increase over last year.
So let's move on to the balance sheet, and we'll begin with review our inventory level. Net inventories ended the year at $2.4 billion and that's an increase of nearly $1 billion or 63.9% over last year. The increase was driven almost entirely by the acquisition of Zale. 
Now to a lesser extent, inventory levels were also impacted by the Sterling Jewelers division, which increased approximately 4%, and this increase was primarily due to new store growth as well as modest increases among branded bridal and diamond jewelry collections as well as loose diamonds. Due in part to our strong January, our inventory levels and assortment are well-positioned in the first quarter.
So moving on, we'll turn our attention to our in-house credit metrics and statistics. In-house credit remains an important component of our Sterling division's business and a competitive advantage. Net accounts receivable increased to $1.57 billion compared to $1.37 billion last year, up 14.1%, and that's driven by higher sales as well as an increase in the credit penetration rate. 
Our credit participation was 60.5% compared to 57.7% last year. The increase in credit participation is attributed primarily to our credit decision engine improvements made in April of last year as well as higher outlet credit participation and strong guest acceptance of our credit offerings. The average monthly collection rate, year-to-date, was 11.9% compared to 12.1% last year as guests continued to opt more to our regular credit programs, which requires lower monthly payments as opposed to the 12-month interest-free program.
So moving on to credit statistics around our in-house finance programs. Net bad debt expense for the year was $160 million compared to $138.3 million last year, an increase of $21.7 million, and that was driven primarily by the growth in our receivable balance from increased credit participation and change in the credit program mix. Interest income from our in-house program, which makes up the vast majority of our other operating income P&L line item, was $217.9 million and that compared to $186.4 million last year. This was an increase of $31.5 million and is due, primarily, to more interest income on the higher outstanding receivables as well as the shift away from the interest-free programs.
So the net impact of these 2 items was income of $57.9 million compared to $48.1 million in the prior year or an increase of $9.8 million.
Operating improvements made to our decision engine have helped increase credit penetration and profit without adversely affecting the net impact of our bad debt for the full year.
Now on a quarterly basis, the net impact of bad debt and interest income was about flat and that's due primarily to the timing of recoveries, which have been realized in the first quarter of fiscal 2016. The portfolio continues to perform very strongly for us and that's evidenced by the allowance as a percentage of our ending accounts receivable, finishing nearly flat to last year.
So let's move onto on to some other highlights of the balance sheet. All right. Capital allocation. In terms of Signet's capital, I'm really excited to share with you our priorities for capital structure and our capital allocation strategy, which have been thoughtfully developed. We have a strong balance sheet and this will allow us to execute our strategic priorities, invest in the business, and return excess cash to shareholders, all while ensuring adequate liquidity. 
We are proud to have an investment-grade rating and we're also committed to maintaining these ratings. And this is important to us because, long term, we will continue to invest in the organic growth of our powerful store brands as well as pursue value-enhancing acquisitions. Our focus remains growing on a per-share basis.
Among the key tenets of our capital strategy that we'd like to share with you are to achieve an adjusted leverage ratio at or below 3.5x. Now we ended fiscal 2015 at 4x but keep in mind that this only includes a partial year at Zale. So as our business grows in fiscal 2016, we should start fiscal 2017 with a ratio closer to our target which will allow us to utilize our balance sheet in fiscal 2017 and beyond, with available sources of debt. We plan to distribute 70% to 80% of annual free cash flow in the form of stock repurchases or dividends, assuming no other strategic uses of capital. We expect to increase the dividend consistently, which we have been doing over the last several years.
Now in terms of share repurchases, we will repurchase $100 million to $150 million of Signet's stock by the end of fiscal 2016. We have a remaining authorization of $265.6 million, and as this program runs out we will review and initiate a new program with our board, in line with leverage and free cash flow target. And finally, we will evaluate using additional capacity beyond our current $600 million on the asset-backed securitization facility beginning in fiscal 2017.
So now I'd like to just take a quick minute and walk through the calculation behind our adjusted leverage ratio, which is outlined on Slide 18. Our methodology of calculating our leverage ratio is really closely aligned to our more constraining credit rating agency approach and incorporates a captive finance adjustment. 
Now this adjustment reduces Signet's total debt, inclusive of ABS debt, by 70% of finance receivables and excludes finance income from our EBITDAR. So if we walk through the calculation -- and we'll start at the top of the slide with our captive finance adjustment. This adjustment is simply our net Sterling Jewelers division finance receivables times 70%, and as you can see a few rows down this amount of $1,087,000,000 will reduce Signet's total adjusted debt.
So in the second row on the slide, we add long-term debt, which includes our asset-backed securitization and loans and overdraft, to derive [ph] at our total balance sheet debt. To then arrive at Signet's adjusted debt, we add our balance sheet debt and 8x rent expense, and from this we subtract the captive finance figure calculated on the first row, this sums to adjusted debt of $4.1 billion. The denominator or our adjusted EBITDAR on the fourth row is calculated by summing our adjusted EBITDA, rent expense and share-based compensation, and from this we subtract our finance income from our finance receivables. This comes to an adjusted EBITDAR of just over $1 billion.
With a full year Zale operations and our expected growth in fiscal 2016, we will be well-positioned to evaluate utilizing additional capacity under our ABS facility in fiscal 2017. Our capital allocation policy allows for continued growth in the business, coupled with meaningful returns to our shareholders.
So now we'll move on to our financial guidance. First quarter Signet comparable store sales are expected to increase 3% to 4%. First quarter adjusted EPS is expected to be $1.57 to $1.62. And as a reminder, adjusted EPS is EPS less the $0.02 of adjustments shown on Slide 19, being purchase accounting and transaction cost. Now within adjusted EPS, Zale operations are expected to be accretive in the first quarter by $0.17 to $0.18. And I would also add, only because it's been a hot topic in our space lately, that the impact to EPS from add-backs is expected to be minimal, and I would just remind you that less than 10% of our annual operating profit is earned outside the U.S.
From an effective tax rate standpoint, Signet's fiscal 2016 annual rate is anticipated to be 28% to 29%, and the difference versus our fiscal 2015 is principally the full-year effect of owning Zale and having our capital structure in place.
Capital expenditure guidance for the full year is $275 million to $325 million, and net selling square footage is projected to grow approximately 2% to 3%. So I'd also reference you to our earnings release for further detail by division. 
That concludes my prepared remarks on the financials. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Mark."

In reference to the Zale openings, we're actually very excited about the opportunity to grow the Zale brand. If you look at our portfolio today, the Kay brand has -- or the Kay store brands have well over 1,000 stores. Zale is in the 700 zone and we think there's opportunity to continue to grow the Zale brand, and this year is the first year in years where Zales is actually going to be flat as it relates to space growth. As we said, we're looking to open 30 to 35 stores and it really is in the zone of 25-or-so Zale stores and 10-or-so Piercing Pagoda stores."

As far as the -- I think you said, Oliver, the non-bridal or non-diamond categories of jewelry, how are we doing? And we're doing better.

And then Oliver, in terms of our growth margin trends, your question around that and breaking that out by brand. We're not forecasting or giving guidance for the year on our gross margin and we don't [ph] want to break it down by brand. But just to try and give you maybe, directionally, some color around that. Going back to our synergies, which we've talked about, a component of our synergies does incorporate gross margin improvement. So -- and we talked about 20% of our synergies being achieved in fiscal 2016 so that in of itself would lend to an improved gross margin. Again, if gold kind of behaves where it's been, you would anticipate that we can continue to see some benefits on the commodity cost side. But gold can be erratic and you never know quite what to predict where's it's going to be or land. Your other comment in terms of how to think through the ABS additional capacity, so a few things there. We talked about our capital allocation strategy and where we end our leverage ratio at the end of fiscal 2015 and, again, I would just remind you that, that includes only a partial year from Zale. We don't have -- we don't see the immediate capacity in fiscal 2016 to utilize additional ABS, our asset-backed securitization, but as we move through FY '16, incorporating a full year of Zale operations as well as just the natural growth in our business, we'll be well-positioned when we end that year and moving into fiscal '17 to revisit our asset-backed securitization and take advantage of capacity. And I just remind you, our current ABS facility, we have an advanced rate of 65% under that, we currently are at about 60% threshold. So we have an opportunity, one, not only to increase our level of capacity under that but also to even revisit and potentially increase that 65% to a higher number. So I'd just provide that color to your question."

So that is a component of it and the other component is that when we pulled out part -- as we talked about the nonproductive inventory pull that we did on the Zale and that we've replenished, and that was primarily focused in branded products, the Vera Wang, you're Unstoppable Love. So since those initiatives have also helped to increase what we saw in that branded penetration rate for the stub period."

So we're looking at our real estate portfolio here, in U.K., very closely every month and every year, and we see opportunities of keeping some stores in the high streets open and we still see opportunities of opening stores and outlets and, as we mentioned, along with any new mall opportunity there is. And then one thing -- we have one thing that Michele's pointed, Jeff, just so that it is -- the combination of the Zale penetration as she said was -- of what she said, the calculation of how it's done, but we have done so very well, as we stated, with the Vera Wang LOVE collection; with Celebration Diamond collection; with the Arctic Brilliance in Canada; and with Unstoppable Love, we're seeing tremendous increases on that just with -- working with the Zale team and trying to put some of our best practices in place."

In the fourth quarter, we delivered solid top line and bottom line results. Signet comp store sales increased by 4.2%, with strong sales performance across all divisions and selling channels.On a divisional bas",1489,"Thanks, James. And good morning, everyone. In the fourth quarter, we delivered solid top line and bottom line results. Signet comp store sales increased by 4.2%, with strong sales performance across all divisions and selling channels.
On a divisional basis, Sterling delivered a same-store sales increase of 3.7%, while delivering record operating profit. Zale also drove an impressive 3.7% comp sales increase. Our U.K. division delivered its highest fourth quarter of same-store sales increase in 13 years at 7.5%, and its best operating profit in 3 years. 
From a merchandise view, Signet's bridal and fashion diamonds performed very well across the organization. And by selling channel, our broad-based strength was evident with outlets and eCommerce delivering strong results, in addition to our traditional store locations. 
Signet's eCommerce sales in the fourth quarter were $149.6 million, which was an increase of 89.4%, which was due to the addition of Zales this year. But when you exclude the Zale division, our eCommerce sales were at $94.8 million which was at a growth rate of 20%. Signet's fourth quarter adjusted EPS was at $3.06, $0.01 higher than our top end of our guidance, and up 40.4% from the prior year period due to strong execution of our fourth quarter strategies. I would also like to add that Zale favorably impacted EPS by $0.43. So when measured on an apples-to-apples basis versus last year by excluding Zale, Signet's EPS was up $0.35 or 16.1%.
Now let's focus on our performance by division, starting with the Sterling division. We had a variety of drivers behind our fourth quarter Sterling results. Most notably, our sustainable competitive strengths that include: our superior guest experience, our exciting merchandise offerings, our creative marketing and our multichannel approach. 
The customer experience is central to our success and we're very pleased with our service metrics that was delivered by our store teams in the fourth quarter and for the year. As for merchandise, Sterling's fourth quarter results were driven by our entire bridal category as well as fashion jewelry, especially Le Vian and Diamonds in Rhythm. Marketing also played a crucial role in the fourth quarter, with the benefits of new creative, increased impressions and well-placed media. Growth in eCommerce and outlets exceeded the division average, while malls and freestanding stores performed well also. All this led to same-store sales increase of 3.7% in Sterling and, as I said earlier, record operating profit.
Now moving on to our Zale division. Zale delivered a strong fourth quarter due to a variety of planned investments and initiatives around merchandising, marketing and field operations. Let's begin with merchandising. Our branded bridal and fashion diamond collection performed very well, led by the Vera Wang LOVE collection, our Celebration Diamond collection and our Unstoppable Love. We've been focused on expanding depth versus breadth in the Zale merchandise assortment, and this proved effective in the fourth quarter. 
We believe we have significant potential to continue to grow our brands along with developing new brands through our innovation process. As for marketing, we increased our TV and online media investment, we strengthened the quality and the placement of our marketing, we focused on Vera and it all worked. We directed more resources towards the flagship Zales brand in the U.S. and Peoples brand in Canada and heavily supported their in-store events. 
Our store teams focused their presentations on features and benefits of our offerings, especially in the context of bridal and the Vera Wang LOVE collection. We also increased payroll for appropriate floor coverage and provided new incentives. In the fourth quarter, there were a variety of successes in the Zale division. We also delivered strong results in Canada in spite of the weaker energy industry, and the Piercing Pagoda and eCommerce businesses performed well. We saw a lot of terrific collaboration between the Zale, Sterling and U.K. teams to enhance our synergies going forward.
As a result of the acquisitions, Signet will realize significant operating profit synergies. We've talked about this before and there are no changes. But it bears repeating, where these synergies will come from and how they will flow and why. Of the $150 million to $175 million of net synergies, roughly 20% will be achieved from expense reductions, 30% from repair services and brand cross-selling, and 50% from supply chain and purchasing initiatives. 
Now as shown on the right graph of Slide 6, we expect to see about 20% of the $150 million to $175 million achieved by fiscal year-end 2016, mainly in the second half of this year. By the end of fiscal 2017, another 40% of synergies will be achieved for a total of 60% of our 3-year goal. Then by the end of fiscal 2018, we expect to achieve the final 40% of our synergy goals. We believe the cadence of the synergies will flow in these proportions due to the reinvesting of some gross synergies and the time required to deploy and effectively utilize certain information technology.
One final point of synergies. The majority of the operating profit synergies will be achieved within the Zale division, but not all of it. A minority of synergies will fall in the Sterling and U.K. divisions. 
In the U.K., we delivered our best fourth quarter comp sales in 13 years and our best operating profit in 3 years. The same drivers that we have seen in the first 3 quarters of the year once again led the division's improved results. These include initiatives around diamonds in an omni-channel approach, new marketing and a focus on sales rather than task. The U.K. results were driven principally by the benefits of strategic moves we've taken around diamonds, based upon a better understanding of our customers and the types of products, pricing and promotions that they require. 
Store team member training is more focused on diamonds which, by the way, helps all sales training. Point-of-purchase displays are more powerful, more space has been devoted to diamonds. Bridal diamond brands performed very well such as Perfect Fit and Forever Diamonds in our H.Samuel stores and Leo, Neil Lane, Le Vian and Tolkowsky in our Ernest Jones stores. And new TV advertising creative with increased impressions has also driven our diamond business.
Our redesigned H.Samuel and Ernest Jones websites as well have improved fulfillment processes, strengthened our U.K. income results. In addition, we opened our first 8 Ernest Jones outlet collection stores in the United Kingdom, and we are pleased with their start and intend to open up more this year and into the future.
We've made a variety of store operation improvement that are driving better sales productivity. In general, the focus on our field operations teams have shifted considerably more in favor of engaging customers and selling as opposed to noncustomer-facing tasks.
It was an absolutely incredible year for Signet, and I want -- now want to take a moment to review just some of the more notable accomplishments in fiscal 2015. The acquisition of Zale was the most significant M&A transaction in the history of jewelry retail. Rarely in retail does #1 acquire #2 and still have significant runway for opportunity because of the highly fragmented nature of our marketplace. Our U.K. performance was unprecedented, as I detailed moments ago. 
We have made great strides in establishing a highly collaborative, team-oriented mindset within and between all 3 of our divisions. We've also begun to establish the ongoing process of sharing best practices and using them within all of our divisions. We call this being Signetized. We continue to find additional ways to unlock the value in our outlet channel. 
In fiscal 2015, we rolled out Jared Vault and we opened new Ernest Jones outlet collection stores in United Kingdom. We became more vertically integrated to secure supplies of diamonds for all of our stores globally, and one of the crowning achievements was becoming a De Beers sight holder. We grew our proprietary and exclusive brand penetration by successfully testing and extending compelling merchandise collections. And we continue to innovate and develop new product with the opening of Signet's new design center in New York. 
We believe more strongly, now than ever that an omni-channel approach to jewelry retail is critical. We educated our customers, we communicated with them, and merchandised to them through an Internet, not only to drive eCommerce growth but also to maximize in-store experiences. We strengthened our digital ecosystem experience by optimizing store-brand websites for both desktop and mobile devices, by increasing merchandise assortments and by investing in social media. 
And from a financial performance perspective, we hit or exceeded all of our financial metrics including or excluding Zale. We returned value to shareholders by increasing our dividend for the third year in a row, while integrating a major acquisition. And all this led to an important threshold of over $10 billion of market capitalization.
And with that, I'll now turn over to Michele for a look at our financials."

So to start with, I just want to emphasize my comparison and commentary will b",2435,"Thanks, Mark. And good morning, everyone. I apologize in advance, I'm battling a cold so if I interrupt my commentary with an occasional cough, again, I apologize. 
All right. So to start with, I just want to emphasize my comparison and commentary will be focused on our fourth quarter results. So let's begin by reviewing sales, which Mark offered a brief overview of these numbers a few moments ago. In the Sterling division, total sales increased 5.5% to $1,358,300,000, which included a same-store sales increase of 3.7%. The average transaction price in Sterling increased by 4.5% and the number of transactions decreased by 1.2%. The increase in the average transaction price was driven primarily by bridal and diamonds, with a number of transactions impacted by a decline in sales associated with lower average selling price units.
Zales division total sales were $636.7 million for the quarter, which included a same-store sales increase of 3.7%. Total sales also included a $12.8 million unfavorable revenue impact due to purchase accounting adjustments related to deferred revenue. As Mark indicated, sales were driven in part by initial synergy initiative surrounding sales associate training, merchandise assortment and new marketing creative. 
Merchandise sales were particularly strong in branded bridal and branded diamond fashion. U.K. division total sales increased 2.1% or 7.7% on a constant exchange basis to $278 million with a comp sales increase of 7.5%. This increase was driven primarily by branded bridal, fashion diamond jewelry and fashion watches. The average transaction price increased by 7% and the number of transactions increased by 1.6% and that was attributed to strong performance across the entire merchandise portfolio.
Moving on. Over the next couple of slides, I will share with you Signet's consolidated Q4 performance before we turn and analyze Signet's adjusted results. So on Slide 10, the table provides a reconciliation of Signet's adjusted results to consolidated results. Again, the difference between adjusted Signet and Signet are the columns reflecting purchase accounting and transaction cost, which also include integration-related expenses.
On a GAAP basis, EPS was $2.84 per share and that was $0.01 higher than our guidance. Purchase accounting adjustments, which include a reduction to deferred revenue, amortization related to inventory fair value step-up and amortization of unfavorable contracts were dilutive to EPS by $0.14. Transaction costs, including advisory, accounting and integration costs cost, were responsible for $0.08 of dilution. Signet's effective tax rate for the quarter was 29.6% and the effective tax rate for fiscal 2015 was 29.5%.
So let's now look at the breakout of operating income by division. Operating income of $331.7 million or 14.6% of sales consisted of the following components: Sterling Jewelers operating income was a record $260 million or 19.1% of division sales, and that is up 140 basis points from last year. Zale division operating income was $36.1 million or 5.7% of division sales. 
Zale's performance consisted of $32.8 million in profit from Zales Jewelry operating segment and $3.3 million from the Piercing Pagoda operating segment. Now that does include costs of $20.8 million related to purchase accounting adjustments, which we just discussed on the previous slide. Excluding the impact from these accounting adjustments, the Zale division operating profit was $56.9 million or 8.7% of division sales. The U.K. operating profit was $53.8 million or 19.4% of division sales and that is $2.1 million higher than last year, and was the best Q4 operating performance in 3 years. This performance is attributed to a continued focus on growing top line combined with cost control measurements. 
Other primarily consists of our corporate and administrative expenses and Signet's diamond sourcing subsidiaries; it also includes $9.2 million of transaction costs.
To help provide comparability to last year, we're also presenting our results on an adjusted basis, which excludes the purchase accounting adjustments and transaction costs. The presentation here on Slide 12 takes adjusted Signet, which is shown on far right side of the slide, and then breaks it into 2 parts: one part is Zale operations, which is reflected in the middle column; and the second part, in the left-hand column, is adjusted Signet excluding Zale. Adjusted Signet excluding Zale is the rest of Signet's inclusive of our finance, interest and taxes. 
From sales to operating income, this gives you an apples-to-apples comparability to prior year results. In addition, the information is provided to give you visibility as to how the Zale operations performed in the fourth quarter. Now recall that we had guided for the Zale EPS accretion of $0.36 to $0.40 for the fourth quarter. Our actual accretion from Zale operations was $0.43, resulting from higher margins and lower expenses in the quarter. We anticipate providing this incremental detail for you until we establish precedent for Signet's results, post-acquisition, when we lapse these numbers in the third quarter.
So continuing on, let's review Signet's adjusted P&L results below the sales line. Adjusted gross margin was $936.9 million or 40.9% of adjusted sales and that was down 60 basis points versus last year. The decrease in rate was driven by the addition of Zale, which impacted the gross margin rate by 110 basis points. Now excluding the Zale division, the adjusted Signet gross margin rate would have been 42% and that compares to prior year fourth quarter rate of 41.5%. The Signet adjusted gross margin rate decrease of 60 basis points was partially offset by a higher gross margin rate in the Sterling division of 70 basis points, primarily due to merchandise margin factors including lower commodity cost.
Adjusted SG&A was $629.3 million or 27.5% of adjusted sales, and that was up 30 basis points versus last year. This increase, again, was driven by the addition of Zale which impacted the rate by 70 basis points. Excluding the Zale division, the adjusted Signet SG&A rate would've been 26.8%, and that compares to the prior year SG&A rate of 27.2% with SG&A leveraging on higher sales.
Other operating income was $54.1 million. This increase of $6.5 million was due principally to higher interest income earned from higher outstanding receivable balances. Adjusted operating income in the fourth quarter was $361.7 million or 15.8% of adjusted sales. Excluding the Zale division, the adjusted Signet operating margin would've been 18.6% and that's up 130 basis points from prior year operating margin rate of 17.3%.
Adjusted EPS was $3.06 compared to $2.18 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014. On a comparable basis, that is when excluding this year's impact from the newly acquired Zale and the capital structure and financing, EPS was $2.53 or a 16.1% increase over last year.
So let's move on to the balance sheet, and we'll begin with review our inventory level. Net inventories ended the year at $2.4 billion and that's an increase of nearly $1 billion or 63.9% over last year. The increase was driven almost entirely by the acquisition of Zale. 
Now to a lesser extent, inventory levels were also impacted by the Sterling Jewelers division, which increased approximately 4%, and this increase was primarily due to new store growth as well as modest increases among branded bridal and diamond jewelry collections as well as loose diamonds. Due in part to our strong January, our inventory levels and assortment are well-positioned in the first quarter.
So moving on, we'll turn our attention to our in-house credit metrics and statistics. In-house credit remains an important component of our Sterling division's business and a competitive advantage. Net accounts receivable increased to $1.57 billion compared to $1.37 billion last year, up 14.1%, and that's driven by higher sales as well as an increase in the credit penetration rate. 
Our credit participation was 60.5% compared to 57.7% last year. The increase in credit participation is attributed primarily to our credit decision engine improvements made in April of last year, as well as higher outlet credit participation and strong guest acceptance of our credit offerings. The average monthly collection rate, year-to-date, was 11.9% compared to 12.1% last year as guests continued to opt more to our regular credit programs, which requires lower monthly payments as opposed to the 12-month interest-free program.
So moving on to credit statistics around our in-house finance programs. Net bad debt expense for the year was $160 million compared to $138.3 million last year, an increase of $21.7 million, and that was driven primarily by the growth in our receivable balance from increased credit participation and change in the credit program max. Interest income from our in-house program, which makes up the vast majority of our other operating income P&L line item, was $217.9 million and that compares to $186.4 million last year. This was an increase of $31.5 million and is due, primarily, to more interest income on the higher outstanding receivables as well as the shift away from the interest-free programs.
So the net impact of these 2 items was income of $57.9 million compared to $48.1 million in the prior year or an increase of $9.8 million.
Operating improvements made to our decision engine have helped increase credit penetration and profit without adversely affecting the net impact of our bad debt for the full year.
Now on a quarterly basis, the net impact of bad debt and interest income was about flat and that's due primarily to the timing of recoveries, which have been realized in the first quarter of fiscal 2016. The portfolio continues to perform very strongly for us and that's evidenced by the allowance as a percentage of our ending accounts receivable, finishing nearly flat to last year.
So let's move onto on to some other highlights of the balance sheet. All right. Capital allocation. In terms of Signet's capital, I'm really excited to share with you our priorities for capital structure and our capital allocation strategy, which have been thoughtfully developed. We have a strong balance sheet and this will allow us to execute our strategic priorities, invest in the business, and return excess cash to our shareholders, all while ensuring adequate liquidity. 
We are proud to have an investment-grade rating and we're also committed to maintaining these ratings. And this is important to us because, long term, we will continue to invest in the organic growth of our powerful store brand, as well as pursue value-enhancing acquisitions. Our focus remains growing on a per-share basis.
Among the key tenets of our capital strategy that we'd like to share with you are to achieve an adjusted leverage ratio at or below 3.5x. Now we ended fiscal 2015 at 4x but keep in mind that this only includes a partial year at Zale. So as our business grows in fiscal 2016, we should start fiscal 2017 with a ratio closer to our target which will allow us to utilize our balance sheet in fiscal 2017 and beyond, with available sources of debt. We plan to distribute 70% to 80% of annual free cash flow in the form of stock repurchases or dividends, assuming no other strategic uses of capital. We expect to increase the dividend consistently, which we have been doing over the last several years.
Now in terms of share repurchases, we will repurchase $100 million to $150 million of Signet's stock by the end of fiscal 2016. We have a remaining authorization of $265.6 million, and as this program runs out, we will review and initiate a new program with our board, in line with leverage and free cash flow targets. And finally, we will evaluate using additional capacity beyond our current $600 million on the asset-backed securitization facility beginning in fiscal 2017.
So now I'd like to just take a quick minute and walk through the calculation behind our adjusted leverage ratio, which is outlined on Slide 18. Our methodology of calculating our leverage ratio is really closely aligned to our more constraining credit rating agency approach and incorporates a captive finance adjustment. 
Now this adjustment reduces Signet's total debt, inclusive of ABS debt, by 70% of finance receivables and excludes finance income from our EBITDAR. So if we walk through the calculation -- and we'll start at the top of the slide with our captive finance adjustment. This adjustment is simply our net Sterling Jewelers division finance receivables times 70%, and as you can see a few rows down, this amount of $1,087,000,000 will reduce Signet's total adjusted debt.
So in the second row on the slide, we add long-term debt, which includes our asset-backed securitization and loans and overdraft, to derive at our total balance sheet debt. To then arrive at Signet's adjusted debt, we add our balance sheet debt and 8x rent expense, and from this we subtract the captive finance figure calculated on the first row, this sums to adjusted debt of $4.1 billion. The denominator or our adjusted EBITDAR on the fourth row is calculated by summing our adjusted EBITDA, rent expense and share-based compensation, and from this we subtract our finance income from our finance receivables. This comes to an adjusted EBITDAR of just over $1 billion.
With a full year of Zale operations and our expected growth in fiscal 2016, we will be well-positioned to evaluate utilizing additional capacity under our ABS facility in fiscal 2017. Our capital allocation policy allows for continued growth in the business, coupled with meaningful returns to our shareholders.
So now we'll move on to our financial guidance. First quarter Signet comparable store sales are expected to increase 3% to 4%. First quarter adjusted EPS is expected to be $1.57 to $1.62. And as a reminder, adjusted EPS is EPS less the 2 sets of adjustments shown on Slide 19, being purchase accounting and transaction cost. Now within adjusted EPS, Zale operations are expected to be accretive in the first quarter by $0.17 to $0.18. And I would also add, only because it's been a hot topic in our space lately, that the impact to EPS from add-backs [ph] is expected to be minimal, and I would just remind you that less than 10% of our annual operating profit is earned outside the U.S.
From an effective tax rate standpoint, Signet's fiscal 2016 annual rate is anticipated to be 28% to 29%, and the difference versus our fiscal 2015 is principally the full-year effect of owning Zale and having our capital structure in place.
Capital expenditure guidance for the full year is $275 million to $325 million, and net selling square footage is projected to grow approximately 2% to 3%. So I'd also reference you to our earnings release for further detail by division. 
That concludes my prepared remarks on the financials. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Mark."

Did you reemphasize any marketing for specific brands, et cetera? And then you guys ended Zales, the stores, I think above the initial guidance and you're guiding flat for the year. Can you talk about what you've seen over the past few quarters that's maybe shaping your ultimate Zale store count objectives? Where do those 30 or 35 Zales division openings fall within the concepts? And then just lastly, Michele, so the Zale EBIT margin contracted slightly this quarter but I think, better than initially expected.

In reference to the Zale openings, we're actually very excited about the opportunity to grow the Zale brand. If you look at our portfolio today, the Kay brand has -- or the Kay store brands have well over 1,000 stores. Zale is in the 700 zone and we think there's tremendous opportunity to continue to grow the Zale brand, and this year is the first year in years where Zales is actually going to be flat as it relates to space growth. As we said, we're looking to open 30 to 35 stores and it really is in the zone of 25-or-so Zale stores and 10-or-so Piercing Pagoda stores."

And then Oliver, in terms of our growth margin trends, your question around that and breaking that out by brand. We're not forecasting or giving guidance for the year on our gross margin and we wouldn't break it down by brand. But just to try and give you maybe, directionally, some color around that. Going back to our synergies, which we've talked about, a component of our synergies does incorporate gross margin improvement. So -- and we talked about 20% of our synergies being achieved in fiscal 2016 so that in of itself would lend to an improved gross margin. Again, if gold kind of behaves where it's been, you would anticipate that we can continue to see some benefits on the commodity cost side. But gold can be erratic and you never know quite what to predict where's it's going to be or land. Your other comment in terms of how to think through the ABS additional capacity, so a few things there. We talked about our capital allocation strategy and where we end our leverage ratio at the end of fiscal 2015 and, again, I would just remind you that, that includes only a partial year from Zale. We don't have -- we don't see the immediate capacity in fiscal 2016 to utilize additional ABS, our asset-backed securitization, but as we move through FY '16, incorporating a full year of Zale operations as well as just the natural growth in our business, we'll be well-positioned when we end that year and moving into fiscal '17 to revisit our asset-backed securitization and take advantage of capacity. And I just remind you, our current ABS facility, we have an advanced rate of 65% under that, we currently are at about a 60% threshold. So we have an opportunity, one, not only to increase our level of capacity under that but also to even revisit and potentially increase that 65% to a higher number. So I'd just provide that color to your question."

So -- but we did not increase our promotional activity per se. Valentine's Day, we're not going to talk about the performance other than saying that as you saw in our guidance was -- we're looking at 3% to 4% comp increases and I think that just kind of reinforces what we think about our Valentine's Day performance. We were able to -- you saw, we did have some new TV creative, for certain, in all of our divisions. We did have some improved weights in -- intense [ph] weights in some of our divisions, and we had some better-targeted media placement in all of our divisions. So as a whole, thank you for your kind words about our stores, we're very thrilled with what our stores accomplished in all of our divisions and some of the new -- exciting new opportunities they offered to our customers. As it relates to the associate training in the Zale division, we started last year, and this -- there's a lot of talented, talented team members in the Zale division and they really are embracing our training philosophy. And last year we started really talking about features and benefits, specifically in the bridal category and Vera Wang. And that type of training is a journey, you can't train 10,000 people overnight. So we continue to focus on training of diamonds, training of features and benefits, and focusing on the bridal sales and that will continue Janet. Every year, as we said before, our Zale division and our U.K. division and our Sterling division are all at different maturity curves as it relates to the business, and the Zale division will continue to have enhanced training year in, year out. And sales training is a journey, it never ends, so thank you again for your kind words."

Signet comps increased by 3.6%, and earnings per share metrics showed impressive increases over last year. Most notably, adjusted EPS was $1.62, which was 25.6% increase over the prior year. And when measured on apples-to-apples basis versus last year by excluding Zale, our EPS was up $0.06 or 4.7%. Each of our divisions had same-store sales increases, led by our U.K. division with an increase of 6.2%, while our newest division, Zale, had a 5.6% increase. The Sterling division had 2.3% comp store increase, which was the division's 22nd consecutive quarterly comp increase. In terms of merchandise, Signet's bridal and fashion diamond collection performed well across the organization. And by selling channel, our broad-based strength was evidence with and eCommerce delivering strong results.
Now let's focus on the performance of our division, starting with our Sterling division. Sterling delivered a 2.3% comp sales growth, led by Kay with an increase of 3.6%, Kay's 25th consecutive quarterly increase. Kay's diamond jewelry [indiscernible] across its merchandise portfolio, and bridal fashion, branded and non-branded and a variety of products. Examples include Neil Lane Bridal and Tolkowsky, Diamonds in Rhythm, Fashion Pendants and earrings and rings and watches were strong also. We launched Pinterest and Instagram for Kay in time for Mother's Day. These are brand-new marketing platforms for our customers.
In nearly every field operations key performance indicator improved year-over-year. Importantly, our customer service index scores are the highest they've ever been.
Our Jared store had comp store sale increase of 0.2%, while our comp store sales were up 4.4%. Jared had success around fashion collection such as Neil Lane Designs, Diamonds in Rhythm, Lois Hill, Earthly Treasure by Smithsonian and Le Vian and watches Movado and Citizen were very strong. And our Vera Wang test continues to perform well in our Jared stores.
We've previously launched a test of incremental radio advertising in several markets that help strengthen our bridal position. In addition, we also launched Jared's first-ever brand book used for direct mail marketing and in-store use. We continue to drive our critical traffic building, repair and design center business. We recently launched a new manager training system for our design and service centers in our Jared stores to enhance our artisans' ability to deliver high-quality products in even faster time frames. Given the investment and our initiatives in our Jared business, we feel we're really well positioned to capture profitable market share.
Now moving onto our Zale division. Zale delivered a strong first quarter of 6.1% comps due to a variety of planned investments and initiatives around merchandising, marketing and field operations. Beginning with merchandising, our branded bridal fashion diamond collections performed very well, led by the Vera Wang LOVE collection, the Celebration Diamond and Unstoppable Love. As we continue to focus on expanding depth versus breadth on our merchandise assortments, our current brands continue to drive sales growth. The Zale store teams are scoring well on key customer service and selling skills performance indicators. They are highly engaged and executing better than ever. In the first quarter, there were a variety of other success beyond our sales store performances. Our people stores in Canada and our Piercing Pagoda stores throughout the United States all delivered comps in excess of 6%. And eCommerce performed very well also.
Driving results is the continued phenomenal collaboration between all of our division members to Signet-ize our business. And speaking of Signet-izing, several areas are actively engaged in collaboration such as field operations, marketing and merchandising. And we're also seeing benefits from consolidated real estate and diamond buying teams as well as alignment around our human resources departments. And we are in the process of finalizing our technology road map for the next several years, which will include a single IT function for the enterprise. Our road map of common technology platforms for us to expand and grow our business and digital experiences that enable us to know our customers intimately while seamlessly servicing them.
For U.K., the main drivers include initiatives around diamonds, success in fashion merchandise and watches and a continued focus on sales rather than test. The U.K. continues to drive diamond sales with their improved sales training and marketing initiatives geared towards bridal customers. Perfect Fit, the Forever Diamond, Neil Lane, Leo and Tolkowsky all were strong in the first quarter as well as Le Vian Diamonds. And our Vera Wang test performed well also.
Outside of the diamond category, watches and beads did also very well. Our U.K. division experienced strength across all selling channels. eCommerce sales increases were higher than total Signet eCommerce sales increases. And our new outlet stores performed well. Our U.K. division continues to embrace a culture of collaboration and is focused on continuously enhancing their diamond selling skills journey.
Signet continues to gain profitable market shares in both Sterling and in our Zale division as well as for Signet overall. We have a highly collaborative team-oriented mindset as we integrate our businesses. We continuously progress against all of our strategic goals and specifically invest in bridal. And our omni-channel approach is clearly thriving as we see strength across all of our selling channels.
So to sum up, we're seeing terrific contributions and collaborations from all of our divisions. Zale continues to gain synergy and operational momentum. The U.K. is showing unprecedented comp growth as a result of our collaborative culture, and Sterling is consistently showing strength with positive comps and operating results. I feel as good as ever about our future for the near and medium and long term.
And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Michele for a run-through on our financials."

So starting with the sales performance, I'll point out a few highlights, which Mark just provided an overview of the numbers. In our Sterling division, total sales increased 4.5% to $944.2 million, which included a same-store sales increase of 2.3%. The average transaction price in Sterling increased by 4.7% and the number of transactions decreased by 3%. This was driven by our merchandise mix, including bridal and higher price point fashion collections. Our Zale division total sales were $437.1 million for the quarter, which included a same-store sales increase of 5.6%. Total sales also included an $8.6 million unfavorable revenue impact due to purchase accounting adjustments related to deferred revenue. As Mark indicated, sales were particularly strong in our Zale division and branded bridal and branded diamond fashion.
In our U.K. division, total sales decreased 3.4% but increased 6.6% on a constant exchange basis. Sales were $146.5 million with a comp sales increase of 6.2%. The average transaction price increased by 3.6%, and the number of transactions increased by 2.6% due to merchandise mix with strong performance and branded bridal, fashion diamond jewelry and fashion watches.
Moving on from sales, I'll walk through Signet's consolidated Q1 performance and will turn in analyzing Signet's adjusted results.
So on Slide 8, the table provides a reconciliation of Signet's adjusted results to our consolidated results. The difference between adjusted Signet and Signet are the columns reflecting purchase accounting and transaction cost with transaction cost including our integration-related expenses. On a GAAP basis, EPS was $1.48 per share and at the high end of our guidance. Purchase accounting adjustments, which included reduction to deferred revenue, amortization related to inventory fair value step-up and amortization of unfavorable contract were dilutive to EPS by $0.09. Transaction costs were responsible for $0.05 of dilution. Transaction costs related to our integration were a couple of pennies per share higher than first anticipated and that's primarily due to timing associated with various consulting expenses.
Now let's move on, and we'll look at operating income by division. Operating income of $176.2 million or 11.5% of sales consisted of the following components: Sterling Jewelers was $178.2 million or 18.9% of division sales, and that's up 50 basis points from last year and a record Q1 high. Zale operating income was $15.5 million or 3.5% of division sales, inclusive of purchase accounting adjustment. Zale's performance consisted of $10.4 million of profit from the Zale Jewelry operating segment and $5.1 million for the Piercing Pagoda operating segment. Now when excluding costs of $11.4 million related to purchase accounting, which we just previously discussed, the Zale division operating profit was $26.9 million or 6% of adjusted division sales.
Our U.K. operating profit was $0.5 million or 0.3% of division sales versus no profit last year. Other, which primarily consist of our corporate and administrative expenses and Signet's diamond sourcing subsidiaries, include $6.4 million of transaction costs related to integration activities. We're continuing to show the detail of adjusted Signet and the Zale operations to get further visibility into our results, which will expect that we'll do this until we fully comp in Q3. After that point, we'll provide Zale details consistent with our divisional disclosures.
The presentation on Slide 10 takes adjusted Signet, which is shown on the far right, and then breaks it into 2 parts. One part is Zale operation, shown on the middle column, and the second part, in the left-hand column, is adjusted Signet excluding Zale. Adjusted Signet excluding Zale is the rest of Signet's, inclusive of finance interest and taxes. From sales to operating income, this gives you comparability to prior year results. In addition, the information is provided to give you visibility as to how the Zale operations perform in the first quarter.
So continuing on, let's review Signet's adjusted P&L results below the sales line. Adjusted gross margin was $581.4 million or 37.8% of adjusted sales, and that was down 80 basis points versus last year. The decrease in rate was driven by the addition of Zale, which impacted the gross margin rate by 90 basis points, as Zale currently operates with a lower gross margin structure than that of the Sterling division. Excluding the Zale division, the adjusted Signet gross margin rate would have been 38.7%, and that would be up 10 basis points, primarily due to favorable commodity cost.
Adjusted SG&A was $450.9 million or 29.3% of adjusted sales, and that was up 70 basis points versus last year's rate of 28.6%. Excluding Zale, the adjusted SG&A rate was also 29.3%, and that's due to higher planned advertising expense in our Sterling division and higher central cost due primarily to legal and related cost. The increase in advertising expense, as Mark had previously mentioned, is due principally to the launch of new Jared radio and print advertising among a variety of other marketing initiatives and investments that impacted the rate by 40 basis points. This higher SG&A ratio is a function of investing for future growth, and we expect our SG&A run rate to improve this year.
Other operating income was $63.5 million. This increase of $9.5 million was due principally to higher interest income earned from higher and receivable balances. Adjusted operating income in the first quarter was 12.6% of adjusted sales. Excluding the Zale division, the adjusted Signet operating margin would have been 15.3%, leveraging up 20 basis points. Adjusted EPS was $1.62 compared to $1.29 in the first quarter of fiscal 2015. On a comparable basis, that is when excluding this year's impact on Zale and capital structure and financing, EPS was $1.35, representing a 4.7% growth over last year. Our strong operating results afford us the opportunity to repurchase 29.1 million of Signet's stock in the quarter in line with our capital allocation plan. At the end of the first quarter, there was $243.7 million remaining under Signet's 2013 share repurchase authorization program.
Now we'll move onto balance sheet, and we'll start with a look with our inventory. Net inventories ended the quarter at approximately $2.5 billion, an increase of nearly $1 billion or 63% over last year, and that's driven in part by sales growth of 45%. The inventory level increase was driven primarily by the acquisition of Zale. To a lesser extent, inventory levels were also impacted by new store growth of $40 million and higher diamond inventory of $56 million, associated with our bridal business and our diamond sourcing initiative. This higher level of diamond inventory reflects our continued initiatives around our best in bridal strategic pillar.
Now I draw your attention to our in-house credit metrics and statistics. In-house credit remains an important component of Sterling division's business and a competitive advantage. Net accounts receivable increased $1.5 billion, and that compared to $1.3 billion last year, up 14.7%, driven by higher sales and an increase in the credit penetration rate. Our planned participation was 60.7% compared to 58.1% last year. The increase in credit participation was attributed primarily to credit decision engine improvements made in April of last year, higher outlet credit participation and strong guest acceptance of our current offerings. The average monthly collection rate was 12.6% compared to 13.2% due primarily to 3 reasons. First, our customers continued to opt more for a regular credit terms, which require a lower monthly payments compared to the 12-month interest-free program. Second, our mix of bridal increases due to our best-in-bridal strategy, and this creates a higher receivable -- average receivable balance. Our required schedule payments do not increase proportionally with a higher merchandise mixed shift. And finally, third, our consumer loans, more principal is paid off later. So as our portfolio has grown more in the last year, proportionately, more of it will be paid later.
So let's move onto a few other credit statistics around our in-house finance program. Net ad expense for the quarter was $28.1 million compared to $22.3 million last year. An increase of $5.8 million, and that was driven primarily by the growth in receivable balance from increased penetration and change in the credit program mix.
Other operating income was $63.5 million compared to $54 million last year. This was an increase of $9.5 million and is due primarily to more interest income on the higher outstanding receivables as well as the shift away from interest-free programs. So the net impact of these 2 items was income of $35.4 million compared to $31.7 million in the prior year or an increase of $3.7 million.
Our portfolio continues to perform well as evidenced by the net impact of bad debt and other operating income as well as the allowance as a percentage of accounts receivable being fairly consistent.
So now we'll move on for -- to our financial guidance. Our financial guidance for the second quarter Signet comparable store sales are expected to increase 2% to 3%. Second quarter adjusted EPS is expected to be $1.11 to $1.16. As a reminder, adjusted EPS is EPS less the $0.02 of adjustments that are shown on Slide 15, being purchase accounting and our transaction costs related to integration. Our Q2 comp sales projection reflects continued sales growth and a strong hurdle rate achieved by Signet last year, driven by Sterling with a 6.7% comp increase. Our current guidance reflects our current sales run rate. And our guidance also reflects our proven ability to protect our bottom line and to drive financial results through EPS growth.
From an effective tax rate standpoint, Signet's fiscal 2016 annual rate is anticipated to be 28% to 29%, and the difference versus fiscal 2015 is principally the full year effect of owning Zale and having our capital structure in place.
Capital expenditure guidance for the full year is $275 million to $325 million, and our net selling square footage is projected to grow approximately 2% to 3%. And I'd reference you to our news release for further detail by division.
And lastly, I'd like to reiterate our confidence in delivering our operating profit synergy goal of $150 million to $175 million, which is, using our current weighted average shares outstanding, equates to about $1.90 to $2.20 of earnings per share within the 3-year period ending January 2018. As we previously guided, 20% of the synergies will be achieved by the end of fiscal year-end and will be back-end loaded to the second half of this year. As a result, synergies are not a material component of our Q2 EPS guidance.
That concludes my remarks on the financials. And with that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Mark."

We actually built the Jared division when we started the Jared before we could afford national TV. We build the Jared division on continuity radio and having radio was a wonderful development in our business and kind of described what Jared is all about. Getting back into testing the radio. We see lift in certain markets and specifically for bridal -- that's a bridal program for the Jared business, so advertising is something that you don't see automatic sales mix. It's something that has a building effect. And we always test programs in the spring season to get a good understanding of the elasticity and what we can do some type of relations as it relates to what type of growth we can expect in the fall. So a lot of this is very common for us to test different type of programs in the spring to hopefully roll it through fall. So got incremental advertising relations to radio in the test mode. As I stated, we had our first-ever branded book in our Jared stores. So both customers, current customers can get direct mail and our stores can sell off of that. And that's something we hope and as soon as we analyze the results, something we can carry into the fall. And the certain products launches that we're in test right now, Simeon, which I'm not going to share with you, for competitive reasons, that were very excited about, that could be very strong launches or extended test for the fall season, and one which I mentioned was Vera Wang. We're finding early results Vera is -- her products are actually doing very well with the Jared customers."

Should we begin seeing procurement benefits that will benefit the gross margin line? Or we start by seeing cost saves on the SG&A or both simultaneously?

And if you look at what their reported gross margins would've been, it's really apples and oranges. Because they are not on a LIFO basis. So I really can't talk directly to the gross margin other than we know it is lower than our Sterling division and it is an area of focus as it relates to our synergies. We anticipate 50% of our synergies are going to come through gross margin with -- between our merchandising and sourcing initiatives, which really translates into your second question on how to think about the synergies and is that the SG&A versus gross margin. I think you're going to start seeing them coming for a little bit at both at the same time. When we talk about our gross margin synergies, we'll start seeing some from the procurement process. The other one we talked about from a gross margin standpoint is our gross margin controls. So that is something we've been currently working on a getting more of a systematic, more visibility at the discount process at Zale. So I think that's where we can start seeing at the tail end of this year as well as we'll start getting some of that SG&A savings coming in on the back half. So I think it will be a little bit of a blend between those 2. And then your final question, Ike, in terms of ADS. You're correct in that ADS contract goes into effect into October. So we will have at the tail end of the year, ADS in place. And we would expect to see some benefit for that last quarter of the year. And just to remind you, Ike, on that front, we did, from a synergies standpoint, we did exclude our ADS savings, which we quantify that full year effect of $22 million. That was excluded from our synergy number, but I think we'll see some benefit at the tail end of our fourth quarter."

So a lot of testing that we're doing will help benefit the third and primarily the fourth quarter. As far as Zale's training programs is going, I said this over and over, but diamond selling training is a journey. It's not a -- there's no destiny. And that Zale teams are doing tremendous offers and foremost, understanding the basics of how to share with customers the features and benefits of selling a diamond, specifically selling Vera Wang and branded diamond programs. And we're continuing to enhance the journey and taking further and further steps in enhancing the Zale training team. So we have basic training going on now, and we will advance the next level of training. We're right now getting our teams ready for career development training for next year. So this training is a true journey. And quite frankly, we have a very good template in our Sterling division that we're sharing with the Zale team. And again going back to maturity curve, it will help the Zale business continue to grow, but it's not something that happens overnight."

Signet comps increased by 3.6%, and earnings per share metrics showed impressive increases over last year. Most notably, adjusted EPS was $1.62, which was 25.6% increase over the prior year. And when measured on apples-to-apples basis versus last year, by excluding Zale, our EPS was up $0.06 or 4.7%. Each of our divisions had same-store sales increases, led by our U.K. division with an increase of 6.2%, while our newest division, Zale, had a 5.6% increase. The Sterling division had a 2.3% comp store increase, which was the division's 22nd consecutive quarterly comp increase. In terms of merchandise, Signet's bridal and fashion diamond collection performed well across the organization. And by selling channel, our broad-based strength was evident with outlets and eCommerce delivering strong results.
Now let's focus on the performance of our division, starting with our Sterling division. Sterling delivered a 2.3% comp sales growth, led by Kay, with an increase of 3.6%, Kay's 25th consecutive quarterly increase. Kay saw strength in diamond jewelry across its merchandise portfolio, in bridal and fashion, branded and non-branded; and a variety of products. Examples include Neil Lane Bridal and Tolkowsky, Diamonds in Rhythm, fashion pendants and solitaire earrings and rings, and watches were strong also. We launched Pinterest and Instagram for Kay in time for Mothers' Day. These are brand-new marketing platforms for our customers.
In nearly every field operations, key performance indicator improved year-over-year. Importantly, our customer service index scores are the highest they've ever been.
Our Jared store had comp store sale increase of 0.2%, while our total store sales were up 4.4%. Jared had success around fashion collections, such as Neil Lane Designs, Diamonds in Rhythm, Lois Hill, Earthly Treasure by Smithsonian and Le Vian. And in watches, Movado and Citizen were very strong. And our Vera Wang test continues to perform well in our Jared stores.
We recently launched a test of incremental radio advertising in several markets that helped strengthen our bridal position. In addition, we also launched Jared's first-ever brand book used for direct mail marketing and in-store use. We continue to drive our critical traffic-building repair and design center business. We recently launched a new managers' training system for our design and service centers in our Jared stores to enhance our artisans' ability to deliver high-quality product in even faster time frames. Given the investment and our initiatives in our Jared business, we feel we are well positioned to capture profitable market share.
Now moving on to our Zale division. Zale delivered a strong first quarter of 6.1% comps due to a variety of planned investments and initiatives around merchandising, marketing and field operations. Beginning with merchandising, our branded bridal and fashion diamond collections performed very well, led by the Vera Wang LOVE collection, the Celebration Diamond and Unstoppable Love. As we continue to focus on expanding depth versus breadth in our merchandise assortments, our current brands continue to drive sales growth. The Zale store teams are scoring well on key customer service and selling skills performance indicators. They are highly engaged and executing better than ever. In the first quarter, there were a variety of other successes beyond our sales store performances. Our Peoples stores in Canada and our Piercing Pagoda stores throughout the United States all delivered comps in excess of 6%. And eCommerce performed very well also.
Driving results is the continued phenomenal collaboration between all of our division team members to Signet-ize our business. And speaking of Signet-izing, several areas are actively engaged in collaboration, such as field operations, marketing and merchandising. And we're also seeing benefits from consolidated real estate and diamond buying teams as well as alignment around our human resources departments. And we are in the process of finalizing our technology road map for the next several years, which will include a single IT function for the enterprise, a road map of common technology platforms for us to expand and grow our business and digital experiences that enable us to know our customers intimately while seamlessly servicing them.
In the U.K., the main drivers include initiatives around diamonds, success in fashion merchandise and watches and a continued focus on sales rather than test. The U.K. continues to drive diamond sales with their improved sales training and marketing initiatives geared towards bridal customers. Perfect Fit, the Forever Diamond, Neil Lane, Leo and Tolkowsky all were strong in the first quarter as well as Le Vian diamonds. And our Vera Wang test performed well also.
Outside of the diamond category, watches and beads also did very well. Our U.K. division experienced strength across all selling channels. eCommerce sales increases were higher than total Signet eCommerce sales increases. And our new outlet stores performed well. Our U.K. division continues to embrace a culture of collaboration and is focused on continuously enhancing their diamond selling skills journey.
Signet continues to gain profitable market shares in both Sterling and in our Zale division as well as for Signet overall. We have a highly collaborative, team-oriented mindset as we integrate our businesses. We continue to see progress against all of our strategic pillars and specifically invest in bridal. And our omni-channel approach is clearly thriving as we see strength across all of our selling channels.
So to sum up, we're seeing terrific contributions and collaborations from all of our divisions. Zale continues to gain synergy and operational momentum. The U.K. is showing unprecedented comp growth as a result of our collaborative culture, and Sterling is consistently showing strength with positive comps and operating results. I feel as good as ever about our future for the near, the medium and long term.
And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Michele for a run-through on our financials."

So starting with our sales performance, I'll point out a few highlights, which Mark just provided an overview of the numbers. In our Sterling division, total sales increased 4.5% to $944.2 million, which included a same-store sales increase of 2.3%. The average transaction price in Sterling increased by 4.7% and the number of transactions decreased by 3%. This was driven by our merchandise mix, including bridal and higher price point fashion collections. Our Zale division total sales were $437.1 million for the quarter, which included a same-store sales increase of 5.6%. Total sales also included an $8.6 million unfavorable revenue impact due to purchase accounting adjustments related to deferred revenue. As Mark indicated, sales were particularly strong in our Zale division in branded bridal and branded diamond fashion.
In our U.K. division, total sales decreased 3.4% but increased 6.6% on a constant exchange basis. Sales were $146.5 million with a comp sales increase of 6.2%. The average transaction price increased by 3.6%, and the number of transactions increased by 2.6% due to merchandise mix with strong performance in branded bridal, fashion diamond jewelry and fashion watches.
Moving on from sales, I'll walk through Signet's consolidated Q1 performance and then will turn to analyze Signet's adjusted results.
So on Slide 8, the table provides a reconciliation of Signet's adjusted results to our consolidated results. The difference between adjusted Signet and Signet are the columns reflecting purchase accounting and transaction costs, with transaction costs including our integration-related expenses. On a GAAP basis, EPS was $1.48 per share, and at the high end of our guidance. Purchase accounting adjustments, which include a reduction to deferred revenue, amortization related to inventory fair value step-up and amortization of unfavorable contract were dilutive to EPS by $0.09. Transaction costs were responsible for $0.05 of dilution. Transaction costs related to our integration were a couple of pennies per share higher than first anticipated, and that's primarily due to timing associated with various consulting expenses.
Let's move on, and we'll look at operating income by division. Operating income of $176.2 million or 11.5% of sales consisted of the following components: Sterling Jewelers was $178.2 million or 18.9% of division sales, and that's up 50 basis points from last year and a record Q1 high. Zale operating income was $15.5 million or 3.5% of division sales, inclusive of purchase accounting adjustments. Zales performance consisted of $10.4 million in profit from the Zales jewelry operating segment and $5.1 million for the Piercing Pagoda operating segment. Now when excluding costs of $11.4 million related to purchase accounting, which we just previously discussed, the Zale division operating profit was $26.9 million or 6% of adjusted division sales.
Our U.K. operating profit was $0.5 million or 0.3% of division sales versus no profit last year. Other, which primarily consist of our corporate and administrative expenses and Signet's diamond sourcing subsidiaries, include $6.4 million of transaction costs related to integration activities. We're continuing to show the detail of adjusted Signet and the Zale operations to give further visibility into our results, which we'll expect that we'll do this until we fully comp in Q3. After that point, we'll provide Zale details consistent with our divisional disclosures.
The presentation on Slide 10 takes adjusted Signet, which is shown on the far right, and then breaks it into 2 parts. One part is Zale operations, shown in the middle column, and the second part, in the left-hand column, is adjusted Signet excluding Zale. Adjusted Signet excluding Zale is the rest of Signet, inclusive of finance interest and taxes. From sales to operating income, this gives you comparability to prior year results. In addition, the information is provided to give you visibility as to how the Zale operations performed in the first quarter.
So continuing on, let's review Signet's adjusted P&L results below the sales line. Adjusted gross margin was $581.4 million or 37.8% of adjusted sales, and that was down 80 basis points versus last year. The decrease in rate was driven by the addition of Zale, which impacted the gross margin rate by 90 basis points, as Zale currently operates with a lower gross margin structure than that of the Sterling division. Excluding the Zale division, the adjusted Signet gross margin rate would have been 38.7%, and that would be up 10 basis points, primarily due to favorable commodity cost.
Adjusted SG&A was $450.9 million or 29.3% of adjusted sales, and that was up 70 basis points versus last year's rate of 28.6%. Excluding Zale, the adjusted SG&A rate was also 29.3%, and that's due to higher planned advertising expense in our Sterling division and higher central costs due primarily to legal- and payroll-related costs. The increase in advertising expense, as Mark had previously mentioned, is due principally to the launch of new Jared radio and print advertising among a variety of other marketing initiatives and investments that impacted the rate by 40 basis points. This higher SG&A ratio is a function of investing for future growth, and we expect our SG&A run rate to improve this year.
Other operating income was $63.5 million. This increase of $9.5 million was due principally to higher interest income earned from higher outstanding receivable balances. Adjusted operating income in the first quarter was 12.6% of adjusted sales. Excluding the Zale division, the adjusted Signet operating margin would have been 15.3%, leveraging up 20 basis points. Adjusted EPS was $1.62 compared to $1.29 in the first quarter of fiscal 2015. On a comparable basis, that is when excluding this year's impact from Zale and capital structure and financing, EPS was $1.35, representing a 4.7% growth over last year. Our strong operating results afford us the opportunity to repurchase $21.9 million of Signet's stock in the first quarter, in line with our capital allocation plan. At the end of the first quarter, there was $243.7 million remaining under Signet's 2013 share repurchase authorization program.
Now we'll move on to the balance sheet, and we'll start with a look at our inventory. Net inventories ended the quarter at approximately $2.5 billion, an increase of nearly $1 billion or 63% over last year, and that's driven in part by sales growth of 45%. The inventory level increase was driven primarily by the acquisition of Zale. To a lesser extent, inventory levels were also impacted by new store growth of $40 million and higher diamond inventory of $56 million, associated with our bridal business and our diamond sourcing initiative. This higher level of diamond inventory reflects our continued initiatives around our best in bridal strategic pillar.
So now I'll turn your attention to our in-house credit metrics and statistics. In-house credit remains an important component of Sterling division's business and a competitive advantage. Net accounts receivable increased $1.5 billion, and that compares to $1.3 billion last year, up 14.7%, driven by higher sales and an increase in the credit penetration rate. Our planned participation was 60.7% compared to 58.1% last year. The increase in credit participation was attributed primarily to credit decision engine improvements made in April of last year, higher outlet credit participation and strong guest acceptance of our current offerings. The average monthly collection rate was 12.6% compared to 13.2%, due primarily to 3 reasons. First, our customers continue to opt more for a regular credit terms, which require a lower monthly payments compared to the 12-month interest-free program. Second, our mix of bridal increases due to our best in bridal strategy, and this creates a higher receivable -- average receivable balance. Our required schedule payments do not increase proportionally with a higher merchandise mix shift. And finally, third, like other consumer loans, more principal is paid off later. So as our portfolio has grown more in the last year, proportionately, more of it will be paid later.
So let's move on to a few other credit statistics around our in-house finance program. Net bad debt expense for the quarter was $28.1 million compared to $22.3 million last year, an increase of $5.8 million, and that was driven primarily by the growth in receivable balance from increased penetration and change in the credit program mix.
Other operating income was $63.5 million compared to $54 million last year. This was an increase of $9.5 million and is due primarily to more interest income on the higher outstanding receivables as well as the shift away from interest-free programs. So the net impact of these 2 items was income of $35.4 million compared to $31.7 million in the prior year or an increase of $3.7 million.
Our portfolio continues to perform well, as evidenced by the net impact of bad debt and other operating income as well as the allowance as a percentage of accounts receivable being fairly consistent.
So now we'll move on for -- to our financial guidance. Our financial guidance for the second quarter Signet comparable store sales are expected to increase 2% to 3%. Second quarter adjusted EPS is expected to be $1.11 to $1.16. As a reminder, adjusted EPS is EPS less the 2 set of adjustments that are shown on Slide 15, being purchase accounting and our transaction costs related to integration. Our Q2 comp sales projection reflects continued sales growth and a strong hurdle rate achieved by Signet last year, driven by Sterling with a 6.7% comp increase. Our comp guidance also reflects our current sales run rate. And our guidance also reflects our proven ability to protect our bottom line and to drive financial results through EPS growth.
From an effective tax rate standpoint, Signet's fiscal 2016 annual rate is anticipated to be 28% to 29%, and the difference versus fiscal 2015 is principally the full year effect of owning Zale and having our capital structure in place.
Capital expenditure guidance for the full year is $275 million to $325 million, and our net selling square footage is projected to grow approximately 2% to 3%. And I'd reference you to our news release for further detail by division.
And lastly, I'd like to reiterate our confidence in delivering our operating profit synergy goal of $150 million to $175 million which, if using our current weighted average shares outstanding, equates to about $1.90 to $2.20 of earnings per share within the 3-year period ending January 2018. As we previously guided, 20% of the synergies will be achieved by the end of fiscal year-end and will be back-end loaded to the second half of this year. As a result, synergies are not a material component of our Q2 EPS guidance.
That concludes my remarks on the financials. And with that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Mark."

Previously, and in -- as part of my prepared remarks, I mentioned we've guided to 20% of realization of synergies for fiscal '16.

We actually built the Jared division -- when we started with Jared, before we could afford national TV, we built the Jared division on continuity radio.

So we're getting back into testing the radio, see that we can get the lift in certain markets and then specifically for our bridal -- for our best in bridal program for the Jared business. So advertising is something that you don't see automatic sales lifts. It's something that has a building effect. And we always test programs in the spring season to get a good understanding of the elasticity in what -- we can do some type of relations as it relates to what type of growth we could expect in the fall. So a lot of this is very common for us to test different type of programs in the spring to hopefully roll it through the fall. So you got incremental advertising as it relates to radio, which was in the test mode. As I stated, we have our first-ever branded book in our Jared stores. So both customers, current customers can get direct mail and our stores can sell off of that. And that's something we hope, and so as we analyze the results, something we can carry through the fall. And there are certain product launches that were in test right now, Simeon, which I'm not going to share with you for competitive reasons, that were very excited about, that could be very strong launches or extended test for the fall season, and one which I mentioned was Vera Wang.

Should we begin by seeing procurement benefits that would benefit the gross margin line? Or would we start by seeing cost saves on the SG&A? Or is it both simultaneously?

And if you look at what their reported gross margins would've been, it's really apples and oranges. Because they were on a LIFO basis. So I really can't talk directly to the gross margin other than we know it is lower than our Sterling division and it is an area of focus as it relates to our synergies. We anticipate 50% of our synergies are going to come through gross margin with -- between our merchandising and sourcing initiatives, which really kind of leads then into your second question on how to think about those synergies and is it SG&A versus gross margin? I think you're going to start seeing them coming through a little bit at -- both at the same time. When we talk about our gross margin synergies, we'll start seeing some from the procurement process. The other one we talked about from a gross margin standpoint is our discount controls. And so that is something that we've been currently working on, on getting more of a systematic, more visibility into the discount control process at Zale. So I think that's when we could start seeing it at the tail end of this year as well as we'll start getting some of that SG&A savings coming in on the back half. So I think it'll be a little bit of a blend between those 2. And then your final question, Ike, in terms of ADS, you're correct in that our ADS contract goes into effect in October. So we will have, at the tail end of the year, ADS in place. And we would expect to see some benefit for that last quarter of the year. And just to remind you, Ike, on that front, we did -- from a synergy standpoint, we did exclude our ADS savings which, if quantified, that full year effect is $22 million.

But I'll give you a quick -- a very quick overview, Oliver, because I won't give it any justice, but the bottom line is the core of our -- the core of our customers in the U.S., Zales, Kay and Jared are within the midmarket. They actually have different customer, different base customers within that midmarket. And it's very clear to us that there is different segmentation within the midmarket. And we will define those segmentations to the market and to all of you at the investor conference. You can understand from our research and understanding our core customers how we can take our core customers for each brand. It was one of the -- the nicest things that we found during the analysis of the Zales acquisition is that Zales' customer within the midmarket is actually different than that of Kay and Jared. And so we're going to take -- have strategies and initiatives how we can penetrate those segments and customers even further. So it's -- I need a lot more time, Oliver, to get into it.

Sterling delivered a 2.3% comp sales growth, led by Kay, with an increase of 3.6%, Kay's 25th consecutive quarterly increase. Kay saw strength in diamond jewelry across its merchandise portfolio, in bridal and fashion, branded and non-branded; and a variety of products. Examples include Neil Lane Bridal and Tolkowsky, Diamonds in Rhythm, fashion pendants and solitaire earrings and rings, and watches were strong also. We launched Pinterest and Instagram for Kay in time for Mothers' Day. These are brand-new marketing platforms for our customers.
In nearly every field operations key performance indicator improved year-over-year. Importantly, our customer service index scores are the highest they've ever been.
Our Jared store had comp store sale increase of 0.2%, while our total store sales were up 4.4%. Jared had success around fashion collections, such as Neil Lane Designs, Diamonds in Rhythm, Lois Hill, Earthly Treasure by Smithsonian and Le Vian. And in watches, Movado and Citizen were very strong. And our Vera Wang test continues to perform well in our Jared stores.
We recently launched a test of incremental radio advertising in several markets that helped strengthen our bridal position. In addition, we also launched Jared's first-ever brand book used for direct mail marketing and in-store use. We continue to drive our critical traffic-building repair and design center business. We recently launched a new managers' training system for our design and service centers in our Jared stores to enhance our artisans' ability to deliver high-quality product in even faster time frames. Given the investment and our initiatives in our Jared business, we feel we are well positioned to capture profitable market share.
Now moving on to our Zale division. Zale delivered a strong first quarter of 6.1% comps due to a variety of planned investments and initiatives around merchandising, marketing and field operations. Beginning with merchandising, our branded bridal and fashion diamond collections performed very well, led by the Vera Wang LOVE collection, the Celebration Diamond and Unstoppable Love. As we continue to focus on expanding depth versus breadth in our merchandise assortments, our current brands continue to drive sales growth. The Zale store teams are scoring well on key customer service and selling skills performance indicators. They are highly engaged and executing better than ever. In the first quarter, there were a variety of other successes beyond our sales store performances. Our Peoples stores in Canada and our Piercing Pagoda stores throughout the United States all delivered comps in excess of 6%. And eCommerce performed very well also.
Driving results is the continued phenomenal collaboration between all of our division team members to Signet-ize our business. And speaking of Signet-izing, several areas are actively engaged in collaboration, such as field operations, marketing and merchandising. And we're also seeing benefits from consolidated real estate and diamond buying teams as well as alignment around our human resources departments. And we are in the process of finalizing our technology road map for the next several years, which will include a single IT function for the enterprise, a road map of common technology platforms for us to expand and grow our business and digital experiences that enable us to know our customers intimately while seamlessly servicing them.
In the U.K., the main drivers include initiatives around diamonds, success in fashion merchandise and watches and a continued focus on sales rather than task. The U.K. continues to drive diamond sales with their improved sales training and marketing initiatives geared towards bridal customers. Perfect Fit, the Forever Diamond, Neil Lane, Leo and Tolkowsky all were strong in the first quarter as well as Le Vian diamonds. And our Vera Wang test performed well also.
Outside of the diamond category, watches and beads also did very well. Our U.K. division experienced strength across all selling channels. eCommerce sales increases were higher than total Signet eCommerce sales increases. And our new outlet stores performed well. Our U.K. division continues to embrace a culture of collaboration and is focused on continuously enhancing their diamond selling skills journey.
Signet continues to gain profitable market shares in both Sterling and in our Zale division as well as for Signet overall. We have a highly collaborative, team-oriented mindset as we integrate our businesses. We continue to see progress against all of our strategic pillars and specifically invest in bridal. And our omni-channel approach is clearly thriving as we see strength across all of our selling channels.
So to sum up, we're seeing terrific contributions and collaborations from all of our divisions. Zale continues to gain synergy and operational momentum. The U.K. is showing unprecedented comp growth as a result of our collaborative culture, and Sterling is consistently showing strength with positive comps and operating results. I feel as good as ever about our future for the near, the medium and long term.
And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Michele for a run-through on our financials."
693964,298301104,822795,"Signet Jewelers Limited, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 28, 2015",2015-05-28,"Earnings Calls","Signet Jewelers Limited","Executives","Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone.

So starting with our sales performance, I'll point out a few highlights which Mark just provided an overview of the numbers. In our Sterling division, total sales increased 4.5% to $944.2 million, which included a same-store sales increase of 2.3%. The average transaction price in Sterling increased by 4.7% and the number of transactions decreased by 3%. This was driven by our merchandise mix, including bridal and higher price point fashion collections. Our Zale division total sales were $437.1 million for the quarter, which included a same-store sales increase of 5.6%. Total sales also included an $8.6 million unfavorable revenue impact due to purchase accounting adjustments related to deferred revenue. As Mark indicated, sales were particularly strong in our Zale division in branded bridal and branded diamond fashion.
In our U.K. division, total sales decreased 3.4% but increased 6.6% on a constant exchange basis. Sales were $146.5 million with a comp sales increase of 6.2%. The average transaction price increased by 3.6%, and the number of transactions increased by 2.6% due to merchandise mix with strong performance in branded bridal, fashion diamond jewelry and fashion watches.
Moving on from sales, I'll walk through Signet's consolidated Q1 performance and then will turn to analyze Signet's adjusted results.
So on Slide 8, the table provides a reconciliation of Signet's adjusted results to our consolidated results. The difference between adjusted Signet and Signet are the columns reflecting purchase accounting and transaction costs, with transaction costs including our integration-related expenses. On a GAAP basis, EPS was $1.48 per share and at the high end of our guidance. Purchase accounting adjustments, which include a reduction to deferred revenue, amortization related to inventory fair value step-up and amortization of unfavorable contracts were dilutive to EPS by $0.09. Transaction costs were responsible for $0.05 of dilution. Transaction costs related to our integration were a couple of pennies per share higher than first anticipated, and that's primarily due to timing associated with various consulting expenses.
Let's move on, and we'll look at operating income by division. Operating income of $176.2 million or 11.5% of sales consisted of the following components: Sterling Jewelers was $178.2 million or 18.9% of division sales, and that's up 50 basis points from last year and a record Q1 high. Zale operating income was $15.5 million or 3.5% of division sales, inclusive of purchase accounting adjustments. Zales performance consisted of $10.4 million in profit from the Zales jewelry operating segment and $5.1 million for the Piercing Pagoda operating segment. Now when excluding costs of $11.4 million related to purchase accounting, which we just previously discussed, the Zale division operating profit was $26.9 million or 6% of adjusted division sales.
Our U.K. operating profit was $0.5 million or 0.3% of division sales versus no profit last year. Other, which primarily consist of our corporate and administrative expenses and Signet's diamond sourcing subsidiaries, include $6.4 million of transaction costs related to integration activities. We're continuing to show the detail of adjusted Signet and the Zale operations to give further visibility into our results, which we'll expect that we'll do this until we fully comp in Q3. After that point, we'll provide Zale details consistent with our divisional disclosures.
The presentation on Slide 10 takes adjusted Signet, which is shown on the far right, and then breaks it into 2 parts. One part is Zale operations, shown in the middle column, and the second part, in the left-hand column, is adjusted Signet excluding Zale. Adjusted Signet excluding Zale is the rest of Signet, inclusive of finance interest and taxes. From sales to operating income, this gives you comparability to prior year results. In addition, the information is provided to give you visibility as to how the Zale operations performed in the first quarter.
So continuing on, let's review Signet's adjusted P&L results below the sales line. Adjusted gross margin was $581.4 million or 37.8% of adjusted sales, and that was down 80 basis points versus last year. The decrease in rate was driven by the addition of Zale, which impacted the gross margin rate by 90 basis points, as Zale currently operates with a lower gross margin structure than that of the Sterling division. Excluding the Zale division, the adjusted Signet gross margin rate would have been 38.7%, and that would be up 10 basis points, primarily due to favorable commodity cost.
Adjusted SG&A was $450.9 million or 29.3% of adjusted sales, and that was up 70 basis points versus last year's rate of 28.6%. Excluding Zale, the adjusted SG&A rate was also 29.3%, and that's due to higher planned advertising expense in our Sterling division and higher central costs due primarily to legal- and payroll-related costs. The increase in advertising expense, as Mark had previously mentioned, is due principally to the launch of new Jared radio and print advertising among a variety of other marketing initiatives and investments that impacted the rate by 40 basis points. This higher SG&A ratio is a function of investing for future growth, and we expect our SG&A run rate to improve this year.
Other operating income was $63.5 million. This increase of $9.5 million was due principally to higher interest income earned from higher outstanding receivable balances. Adjusted operating income in the first quarter was 12.6% of adjusted sales. Excluding the Zale division, the adjusted Signet operating margin would have been 15.3%, leveraging up 20 basis points. Adjusted EPS was $1.62 compared to $1.29 in the first quarter of fiscal 2015. On a comparable basis, that is when excluding this year's impact from Zale and capital structure and financing, EPS was $1.35, representing a 4.7% growth over last year. Our strong operating results afford us the opportunity to repurchase $21.9 million of Signet's stock in the first quarter, in line with our capital allocation plan. At the end of the first quarter, there was $243.7 million remaining under Signet's 2013 share repurchase authorization program.
Now we'll move on to the balance sheet, and we'll start with a look at our inventory. Net inventories ended the quarter at approximately $2.5 billion, an increase of nearly $1 billion or 63% over last year, and that's driven in part by sales growth of 45%. The inventory level increase was driven primarily by the acquisition of Zale. To a lesser extent, inventory levels were also impacted by new store growth of $40 million and higher diamond inventory of $56 million, associated with our bridal business and our diamond sourcing initiative. This higher level of diamond inventory reflects our continued initiatives around our best in bridal strategic pillar.
So now I'll turn your attention to our in-house credit metrics and statistics. In-house credit remains an important component of Sterling division's business and a competitive advantage. Net accounts receivable increased $1.5 billion, and that compares to $1.3 billion last year, up 14.7%, driven by higher sales and an increase in the credit penetration rate. Our planned participation was 60.7% compared to 58.1% last year. The increase in credit participation was attributed primarily to credit decision engine improvements made in April of last year, higher outlet credit participation and strong guest acceptance of our credit offerings. The average monthly collection rate was 12.6% compared to 13.2%, due primarily to 3 reasons. First, our customers continue to opt more for our regular credit terms, which require a lower monthly payments compared to the 12-month interest-free program. Second, our mix of bridal increases due to our best in bridal strategy, and this creates a higher receivable -- average receivable balance. Our required schedule payments do not increase proportionally with a higher merchandise mix shift. And finally, third, like other consumer loans, more principal is paid off later. So as our portfolio has grown more in the last year, proportionately, more of it will be paid later.
So let's move on to a few other credit statistics around our in-house finance program. Net bad debt expense for the quarter was $28.1 million compared to $22.3 million last year, an increase of $5.8 million, and that was driven primarily by the growth in receivable balance from increased penetration and change in the credit program mix.
Other operating income was $63.5 million compared to $54 million last year. This was an increase of $9.5 million and is due primarily to more interest income on the higher outstanding receivables as well as the shift away from interest-free programs. So the net impact of these 2 items was income of $35.4 million compared to $31.7 million in the prior year or an increase of $3.7 million.
Our portfolio continues to perform well, as evidenced by the net impact of bad debt and other operating income as well as the allowance as a percentage of accounts receivable being fairly consistent.
So now we'll move on for -- to our financial guidance. Our financial guidance for the second quarter Signet comparable store sales are expected to increase 2% to 3%. Second quarter adjusted EPS is expected to be $1.11 to $1.16. As a reminder, adjusted EPS is EPS less the 2 set of adjustments that are shown on Slide 15, being purchase accounting and our transaction costs related to integration. Our Q2 comp sales projection reflects continued sales growth and a strong hurdle rate achieved by Signet last year, driven by Sterling with a 6.7% comp increase. Our comp guidance also reflects our current sales run rate. And our guidance also reflects our proven ability to protect our bottom line and to drive financial results through EPS growth.
From an effective tax rate standpoint, Signet's fiscal 2016 annual rate is anticipated to be 28% to 29%, and the difference versus fiscal 2015 is principally the full year effect of owning Zale and having our capital structure in place.
Capital expenditure guidance for the full year is $275 million to $325 million, and our net selling square footage is projected to grow approximately 2% to 3%. And I'd reference you to our news release for further detail by division.
And lastly, I'd like to reiterate our confidence in delivering our operating profit synergy goal of $150 million to $175 million which, if using our current weighted average shares outstanding, equates to about $1.90 to $2.20 of earnings per share within the 3-year period ending January 2018. As we previously guided, 20% of the synergies will be achieved by the end of fiscal year-end and will be back-end loaded to the second half of this year. As a result, synergies are not a material component of our Q2 EPS guidance.
That concludes my remarks on the financials. And with that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Mark."

Previously, and in -- as part of my prepared remarks, I mentioned we've guided to 20% of realization of synergies for fiscal '16.

So advertising is something that you don't see automatic sales lifts. It's something that has a building effect. And we always test programs in the spring season to get a good understanding of the elasticity in what -- we can do some type of relations as it relates to what type of growth we could expect in the fall. So a lot of this is very common for us to test different type of programs in the spring to hopefully roll it through the fall. So you got incremental advertising as it relates to radio, which was in the test mode. As I stated, we have our first-ever branded book in our Jared stores. So both customers, current customers can get direct mail and our stores can sell off of that. And that's something we hope, and so as we analyze the results, something we can carry through the fall.

I guess, first, can you give some color on their -- I'm sorry if I missed this -- on their gross margin performance in the quarter year-over-year since we don't have the like-for-like comparison to really look at? And then also when we start to think about the synergies, Michele, that you mentioned blowing into the P&L in the back half, how should that process evolve? Should we begin by seeing procurement benefits that would benefit the gross margin line? Or would we start by seeing cost saves on the SG&A? Or is it both simultaneously? And then the very last question will be the ADS agreement at Zale, should that start to add a few million dollars in EBIT to the segment every quarter, beginning in Q4 this year? Or how should we think about that?"

And if you look at what their reported gross margins would've been, it's really apples and oranges. Because they were on a LIFO basis. So I really can't talk directly to the gross margin other than we know it is lower than our Sterling division and it is an area of focus as it relates to our synergies. We anticipate 50% of our synergies are going to come through gross margin with -- between our merchandising and sourcing initiatives, which really kind of leads then into your second question on how to think about those synergies and is it SG&A versus gross margin? I think you're going to start seeing them coming through a little bit at -- both at the same time. When we talk about our gross margin synergies, we'll start seeing some from the procurement process. The other one we talked about from a gross margin standpoint is our discount controls. And so that is something that we've been currently working on, on getting more of a systematic, more visibility into the discount control process at Zale. So I think that's when we could start seeing it at the tail end of this year as well as we'll start getting some of that SG&A savings coming in on the back half. So I think it'll be a little bit of a blend between those 2. And then your final question, Ike, in terms of ADS, you're correct in that our ADS contract goes into effect in October. So we will have, at the tail end of the year, ADS in place. And we would expect to see some benefit for that last quarter of the year. And just to remind you, Ike, on that front, we did -- from a synergy standpoint, we did exclude our ADS savings which, if quantified that full year effect, is $22 million. That was excluded from our synergy number, but I think we'll see some benefit at the tail end of our fourth quarter."

In the second quarter, we delivered strong top line and solid bottom line results, which exceeded guidance. 
Signet comps increased by 4.2%, and adjusted EPS was at $1.28, which was a 19.6% increase over the prior year adjusted EPS. Our success in the second quarter of fiscal 2016 was broad-based with sales and profit growth coming from virtually all of our store concepts across various geographies with contributions across our selling channels and from several functional areas. 
We continue to outperform our industry driven by our competitive strengths, and importantly, we're increasingly confident about our integration synergies. In addition, we are making excellent progress against each of our Vision 2020 strategic pillars. 
Before I get to the second quarter and what's to come for the back half of the year, I wanted to make a few comments about our space in the jewelry industry. We have a 5-year compounded annual growth rate of 12% in total sales. Signet has been gaining and continues to gain market share profitably. We consistently outperform the jewelry market and the total retail market. And based on results to date, we appear poised to deliver another year of industry outperformance. 
Given the fragmented jewelry industry, we believe we have many years of profitable market share gains ahead of us. Our brands, our scale and our people give us a sustained, competitive advantage. 
Our leading position in the jewelry marketplace has been driven by progress each -- against each of our strategic pillars, specifically in best in bridal, which leads me to review our second quarter sales drivers. 
From a merchandise perspective, diamond jewelry was strong. Bridal, a strategic focus of ours, grew faster than Signet's overall rate of growth and therefore, gained relative share. Bridal brands such as Neil Lane, Vera Wang LOVE and Tolkowsky were standouts as well as our nonbranded bridal portfolio. 
Complementing those results has been the continued momentum of Diamonds in Rhythm, Unstoppable Love and our solitaire diamond earrings programs. The great work of Signet's collective teams around discount controls, commodity pricing and product design over the past year is now manifesting itself in our financial results, helping to drive not only higher sales and great value but also higher profitabilities and synergies. 
We're also pleased to report that our marketing test initiatives are doing well, and results are encouraging. What we are learning is that our radio and print spend work well outside the times when we're on television. This strengthens the continuity of our brands in the minds of our customers. We will continue to closely monitor our marketing spend as we move into the fourth quarter. 
Our key store operation performance indicator improved in the second quarter also. Our store teams are benefiting from longer, more focused District Manager store visits. 
So in summary, we're executing throughout the organization, and it all shows in our financial results. Not only do we have good momentum coming out of a very productive second quarter, but we also have a variety of new catalysts to drive our business into the second half of the year. 
Among our merchandise initiatives that we are excited about are Miracle Links, which is the perfect pendant for new moms symbolizing the birth of a new child. We're also proud to announce a new partnership with ALEX AND ANI, which we'll test in 108 Jared stores beginning in mid-September. ALEX AND ANI is a leading-edge, trend-right fashion collection that is very popular with the millenials and a natural traffic driver. 
We also have the Chosen Diamond, which is a program that will test in 60 Jared stores this fall and is expected to resonate with the sentimentalist customer that Jared attracts. It provides documentation from rough to finish polished diamonds, so customers know the steps of their own diamond's journey. 
Vera Wang LOVE continues to do very well in our sales stores. The cross-selling effort test so well in Jared that Vera Wang LOVE will now rollout to all Jared stores this fall. 
We also will be one of select jewelers who will sell Star Wars jewelry and beads this holiday season, which will be sold in our Kay stores. And in late October, we intend to launch a new must-have jewelry product that we first referenced at our Investor Conference in June. This collection will be -- which will be in all of our national store brands in the United States, United Kingdom and in Canada will be supported with one of our most comprehensive marketing programs in the history of our company. 
And speaking of marketing, we will apply many of our recent customer segmentation learnings. For instance, Zale will have a new TV creative campaigns with higher media weights called Diamond Kind of Love, which has tested very, very well. 
Kay marketing will be focused and classic to resonate with a gift customer profile, and Jared will begin running semiannual special events to launch new products in order to stay relevant to with select customers who seek value opportunities. 
We also test a new store design for Zale and for Piercing Pagoda, and we'll continue to grow the latest concepts in store design for Kay. Again all of these designs are aligned with our segmentation learnings. 
And we'll continue to drive custom jewelry with a new jewelry technology for custom in our Zale stores. These are just some of the many catalysts that we are investing in throughout Signet, and we are just getting started, and there are many, many more to come. 
So on my final slide, I want to take a minute to reiterate a few important points about our favorable position in the jewelry space. Our people are getting ready for the busy fourth quarter selling season. 
We have just completed successful District Manager meetings in preparation for our managers' leadership conferences. Our preparations are nearly complete, and there's great excitement around district agendas and district exciting initiatives that will be driving home to our field operation organization. 
Our pipeline of merchandises tested in full. We have a variety of life extensions and new programs designed to be fresh, exciting, consistent with our strategy and relevant with our core customers in each of their shopping locations. 
The merchandise fall will be supported with new marketing creative that has been placed extremely thoughtfully to maximize its impact. And all of this is culminated to generate momentum behind our business our same-store sales improved throughout the quarter. 
In closing, our business is strong, and this was also recognized by Standard & Poor's as Signet was added to the S&P 500 during the second quarter, which is a great honor to us to be added to this iconic index. I am extremely confident in Signet's prospects for the near term, the medium term and the long term. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Michele for a run-through on our financials."
693964,308671565,862752,"Signet Jewelers Limited, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 27, 2015",2015-08-27,"Earnings Calls","Signet Jewelers Limited","Executives","Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. So let's start with our second quarter sales performance. Signet's total sales increased 15.1%, and comps increased 4.2% above our guided comp range of 2% to 3%. So let me share with you some additional color",2261,"Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. So let's start with our second quarter sales performance. 
Signet's total sales increased 15.1%, and comps increased 4.2% above our guided comp range of 2% to 3%. So let me share with you some additional color on our sales and comp performance by division. 
So in our Sterling division, total sales increased 5.9% to $858.5 million, which included a same-store sales increase of 3.3%. Sales increases were broad-based across store banners, product brands and nonbrands as well as omni-channel. Bridal and diamond jewelry also were particularly strong. 
The average transaction price in Sterling increased by 4.2%, and the number of transactions decreased by 2.5% due to merchandise mix. Our Zale division total sales were $389.3 million for the quarter, which included a same-store sales increase of 5.8%. We saw particular strength in branded bridal and branded diamond fashion. 
Sales increases were also favorably impacted by our continued integration initiatives around sales associate training, targeted promotional events and new marketing creative. Also, keep in mind that the prior year quarter had 26 fewer days due to the acquisition occurring on May 29, 2014. 
In our U.K. division, total sales decreased 2.3% but increased 6.4% on a constant exchange basis. Sales were $159.1 million with a comp sales increase of 5.1%, and that was driven primarily by Ernest Jones. Both U.K. store concepts reflected strong results in bridal and watches. The average transaction price increased 4.3%, and the number of transactions also increased by 1.8% driven by merchandise mix. 
As mentioned in our earnings release this morning, the second quarter comp sales were favorably impacted by 60 basis points associated with an operational change that we made to align Sterling's extended service plans or ESPs with Zale, in which we view Zale as having a best practice related to the extended service plans. This operational change that related to ring sizing triggered a change in the revenue and expense recognition rates associated with our ESPs. 
So previously, in the Sterling division, the cost of ring sizing for customers who had purchased an ESP were not included as part of the extended service plan claim. So now since this alignment, the cost for ring sizing for customers who purchased an ESP are included in claims costs. 
For those customers who elect not to purchase an ESP and need ring sizing, a nominal fee is charged for this service. So the net impact is that more sales and profit are now recognized earlier within the Sterling division ESP sale, and this change is entirely noncash. 
Again, this operational change is just another example of Signet sharing best practices across the organization. Excluding the impact of the ESP change, Signet's comp sales would have been 3.6%, 60 basis points above the high end of our guidance. 
So moving on to sales. Let me walk you through Signet's consolidated Q2 performance before we turn and analyze Signet's adjusted results. 
The table you see on Slide 9 provides a reconciliation of Signet's adjusted results to consolidated results. Now the difference between adjusted Signet and Signet are the columns reflected purchase accounting and transaction costs, which include our integration-related expenses. 
So starting on the right side of the slide on a GAAP basis, EPS was $0.78 per share, and that was lower than our guidance due to the legal settlement of $34.2 million relating to the Zale acquisition appraisal rights matter. This settlement is recorded within transaction cost as SG&A, and the settlement finalizes the appraisal litigation, and no further cost associated with this litigation are expected to be incurred. 
The next column reflects our transaction costs. Transaction costs were responsible for $0.46 of EPS dilution, and that's inclusive of a $0.39 impact from the appraisal settlement we just spoke of. Purchase accounting adjustments, which reflect a reduction to deferred revenue, amortization related to the inventory fair value step up and amortization of unfavorable contracts, were dilutive to EPS by $0.04. 
On an adjusted Signet basis, the far most left column on the slide, EPS was $1.28, higher than our guidance of $1.11 to $1.16. Now we'll discuss our adjusted results in more detail momentarily, but first, let's turn take and look at our operating income by division. 
So our second fiscal 2016 operating income was $100.8 million or 7.2% of sales, reflecting a 20.7% increase over prior year, and that also reflects a 40 basis point increase in operating margin rate. Components of operating income consisted of the following. Sterling Jewelers was $157.8 million or 18.4% of division of sales, reflecting a 21.5% increase over prior year, and that was up 240 basis points in rate from last year. 
Zale operating loss was $2.1 million or 0.5% of division sales, and that's inclusive of purchase accounting adjustments. Zale's performance consisted of a $2 million loss from the Zale Jewelry operating segment and a $0.1 million loss from the Piercing Pagoda operating segment. Now excluding these adjustment, and you'll see this in a moment on Slide 11, the Zale division operating profit was $3 million or 0.7% of adjusted division sales. 
Our U.K. operating profit was $3.2 million or 2% of division sales, and that's up 130 basis points from last year. 
Other, which primarily consists of our corporate and administrative expenses and Signet's diamond sourcing subsidiaries, includes $43.6 million of transaction costs, which also includes the $34.2 million related to the appraisal settlement. 
So now this the last quarter that we will show the detail of the Zale operations. Next quarter, we will provide Zale details that are consistent with our other divisional disclosures as we will have fully comped the acquisition. 
So the presentation on Slide 11 takes adjusted Signet, which is shown on the far right, and then breaks it into 2 parts. One part is Zale operations, which is shown in the middle column, and the second part in the left-hand column is adjusted Signet, excluding Zale. Adjusted Signet, excluding Zale, is the rest of Signet and inclusive of finance interest and taxes. So from sales to operating income, this gives you comparability to prior year results. In addition, the information is provided to give you visibility as to how the Zale operations performed in the second quarter, and again, I would just remind you that the prior year Q2 had 26 fewer days as the acquisition occurred on May 29, 2014. 
So continuing on, let's look at Signet's adjusted P&L results below the sales line. Adjusted gross margin was $500.1 million or 35.3% of adjusted sales, and that was up 100 basis points driven principally by higher sales, favorable commodity cost and merchandise synergy initiatives in the Zale division. Excluding the Zale division, the adjusted Signet gross margin rate would have been 35.7%, and that's up 90 basis points, principally driven by favorable commodity cost and partially offset by net bad debt due to higher credit sales in the Sterling division. 
Adjusted SG&A was $413.4 million or 29.2% of adjusted sales, up 80 basis points due to the incremental investment in Zale, principally surrounding advertising, information technology support and employee benefits. So excluding Zale, the adjusted SG&A rate was 27.5%, favorable by 10 basis points over last year. This was driven by store payroll leverage and nearly offset by higher central costs, primarily related to legal fees associated with the appraisal settlement. 
These legal fees associated with the appraisal litigation will no longer be incurred on a going-forward basis. Other operating income was $62.8 million. This increase of $9.1 million was due principally to higher interest income earned from higher outstanding receivable balances. 
Adjusted operating income of $149.5 million or 10.5% of sales reflects an 18.8% increase and up 30 basis points in rate. This growth was driven primarily by the increase in sales and gross margin. 
Importantly, excluding the Zale division, the adjusted Signet operating margin rate would have been 14.4%, leveraging off 170 basis points. This result shows the operating leverage inherent in our business model. 
Adjusted EPS was $1.28 compared to $1.07 last year, an increase of 19.6% driven by stronger-than-expected business performance, a lower tax rates and operational change associated with the extended service plans that I discussed earlier. The impact from the extended service plans change was $0.05 on adjusted EPS in the quarter. 
We repurchased $60 million of Signet's stock in the second quarter, and that's in line with our capital allocation plan. At the end of the second quarter, there was $183.7 million remaining under Signet's 2013 share repurchase authorization program. 
So now let's move on to the balance sheet, and we're going to first start with inventory. Net inventory ended the year at $2.4 billion, an increase of $68.9 million. This 2.9% increase over last year was driven primarily by first, new store growth; secondly, our diamond sourcing initiative. 
We continue to become more vertically integrated by procuring more rough diamonds to meet the needs of all of our divisions and to support our strategic initiative to be best in bridal. And finally, those factors were offset in part by strategic initiatives to increase Zale inventory turns. 
Through focused on eliminating slower turning SKUs and increasing merchandise that's more relevant to Zale's influence customers, we are making significant strides in streamlining the division's inventory. 
Signet ended the quarter well positioned in inventory as we move in the third quarter ahead of the holiday selling season. So now we'll turn our attention to our in-house credit metrics and statistics. Net accounts receivable increased to $1.5 billion compared to $1.3 billion last year, and that's up 13.5%, driven by higher sales and an increase in Sterling's division credit penetration rate. 
Year-to-date, credit participation was 61.6% compared to 60% last year. The increase in credit participation was attributed primarily to credit decision engine improvements and strong customer acceptance of our credit offerings. 
The average monthly collection rate was 12% compared to 12.4% due primarily to 3 reasons: first, our customers continue to opt more for our regular credit terms, which do require a lower monthly payments compared to the 12-month interest-free program; and second, as our mix of bridal increases due to our best in bridal strategy, this creates a higher average receivable. Our required scheduled payment do not increase proportionally with a higher merchandise mix shift; and third, just like other consumer loans, more principal is paid off later. So as our portfolio has grown more in the last year, proportionately, more of it will be paid later. 
Net bad debt expense for the quarter was $49.5 million, and that compares to $41.8 million last year, an increase of $7.7 million, and that's driven primarily by the growth in receivable balances from the increased credit penetration and the change in the credit mix. Other operating income was $62.8 million compared to $53.7 million last year. This was an increase of $9.1 million and is due primarily to more interest income on the higher outstanding receivables as well as the shift away from interest-free programs. 
So the net impact of these 2 items was income of $13.3 million compared to $11.9 million in the prior year or an increase of $1.4 million. The portfolio continues to perform strongly as evidenced by the net impact of our bad debt and other operating income. 
The allowance as a percentage of AR of 7.3% increased over last year due to timing. That is, in Q2 last year, accounts receivable grew due to the credit decision engine introduction, but the bad debt that would come with any AR growth lagged. So this created unusually low percentage last year, which we are now lapping. 
So sticking with the subject of credit, just a few comments regarding the third-party credit in our Zale stores. We're really looking forward to transitioning to our new partner, Alliance Data Systems, and this transition is expected to occur around fiscal year-end, which is a change from our original projection of October. 
All the financial and operational virtues of having ADS as our partner remain in place but will be deferred just a few months due to some administrative issues. We're very pleased that Signet's in-house credit team will be testing a second look credit in late October for Zale stores. Following a successful test, we expect the in-house credit team will fully support all Zale U.S. stores for the holiday selling season. 
So let's move on to the financial guidance for the third quarter. Signet's third quarter comparable store sales are expected to increase 3% to 4%. Third quarter adjusted EPS is expected to be $0.36 to $0.40, which does include a modest favorable impact of $0.03 from the extended service plan revenue recognition change. 
From an effective tax rate standpoint, Signet's fiscal 2016 annual rate is anticipated to be 28% to 29%. Our capital expenditure guidance for the full year remains at $275 million to $325 million, and our net selling square footage is projected to grow approximately 2% to 3%. 
I would also reference you to our news release for further details on how the capital is to be directed. We remain increasingly confident in achieving our synergy targets for FY '16 as well as our 3-year period. 
And as we noted in our Investor Day, we see the long-term potential for Sterling operating margins to reach 19%, Zale to reach 15% and the U.K., 10%. This represents a substantial margin opportunity in our business. We are very pleased with our financial performance in the second quarter. 
And with that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Mark."

So again I'll just start with and then if you look a broken record I think I say this every quarter on the call, we don't give guidance in terms of our gross margin or break down that gross margin in terms of what the expectations are from lower commodity costs. But what I would tell you is that we expect that we'll continue to see a benefit from the lower commodity prices rolling into our gross margin rate. The other thing I would just add to that is remember that we are on an average cost method. So benefits don't always immediately drop to the P&L but what we're seeing with this longer, sustained goal, particularly as it relates to the goal of commodity costs, we could continue to expect to see benefits coming in from commodity pricing. The other thing I would just add real quick on that, Oliver, is when you look at, and this was really exciting for us when you look at our gross margin, particularly on the Zale side, we're also being impacted by all the great synergy initiatives that we have been and the teams have been working so hard on. So we're really seeing that take root in terms of gross margin. I know Mark and I previously talked about discount controls. We have that up and running.

We have new products that we've been testing whether the Vera Wang LOVE that we shared with you or the Miracle Links that I shared with you. And in our business, it's always about the people, and our operational team came up with a focused, targeted effort as it relates to in-store customer experience, and they were spending more times in the stores.

What's made us much more confident in terms of our view of our synergies is we are starting to see those benefits roll in a little bit faster than we had originally anticipated. It's still overall I think relatively immaterial to the quarter as a whole. And on a net basis, the guidance we gave for fiscal year 2016 was about a $30 million to $35 million range or 20% of the $150 million to $175 million. So that is largely to come between the Q3 and Q4 quarters, and we would anticipate that the realization of those synergies over those quarters would be somewhat proportionate to the size of those quarters. The breakdown of what we're seeing at this point in time within the quarter is primarily been a lot of the benefits are coming in on the sales and the gross margin side and the initiatives surrounding our trading, targeted promotions, cross-selling on the gross margin side, a lot of the work that the teams have been doing over the merchandise assortment, the discount controls that we talked about, a lot of those are really taking root. Now on the SG&A side, we're not yet quite seeing those benefits there because what we do is making a lot of investments back into the Zale division to kind of support the sales and gross margin initiative. So these investments include what I talked about on the call the advertising, the IT support.

We believe and I said this before that in our business, it's the closest thing that we have asked to a necessity, and that our bridal business continues to grow with enhanced customer service behind the counter, understanding how to connect with the customers as it relates to a bridal sale, which is very unique. We continue to have new and exciting bridal brands that continues to do well with Vera Wang LOVE, and Neil Lane continues to do well, and Tolkowsky continues to do well, and we always testing new bridal assortments both in our branded and in our nonbranded products. And we just believe that the bridal category for us is something that is a journey and that we will not have a ceiling. As it relates to the market, weddings have been pretty constant not growing a, lot and what we're seeing is we believe we're gaining market share, and we believe we're gaining market share both from a unit perspective, but we're also seeing our average selling price of engagement rings going up, and part of that is due to the consumers are getting engaged in an older age, and it's benefiting us in that we're selling a higher average bridal engagement ring, and we think that's continue go into the future."

The other big element as it relates to synergies on the sales side that we had talked about was on the repairs. So that is one that we're still working through that initiative as it relates to our repair sales, which there is a lot of underlying system support that we really need to get that initiative up and running.

First of all, the diamond prices that has been reduced and what's happening in the diamond market is primarily what's happening on the slowdown of what's going on in Asia and the Middle East, and the diamonds that are heavily sold in the Asia and the Middle East are higher-quality diamonds than we sell at Signet. Their VS quality from a GIA terminology and better and our quality of goods is not as a whole we sell but as a whole, we don't sell that higher tier of quality of diamonds. So the opportunities were diamond prices are lowering is really more in the higher-end rough, in the higher-end polished goods. It doesn't mean there may not be an opportunity for us, but for right now it's happening to the diamond market those lower-priced opportunities are in the higher-end price or higher-end quality of goods.

In the second quarter, we delivered strong top line and solid bottom line results, which exceeded guidance. 
Signet comps increased by 4.2%. And adjusted EPS was at $1.28, which was a 19.6% increase over the prior year adjusted EPS. Our success in the second quarter of fiscal 2016 was broad-based, with sales and profit growth coming from virtually all of our store concepts across various geographies with contributions across our selling channels and from several functional areas. 
We continue to outperform our industry driven by our competitive strengths. And importantly, we're increasingly confident about our integration synergies. In addition, we are making excellent progress against each of our VISION 2020 strategic pillars. 
Before I get to the second quarter and what's to come for the back half of the year, I wanted to make a few comments about our space in the jewelry industry. We have a 5-year compounded annual growth rate of 12% in total sales. Signet has been gaining and continues to gain market share profitably. We consistently outperform the jewelry market and the total retail market. And based on results to date, we appear poised to deliver another year of industry outperformance. 
Given the fragmented jewelry industry, we believe we have many years of profitable market share gains ahead of us. Our brands, our scale and our people give us a sustained, competitive advantage. 
Our leading position in the jewelry marketplace has been driven by progress against each of our strategic pillars, specifically in best in bridal, which leads me to review our second quarter sales drivers. 
From a merchandise perspective, diamond jewelry was strong. Bridal, a strategic focus of ours, grew faster than Signet's overall rate of growth, and therefore gained relative share. Bridal brands such as Neil Lane, Vera Wang LOVE and Tolkowsky were standouts as well as our non-branded bridal portfolio. 
Complementing those results has been the continued momentum of Diamonds in Rhythm, Unstoppable Love and our solitaire diamond earrings programs. The great work of Signet's collective teams around discount controls, commodity pricing and product design over the past year is now manifesting itself in our financial results, helping to drive not only higher sales and great value, but also higher profitabilities and synergies. 
We're also pleased to report that our marketing test initiatives are doing well, and results are encouraging. What we are learning is that our radio and print spend work well outside the times when we're on television. This strengthens the continuity of our brands in the minds of our customers. We will continue to closely monitor our marketing spend as we move into the fourth quarter. 
Our key store operation performance indicator improved in the second quarter also. Our store teams are benefiting from longer, more focused district manager store visits. 
So in summary, we're executing throughout the organization, and it all shows in our financial results. Not only do we have good momentum coming out of a very productive second quarter, but we also have a variety of new catalysts to drive our business into the second half of the year. 
Among our merchandise initiative, we are excited about our Miracle Links, which is the perfect pendant for new moms symbolizing the birth of a new child. We're also proud to announce a new partnership with ALEX AND ANI, which we'll test in 108 Jared stores beginning in mid-September. ALEX AND ANI is a leading-edge, trend-right fashion collection that is very popular with the millenials and a natural traffic driver. 
We also have the Chosen Diamond, which is a program that will test in 60 Jared stores this fall, and is expected to resonate with the sentimentalist customer that Jared attracts. It provides documentation from rough to finish polished diamond, so customers know the steps of their own diamond's journey. 
Vera Wang LOVE continues to do very well in our sales stores. The cross-selling effort test is so well in Jared that Vera Wang LOVE will now roll out to all Jared stores this fall. 
We also will be one of select jewelers who will sell Star Wars fine jewelry and beads this holiday season, which will be sold in our Kay stores. And in late October, we intend to launch a new must-have jewelry product that we first referenced at our Investor Conference in June. This collection will be -- which will be in all of our national store brands in the United States, the United Kingdom and in Canada, will be supported with one of our most comprehensive marketing programs in the history of our company. 
And speaking of marketing, we'll apply many of our recent customer segmentation learnings. For instance, Zales will have a new TV creative campaign with higher media weights called Diamond Kind of Love, which has tested very, very well. 
Kay marketing will be focused and classic to resonate with the gifter customer profile, and Jared will begin running semiannual special events to launch new products and in order to stay relevant with select customers, who seek value opportunities. 
We'll also test a new store design for Zales and for Piercing Pagoda, and we'll continue growing the latest concepts in store design for Kay. Again, all of these designs are aligned with our segmentation learnings. 
And we'll continue to drive custom jewelry with a new jewelry technology for custom in our Zales stores. These are just some of the many catalysts that we are investing in throughout Signet, and we are just getting started. And there are many, many more to come. 
So on my final slide, I want to take a minute to reiterate a few important points about our favorable position in the jewelry space. Our people are getting ready for the busy fourth quarter selling season. 
We have just completed successful district manager meetings in preparation for our managers' leadership conferences. Our confident preparations are nearly complete, and there's great excitement around this year's agendas and this year's exciting initiatives that will be driving home to our field operation organization. 
Our pipeline of merchandises tested in full. We have a variety of line extensions and new programs designed to be fresh, exciting, consistent with our strategy and relevant with our core customers in each of their shopping locations. 
The merchandise fall will be supported with new marketing creative that has been placed extremely thoughtfully to maximize its impact. And all of this is culminated to generate momentum behind our business, as our same-store sales improved throughout the quarter. 
In closing, our business is strong. And this was also recognized by Standard & Poor's as Signet was added to the S&P 500 during the second quarter, which is a great honor to us to be added to this iconic index. I am extremely confident in Signet's prospects for the near term, the medium term and the long term. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Michele for a run-through on our financials."

So let's start with our second quarter sales performance. Signet's total sales increased 15.1%, and comps increased 4.2% above our guided comp range of 2% to 3%. So let me share with you some additional color",2256,"Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. So let's start with our second quarter sales performance. 
Signet's total sales increased 15.1%, and comps increased 4.2% above our guided comp range of 2% to 3%. So let me share with you some additional color on our sales and comp performance by division. 
So in our Sterling division, total sales increased 5.9% to $858.5 million, which included a same-store sales increase of 3.3%. Sales increases were broad-based across store banners, product brands and non-brands as well as omni-channel. Bridal and diamond jewelry also were particularly strong. 
The average transaction price in Sterling increased by 4.2%, and the number of transactions decreased by 2.5% due to merchandise mix. Our Zale division total sales were $389.3 million for the quarter, which included a same-store sales increase of 5.8%. We saw particular strength in branded bridal and branded diamond fashion. 
Sales increases were also favorably impacted by our continued integration initiatives around sales associate training, targeted promotional events and new marketing creative. Also, keep in mind that the prior-year quarter had 26 fewer days due to the acquisition occurring on May 29, 2014. 
In our U.K. division, total sales decreased 2.3%, but increased 6.4% on a constant exchange basis. Sales were $159.1 million with a comp sales increase of 5.1%, and that was driven primarily by Ernest Jones. Both U.K. store concepts reflected strong results in bridal and watches. The average transaction price increased 4.3%, and the number of transactions also increased by 1.8% driven by merchandise mix. 
As mentioned in our earnings release this morning, the second quarter comp sales were favorably impacted by 60 basis points associated with an operational change that we made to align Sterling's extended service plans, or ESPs, with Zales, and which we viewed Zales as having a best practice related to the extended service plans. This operational change that related to ring sizing triggered a change in the revenue and expense recognition rates associated with our ESPs. 
So previously, in the Sterling division, the cost of ring sizing for customers who had purchased an ESP were not included as part of the extended service plan claim. So now since this alignment, the cost for ring sizing for customers who purchased an ESP are included in claims costs. 
For those customers who elect not to purchase an ESP and need ring sizing, a nominal fee is charged for this service. So the net impact is that more sales and profit are now recognized earlier within the Sterling division ESP sale, and this change is entirely noncash. 
So again, this operational change is just another example of Signet sharing best practices across the organization. Excluding the impact of the ESP change, Signet's comp sales would have been 3.6%, 60 basis points above the high end of our guidance. 
So moving on from sales. Let me walk you through Signet's consolidated Q2 performance before we turn and analyze Signet's adjusted results. 
The table you see on Slide 9 provides a reconciliation of Signet's adjusted results to consolidated results. Now the difference between adjusted Signet and Signet are the columns reflected purchase accounting and transaction costs, which include our integration-related expenses. 
So starting on the right side of the slide on a GAAP basis, EPS was $0.78 per share, and that was lower than our guidance due to the legal settlement of $34.2 million related to the Zale acquisition appraisal rights matter. This settlement is recorded within transaction costs as SG&A. And the settlement finalizes the appraisal litigation, and no further cost associated with this litigation are expected to be incurred. 
The next column over reflects our transaction costs. Transaction costs were responsible for $0.46 of EPS dilution, and that's inclusive of a $0.39 impact from the appraisal settlement we just spoke of. Purchase accounting adjustments, which reflect a reduction to deferred revenue, amortization related to the inventory fair value step-up and amortization of unfavorable contracts, were dilutive to EPS by $0.04. 
On an adjusted Signet basis, the far-most left column on the slide, EPS was $1.28, higher than our guidance of $1.11 to $1.16. Now we'll discuss our adjusted results in more detail momentarily. But first, let's turn and look at our operating income by division. 
So our second fiscal 2016 operating income was $100.8 million or 7.2% of sales, reflecting a 20.7% increase over prior year, and that also reflects a 40-basis-point increase in operating margin rate. Components of operating income consisted of the following. Sterling Jewelers was $157.8 million or 18.4% of division of sales, reflecting a 21.5% increase over prior year. And that was up 240 basis points in rate from last year. 
Zale operating loss was $2.1 million or 0.5% of division sales, and that's inclusive of purchase accounting adjustments. Zale's performance consisted of a $2 million loss from the Zale Jewelry operating segment and a $0.1 million loss from the Piercing Pagoda operating segment. Now excluding this adjustment, and you'll see this in a moment on Slide 11, the Zale division operating profit was $3 million or 0.7% of adjusted division sales. 
Our U.K. operating profit was $3.2 million or 2% of division sales, and that's up 130 basis points from last year. 
Other, which primarily consists of our corporate and administrative expenses and Signet's diamond sourcing subsidiaries, includes $43.6 million of transaction costs, which also includes the $34.2 million related to the appraisal settlement. 
So now this is the last quarter that we will show the detail of the Zale operations. Next quarter, we will provide Zale details that are consistent with our other divisional disclosures as we will have fully comped the acquisition. 
So the presentation on Slide 11 takes adjusted Signet, which is shown on the far right, and then breaks it into 2 parts. One part is Zale operations, which is shown in the middle column, and the second part in the left-hand column is adjusted Signet, excluding Zale. Adjusted Signet, excluding Zale, is the rest of Signet and inclusive of finance interest and taxes. So from sales to operating income, this gives you comparability to prior-year results. In addition, the information is provided to give you visibility as to how the Zale operations performed in the second quarter. And again, I would just remind you that the prior-year Q2 had 26 fewer days as the acquisition occurred on May 29, 2014. 
So continuing on, let's look at Signet's adjusted P&L results below the sales line. Adjusted gross margin was $500.1 million or 35.3% of adjusted sales, and that was up 100 basis points driven principally by higher sales, favorable commodity cost and merchandise synergy initiatives in the Zale division. Excluding the Zale division, the adjusted Signet gross margin rate would have been 35.7%. And that's up 90 basis points, principally driven by favorable commodity cost and partially offset by net bad debt due to higher credit sales in the Sterling division. 
Adjusted SG&A was $413.4 million or 29.2% of adjusted sales, up 80 basis points due to the incremental investment in Zale, principally surrounding advertising, information technology support and employee benefits. So excluding Zale, the adjusted SG&A rate was 27.5%, favorable by 10 basis points over last year. This was driven by store payroll leverage and nearly offset by higher central costs, primarily related to legal fees associated with the appraisal settlement. 
These legal fees associated with the appraisal litigation will no longer be incurred on a going-forward basis. Other operating income was $62.8 million. This increase of $9.1 million was due principally to higher interest income earned from higher outstanding receivable balances. 
Adjusted operating income of $149.5 million or 10.5% of sales reflects an 18.8% increase and up 30 basis points in rate. This growth was driven primarily by the increase in sales and gross margin. 
Importantly, excluding the Zale division, the adjusted Signet operating margin rate would have been 14.4%, leveraging off 170 basis points. This result shows the operating leverage inherent in our business model. 
Adjusted EPS was $1.28 compared to $1.07 last year, an increase of 19.6% driven by stronger-than-expected business performance, a lower tax rate and operational change associated with the extended service plans that I discussed earlier. The impact from the extended service plans change was $0.05 on adjusted EPS in the quarter. 
We repurchased $60 million of Signet's stock in the second quarter, and that's in line with our capital allocation plan. At the end of the second quarter, there was $183.7 million remaining under Signet's 2013 share repurchase authorization program. 
So now let's move on to the balance sheet, and we're going to first start with inventory. Net inventory ended the year at $2.4 billion, an increase of $68.9 million. This 2.9% increase over last year was driven primarily by, first, new store growth; secondly, our diamond sourcing initiative. 
We continue to become more vertically integrated by procuring more rough diamonds to meet the needs of all of our divisions and to support our strategic initiative to be best in bridal. And finally, those factors were offset in part by strategic initiatives to increase Zale inventory turns. 
Through focus on eliminating slower turning SKUs and increasing merchandise that's more relevant to Zale's influence customers, we are making significant strides in streamlining the division's inventory. 
Signet ended the quarter well-positioned in inventory as we move into the third quarter ahead of the holiday selling season. So now we'll turn our attention to our in-house credit metrics and statistics. Net accounts receivable increased to $1.5 billion compared to $1.3 billion last year. And that's up 13.5%, driven by higher sales and an increase in Sterling's division credit penetration rate. 
Year-to-date, credit participation was 61.6% compared to 60% last year. The increase in credit participation was attributed primarily to credit decision engine improvements and strong customer acceptance of our credit offerings. 
The average monthly collection rate was 12% compared to 12.4% due primarily to 3 reasons. First, our customers continue to opt more for our regular credit terms, which do require lower monthly payments compared to the 12-month interest-free program. And second, as our mix of bridal increases due to our best in bridal strategy, this creates a higher average receivable. Our required scheduled payment do not increase proportionally with a higher merchandise mix shift. And third, just like other consumer loans, more principal is paid off later. So as our portfolio has grown more in the last year, proportionately, more of it will be paid later. 
Net bad debt expense for the quarter was $49.5 million, and that compares to $41.8 million last year, an increase of $7.7 million. And that's driven primarily by the growth in receivable balances from the increased credit penetration and the change in the credit program mix. Other operating income was $62.8 million compared to $53.7 million last year. This was an increase of $9.1 million and is due primarily to more interest income on the higher outstanding receivables as well as the shift away from interest-free programs. 
So the net impact of these 2 items was income of $13.3 million compared to $11.9 million in the prior year or an increase of $1.4 million. The portfolio continues to perform strongly as evidenced by the net impact of our bad debt and other operating income. 
The allowance as a percentage of AR of 7.3% increased over last year due to timing. That is, in Q2 last year, accounts receivable grew due to the credit decision engine introduction, but the bad debt that would come with any AR growth lagged. So this created unusually low percentage last year, which we are now lapping. 
So sticking with the subject of credit, just a few comments regarding the third-party credit in our Zale stores. We are really looking forward to transitioning to our new partner, Alliance Data Systems. And this transition is expected to occur around fiscal year-end, which is a change from our original projection of October. 
All the financial and operational virtues of having ADS as our partner remain in place, but will be deferred just a few months due to some administrative issue. We're very pleased that Signet's in-house credit team will be testing a second look credit in late October for Zale stores. Following a successful test, we expect the in-house credit team will fully support all Zale U.S. stores for the holiday selling season. 
So let's move on to the financial guidance for the third quarter. Signet's third quarter comparable store sales are expected to increase 3% to 4%. Third quarter adjusted EPS is expected to be $0.36 to $0.40, which does include a modest favorable impact of $0.03 from the extended service plan revenue recognition change. 
From an effective tax rate standpoint, Signet's fiscal 2016 annual rate is anticipated to be 28% to 29%. Our capital expenditure guidance for the full year remains at $275 million to $325 million, and our net selling square footage is projected to grow approximately 2% to 3%. 
I would also reference you to our news release for further details on how the capital is to be directed. We remain increasingly confident in achieving our synergy targets for FY '16 as well as our 3-year period. 
And as we noted in our Investor Day, we see the long-term potential for Sterling operating margins to reach 19%, Zale to reach 15% and the U.K., 10%. This represents a substantial margin opportunity in our business. We are very pleased with our financial performance in the second quarter. 
And with that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Mark."

So we're really seeing that take root in terms of gross margin. I know Mark and I have previously talked about discount controls. We have that up and running. So besides the commodity pricing, which will definitely take the benefit of that, we're really reaping the reward from our synergy initiative."

We have new products that we've been testing, whether it be the Vera Wang LOVE that we shared with you or the Miracle Links that I shared with you. And in our business, it's always about the people. And our operational team came up with a focused, targeted effort as it relates to in-store customer experience, and they were spending more times in the stores. And lastly, we have tested some targeted promotions that were more targeted to dealing with the customers in Jared. So a combination of all of the above is why we believe that Signet's Jared division is continuing to do well. And we feel pretty good about the Jared business going into the fourth quarter also."

What's made us much more confident in terms of our view of our synergies is we are starting to see those benefits roll in a little bit faster than we had originally anticipated.

And on a net basis, the guidance we gave for fiscal year 2016 was about a $30 million to $35 million range or 20% of the $150 million to $175 million. So that is largely to come between the Q3 and Q4 quarters, and we would anticipate that the realization of those synergies over those quarters would be somewhat proportionate to the size of those quarters. The breakdown of what we're seeing at this point in time within the quarter has primarily been a lot of the benefits are coming in on the sales and the gross margin side and the initiatives surrounding our training, targeted promotions, cross-selling on the gross margin side, a lot of the work that the teams have been doing over the merchandise assortment, the discount controls that we talked about, a lot of those are really taking root. Now on the SG&A side, we're not yet quite seeing those benefits there because what we're doing is making a lot of investments back into the Zale division to kind of support the sales and gross margin initiative. So these investments include what I talked about on the call, the advertising, the IT support. So right now, there's a little bit of a lag between those investments that are sitting in SG&A and when we get the leverage on the sales side coming through."

So particularly as we look at the Vera Wang, a lot of the initiatives we had on the Vera Wang side surrounding our marketing creative, the product assortment, we're seeing a benefit on the Zale side of that. We're also, as Mark had indicated, on the Jared side with the cross-selling, they're rolling that out to all of our stores. So we're definitely well on our way as it relates to the cross-selling synergy goals that we had in place. We expect that, that will continue in terms of our cross-selling initiatives throughout the remainder of the year and going into next year. The other big element as it relates to synergies on the sales side that we had talked about was on the repairs. So that is one that we're still working through that initiative as it relates to our repair sales, which there is a lot of underlying system support that we really need to get that initiative up and running. So there's been a lot of work that we've done to date on that, and I think that's one that you would expect to see probably more so in FY '17."

Rubies and emeralds and sapphires, other semi-precious or precious gems do not have any indication on diamond pricing. They're not interconnected. So let's start with that. So let me give you a little bit of background on what's going on the diamond market. First of all, the diamond prices that has been reduced and what's happening with the diamond market is primarily what's happening on the slowdown of what's going on in Asia and the Middle East. And the diamonds that are heavily sold in the Asia and the Middle East are higher-quality diamonds than we sell at Signet. They're VS quality from a GIA terminology and better. And our quality of goods is not -- as a whole, we sell VS goods. But as a whole, we don't sell that higher tier of quality of diamonds. So the opportunities, where diamond prices are lowering, is really more in the higher-end rough, in the higher-end polished goods. It doesn't mean there may not be an opportunity for us. But for -- right now what's happening in the diamond market, those lower-priced opportunities are in the higher-end price or higher-end quality of goods. Now also remember that we're on a cost-averaging perspective I'm sure Michele will talk about soon. So when and if we see opportunities to increase savings on our diamond purchasing, it takes a while to get through the system. I don't know if you want to talk to that."

In the second quarter, we delivered strong top line and solid bottom line results, which exceeded guidance.  Signet comps increased by 4.2%. And adjusted EPS was at $1.28, which was a 19.6% increase over the prior year adjusted EPS. Our success in the second quarter of fiscal 2016 was broad-based, with sales and profit growth coming from virtually all of our store concepts across various geographies with contributions across our selling channels and from several functional areas.  We continue to outperform our industry driven by our competitive strengths. And importantly, we're increasingly confident about our integration synergies. In addition, we are making excellent progress against each of our VISION 2020 strategic pillars. 
Before I get to the second quarter and what's to come for the back half of the year, I wanted to make a few comments about our space in the jewelry industry. We have a 5-year compounded annual growth rate of 12% in total sales. Signet has been gaining and continues to gain market share profitably. We consistently outperform the jewelry market and the total retail market. And based on results to date, we appear poised to deliver another year of industry outperformance.  Given the fragmented jewelry industry, we believe we have many years of profitable market share gains ahead of us. Our brands, our scale and our people give us a sustained competitive advantage. 
Our leading position in the jewelry marketplace has been driven by progress against each of our strategic pillars, specifically in best in bridal, which leads me to review our second quarter sales drivers.  From a merchandise perspective, diamond jewelry was strong. Bridal, a strategic focus of ours, grew faster than Signet's overall rate of growth, and therefore gained relative share. Bridal brands such as Neil Lane, Vera Wang LOVE and Tolkowsky were standouts as well as our non-branded bridal portfolio. Complementing those results has been the continued momentum of Diamonds in Rhythm, Unstoppable Love and our solitaire diamond earrings programs. The great work of Signet's collective teams around discount controls, commodity pricing and product design over the past year is now manifesting itself in our financial results, helping to drive not only higher sales and great value, but also higher profitabilities and synergies. 
We're also pleased to report that our marketing test initiatives are doing well, and results are encouraging. What we are learning is that our radio and print spend work well outside the times when we're on television. This strengthens the continuity of our brands in the minds of our customers. We will continue to closely monitor our marketing spend as we move into the fourth quarter.  Our key store operation performance indicator improved in the second quarter also. Our store teams are benefiting from longer, more focused district manager store visits.  So in summary, we're executing throughout the organization, and it all shows in our financial results. 
Not only do we have good momentum coming out of a very productive second quarter, but we also have a variety of new catalysts to drive our business into the second half of the year.  Among our merchandise initiative, we are excited about our Miracle Links, which is the perfect pendant for new moms symbolizing the birth of a new child. We're also proud to announce a new partnership with ALEX AND ANI, which we'll test in 108 Jared stores beginning in mid-September. ALEX AND ANI is a leading-edge, trend-right fashion collection that is very popular with the millennials and a natural traffic driver.  We also have the Chosen Diamond, which is a program that will test in 60 Jared stores this fall, and is expected to resonate with the sentimentalist customer that Jared attracts. It provides documentation from rough to finish polished diamond, so customers know the steps of their own diamond's journey. 
Vera Wang LOVE continues to do very well in our sales stores. The cross-selling effort tested so well in Jared that Vera Wang LOVE will now roll out to all Jared stores this fall.  We also will be one of select jewelers who will sell Star Wars fine jewelry and beads this holiday season, which will be sold in our Kay stores. And in late October, we intend to launch a new must-have jewelry product that we first referenced at our Investor Conference in June. This collection will be -- which will be in all of our national store banners in the United States, the United Kingdom and in Canada, will be supported with one of our most comprehensive marketing programs in the history of our company. 
And speaking of marketing, we'll apply many of our recent customer segmentation learnings. For instance, Zales will have a new TV creative campaign with higher media weights called Diamond Kind of Love, which has tested very, very well.  Kay marketing will be focused in classic to resonate with the gifter customer profile, and Jared will begin running semiannual special events to launch new products and in order to stay relevant with select customers, who seek value opportunities.  We'll also test a new store design for Zales and for Piercing Pagoda, and we'll continue growing the latest concepts in store design for Kay. Again, all of these designs are aligned with our segmentation learnings.  And we'll continue to drive custom jewelry with a new jewelry technology for custom in our Zales stores. These are just some of the many catalysts that we are investing in throughout Signet, and we are just getting started. And there are many, many more to come. 
So on my final slide, I want to take a minute to reiterate a few important points about our favorable position in the jewelry space. Our people are getting ready for the busy fourth quarter selling season.  We have just completed successful district manager meetings in preparation for our managers' leadership conferences. Our counter preparations are nearly complete, and there's great excitement around this year's agendas and this year's exciting new initiatives that will be driving home to our field operation organization. 
Our pipeline of merchandise is tested in full. We have a variety of line extensions and new programs designed to be fresh, exciting, consistent with our strategy and relevant with our core customers at each of their shopping locations. The merchant this fall will be supported with new marketing creative that has been placed extremely thoughtfully to maximize its impact. And all of this is culminated to generate momentum behind our business, as our same-store sales improved throughout the quarter. 
In closing, our business is strong. And this was also recognized by Standard & Poor's as Signet was added to the S&P 500 during the second quarter, which is a great honor to us to be added to this iconic index. I am extremely confident in Signet's prospects for the near term, the medium term and the long term. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Michele for a run-through on our financials."
693964,308671565,862941,"Signet Jewelers Limited, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 27, 2015",2015-08-27,"Earnings Calls","Signet Jewelers Limited","Executives","Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. So let's start with our second quarter sales performance. Signet's total sales increased 15.1%, and comps increased 4.2%, above our guided comp range of 2% to 3%. So let me share with you some additional color",2259,"Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. So let's start with our second quarter sales performance. Signet's total sales increased 15.1%, and comps increased 4.2%, above our guided comp range of 2% to 3%. So let me share with you some additional color on our sales and comp performance by division. 
So in our Sterling division, total sales increased 5.9% to $858.5 million, which included a same-store sales increase of 3.3%. Sales increases were broad-based across store banners, product brands and non-brands as well as omni-channel. Bridal and diamond jewelry also were particularly strong.  The average transaction price in Sterling increased by 4.2%, and the number of transactions decreased by 2.5% due to merchandise mix. Our Zales division total sales were $389.3 million for the quarter, which included a same-store sales increase of 5.8%. We saw particular strength in branded bridal and branded diamond fashion. Sales increases were also favorably impacted by our continued integration initiatives around sales associate training, targeted promotional events and new marketing creative. Also, keep in mind that the prior-year quarter had 26 fewer days due to the acquisition occurring on May 29, 2014. 
In our U.K. division, total sales decreased 2.3%, but increased 6.4% on a constant exchange basis. Sales were $159.1 million with a comp sales increase of 5.1%, and that was driven primarily by Ernest Jones. Both U.K. store concepts reflected strong results in bridal and watches. The average transaction price increased 4.3%, and the number of transactions also increased by 1.8% driven by merchandise mix. 
As mentioned in our earnings release this morning, the second quarter comp sales were favorably impacted by 60 basis points associated with an operational change that we made to align Sterling's extended service plans, or ESPs, with Zales, and which we viewed Zales as having a best practice related to the extended service plans. This operational change that related to ring sizing triggered a change in the revenue and expense recognition rates associated with our ESPs. 
So previously, in the Sterling division, the cost of ring sizing for customers who had purchased an ESP were not included as part of the extended service plan claim. So now since this alignment, the cost for ring sizing for customers who purchased an ESP are included in claims costs. For those customers who elect not to purchase an ESP and need ring sizing, a nominal fee is charged for this service. So the net impact is that more sales and profit are now recognized earlier within the Sterling division ESP sale, and this change is entirely noncash. So again, this operational change is just another example of Signet sharing best practices across the organization. Excluding the impact of this ESP change, Signet's comp sales would have been 3.6%, 60 basis points above the high end of our guidance. 
So moving on from sales. Let me walk you through Signet's consolidated Q2 performance before we turn and analyze Signet's adjusted results. The table you see on Slide 9 provides a reconciliation of Signet's adjusted results to consolidated results. Now the difference between adjusted Signet and Signet are the columns reflected purchase accounting and transaction costs, which include our integration-related expenses.  So starting on the right side of the slide on a GAAP basis, EPS was $0.78 per share, and that was lower than our guidance due to the legal settlement of $34.2 million related to the Zale acquisition appraisal rights matter. This settlement is recorded within transaction costs as SG&A. And the settlement finalizes the appraisal litigation, and no further costs associated with this litigation are expected to be incurred. 
The next column over reflects our transaction costs. Transaction costs were responsible for $0.46 of EPS dilution, and that's inclusive of a $0.39 impact from the appraisal settlement we just spoke of. Purchase accounting adjustments, which reflect a reduction to deferred revenue, amortization related to the inventory fair value step-up and amortization of unfavorable contracts, were dilutive to EPS by $0.04. On an adjusted Signet basis, the far-most left column on the slide, EPS was $1.28, higher than our guidance of $1.11 to $1.16. 
Now we'll discuss our adjusted results in more detail momentarily. But first, let's turn and look at our operating income by division. So our second quarter fiscal 2016 operating income was $100.8 million or 7.2% of sales, reflecting a 20.7% increase over prior year, and that also reflects a 40-basis-point increase in operating margin rate. Components of operating income consisted of the following: Sterling Jewelers was $157.8 million or 18.4% of division of sales, reflecting a 21.5% increase over prior year, and that was up 240 basis points in rate from last year; Zale operating loss was $2.1 million or 0.5% of division sales, and that's inclusive of purchase accounting adjustments. Zale's performance consisted of a $2 million loss from the Zales Jewelry operating segment and a $0.1 million loss from the Piercing Pagoda operating segment. Now excluding these adjustments, and you'll see this in a moment on Slide 11, the Zale division operating profit was $3 million or 0.7% of adjusted division sales.  Our U.K. operating profit was $3.2 million or 2% of division sales, and that's up 130 basis points from last year.  Other, which primarily consists of our corporate and administrative expenses and Signet's diamond sourcing subsidiaries, includes $43.6 million of transaction costs, which also includes the $34.2 million related to the appraisal settlement. 
So now this is the last quarter that we will show the detail of the Zale operations. Next quarter, we will provide Zale details that are consistent with our other divisional disclosures as we will have fully comped the acquisition.  So the presentation on Slide 11 takes adjusted Signet, which is shown on the far right, and then breaks it into 2 parts. One part is Zale operations, which is shown in the middle column, and the second part in the left-hand column is adjusted Signet, excluding Zale. Adjusted Signet, excluding Zale, is the rest of Signet and inclusive of finance interest and taxes. So from sales to operating income, this gives you comparability to prior-year results. In addition, the information is provided to give you visibility as to how the Zale operations performed in the second quarter. And again, I would just remind you that the prior-year Q2 had 26 fewer days as the acquisition occurred on May 29 of 2014. 
So continuing on, let's look at Signet's adjusted P&L results below the sales line. Adjusted gross margin was $500.1 million or 35.3% of adjusted sales, and that was up 100 basis points driven principally by higher sales, favorable commodity cost and merchandise synergy initiatives in the Zale division. Excluding the Zale division, the adjusted Signet gross margin rate would have been 35.7%. And that's up 90 basis points, principally driven by favorable commodity cost and partially offset by net bad debt due to higher credit sales in the Sterling division. 
Adjusted SG&A was $413.4 million or 29.2% of adjusted sales, up 80 basis points due to the incremental investment in Zale, principally surrounding advertising, information technology support and employee benefits. So excluding Zale, the adjusted SG&A rate was 27.5%, favorable by 10 basis points over last year. This was driven by store payroll leverage and nearly offset by higher central costs, primarily related to legal fees associated with the appraisal settlement. These legal fees associated with the appraisal litigation will no longer be incurred on a going-forward basis. 
Other operating income was $62.8 million. This increase of $9.1 million was due principally to higher interest income earned from higher outstanding receivable balances. Adjusted operating income of $149.5 million or 10.5% of sales reflects an 18.8% increase and up 30 basis points in rate. This growth was driven primarily by the increase in sales and gross margin. Importantly, excluding the Zale division, the adjusted Signet operating margin rate would have been 14.4%, leveraging up 170 basis points. This result shows the operating leverage inherent in our business model. 
Adjusted EPS was $1.28 compared to $1.07 last year, an increase of 19.6% driven by stronger-than-expected business performance, a lower tax rate and operational change associated with the extended service plans that I discussed earlier. The impact from the extended service plans change was $0.05 on adjusted EPS in the quarter. We repurchased $60 million of Signet's stock in the second quarter, and that's in line with our capital allocation plan. At the end of the second quarter, there was $183.7 million remaining under Signet's 2013 share repurchase authorization program. 
So now let's move on to the balance sheet, and we're going to first start with inventory. Net inventory ended the year at $2.4 billion, an increase of $68.9 million. This 2.9% increase over last year was driven primarily by, first, new store growth; secondly, our diamond sourcing initiative. We continue to become more vertically integrated by procuring more rough diamonds to meet the needs of all of our divisions and to support our strategic initiative to be best in bridal. And finally, those factors were offset in part by strategic initiatives to increase Zale inventory turns. Through focus on eliminating slower turning SKUs and increasing merchandise that's more relevant to Zale's influence customers, we are making significant strides in streamlining the division's inventory. Signet ended the quarter well-positioned in inventory as we move into the third quarter ahead of the holiday selling season. 
So now let's turn our attention to our in-house credit metrics and statistics. Net accounts receivable increased to $1.5 billion compared to $1.3 billion last year. And that's up 13.5%, driven by higher sales and an increase in Sterling's division credit penetration rate. Year-to-date, credit participation was 61.6% compared to 60% last year. The increase in credit participation was attributed primarily to credit decision engine improvements and strong customer acceptance of our credit offerings. 
The average monthly collection rate was 12% compared to 12.4%, due primarily to 3 reasons. First, our customers continue to opt more for our regular credit terms, which do require lower monthly payments compared to the 12-month interest-free program. And second, as our mix of bridal increases due to our best in bridal strategy, this creates a higher average receivable. Our required scheduled payments do not increase proportionally with a higher merchandise mix shift. And third, just like other consumer loans, more principal is paid off later. So as our portfolio has grown more in the last year, proportionately, more of it will be paid later. 
Net bad debt expense for the quarter was $49.5 million, and that compares to $41.8 million last year, an increase of $7.7 million. And that's driven primarily by the growth in receivable balances from the increased credit penetration and the change in the credit program mix. Other operating income was $62.8 million compared to $53.7 million last year. This was an increase of $9.1 million and is due primarily to more interest income on the higher outstanding receivables as well as the shift away from interest-free programs. So the net impact of these 2 items was income of $13.3 million compared to $11.9 million in the prior year or an increase of $1.4 million. The portfolio continues to perform strongly as evidenced by the net impact of our bad debt and other operating income.  The allowance as a percentage of AR of 7.3% increased over last year due to timing. That is, in Q2 last year, accounts receivable grew due to the credit decision engine introduction, but the bad debt that would come with any AR growth lagged. So this created an unusually low percentage last year, which we are now lapping. 
So sticking with the subject of credit, just a few comments regarding the third-party credit in our Zales stores. We are really looking forward to transitioning to our new partner, Alliance Data Systems. And this transition is expected to occur around fiscal year-end, which is a change from our original projection of October.  All the financial and operational virtues of having ADS as our partner remain in place, but will be deferred just a few months due to some administrative issues. We're very pleased that Signet's in-house credit team will be testing a second look credit in late October for Zales stores. Following a successful test, we expect the in-house credit team will fully support all Zale U.S. stores for the holiday selling season. 
So let's move on to the financial guidance for the third quarter. Signet's third quarter comparable store sales are expected to increase 3% to 4%. Third quarter adjusted EPS is expected to be $0.36 to $0.40, which does include a modest favorable impact of $0.03 from the extended service plan revenue recognition change. From an effective tax rate standpoint, Signet's fiscal 2016 annual rate is anticipated to be 28% to 29%. Our capital expenditure guidance for the full year remains at $275 million to $325 million, and our net selling square footage is projected to grow approximately 2% to 3%. I would also reference you to our news release for further details on how the capital is to be directed. 
We remain increasingly confident in achieving our synergy targets for FY '16 as well as our 3-year period. And as we noted in our Investor Day, we see the long-term potential for Sterling operating margins to reach 19%, Zales to reach 15% and the U.K., 10%. This represents a substantial margin opportunity in our business. We are very pleased with our financial performance in the second quarter. 
And with that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Mark."

But what I would tell you is that we expect that we'll continue to see a benefit from the lower commodity prices rolling into our gross margin rate. The other thing I would just add to that is remember that we are on an average cost method, so benefits don't always immediately drop to the P&L. But what we're seeing with this longer, sustained goal, particularly as it relates to the goal of commodity costs, we could continue to expect to see benefits coming in from commodity pricing. The other thing I would just add real quick on that, Oliver, is when you look at -- and this was really exciting for us when you look at our gross margin, particularly on the Zale side, we're also being impacted by all the great synergy initiatives that we have been and the teams have been working so hard on. So we're really seeing that take root in terms of gross margin. I know Mark and I have previously talked about discount controls. We have that up and running.

First of all, we're very happy with the momentum of our Jared business. As good retail merchants do, we investigated everything that was going on in our Jared business as we do with all of our business, and we're able to test certain different programs. As we stated in the last call, we tested new radio marketing vehicle. It seems to be doing well, as I mentioned in my prepared comments. We have new products that we've been testing, whether it be the Vera Wang LOVE that we shared with you or the Miracle Links that I shared with you. And in our business, it's always about the people. And our operational team came up with a focused, targeted effort as it relates to in-store customer experience, and they were spending more times in the stores. And lastly, we have tested some targeted promotions that were more targeted to dealing with the customers in Jared. So a combination of all of the above is why we believe that Signet's Jared division is continuing to do well. And we feel pretty good about the Jared business going into the fourth quarter also."

We're excited about the opportunities of our team members to work with ALEX AND ANI, and we're looking forward to seeing some new millennial customers walking on the door looking for this fashionable product.

What's made us much more confident in terms of our view of our synergies is we are starting to see those benefits roll in a little bit faster than we had originally anticipated. It's still overall I'd say relatively immaterial to the quarter as a whole. And on a net basis, the guidance we gave for fiscal year 2016 was about a $30 million to $35 million range or 20% of the $150 million to $175 million. So that is largely to come between the Q3 and Q4 quarters, and we would anticipate that the realization of those synergies over those quarters would be somewhat proportionate to the size of those quarters. The breakdown of what we're seeing at this point in time within the quarter has primarily been a lot of the benefits are coming in on the sales and the gross margin side and the initiatives surrounding our training, targeted promotions, cross-selling on the gross margin side, a lot of the work that the teams have been doing over the merchandise assortment, the discount controls that we talked about, a lot of those are really taking root. Now on the SG&A side, we're not yet quite seeing those benefits there because what we're doing is making a lot of investments back into the Zale division to kind of support the sales and gross margin initiative. So these investments include what I talked about on the call, the advertising, the IT support. So right now, there's a little bit of a lag between those investments that are sitting in SG&A and when we get the leverage on the sales side coming through."

So maybe are you a little bit more optimistic in terms of the pace of the improvement in the Zales margins versus June?"

I also was wondering about the platform launch for October, what the ASP and margin profile of that, I believe it's a fashion jewelry launch. But I'm wondering if it would carry higher ASPs and margins that could potentially help benefit the P&L more than we are expecting at this time. And lastly, Michele, on the commodity pricing, we're seeing gold pricing being pretty soft on a go-forward basis. So I'm wondering if that should provide some favorable input pricing for you next year in terms of gross margin gains."

Rubies and emeralds and sapphires, other semi-precious or precious gems do not have any indication on diamond pricing. They're not interconnected. So let's start with that. So let me give you a little bit of background on what's going on in the diamond market. First of all, the diamond prices that has been reduced and what's happening with the diamond market is primarily what's happening on the slowdown of what's going on in Asia and the Middle East. And the diamonds that are heavily sold in the Asia and the Middle East are higher-quality diamonds than we sell at Signet. They're VS quality from a GIA terminology and better. And our quality of goods is not -- as a whole, we sell VS goods. But as a whole, we don't sell that higher tier of quality of diamonds. So the opportunities, where diamond prices are lowering, is really more in the higher-end rough and the higher-end polished goods. Doesn't mean there may not be an opportunity for us. But for right now what's happening in the diamond market, those lower-priced opportunities are in the higher-end price or higher-end quality of goods. Now also remember that we're on a cost-averaging perspective I'm sure Michele will talk about soon. So when and if we see opportunities to increase savings on our diamond purchasing, it takes a while to get through the system. I don't know if you want to talk to that."

When you think about our averaging cost method, we don't immediately recognize the benefits of lower commodity pricing. It also works inversely the same.

There are 4-key messages that I want you to take",1698,"Thanks, James, and good morning, everyone. In the third quarter  Signet comps and total sales both increased by 3.3%. Adjusted EPS was at $0.33 a share, a 57.1% increase over the prior year's adjusted EPS. There are 4-key messages that I want you to take away from our results and our guidance. First, in what has been a choppy retail environment for most, we were able to deliver same-store sales growth in line with our guidance; our total sales increase, which came from all selling channels were driven primarily by branded bridal sales across all of our store as well as strong growth overall from K Jewelers, Ernest Jones and Piercing Pagoda. 
We also continued to outperform our industry according to latest U.S. government and British Retail Consortium data. This was driven by a multitude of strength that separate us from our competition, such as advertising, driving jewelry trends, branding and much more. Second, we made significant investments a store operations, systems and training during the third quarter in order to be in the best possible position for the fourth quarter and those investments are starting to pay off. 
While our sales results in the aggregate were in line with our expectations, we saw some softness during sales. This was the result of very specific systems investments, personal changes and training that we implemented in the quarter. I will elaborate on these changes later in the call, but suffice it to say, that this is lot of change to implement in a short period of time. We thought it was appropriate to push through these changes and investment in our smallest quarter in order to prepare us for our biggest quarter and into the future. The third point I want you to take away is that these investments are paying off and we're seeing solid sales results across our thus far in the quarter, particularly at Jared and Zales. One specific bright spot is sales from our newest must-have collection,  Ever Us, which was launched on October 15th and have exceeded our expectations of thus far. We are confident heading into the holiday given the strength of our business and the results to date as evidenced by our guidance for accelerating same-store sales growth of 3.5% to 5% in the fourth quarter. 
The fourth point is our topline results are translating into strong earnings growth per shares. Our adjusted EPS grew by 57% in the third quarter. The Zales integration continues to go very well. Importantly, we are realizing that synergies from our application integration activities during the third quarter, which in part, helped driving operating margin 190 basis points higher or 90 basis points on an adjusted basis. While we delivered excellent earnings growth overall in the quarter, there was a modest margin impact due to a salesmanship from Jared to Kay, which Michele will elaborate on later. 
Now let's take a look at the sales drivers of the third quarter. Bridal, which is our strategic focus of ours, grew faster than Signet's overall rate of sales. The bridal business is a stable grower and insulates us from some of the volatility that traditional retailers face. Bridal brand, such as Vera Wang LOVE, Neil Lane and the Forever Diamond, which is sold exclusively in our 8 Sterling stores, led the way. Complimenting those results has been the momentum a fashion collection, such as Diamonds in Rhythm and diamond earnings led by the radiant reflection assortment as well as growth in bracelets and a variety of jewelry for the rest. 
Also marketing initiatives in the third quarter did well most notably at Kay. We increased our TV rates and executed successful multimedia campaign around engagement season. We also learnings from our customer segmentation study to our advertising creative, which we believe is starting to resonate with our customer. 
And speaking of Kay, the team had an excellent quarter across all of the selling channels and a wide variety of product collection, including fashion jewelry and watches as well as bridal. 
Piercing Pagoda had a great third quarter, which was driven by gold, piercings, diamonds and religious jewelry. Improvements in training and the newly design kiosk helped results as well. Ernest Jones delivered outstanding results across all channels, driven, principally by diamond and the watch business. These gains, however, were partially offset by the multitude of investments that we made at Jared and Zales. So to elaborate a little, Jared managed a significant amount of change around field operations including coverage and selling process. Zales initiatives included discount control policies, repair process and more. These distracted our people a bit, but it's the appropriate position for our business to prepare us for the important fourth quarter. 
While this was a lot of change to implement in a short period of time, it was important to get it done in our smallest quarter to prepare us for the fourth quarter when we expect to make over half of our adjusted EPS for the year.
Toward the end of the third quarter, we launched Ever Us, our new must-have offering and the biggest product introduction in our company's history. We're about 6 weeks into it and Ever  -- Ever Us is off to a strong start. 
To review, Ever Us is Signet's effort to jumpstart innovation in our industry. It was led by our New York design office. Identified the need in the jewelry industry and develop to start a collection, which is been consistently marketed and tagged with all of our store banners in the markets that we serve. The 2-stone diamond ring, which is positioned to be we for one's best friend and true love, serves a variety of give-to-me occasions in the lives of couples. 
Ever Us sales are greater than our expectations at this point. And what's most exciting is the longer term strategic potential of a program like this. For now Ever Us comes in one-ring style and 5  different carat ways, but we anticipate extending the benefit tail driven by product line extensions into maybe different line designs, earrings and pendants and omni-channel opportunities. As a matter of  fact, Ever Us has already established a strong online presence. 
Part of the power of Ever Us is that it's being purchased for a wide variety of occasions. We're hearing stories from our store teams thast customers are purchasing Ever Us for Anniversaries, for birthdays, special mother-and-daughter events and even for self purchase. Needless to say, we are very excited to see our Ever Us received by our customers' in the fourth quarter. 
Now that we are done with the third quarter and which made significant progress around implement initial phases of select systems, testing products and refining selling techniques, we are locked and loaded for the fourth quarter. So let's take a closer look at some of the initiatives going on. 
In merchandising, as I mentioned, we are very optimistic about Ever Us. Vera Wang LOVE continues to do well in all of our selling channels globally. The cross-selling effort tested so well in Jared that is now fully roled out every Jared store. The Star Wars collection of beads as well as Men's and Women's jewelry is off to an excellent start in Kay stores. Miracle Links has expanded to all Jared stores in about 500 Kay stores, and it's the perfect gift for new moms symbolizing the birth of a child. 
In marketing, we have greater advertising rates and more impressions than last year across all of our store brands. We have applied many of our recent customer segmentation learning to our new campaigns. Our new TV ads are available to view at signetjewelers.com on our Media Center page. 
Jared ran its first and very successful sales event billed The Light Up the Holidays earlier this month, and Zales has 1 incremental preferred customer event this quarter also. 
In field operations, the investment that we've made in third quarter and Zales around training, systems and process for a peer, discount controls and custom jewelry are in early stage deployment. And Jared has made some improvements to its selling techniques, coverage and Customer Relationship Management. Our field operations team are highly motivated and ready to execute this holiday season. The testing of our in-house credit group offer credit in Zales as a third month quickly moved from a test in mid-October to full rollout here in the fourth quarter. And we know that our customers heavily rely on our online platform to learn about jewelry, compare products when they purchase online or when they purchase in store. We are aggressively implementing changes that enhance the omni-channel experience and drive online and in-store sales. Led by our duly promoted Signet's Senior Vice President, Julian Surely, mobile navigation and search has been dramatically improved. It is also greater personalization and targeted digital marketing, which has elevated the efficiency and effectiveness of our omni-channel approach to selling. 
There has been more going on in this company in recent months than I can recall in my long history here at Signet. Third quarter is the time to train and plan for new initiatives. And now with the fourth quarter under way and distraction to our stores members minimize, we are excited about all the new initiatives that they will deliver. 
So to sum up the third quarter, Signet delivered solid sales, net synergies, operating margin expansion, significant adjusted EPS growth and completed the fourth quarter preparations effectively. We are loaded with initiatives in the fourth quarter in all the critical areas of our business, including merchandising, marketing, store operations and credit. These initiatives are already paying off as evidenced by our results to date and our expectations for accelerating same-store sales of 3.5% to 5% in the fourth quarter. And we are simultaneously delivering consistent strong sales and earnings growth, achieving synergy goals, executing transformative initiative that will facilitate long-term profitable growth, and we're making the share purchases that we committed to as part of our capital allocation plan. We are very confident and excited about our fourth quarter and long-term opportunities. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Michele for a walk through on the financials."

All right. So let's begin with our third quarter sales performance. Signet total sales and comps each increased 3.3%, and on a constant exchange basis, total sales increased 4.9%. Let me add some additional col",1625,"Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. All right. So let's begin with our third quarter sales performance. Signet total sales and comps each increased 3.3%, and on a constant exchange basis, total sales increased 4.9%. Let me add some additional color on our total sales and comp performance by division. 
Starting with our Sterling division. Total sales increased 5.9% to $733.5 million, which included a comp increase of 3.5%. Sales increased primarily due to branded bridal and select diamond jewelry, most notably at Kay. This was partially offset by a comp decline at Jared. The average transaction price in Sterling increased by 3% and the number of transactions decreased by 0.7% due to merchandise mixed shift in favor of branded bridal. 
Our sales division Q3 total sales decreased by 0.5%, but increased 2.4% on a constant exchange basis. Total sales were $329.9 million, including a same-store sales increase of 2.6%. The average transaction price and number of transactions both increased 1%. 
The Zales jewelry operating segment saw higher transaction growth at 2.9% and a decrease in average transaction value of 1.9% as we improve the sales productivity in fashion jewelry. 
Piercing Pagoda sales were driven by an 11.6% increase in average transaction value, while transaction count remained flat. The higher average transaction value was primarily due to higher gold sales. 
Now in our U.K. division. Total sales decreased 1.1% but increased 4.9% on a constant exchange basis. Total sales were $149.4 million, with a comp sales increase of 4.1%, driven primarily by diamond jewelry and watches, most notably at Earnest Jones. The average transaction price increased 3.4% and the number of transactions increased by 2.3%. 
Now moving on from sales, let's look through Signet's consolidated Q3 performance and then we'll turn and analyze Signet's adjusted results. 
So on Slide 9, the table provide a reconciliation of Signet's adjusted results to consolidated results. The difference between adjusted Signet and Signet are in the columns reflecting purchase accounting and transaction cost, which includes integration-related expenses. Starting on the right side of the slide on a GAAP basis, EPS was $0.19 per share. The next over reflect our transaction cost, which are primarily cost for consultants that are assisting us with the integration. Transaction cost were responsible for $0.11 of EPS dilution. Purchase accounting adjustments, which reflects a reduction to deferred revenue and amortization of unfavorable contracts were diluted to EPS by $0.03. And on an adjusted Signet basis, the foremost left columns, EPS was $0.33. 
So moving on and reviewing Signet's adjusted P&L results below the sales line. Adjusted gross margin was $373.8 million or 30.6% of adjusted sales. This rate was flat to last year as the favorable impact from commodity cost and synergies was entirely offset by the impact of bad debt due to sales mix shift from Jared to Kay. The sourcing impacted the key inputs led by gold was favorable, and we're starting to benefit from new initiatives, principally in Zales, such as discount controls, vendor terms and other growth margin enhancing programs. These factors combined improve the Zales gross margin rate by 120 basis points. 
The Sterling division gross margin declined 90 basis points, driven primarily by the sales mixed shift. This mixed shift had a notable impact on gross margins, given that Q3 is the smallest quarter. I'll discuss further details in a few minutes related to this. 
Our U.K. gross margin increased 70 basis points due primarily to occupancy leverage. Adjusted SG&A was $387.6 million or 31.7% of adjusted sales. This rate was favorable to last year by 40 basis points and was driven by store payroll leverage and partially offset by incremental investments in Zales around advertising, technology support and employee benefits. 
Other operating income was $60.9 million. This increase of $7.4 million was due principally to higher interest income earned from higher outstanding receivable balances. 
Adjusted operating income of $47.1 million or 3.9% of sales reflects a 31.9% increase in dollars and a rate expansion of 90 basis points. This growth was driven by the increase in sales, net synergies and SG&A leverage. The credit mix shift had a notable and partially offsetting impact on operating income because our operating earnings in Q3 are less than 5% of our overall animal operating earnings. So a small shift in credit has a more noticeable impact. Adjusted EPS was $0.33 compared to $0.21 last year, an increase of 57.1%, driven principally by a stronger business performance. 
We repurchased 30 million of Signet's stock in the third quarter and 112 million year-to-date. This is ahead of our capital allocation plan and already within our annual buyback guidance. Nevertheless, we anticipate being in the market in our fiscal fourth quarter. We have a 154 million left on our share repurchase authorization program. 
So let's move on to balance sheet and we'll begin with inventory. So this is a first quarter since the Zales acquisition that we had an apples-to-apples period and our continued focus on optimization of Zales inventory is reflected within our Q3 ending inventory position. Net inventory ended the quarter at $2.7 billion, an increase of 2%. At the end of the third quarter, we had 39 more stores than the previous year, which is what drove the inventory growth. Now this was offset in part by outstanding inventory management across all of our Signet businesses. 
In our Zales division, we ended narrower and deeper in our assortments in which continues to be a strategic objective for us. It's important to note that our total sales increased 3.3%, which is 130 basis points faster than the growth in our total inventory. Coupled with sound inventory management across the rest of our business, this puts us in a good, clean position to start in the fourth quarter. 
So now let's move on to turn our attention to our in-house credit metrics and statistics. Net accounts receivable increased to $1.5 billion compared to $1.3 billion last year and that's up 12.3%, driven by higher sales and an increase in the Sterling division credit penetration rate. Year-to-date, credit participation was 63% compared to 61.7% last year, driven by Kay. Our credit approval standards remained disciplined and unchanged. The higher participation rate was primarily driven by a greater increase of Kay customers compared to our Jared customers. The average monthly collection rate was 11.7% compared to 12.1% due to 2 main reasons: first, as our mixed of bridal increases due to our Best in Bridal strategy, this creates a higher average receivable. By design, the repayment rate is [indiscernible] the price point of the merchandise increases. Bridled at has a higher average credit sales and therefore, the repayment is longer percent this leaves a higher outstanding receivable to be collected. And second, like other consumer loans, more principal is paid off later in the life of the loan. So as our credit portfolio has grown more in the last year, proportionately, more of it will be paid later.
Net bad debt expense for the quarter was $53 million compared to $41.7 million last year. The increase of $11.3 million was driven by higher receivable balances as well as the mix of customers accepting our credit, particularly by store banner. That is just Jared typically has a higher tier credit scoring customer than Kay, but Kay credit sales are growing faster than Jared, resulting in a sales mix shift. Importantly, Signet has not changed its credit standards and our credit portfolio continues to perform well and profitably. 
Other operating income was $60.9 million compared to $53.5 million last year. The increase of $7.4 million was due primarily to more interest income on the higher outstanding receivable base. The net impact of bad debt and other operating income generated operating profit of $7.9 million compared to $11.8 million in the prior year. No changes have been made in our credit standards and the bottom line is that small changes had a more pronounced impact in the third quarter as the third quarter is our smallest quarter, but our credit earnings are earned more evenly throughout the year. This modest shift in mix had a $4.5 million impact in the quarter or about $0.04 to earnings per share. We remain highly disciplined in our approval process and as a result, our credit portfolio continues to be profitable and stable. 
So finally, let's walk through our fourth quarter guidance. Signet's fourth quarter comparable store sales are expected to increase 3.5% to 5%. And as Mark indicated earlier, we are experiencing a strong start to the quarter across all banners based on the number of initiatives that we have put in place. 
Fourth quarter adjusted EPS is expected to be $3.40 to $3.60. Based on the investments we have made and the strong sales results we have seen to date, we are confident in this guidance. From an effective tax rate standpoint, Signet's fiscal 2016 annual rate is anticipated to be about 28% to 29%, and that's both on an adjusted and GAAP basis. 
Capital expenditure guidance for the full year now stands at $260 million to $280 million due primarily to timing. The reduction versus our earlier projection is attributed to a combination of store remodels, Information Technology and facilities that we likely will address before the end of the fiscal year. Net selling square footage is still projected to grow approximately 2% to 3%, and I would reference you to see our news release for details on how the capital is to be directed. We remain highly confident in our achieving our synergy target of $30 million so $35 million for fiscal 2016 as well as our 3-year target of $150 million to $175 million. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Mark."

And so really what we saw in Q3, and I would just draw an analogy the merchandise mix, where product changes might affect rate, but profit is still flowing through the bottom line. So when you think about our Q3, which is really our smallest quarter, and that our credit earnings are more evenly spread throughout the year, it just has a more profound impact on our Q3. So really, that increase is driven by this mix shift that we saw in Q3 we created it's about $0.04 per share, and our credit portfolio continues to operate profitably. It is table and continues to perform strong and well within our expectations based on this mix shift."

And I just want to ground everybody listening on the call that traditionally, the certain jewelry industry, we take the third quarter as an important quarter for us to train our people, prepare them for all the new initiatives and get them ready for the fourth quarter, and the third quarter is our smallest quarter. In Jared, they had more going on the initial because we were focused on a lot of different areas of business that we're trying to enhance, and a lot of it came from our customer segmentation study that we did with. To get a better understanding of that Jared customer, that sentimental customers, to make sure we're interacting with them the appropriately that they're expecting. So some of the things that we did in the third quarter, one is we had a major leadership conference. We get all of our managers and get them trained and ready. And then our Jared team had to focus on some more specific areas of this were to changing our selling process and techniques. And quite frankly, the third quarter is the time where we make sure that we have all the right team members, both from a managerial perspective and on the sales floor, that we have the right team members in place that are ready and prepared to execute our new selling techniques that correlate with our new being segmentation study. So we've made some changes. We've made some changes in the stores because we made because we have some team members that weren't there and weren't ready. So we made some good personnel changes, first and foremost, then we focused on training our team members to sell differently. They actually have changed their selling techniques to get it more specific with the customers and what they're looking for is opposed of given a tour of our entire store whether they're looking for a tour or not. We also had some enhancements and some product launches. Vera Wang LOVE is going to all of our stores. The team members are getting to understand the Vera Wang collection better. So a lot of these changes are made we're affecting our sales because our team members were down consciously focused and training and enhancing these process. Now you asked what level will work the most? I mean, there's never any magic bullet,  Albert. It's a bunch of different levers. So it starts off with the customer experience, and that's a very important lever. It starts off with the advertising, the new creative advertising, which is coming off of the segmentation. So if you're watching TV and you're seeing a new Jared add, it's a different creative and we're hearing wonderful feedback on the creative advertising from our Jared customers through our team members. And, of course, having exciting new launches, whether it be America Links in Jared or whether it be Vera Wang, we're all excited for the team member. So we think the Jared stores are just really prepared for the fourth quarter and we constantly took the third quarter to get it even more prepared."

We have the benefit of Vera Wang LOVE going into all of our tested very well, so it's an incremental bridal option for them. We have Miracle Links in those stores, which is a new program for the birth of a child, which is a little lower price points we're happy with. And also, we have a great partnership with Pandora, and you'll see some new Pandora and we are partnered with Pandora. And Starting to sell Pandora jewelry and pushing that opportunity even further and taking that to next level. And you'll see a TV ad this fall actually with Pandora with the beautiful Pandora ring that will be on. So Jared is ready for a good the fourth quarter. It's a lot of incremental initiatives and product launches. And again, the have increased TV marketing spend year-on-year and the new creative, which we believe is getting better reaction from our customers than last year."

That being said, as I shared with Oliver, we always have a toolkit. We're continually testing opportunities for different type of promotions and understand the elasticity of those promotions. So we have a toolkit the promotions that we know or at least we understand the lift that we can get from sales and incremental gross margin dollars.

We're not going to guide on the particular gross margins, but try and give you some additional color to help with your battle. On the Sterling side, we would expect that we'll continue to see benefits related to lower gold cost. We did see benefits in the quarter related to that and that was, as I said in the prepared remarks, entirely offset by this mix shift that we saw in Q3. So as we think about the Q4, what I would expect is still to see benefits flowing through on the gold side, on our commodity side. A little bit of headwind, I would imagine, coming through on this mix shift. It's something that will work through, but given the size of the Q4, that will be definitely less pronounced. And so I would expect that we'll see expansion."

So I think it was more so due to the fact that we lapped the quarter plus there have some targeted cost savings reduction that we've been looking across the business to help from a leverage standpoint. As we move forward, the investments will continue to be there. Again, we'll have a little bit of this lag effect when you look at your sales and gross margins in the way those are flowing through. Importantly, though, what I would say and what we're really pleased when we think about the Q3 is that we did realize that synergies in the third quarter. And Mark and I both talked about our operating margin expansion of 90 basis points in Q3. That was in part driven by the modest net synergies that we realized during Q3. And those synergies primarily are coming from our sales and our gross margin. And again, they are partially being offset the investments that we are making within our SG&A."

The company will tell you though that historically, when we have an exciting program like this, it really does excite the store teams and the customers. So it puts a good emphasis on the business, let's just say that. As far as the roll out where we're going next is we'll start testing different items, whether it be in the earing category, or the necklace category, or different ring styles, we'll be starting the testing in the first quarter and the second quarter this year with the hopes of finding a winner extended out into all of our brands into the fall season next year or a year from now.

First of all, I keep on always going back to one of the things that we have that kind of insulates us from promotion is our brands. And that our brands offer competitive set and think cut programs like Ever Us, and Vera Wang LOVE and Neil Lane that if customers are excited about those brands, they're not going to get anywhere else and so they're not going not get a discount. So it insulates us. That being said, you're right. We have increased the amount of promoting specifically in Jared because when we learned more about the Jared customers through our segmentation studies, there are sentimentalist customers that care about the product, they care about being engaged as it relates to when they're purchasing the product. But they still want to make sure that they're getting a value and they still want to make sure they have an opportunity for that value. So having a sale every once in a while and Jared like some other type of nonjewelry competitors to Jared, is very normal for that when we think we're actually out of sync, but not adding those sales to our sentimental customers. So you will see a little bit more promotions at Jared. As far as Zales goes in the rest of our brands, we're just targeting our promotions better. We're -- we have a promotional kind of Treasure Chest that the $4 there. And what we're doing better with Zales, we believe we're targeting those promotions better and using those promotion dollars more and more effectively. So as far as the fourth quarter, are we promoting more as a whole? I'd say no. But in the Jared business, we're being a little more thoughtful to deal with that segmentation understanding of that customer is looking for some event sometimes."

A dynamic shift happening in the diamond supply chain right now, specifically those of you have read Debeers had a very not a good second quarter. There has just been some writings in our industry about the last site, meaning the last production or sale of goods coming out of their mines was substantially below the previous years. And that's primarily coming from the lack of demand from the far East and from the Middle East part of the countries who have a demand for, primarily used to demand of higher quality than reducing. So right now, there are opportunities to make buys in the rough market and potentially polished market on the higher quality of diamond called the VS type of good by terminology. And that's just not the goods that we use here at Signet. We're house that uses I want -- heavy I want some SI iTunes. So the opportunities that are coming from the market right now are more in the higher quality because of the lack of demand from the far east. It's not something we're seeing now. Well, will there be opportunities in the future? Can there be opportunities in supply chain opportunities for our company whose got a consistency of how we order our products? We'll see, and we're investigating those opportunities. But as of right now, those opportunities are really for better buys are really I the higher quality rough and polished diamonds that we don't use at this point."

There are 4-key messages that I want you to take",1707,"Thanks, James, and good morning, everyone. In the third quarter  Signet comps and total sales both increased by 3.3%. Adjusted EPS was at $0.33 a share, a 57.1% increase over the prior year's adjusted EPS. There are 4-key messages that I want you to take away from our results and our guidance: First, in what has been a choppy retail environment for most, we were able to deliver same-store sales growth in line with our guidance; our total sales increase, which came from all-selling channels were driven primarily by branded bridal sales across all of our store buyers as well as strong growth overall from Kay Jewelers, Ernest Jones and Piercing Pagoda. We also continue to outperform our industry according to latest U.S. government and British Retail Consortium data. This was driven by a multitude of strength that separate us from our competition, such as advertising, driving jewelry trends, branding and much more.
Second, we made significant investments in store operations, systems and training during the third quarter in order to be in the best possible position for the fourth quarter and those investments are starting to pay off.
While our sales results in the aggregate were in line with our expectations, we saw some softness at Jared and Zales. This was the result of very specific systems investments, personal changes and training that we implemented in the quarter. I will elaborate on these changes later in the call, but it's suffice to say that this was a lot of change to implement in a short period of time. We thought it was appropriate to push through these changes and investment in our smallest quarter in order to prepare us for our biggest quarter and into the future.
The third point I want you to take away is that these investments are paying off and we're seeing solid sales results across our banners thus far in the quarter, particularly at Jared and Zales. One specific bright spot is sales from our newest must-have collection,  Ever Us, which was launched on October 15 and have exceeded our expectations thus far. We are confident heading into the holiday season given the strength of our business and the results to date as evidenced by our guidance for accelerating same-store sales growth of 3.5% to 5% in the fourth quarter.
The fourth point is that our topline results are translating into strong earnings growth per shares. Our adjusted EPS grew by 57% in the third quarter. The Zales integration continues to go very well. Importantly, we are realizing net synergies from our acquisition integration activities during the third quarter, which in part helped driving operating margin 190 basis points higher or 90 basis points on an adjusted basis. While we delivered excellent earnings growth overall in the quarter, there was a modest margin impact due to a sales mix shift from Jared to Kay, which Michele will elaborate on later.
Now let's take a look at the sales drivers of the third quarter. Bridal, which is a strategic focus of ours, grew faster than Signet's overall rate of sales. The bridal business is a stable grower and insulates us from some of the volatility that traditional retailers face. Bridal brands, such as Vera Wang LOVE, Neil Lane and the Forever Diamond, which is sold exclusively in our H.Samuel stores, led the way.
Complementing those results has been the momentum of a fashion collection, such as Diamonds in Rhythm and diamond solitaire earrings led by the radiant reflection assortment as well as growth in bracelets and a variety of jewelry for the rest.
Also marketing initiatives in the third quarter did well, most notably at Kay. We increased our TV rates and executed successful multimedia campaign around engagement season. We also applied learnings from our customer segmentation study to our advertising creative, which we believe is starting to resonate with our customers.
And speaking of Kay, the team had an excellent quarter across all of the selling channel and a wide variety of product collections, including fashion jewelry and watches as well as bridal.
Piercing Pagoda had a great third quarter, which was driven by gold, piercings, diamonds and religious jewelry. Improvements in training and the newly design kiosk helped results as well. Ernest Jones delivered outstanding results across all of the selling channels, driven principally by diamond and the watch business. These gains, however, were partially offset by the multitude of investments that we made at Jared and Zales. So to elaborate a little, Jared managed a significant amount of change around field operations including coverage and selling process. Zales initiatives included discount control policies, repair process and more. These distracted our people a bit, but it was the appropriate decision for our business to prepare us for the important fourth quarter.
While this was a lot of change to implement in the short period of time, it was important to get it done in our smallest quarter to prepare us for the fourth quarter when we expect to make over half of our adjusted EPS for the year.
Toward the end of the third quarter, we launched Ever Us, our new must-have offering and the biggest product introduction in our company's history. We're about 6 weeks into it and Ever Us is off to a strong start.
To review, Ever Us is Signet's effort to jump starting innovation in our industry. It was led by our New York design office. We've identified the need in the jewelry industry and develop to start a collection, which has been consistently marketed and tagged with all of our store banners in the markets that we serve. The 2-stone diamond ring, which is positioned to be for one's best friend and true love, serves a variety of gifting occasions in the lives of couples.
Ever Us sales are greater than our expectations at this point. And what's most exciting is the longer-term strategic potential of a program like this. For now, Ever Us comes in one-ring style and 5 different carat ways. But we anticipate extending the benefit tail, driven by product line extensions into maybe different line designs, earrings and pendants and omni-channel opportunities. As a matter of  fact, Ever Us has already established a strong online presence.
Part of the power of Ever Us is that it's being purchased for a wide variety of occasions. We're hearing stories from our store teams that customers are purchasing Ever Us for anniversaries, for birthdays, special mother-and-daughter events and even for self-purchase. Needless to say, we are very excited to see our Ever Us received by our customers in the fourth quarter.
Now that we are done with the third quarter and which made significant progress around implementing initial phases of select systems, testing products and refining selling techniques, we are locked and loaded for the fourth quarter. So let's take a closer look at some of the initiatives going on.
In merchandising, as I mentioned, we are very optimistic about Ever Us. Vera Wang LOVE continues to do well in all of our selling channels globally. The cross-selling effort tested so well in Jared that is now fully rolled out to every Jared store. The Star Wars collection of beads as well as Men's and Women's jewelry is off to an excellent start in Kay stores. Miracle Links has expanded to all Jared stores in about 500 Kay stores, and it's the perfect gift for new moms symbolizing the birth of a child.
In marketing, we have greater advertising rates and more impressions than last year across all of our store brands. We have applied many of our recent customer segmentation learning to our new campaigns. Our new TV ads are available to view at signetjewelers.com on our Media Center page.
Jared ran its first and very successful sales event billed Light Up the Holidays earlier this month, and Zales has one incremental preferred customer event this quarter also.
In field operations, the investment that we made in third quarter at Zales around training, systems and process for a peer, discount controls and custom jewelry are in early stage deployment. And Jared has made some improvements to its selling techniques, coverage and customer relationship management. Our field operations team are highly motivated and ready to execute this holiday season. The testing of our in-house credit group offer credit at Zales as a third month quickly move from a test in mid-October to full rollout here in the fourth quarter. And we know that our customers heavily rely on our online platforms to learn about jewelry, compare products when they purchase online or if they purchase in-store. We are aggressively implementing changes that enhance the omni-channel experience and drive online and in-store sales. Led by our newly promoted Signet's Senior Vice President, Julian Shirley, mobile navigation and search has been dramatically improved. There is also greater personalization and targeted digital marketing, which has elevated the efficiency and the effectiveness of our omni-channel approach to selling.
There has been more going on in this company in recent months than I can recall in my long history here at Signet. Third quarter is the time to train and plan for new initiatives. And now with the fourth quarter under way and distractions to our store team members minimize, we are excited about all the new initiatives that they will deliver.
So to sum up the third quarter, Signet delivered solid sales, net synergies, operating margin expansion, significant adjusted EPS growth and completed the fourth quarter preparations effectively. We are loaded with initiatives in the fourth quarter in all the critical areas of our business, including merchandising, marketing, store operations and credit. These initiatives are already paying off as evidenced by our results to date and our expectations for accelerating same-store sales of 3.5% to 5% in the fourth quarter. And we are simultaneously delivering consistent strong sales and earnings growth, achieving synergy goals, executing transformative initiative that will facilitate long-term profitable growth, and we're making the share purchases we committed to as part of our capital allocation plan. We are very confident and excited about our fourth quarter and long-term opportunities.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Michele for a run-through on the financials."

All right. So let's begin with our third quarter sales performance. Signet total sales and comps each increased 3.3%, and on a constant exchange basis, total sales increased 4.9%. Let me add some additional col",1623,"Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. All right. So let's begin with our third quarter sales performance. Signet total sales and comps each increased 3.3%, and on a constant exchange basis, total sales increased 4.9%. Let me add some additional color on our total sales and comp performance by division. 
Starting with our Sterling division. Total sales increased 5.9% to $733.5 million, which included a comp increase of 3.5%. Sales increased primarily due to branded bridal and select diamond jewelry, most notably at Kay. This was partially offset by a comp decline at Jared. The average transaction price in Sterling increased by 3% and the number of transactions decreased by 0.7% due to merchandise mix shift in favor of branded bridal.
Our Zale division Q3 total sales decreased by 0.5%, but increased 2.4% on a constant exchange basis. Total sales were $329.9 million, including a same-store sales increase of 2.6%. The average transaction price and number of transactions both increased 1%.
The Zale jewelry operating segment saw higher transaction growth at 2.9% and a decrease in average transaction value of 1.9%, as we improved sales productivity in fashion jewelry.
Piercing Pagoda sales were driven by an 11.6% increase in average transaction value, while transaction count remained flat. The higher average transaction value was primarily due to higher gold sales.
Now in our U.K. division. Total sales decreased 1.1% but increased 4.9% on a constant exchange basis. Total sales were $149.4 million, with a comp sales increase of 4.1%, driven primarily by diamond jewelry and watches, most notably at Ernest Jones. The average transaction price increased 3.4% and the number of transactions increased by 2.3%.
Now moving on from sales, let's walk through Signet's consolidated Q3 performance and then we'll turn and analyze Signet's adjusted results.
So on Slide 9, the table provides a reconciliation of Signet's adjusted results to consolidated results. The difference between adjusted Signet and Signet are in the columns reflecting purchase accounting and transaction cost, which includes integration-related expenses. Starting on the right side of the slide on a GAAP basis, EPS was $0.19 per share. The next column over reflects our transaction cost, which are primarily costs for consultants that are assisting us with the integration. Transaction costs were responsible for $0.11 of EPS dilution. Purchase accounting adjustments, which reflect reduction to deferred revenue and amortization of unfavorable contracts were diluted to EPS by $0.03. And on an adjusted Signet basis, the far most left column, EPS was $0.33.
So moving on and reviewing Signet's adjusted P&L results below the sales line. Adjusted gross margin was $373.8 million or 30.6% of adjusted sales. This rate was flat to last year as the favorable impact from commodity cost and synergy was entirely offset by the impact of bad debt due to a sales mix shift from Jared to Kay. The sourcing impacted key inputs led by gold was favorable, and we are starting to benefit from new initiatives, principally in Zale, such as discount controls, vendor terms and other growth margin enhancing programs. These factors combined improve the Zale division gross margin rate by 120 basis points.
The Sterling division gross margin declined 90 basis points, driven primarily by the sales mix shift. This mix shift had a notable impact on gross margins, given that Q3 is the smallest quarter. I'll discuss further details in a few minutes related to this.
Our U.K. gross margin increased 70 basis points due primarily to occupancy leverage. Adjusted SG&A was $387.6 million or 31.7% of adjusted sales. This rate was favorable to last year by 40 basis points and was driven by store payroll leverage and partially offset by incremental investments in Zale around advertising, technology support and employee benefits.
Other operating income was $60.9 million. This increase of $7.4 million was due principally to higher interest income earned from higher outstanding receivable balances.
Adjusted operating income of $47.1 million or 3.9% of sales reflects a 31.9% increase in dollars and a rate expansion of 90 basis points. This growth was driven by the increase in sales, net synergies and SG&A leverage. The credit mix shift had a notable and partially offsetting impact on operating income because our operating earnings in Q3 are less than 5% of our overall annual operating earnings. So a small shift in credit has a more noticeable impact. Adjusted EPS was $0.33 compared to $0.21 last year, an increase of 57.1%, driven principally by stronger business performance.
We repurchased $30 million of Signet's stock in the third quarter and $112 million year-to-date. This is ahead of our capital allocation plan and already within our annual buyback guidance. Nevertheless, we anticipate being in the market in our fiscal fourth quarter, we have $154 million left on our share repurchase authorization program.
So let's move on to the balance sheet and we'll begin with inventory. So this is the first quarter since the Zale acquisition that we've had an apples-to-apples result and our continued focus on optimization of Zale inventory is reflected within our Q3 ending inventory position. Net inventory ended the quarter at $2.7 billion, an increase of 2%. At the end of the third quarter, we had 39 more stores than the previous year, which is what drove the inventory growth. Now this was offset in part by outstanding inventory management across all of our Signet businesses.
In our Zale division, we ended narrower and deeper in our assortments which continues to be a strategic objective for us. It's important to note that our total sales increased 3.3%, which is 130 basis points faster than the growth in our total inventory. Coupled with sound inventory management across the rest of our business, this puts us in a good, clean position towards third and the fourth quarter.
So now let's move on and turn our attention to our in-house credit metrics and statistics. Net accounts receivable increased to $1.5 billion compared to $1.3 billion last year and that's up 12.3%, driven by higher sales and an increase in the Sterling division credit penetration rate. Year-to-date, credit participation was 63% compared to 61.7% last year, driven by Kay.
Our credit approval standards remain disciplined and unchanged. The higher participation rate was primarily driven by a greater increase of Kay customers compared to our Jared customers. The average monthly collection rate was 11.7% compared to 12.1% due to 2 main reasons: first, as our mix of bridal increases due to our best in bridal strategy, this creates a higher average receivable. By design, the repayment rate is lower as the price point of the merchandise increases. Bridal has a higher average credit sale and therefore, the repayment is longer. So this leaves a higher outstanding receivable to be collected. And second, like other consumer loans, more principal is paid off later in the life of the loan. So as our credit portfolio has grown more in the last year, proportionately more of it will be paid later.
Net bad debt expense for the quarter was $53 million compared to $41.7 million last year. The increase of $11.3 million was driven by higher receivable balances as well as the mix of customers accepting our credit, particularly by store banner. That is Jared typically has a higher tier credit scoring customer than Kay, but Kay credit sales are growing faster than Jared, resulting in a sales mix shift. Importantly, Signet has not changed its credit standards and our credit portfolio continues to perform well and profitably.
Other operating income was $60.9 million compared to $53.5 million last year. The increase of $7.4 million was due primarily to more interest income on the higher outstanding receivable base. The net impact of bad debt and other operating income generated operating profit of $7.9 million compared to $11.8 million in the prior year. No changes have been made in our credit standards and the bottom line is that small changes have a more pronounced impact in the third quarter as the third quarter is our smallest quarter, but our credit earnings are earned more evenly throughout the year. This modest shift in mix had a $4.5 million impact in the quarter or about $0.04 to earnings per share. We remain highly disciplined in our approval process and as a result, our credit portfolio continues to be profitable and stable.
So finally, let's walk through our fourth quarter guidance. Signet's fourth quarter comparable store sales are expected to increase 3.5% to 5%. And as Mark indicated earlier, we are experiencing a strong start to the quarter across all banners based on the number of initiatives that we have put in place.
Fourth quarter adjusted EPS is expected to be $3.40 to $3.60. Based on the investments we have made and the strong sales results we have seen to date, we are confident in this guidance. From an effective tax rate standpoint, Signet's fiscal 2016 annual rate is anticipated to be about 28% to 29%, and that's both on an adjusted and GAAP basis.
Capital expenditure guidance for the full year now stands at $260 million to $280 million due primarily to timing. The reduction versus our earlier projection is attributed to a combination of store remodels, information technology and facilities that we likely will address before the end of the fiscal year.
Net selling square footage is still projected to grow approximately 2% to 3%, and I would reference you to see our news release for details on how the capital is to be directed. We remain highly confident in achieving our synergy target of $30 million to $35 million for fiscal 2016 as well as our 3-year target of $150 million to $175 million.
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Mark."

And so really what we saw in Q3, and I would just draw an analogy to merchandise mix, where product changes might affect rate, but profit is still flowing through the bottom line. So when you think about our Q3, which is really our smallest quarter, and that our credit earnings are more evenly spread throughout the year, it just has a more profound impact on our Q3. So really, that increase is driven by this mix shift that we saw in Q3. We equated it to about $0.04 per share, and our credit portfolio continues to operate profitably. It is stable and continues to perform strong and well within our expectations based on this mix shift."

And I just want to ground everybody listening on the call that traditionally to serve in the jewelry industry, we take the third quarter as an important quarter for us to train our people, prepare them for all the new initiatives and get them ready for the fourth quarter, and the third quarter is our smallest quarter. In Jared, they had more going on than usual because we were focused on a lot of different areas of business that we're trying to enhance and a lot of it came from our customer segmentation study that we did with Bain to get a better understanding of that Jared customer, that sentimental customers, to make sure we're interacting with them the appropriate way that they're expecting. So some of the things that we did in the third quarter, one is we had a major leadership conference. We get all of our managers and get them trained and ready, and then our Jared team had to focus on some more specific areas, because we're changing our selling process and techniques. And quite frankly, the third quarter is the time where we make sure that we have all the right team members, both from a managerial perspective and on the sales floor, that we have the right team members in place that are ready and prepared to execute our new selling techniques that correlate with our new Bain segmentation study. So we've made some changes. We've made some changes in the stores that make -- because we have some team members that weren't there and weren't ready. So we made some good personal changes, first and foremost, then we focused on training our team members to sell differently. They actually have changed their selling techniques to get it more specific with the customers and what they're looking for as opposed to giving them a tour of our entire store whether they were looking for a tour or not. We also had some enhancements and some product launches. Vera Wang LOVE is going to all of our stores. The team members are getting to understand the Vera Wang collection better. So a lot of these changes that are made were affecting our sales because our team members were down consciously focused on training and enhancing these process. Now you ask what level will work the most. I mean, there's never any magic bullet,  Oliver. It's a bunch of different levers. So it starts off with the customer experience, and that's a very important lever. It starts off with the advertising, the new creative advertising, which is coming off of the segmentation. So if you're watching TV and you're seeing our new Jared ad, it's a different creative and we're hearing wonderful feedback on the creative -- or our new advertising from our Jared customers through our team members. And, of course, having exciting new launches, whether it be Miracle Links in Jared or whether it be Vera Wang LOVE were all exciting for the team members. So we think that Jared stores are just really prepared for the fourth quarter and we constantly took the third quarter to get them even more prepared."

So we have a toolkit of promotions that we know or at least we understand the lift that we can get from sales an incremental gross margin dollars.

In terms of the margins, again, I say this every quarter, we're not going to guide on the particular gross margins, but try and give you some additional color to help with your model. On the Sterling side, we would expect that we'll continue to see benefits related to lower gold cost. We did see benefits in the quarter related to that and that was, as I said in the prepared remarks, entirely offset by this mix shift that we saw in Q3. So as we think about the Q4, what I would expect is still to see benefits flowing through on the gold side, on our commodity side. A little bit of headwind, I would imagine, coming through on this credit mix shift. It's something that will work through. But given the size of the Q4, that will be definitely less pronounced.

And particularly SG&A, as we talked about we are making significant investments on the Zale division and we know that there is a lag between when we're making those investments and when we're seeing the lift coming through on our sales and our gross margin side. So I think it was more so due to the fact that we've lapped the quarter plus there has some targeted cost savings reductions that we've been looking across the business to help from a leverage standpoint. As we move forward, the investments will continue to be there. Again, we'll have a little bit of this lag effect when you look at your sales and gross margins in the way those are flowing through. Importantly, though, what I would say and what we are really pleased when we think about the Q3 is that we did realize net synergies in the third quarter. And Mark and I both talked about our operating margin expansion of 90 basis points in Q3. That was in part driven by the modest net synergies that we realized during Q3. And those synergies primarily are coming from our sales and our gross margin. And again, they are partially being offset by the investments that we are making within our SG&A."

The remainder will flow through in our Q4. When you go to FY '17, it's an incremental 40% or it's a different way, we should realize total of 60% of our net synergies by the end of FY '17.

So it's a very, very strong rollout for us, but we do not give specific contributions of the company. I will tell you though that historically, when we have an exciting program like this, it really does excite the store teams and the customers. So it puts a good emphasis on the business, let's just say that. As far as the roll out where we're going next is we'll start testing different items, whether it be in the earring category or the necklace category or different ring styles, we'll be starting the testing in the first quarter and the second quarter of this year with the hopes of finding a winner and extend it out into all of our brands into the fall season of next year or a year from now, and if not Kay division primarily. This is all of our brands. It's in Kay, it's in Zale, it's in peoples in Canada, it's in Ernest Jones in H.Samuel, United Kingdom, it is in Jared. So this is not Kay only. This is a brand and an offering that crosses over all of our customer segments, and it's working well in all of our brands and all of the countries in which we operate."

As you've heard in our prepared remarks, we repurchased $112 million of our shares to date. The guidance we have provided was $100 million to $150 million of a share buyback as it relates to FY '16, and that was really on the heels of our capital allocation policy that we had unveiled last March with one of those tenants seeing that we would return 70% to 80% of our free cash flow to shareholders either in the form of dividends and/or share repurchases, again, always subject to any strategic initiatives that will come along. So we really have met that guidance. We anticipate in the fourth quarter that we'll continue to purchase our shares. We have currently $154 million that remains under that authorized program. So I think you need to stay tuned, and you'll be hearing more on our fourth quarter call, as it relates to our capital allocation plans moving into FY '17 and what that means. From a CapEx standpoint, you're right. A number of these -- we reduced that guidance from what we originally had. We are at $275 million to $325 million previously, and that has now $260 million to $280 million, primarily driven by timing. So we would expect a number of these projects, particularly as it relates to IT, will be moved over to FY '17 and we would expect to see elevated levels of capital expenditure for FY '17, given the amount of initiatives we have in place particularly as it relates to IT.

So Zales, it's a lot for those stores to take on, but the company had to add the experience from a lot of these systems and trainings that we've done in our U.S. Signet business from the past. We knew we can make it happen, but it was a lot to take on. So that being said, it was consciously done in the third quarter, and we feel very good about the position of Zales in the fourth quarter.

First of all, I keep on always going back to one of the things that we have that kind of insulates us from promotion is our brands. And that our brands are not offered at our competitive set and programs like Ever Us and Vera Wang LOVE and Neil Lane that if customers are excited about those brands, they're not going to get anywhere else and so they're not going get a discount. So it insulates us. That being said, you're right. We have increased the amount of promoting specifically in Jared because when we learned more about the Jared customers through our segmentation studies, there are sentimentalist customers that care about the product, they care about being engaged as it relates to when they're purchasing the product. But they still want to make sure that they're getting a value and they still want to make sure they have an opportunity for that value. So having a sale every once in a while and Jared like some other type of non-jewelry competitors to Jared, is very normal for them and we think we're actually out of sync by not having those sales to our sentimentalist customers. So you will see a little bit more promotions with Jared. As far as Zales goes in the rest of our brands, we're just targeting our promotions better. We're -- we have a promotional kind of treasure chest of what we have for dollars there. And what we're doing better with Zales, we believe we're targeting those promotions better and that we're using those promotion dollars more simply and more effectively. So as far as the fourth quarter, are we promoting more as a whole? I'd say no. But in the Jared business, we are being a little bit more thoughtful to do to that the segmentation understanding of that customer is looking for some event sometimes."

There's some dynamic shifts happening in the diamond supply chain right now, specifically if those of you have read De Beers had a very -- not a good second quarter. There has just been some writings in our industry about the last site, meaning the last production or sale of goods coming out of their mines, was substantially below the previous years. And that's primarily coming from the lack of demand from the Far East and from the Middle Eastern part of the countries who have a demand for primarily use of demand of higher-quality goods than we're using. So right now, there are opportunities to make buys in the rough market and potentially polished market on the higher quality of diamonds called the VS type of goods by GIA terminology. And that's just not the goods that we use here at Signet, we're a house that uses I1, heavy I1 and some SI2s. So the opportunities that are coming from the market right now are more in the higher quality because of the lack of demand from the Far East. It's not something we're seeing now. Well, will there be opportunities in the future? Can there be opportunities and supply chain opportunities for our company, whose got a consistency of how we order our products? We'll see, and we'll be investigating those opportunities.

There are 4-key messages that I want you to take",1708,"Thanks, James, and good morning, everyone. In the third quarter  Signet comps and total sales both increased by 3.3%. Adjusted EPS was at $0.33 a share, a 57.1% increase over the prior year's adjusted EPS. There are 4-key messages that I want you to take away from our results and our guidance: First, in what has been a choppy retail environment for most, we were able to deliver same-store sales growth in line with our guidance; our total sales increase, which came from all-selling channels were driven primarily by branded bridal sales across all of our store buyers as well as strong growth overall from Kay Jewelers, Ernest Jones and Piercing Pagoda. We also continue to outperform our industry according to latest U.S. government and British Retail Consortium data. This was driven by a multitude of strength that separate us from our competition, such as advertising, driving jewelry trends, branding and much more.
Second, we made significant investments in store operations, systems and training during the third quarter in order to be in the best possible position for the fourth quarter and those investments are starting to pay off.
While our sales results in the aggregate were in line with our expectations, we saw some softness at Jared and Zales. This was the result of very specific systems investments, personal changes and training that we implemented in the quarter. I will elaborate on these changes later in the call, but it's suffice to say that this was a lot of change to implement in a short period of time. We thought it was appropriate to push through these changes and investment in our smallest quarter in order to prepare us for our biggest quarter and into the future.
The third point I want you to take away is that these investments are paying off and we're seeing solid sales results across our banners thus far in the quarter, particularly at Jared and Zales. One specific bright spot is sales from our newest must-have collection, Ever Us, which was launched on October 15 and have exceeded our expectations thus far. We are confident heading into the holiday season given the strength of our business and the results to date as evidenced by our guidance for accelerating same-store sales growth of 3.5% to 5% in the fourth quarter.
The fourth point is that our topline results are translating into strong earnings growth per shares. Our adjusted EPS grew by 57% in the third quarter. The Zales integration continues to go very well. Importantly, we are realizing net synergies from our acquisition integration activities during the third quarter, which in part helped driving operating margin 190 basis points higher or 90 basis points on an adjusted basis. While we delivered excellent earnings growth overall in the quarter, there was a modest margin impact due to a sales mix shift from Jared to Kay, which Michele will elaborate on later.
Now let's take a look at the sales drivers of the third quarter. Bridal, which is a strategic focus of ours, grew faster than Signet's overall rate of sales. The bridal business is a stable grower and insulates us from some of the volatility that traditional retailers face. Bridal brands, such as Vera Wang LOVE, Neil Lane and the Forever Diamond, which is sold exclusively in our H.Samuel stores, led the way.
Complementing those results has been the momentum of a fashion collection, such as Diamonds in Rhythm and diamond solitaire earrings led by the radiant reflection assortment as well as growth in bracelets and a variety of jewelry for the wrist.
Also marketing initiatives in the third quarter did well, most notably at Kay. We increased our TV rates and executed successful multimedia campaign around engagement season. We also applied learnings from our customer segmentation study to our advertising creative, which we believe is starting to resonate with our customers.
And speaking of Kay, the team had an excellent quarter across all of the selling channel and a wide variety of product collections, including fashion jewelry and watches as well as bridal.
Piercing Pagoda had a great third quarter, which was driven by gold, piercings, diamonds and religious jewelry. Improvements in training and the newly design kiosk helped results as well. Ernest Jones delivered outstanding results across all of the selling channels, driven principally by diamond and the watch business. These gains, however, were partially offset by the multitude of investments that we made at Jared and Zales. So to elaborate a little, Jared managed a significant amount of change around field operations including coverage and selling process. Zales initiatives included discount control policies, repair process and more. These distracted our people a bit, but it was the appropriate decision for our business to prepare us for the important fourth quarter.
While this was a lot of change to implement in the short period of time, it was important to get it done in our smallest quarter to prepare us for the fourth quarter when we expect to make over half of our adjusted EPS for the year.
Toward the end of the third quarter, we launched Ever Us, our new must-have offering and the biggest product introduction in our company's history. We're about 6 weeks into it and Ever Us is off to a strong start.
To review, Ever Us is Signet's effort to jump starting innovation in our industry. It was led by our New York design office. We've identified the need in the jewelry industry and develop to start a collection, which has been consistently marketed and tagged with all of our store banners in the markets that we serve. The 2-stone diamond ring, which is positioned to be for one's best friend and true love, serves a variety of gifting occasions in the lives of couples.
Ever Us sales are greater than our expectations at this point. And what's most exciting is the longer-term strategic potential of a program like this. For now, Ever Us comes in one-ring style and 5 different carat ways. But we anticipate extending the benefit tail, driven by product line extensions into maybe different line designs, earrings and pendants and omni-channel opportunities. As a matter of  fact, Ever Us has already established a strong online presence.
Part of the power of Ever Us is that it's being purchased for a wide variety of occasions. We're hearing stories from our store teams that customers are purchasing Ever Us for anniversaries, for birthdays, special mother-and-daughter events and even for self-purchase. Needless to say, we are very excited to see how Ever Us is received by our customers in the fourth quarter.
Now that we are done with the third quarter and which made significant progress around implementing initial phases of select systems, testing products and refining selling techniques, we are locked and loaded for the fourth quarter. So let's take a closer look at some of the initiatives going on.
In merchandising, as I mentioned, we are very optimistic about Ever Us. Vera Wang LOVE continues to do well in all of our selling channels globally. The cross-selling effort tested so well in Jared that is now fully rolled out to every Jared store. The Star Wars collection of beads as well as Men's and Women's jewelry is off to an excellent start in Kay stores. Miracle Links has expanded to all Jared stores in about 500 Kay stores, and it's the perfect gift for new moms symbolizing the birth of a child.
In marketing, we have greater advertising rates and more impressions than last year across all of our store brands. We have applied many of our recent customer segmentation learning to our new campaigns. Our new TV ads are available to view at signetjewelers.com on our Media Center page.
Jared ran its first and very successful sales event billed Light Up the Holidays earlier this month, and Zales has one incremental preferred customer event this quarter also.
In field operations, the investment that we made in third quarter at Zales around training, systems and process for a peer, discount controls and custom jewelry are in early stage deployment. And Jared has made some improvements to its selling techniques, coverage and customer relationship management. Our field operations team are highly motivated and ready to execute this holiday season. The testing of our in-house credit group offer credit at Zales as a third month quickly move from a test in mid-October to full rollout here in the fourth quarter. And we know that our customers heavily rely on our online platforms to learn about jewelry, compare products when they purchase online or if they purchase in-store. We are aggressively implementing changes that enhance the omni-channel experience and drive online and in-store sales. Led by our newly promoted Signet's Senior Vice President, Julian Shirley, mobile navigation and search has been dramatically improved. There is also greater personalization and targeted digital marketing, which has elevated the efficiency and the effectiveness of our omni-channel approach to selling.
There has been more going on in this company in recent months than I can recall in my long history here at Signet. Third quarter is the time to train and plan for new initiatives. And now with the fourth quarter under way and distractions to our store team members minimize, we are excited about all the new initiatives that they will deliver.
So to sum up the third quarter, Signet delivered solid sales, net synergies, operating margin expansion, significant adjusted EPS growth and completed the fourth quarter preparations effectively. We are loaded with initiatives in the fourth quarter in all the critical areas of our business, including merchandising, marketing, store operations and credit. These initiatives are already paying off as evidenced by our results to date and our expectations for accelerating same-store sales of 3.5% to 5% in the fourth quarter. And we are simultaneously delivering consistent strong sales and earnings growth, achieving synergy goals, executing transformative initiative that will facilitate long-term profitable growth, and we're making the share purchases we committed to as part of our capital allocation plan. We are very confident and excited about our fourth quarter and long-term opportunities.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Michele for a run-through on the financials."

Signet total sales and comps each increased 3.3%, and on a constant exchange basis, total sales increased 4.9%. Let me add some additional color on our total sales and comp performance by division. 
Starting with our Sterling division. Total sales increased 5.9% to $733.5 million, which included a comp increase of 3.5%. Sales increased primarily due to branded bridal and select diamond jewelry, most notably at Kay. This was partially offset by a comp decline at Jared. The average transaction price in Sterling increased by 3% and the number of transactions decreased by 0.7% due to merchandise mix shift in favor of branded bridal.
Our Zale division Q3 total sales decreased by 0.5%, but increased 2.4% on a constant exchange basis. Total sales were $329.9 million, including a same-store sales increase of 2.6%. The average transaction price and number of transactions both increased 1%.
The Zale jewelry operating segment saw higher transaction growth at 2.9% and a decrease in average transaction value of 1.9%, as we improved sales productivity in fashion jewelry.
Piercing Pagoda sales were driven by an 11.6% increase in average transaction value, while transaction count remained flat. The higher average transaction value was primarily due to higher gold sales.
Now in our U.K. division. Total sales decreased 1.1% but increased 4.9% on a constant exchange basis. Total sales were $149.4 million, with a comp sales increase of 4.1%, driven primarily by diamond jewelry and watches, most notably at Ernest Jones. The average transaction price increased 3.4% and the number of transactions increased by 2.3%.
Now moving on from sales, let's walk through Signet's consolidated Q3 performance and then we'll turn and analyze Signet's adjusted results.
So on Slide 9, the table provides a reconciliation of Signet's adjusted results to consolidated results. The difference between adjusted Signet and Signet are in the columns reflecting purchase accounting and transaction cost, which includes integration-related expenses. Starting on the right side of the slide on a GAAP basis, EPS was $0.19 per share. The next column over reflects our transaction cost, which are primarily costs for consultants that are assisting us with the integration. Transaction costs were responsible for $0.11 of EPS dilution. Purchase accounting adjustments, which reflect reduction to deferred revenue and amortization of unfavorable contracts were diluted to EPS by $0.03. And on an adjusted Signet basis, the far most left column, EPS was $0.33.
So moving on and reviewing Signet's adjusted P&L results below the sales line. Adjusted gross margin was $373.8 million or 30.6% of adjusted sales. This rate was flat to last year as the favorable impact from commodity cost and synergy was entirely offset by the impact of bad debt due to a sales mix shift from Jared to Kay. The sourcing impacted key inputs led by gold was favorable, and we are starting to benefit from new initiatives, principally in Zale, such as discount controls, vendor terms and other growth margin enhancing programs. These factors combined improve the Zale division gross margin rate by 120 basis points.
The Sterling division gross margin declined 90 basis points, driven primarily by the sales mix shift. This mix shift had a notable impact on gross margins, given that Q3 is the smallest quarter. I'll discuss further details in a few minutes related to this.
Our U.K. gross margin increased 70 basis points due primarily to occupancy leverage. Adjusted SG&A was $387.6 million or 31.7% of adjusted sales. This rate was favorable to last year by 40 basis points and was driven by store payroll leverage and partially offset by incremental investments in Zale around advertising, technology support and employee benefits.
Other operating income was $60.9 million. This increase of $7.4 million was due principally to higher interest income earned from higher outstanding receivable balances.
Adjusted operating income of $47.1 million or 3.9% of sales reflects a 31.9% increase in dollars and a rate expansion of 90 basis points. This growth was driven by the increase in sales, net synergies and SG&A leverage. The credit mix shift had a notable and partially offsetting impact on operating income because our operating earnings in Q3 are less than 5% of our overall annual operating earnings. So a small shift in credit has a more noticeable impact. Adjusted EPS was $0.33 compared to $0.21 last year, an increase of 57.1%, driven principally by stronger business performance.
We repurchased $30 million of Signet's stock in the third quarter and $112 million year-to-date. This is ahead of our capital allocation plan and already within our annual buyback guidance. Nevertheless, we anticipate being in the market in our fiscal fourth quarter, we have $154 million left on our share repurchase authorization program.
So let's move on to the balance sheet and we'll begin with inventory. So this is the first quarter since the Zale acquisition that we've had an apples-to-apples result and our continued focus on optimization of Zale inventory is reflected within our Q3 ending inventory position. Net inventory ended the quarter at $2.7 billion, an increase of 2%. At the end of the third quarter, we had 39 more stores than the previous year, which is what drove the inventory growth. Now this was offset in part by outstanding inventory management across all of our Signet businesses.
In our Zale division, we ended narrower and deeper in our assortments which continues to be a strategic objective for us. It's important to note that our total sales increased 3.3%, which is 130 basis points faster than the growth in our total inventory. Coupled with sound inventory management across the rest of our business, this puts us in a good, clean position to a start at the fourth quarter.
So now let's move on and turn our attention to our in-house credit metrics and statistics. Net accounts receivable increased to $1.5 billion compared to $1.3 billion last year and that's up 12.3%, driven by higher sales and an increase in the Sterling division credit penetration rate. Year-to-date, credit participation was 63% compared to 61.7% last year, driven by Kay.
Our credit approval standards remain disciplined and unchanged. The higher participation rate was primarily driven by a greater increase of Kay customers compared to our Jared customers. The average monthly collection rate was 11.7% compared to 12.1% due to 2 main reasons: first, as our mix of bridal increases due to our best in bridal strategy, this creates a higher average receivable. By design, the repayment rate is lower as the price point of the merchandise increases. Bridal has a higher average credit sale and therefore, the repayment is longer. So this leaves a higher outstanding receivable to be collected. And second, like other consumer loans, more principal is paid off later in the life of the loan. So as our credit portfolio has grown more in the last year, proportionately more of it will be paid later.
Net bad debt expense for the quarter was $53 million compared to $41.7 million last year. The increase of $11.3 million was driven by higher receivable balances as well as the mix of customers accepting our credit, particularly by store banner. That is Jared typically has a higher tier credit scoring customer than Kay, but Kay credit sales are growing faster than Jared, resulting in a sales mix shift. Importantly, Signet has not changed its credit standards and our credit portfolio continues to perform well and profitably.
Other operating income was $60.9 million compared to $53.5 million last year. The increase of $7.4 million was due primarily to more interest income on the higher outstanding receivable base. The net impact of bad debt and other operating income generated operating profit of $7.9 million compared to $11.8 million in the prior year. No changes have been made in our credit standards and the bottom line is that small changes have a more pronounced impact in the third quarter as the third quarter is our smallest quarter, but our credit earnings are earned more evenly throughout the year. This modest shift in mix had a $4.5 million impact in the quarter or about $0.04 to earnings per share. We remain highly disciplined in our approval process and as a result, our credit portfolio continues to be profitable and stable.
So finally, let's walk through our fourth quarter guidance. Signet's fourth quarter comparable store sales are expected to increase 3.5% to 5%. And as Mark indicated earlier, we are experiencing a strong start to the quarter across all banners based on the number of initiatives that we have put in place.
Fourth quarter adjusted EPS is expected to be $3.40 to $3.60. Based on the investments we have made and the strong sales results we have seen to date, we are confident in this guidance. From an effective tax rate standpoint, Signet's fiscal 2016 annual rate is anticipated to be about 28% to 29%, and that's both on an adjusted and GAAP basis.
Capital expenditure guidance for the full year now stands at $260 million to $280 million due primarily to timing. The reduction versus our earlier projection is attributed to a combination of store remodels, information technology and facilities that we likely wont address before the end of the fiscal year.
Net selling square footage is still projected to grow approximately 2% to 3%, and I would reference you to see our news release for details on how the capital is to be directed. We remain highly confident in achieving our synergy target of $30 million to $35 million for fiscal 2016 as well as our 3-year target of $150 million to $175 million.
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Mark."

And again, we said this before, credit really is a competitive advantage to us that enables our sales and drives a higher customer lifetime value than a noncustomer, -- noncredit customer. And so really what we saw in Q3, and I would just draw an analogy to merchandise mix, where product changes might affect rate, but profit is still flowing through the bottom line. So when you think about our Q3, which is really our smallest quarter, and that our credit earnings are more evenly spread throughout the year, it just has a more profound impact on our Q3. So really, that increase is driven by this mix shift that we saw in Q3. We equated it to about $0.04 per share, and our credit portfolio continues to operate profitably. It is stable and continues to perform strong and well within our expectations based on this mix shift."

And I just want to ground everybody listening on the call that traditionally to serve in the jewelry industry, we take the third quarter as an important quarter for us to train our people, prepare them for all the new initiatives and get them ready for the fourth quarter, and the third quarter is our smallest quarter. In Jared, they had more going on than usual because we were focused on a lot of different areas of business that we're trying to enhance and a lot of it came from our customer segmentation study that we did with Bain to get a better understanding of that Jared customer, that sentimental customers, to make sure we're interacting with them the appropriate way that they're expecting. So some of the things that we did in the third quarter, one is we had a major leadership conference. We get all of our managers and get them trained and ready, and then our Jared team had to focus on some more specific areas, because we're changing our selling process and techniques. And quite frankly, the third quarter is the time where we make sure that we have all the right team members, both from a managerial perspective and on the sales floor, that we have the right team members in place that are ready and prepared to execute our new selling techniques that correlate with our new Bain segmentation study. So we've made some changes. We've made some changes in the stores that make -- because we have some team members that weren't there and weren't ready. So we made some good personnel changes, first and foremost, then we focused on training our team members to sell differently. They actually have changed their selling techniques to get it more specific with the customers and what they're looking for as opposed to giving them a tour of our entire store whether they were looking for a tour or not. We also had some enhancements and some product launches. Vera Wang LOVE is rolling to all of our stores. The team members are getting to understand the Vera Wang collection better. So a lot of these changes that are made were affecting our sales because our team members were down consciously focused on training and enhancing these processes. Now you ask what level will work the most. I mean, there's never any magic bullet,  Oliver. It's a bunch of different levers. So it starts off with the customer experience, and that's a very important lever. It starts off with the advertising, the new creative advertising, which is coming off of the segmentation. So if you're watching TV and you're seeing our new Jared ad, it's a different creative and we're hearing wonderful feedback on the creative -- or our new advertising from our Jared customers through our team members. And, of course, having exciting new launches, whether it be Miracle Links in Jared or whether it be Vera Wang LOVE were all exciting for the team members. So we think that Jared stores are just really prepared for the fourth quarter and we constantly took the third quarter to get them even more prepared."

So we have a toolkit of promotions that we know or at least we understand the lift that we can get from sales and incremental gross margin dollars.

In terms of the margins, again, I say this every quarter, we're not going to guide on the particular gross margins, but try and give you some additional color to help with your model. On the Sterling side, we would expect that we'll continue to see benefits related to lower gold cost. We did see benefits in the quarter related to that and that was, as I said in the prepared remarks, entirely offset by this mix shift that we saw in Q3. So as we think about the Q4, what I would expect is still to see benefits flowing through on the gold side, on our commodity side. A little bit of headwind, I would imagine, coming through on this credit mix shift. It's something that will work through. But given the size of the Q4, that will be definitely less pronounced. And so I would expect that we'll see expansion."

And particularly SG&A, as we talked about we are making significant investments on the Zale division and we know that there is a lag between when we're making those investments and when we're seeing the lift coming through on our sales and our gross margin side. So I think it was more so due to the fact that we've lapped the quarter plus there has some targeted cost savings reductions that we've been looking across the business to help from a leverage standpoint. As we move forward, the investments will continue to be there. Again, we'll have a little bit of this lag effect when you look at your sales and gross margins in the way those are flowing through. Importantly, though, what I would say and what we are really pleased when we think about the Q3 is that we did realize net synergies in the third quarter. And Mark and I both talked about our operating margin expansion of 90 basis points in Q3. That was in part driven by the modest net synergies that we realized during Q3. And those synergies primarily are coming from our sales and our gross margin. And again, they are partially being offset by the investments that we are making within our SG&A."

I will tell you though that historically, when we have an exciting program like this, it really does excite the store teams and the customers. So it puts a good emphasis on the business, let's just say that. As far as the roll out where we're going next is we'll start testing different items, whether it be in the earring category or the necklace category or different ring styles, we'll be starting the testing in the first quarter and the second quarter of this year with the hopes of finding a winner and extend it out into all of our brands into the fall season of next year or a year from now, and if not Kay division primarily. This is all of our brands. It's in Kay, it's in Zale, it's in peoples in Canada, it's in Ernest Jones in H.Samuel, United Kingdom, it is in Jared. So this is not Kay only.

So we really have met that guidance. We anticipate in the fourth quarter that we'll continue to purchase our shares. We have currently $154 million that remains under that authorized program. So I think you need to stay tuned, and you'll be hearing more on our fourth quarter call, as it relates to our capital allocation plans moving into FY '17 and what that means.

We are at $275 million to $325 million previously, and that has now $260 million to $280 million, primarily driven by timing. So we would expect a number of these projects, particularly as it relates to IT, will be moved over to FY '17 and we would expect to see elevated levels of capital expenditure for FY '17, given the amount of initiatives we have in place particularly as it relates to IT.

And I'll tell you that, obviously, we experienced -- the experience of traffic dropping in the malls and retail affects us, but we believe it doesn't affect us as much as our other retail competitive set because, again, we have a product that people are thinking about before they come into the stores and doing a lot of shopping online. So the traffic does affect us, but we believe we're a little insulated as it relates to other parts of the retail world. But again, we feel very good about the amount of advertising we've got this year, our new creative that we have this year, our new initiatives was -- as it relates to selling and our new product launches that should hopefully increase the traffic into our stores for the fourth quarter."

First of all, I keep on always going back to one of the things that we have that kind of insulates us from promotion is our brands. And that our brands are not offered at our competitive set and programs like Ever Us and Vera Wang LOVE and Neil Lane that if customers are excited about those brands, they're not going to get anywhere else and so they're not going get a discount. So it insulates us. That being said, you're right. We have increased the amount of promoting specifically in Jared because when we learned more about the Jared customers through our segmentation studies, there are sentimentalist customers that care about the product, they care about being engaged as it relates to when they're purchasing the product. But they still want to make sure that they're getting a value and they still want to make sure they have an opportunity for that value. So having a sale every once in a while and Jared like some other type of non-jewelry competitors to Jared, is very normal for them and we think we're actually out of sync by not having those sales to our sentimentalist customers. So you will see a little bit more promotions with Jared. As far as Zales goes in the rest of our brands, we're just targeting our promotions better. We're -- we have a promotional kind of treasure chest of what we have for dollars there. And what we're doing better with Zales, we believe we're targeting those promotions better and that we're using those promotion dollars more succinctly and more effectively. So as far as the fourth quarter, are we promoting more as a whole? I'd say no. But in the Jared business, we are being a little bit more thoughtful to do to that the segmentation understanding of that customer is looking for some event sometimes."

There's some dynamic shifts happening in the diamond supply chain right now, specifically if those of you have read De Beers had a very -- not a good second quarter. There has just been some writings in our industry about the last site, meaning the last production or sale of goods coming out of their mines, was substantially below the previous years. And that's primarily coming from the lack of demand from the Far East and from the Middle Eastern part of the countries who have a demand for primarily use of demand of higher-quality goods than we're using. So right now, there are opportunities to make buys in the rough market and potentially polished market on the higher quality of diamonds called the VS type of goods by GIA terminology. And that's just not the goods that we use here at Signet, we're a house that uses I1, heavy I1 and some SI2s. So the opportunities that are coming from the market right now are more in the higher quality because of the lack of demand from the Far East. It's not something we're seeing now. Well, will there be opportunities in the future? Can there be opportunities and supply chain opportunities for our company, whose got a consistency of how we order our products? We'll see, and we'll be investigating those opportunities. But as of right now, those opportunities are really -- for better buys are really in the higher-quality rough and polished diamonds that we don't use at this point."
