Raytheon concluded 2014 with a strong fourth quarter, driven by global demand for our advanced technologies and a solid execution across the company.

Raytheon concluded 2014 with a strong fourth quarter, driven by global demand for our advanced technologies and a solid execution across the company. Bookings were better than expected at $7.1 billion, yielding a book-to-bill ratio of 1.16 for Q4. Sales were up nearly 5% in the quarter as both domestic and international sales increased. And cash flow and margins were strong as well. 
These results were made possible by the dedicated efforts of the entire at Raytheon team. And I want to thank everyone on the team for the strong quarter and solid year. 
As I look back on 2014, I'm pleased with our overall performance. We had a book-to-bill ratio of 1.05 for the year. Bookings of $24.1 billion exceeded the high end of our expectations. 
The company capitalized on key domestic and international opportunities in missile defense, electronic warfare, cybersecurity, C4ISR and training. This highlights our continued alignment with our customers' priorities and our strong competitive position. Furthermore, we're especially proud that we delivered better-than-expected bookings performance, even as one of our anticipated large international Patriot awards moved into the first quarter of 2014. 
Operationally, we continue to focus on reducing cost, improving affordability and delivering strong returns, while at the same time, we follow through in our commitment to invest on our future. As we look forward to 2015, we expect to continue to perform well. Dave will walk you through our 2015 guidance in a few minutes. 
Demand from our broad base of customers continues to drive growth in our international business. Over the past few months, I continue to receive feedback from our international customers that investing in national security remains a top priority, given the global threat environment. And you can see this in both our fourth quarter and full year results. 
Full year 2014 international bookings were up 27% over 2013 and were 35% of the total company bookings. I will note that our international book-to-bill ratio for the year was 1.28 and I look for -- at the fourth quarter, it was 2.0. So we finished the year with very solid international bookings. 
We saw strong demand across our international portfolio during the year, including bookings from Qatar for Patriot and an air defense operating sector; Kuwait for Patriot fire units, Canada for the North Warning System, several countries for AMRAAM, South Korea for missiles and in the Australia for the air warfare destroyer, among a host of others. 
At the end of Q4, international backlog increased to 40% of our total backlog. Our domestic bookings in 2014 also improved over 2013. We received key awards in training, SM-3, AMRAAM, Tomahawk and the FAA program. We also closed on key competitive awards, including the family of advanced beyond line of sight terminal. And last summer, we also had successful tested the exoatmospheric [ph] vehicle that allowed us to move forward on this important program that protects the homeland. 
We saw strong bookings in our classified business, which includes both domestic and international. And our overall classify bookings increased by 29% in 2014. 
We feel good about the outlook for 2015 and we expect another year with a book-to-bill ratio above 1. International bookings are expected to continue to be strong, representing approximately 1/3 of our total 2015 bookings, driven by opportunities from a broad base of global customers and across a wide range of our products and solutions, including missiles, tactical radars and Command and Control systems. 
In addition, demand for the proven Patriot systems air and missile defense capabilities continues. New opportunities in Asia and the Middle East as well as competitive awards continue to develop. As I just mentioned, we are close to finalizing a $2 billion Patriot order from an international customer in Q1. We also expect to conclude negotiations on the Patriot upgrade program in South Korea within the next 6 to 9 months. Keep in mind the missile upgrade awarded to us in Q3 of 2014 is a precursor for Korea's expected follow-on hardware upgrade Configuration-3 plus. 
In Europe, is expected to make the final down select for the medium-range integrated air and missile defense competition by the end of this year. Patriot is 1 of 2 systems in the final round of the competition. 
From a domestic perspective, the final agreement on the fiscal year 2015 DoD base budget was reached in December. Modernization accounts came in several billion dollars higher than requested, yielding funding increases for several Raytheon programs. We expect the administration to submit its fiscal year 2016 defense budget request next week. While we won't speculate on what the final funding level for DoD will be in fiscal year 2016, we will point out that even if the Budget Control Act caps are not raised at all, DoD base budget funding will be several billion dollars higher in fiscal year 2016 than fiscal year 2015.  While the domestic market is still constrained, the trajectory of the DoD base budget is finally, starting to trend upwards. 
We see considerable opportunities in the domestic market. The growing sophistication of the threat toward national security is creating demand for new innovative solutions. As a result, we are investing more to develop the discriminating technologies and differentiated capabilities that will enable us to provide our customers what they need in areas such as missile defense, electronic warfare, high-energy lasers, advanced propulsion and undersea sensors. These investments will position us to capture future franchise programs and lay the foundation for growth. 
Another area where we see continually evolving the persuasive threat in cyber. In fact, we see change for certain areas of the industry. Whereas C3ISR expanded to C4ISR, this is now evolving to C5ISR with the latest C stand for cyber. Consistent with this, many of our customers are turning to us to incorporate the latest cyber protection into their networks and systems so that they are more secure. As always, we stand ready to help our global customers with our advanced cyber capabilities. At the end of the last decade, we began adding to our organic cyber capabilities through acquisitions. And we've made a number of cyber-related acquisitions since then, positioning us a technology leader in this growing market. 
Our latest cyber-related acquisition was Blackbird technologies, in which we completed in the fourth quarter. Blackbird not only adds unique cyber and other capabilities but also expands key market channels in the special operations and Intel markets for Raytheon. It is a great fit and we welcome their employees to the Raytheon team. 
One of the key strengths of Raytheon is our ongoing commitment to our core values. And in 2014, we were recognized for our achievements in the area of ethics and integrity, health and safety and sustainability. We were awarded the 2014 corporate leadership award by Transparency International USA for our commitment to shape initiatives that promote high business standards, transparency and anticorruption in the U.S. and internationally. We achieved the best safety record in our history, significantly reducing both lost workdays and recordable injuries. 
We reached the -- received the Energy Star Partner award for an EPA and have been recognized as one of the top green companies in America for our strong greenhouse gas reduction program and sound energy practices. We were also recognized as one of the 100 best corporate citizens by Corporate Responsibility magazine. Our goal is to continue to build on these successes. 
Before wrapping up, I'd like to highlight another significant attribute that we pride ourselves here on Raytheon. That is having a deep bench of management talent as a result of our strong leadership development and succession planning programs. Over recent weeks, we've made announcements that clearly demonstrate this. I'd like to again congratulate David Wajsgras on his new role as President of IIS. Dave has been CFO of Raytheon since 2006. His tenure as CFO has been an integral component of an exceptional period of value creation for the company. His deep industry background and broad experience working with both customers and industry partners will be key in driving the global growth strategy in IIS. Dave will be succeeding who will be retiring after serving more than 10 years with the company, including 6 years as a President of IIS, which he delivered solid operating results and outstanding leadership. 
I'd also like to welcome Toby to his new role as CFO of Raytheon. As many of you know, Toby has been with the company for nearly 30 years and has held a number of business CFO roles in the company. He was CFO at IDS when he led the business. So I had the pleasure of working with Toby before and look forward to doing so again. I'm confident he'll do a great job. 
In summary, we had another great year at Raytheon and we have a solid outlook for 2015. With that, let me turn it over to Dave."
105612,282273180,750797,"Raytheon Company, Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Jan 29, 2015",2015-01-29,"Earnings Calls","Raytheon Company","Executives","Okay. Thanks, Tom.

Then I'll discuss our outlook for 2015 and after that, we'll open up the call for questions. So in my remarks, I'll be referring to the web slides we issued earlier this morning, which are posted on the Raytheon website. 
Okay, if everyone could please move to Page 3. We delivered solid results in both the quarter and the full year. Fourth quarter operating margin was 14.1% and on an adjusted basis was 13%. For the full year, operating margin was 13.9% and 12.7% on an adjusted basis. Our fourth quarter EPS from continuing operations was $1.86 and on an adjusted basis, was $1.71. For the full year, EPS from continuing operations was $6.97 and our adjusted EPS were $6.12. Our sales for the quarter was $6.1 billion and $22.8 billion for the year. We also generated strong operating cash flow of over $825 million for the quarter and $2.1 billion for the year, after a $600 million pretax discretionary pension contribution, which was not in our prior guidance. 
Additionally, the company repurchased 7.7 million shares of common stock for approximately $750 million in 2014. The company ended the year with a strong balance sheet and net debt of $611 million. 
Also, as previously announced, the company acquired Blackbird technologies in the fourth quarter for approximately $425 million. 
If you turn to Page 4. Let me go through some of the details of our fourth quarter and full year results. We had strong bookings of $7.1 billion in the quarter and $24.1 billion for the full year, resulting in a year end backlog of $33.6 billion. Our book-to-bill ratio in the quarter was 1.16 and 1.05 for the year. And the company ended 2014 with a funded backlog of $23.1 billion. 
For the quarter, international orders represented 50% of our total company bookings and for the full year was 35% of total bookings. At the end of 2014, approximately 40% of our total backlog was international. 
Turning now to Page 5. We had fourth quarter sales of $6.1 billion, up 5% over the same period in 2013 and again, was consistent with our expectations. So looking at the businesses, all had higher sales than the same period last year. Net sales at IDS were $1.6 billion in the quarter. Compared to last year's fourth quarter, the increase was primarily due to higher sales on international Patriot programs. 
IIS net sales of $1.5 billion in the quarter were up from the same period last year, primarily due to higher volume on classified programs. 
Missile Systems had fourth quarter 2014 net sales of $1.7 billion, up 5% compared to the fourth quarter of 2013. The increase was primarily due to higher sales on AMRAAM and evolved Sea Sparrow missile programs. And IIS had net sales of $1.7 billion in Q4, higher than the comparable period last year, primarily due to increased sales on an Electronic Warfare systems program. 
For the year, sales were $22.8 billion, down 3.7%, again, consistent with our expectations. International sales growth partially offset a decline in domestic sales. 
So moving ahead to Page 6, we delivered solid operational performance in the quarter and for the full year. Looking at business margins in the quarter, at IDS, IIS and missiles, margins were essentially in-line with or better than last year. In the fourth quarter 2014, IDS achieved some important program milestones and I did briefly discussed this on the call on October. 
And at SAS, fourth quarter 2013 benefited from the timing of profit adjustments. Said another way, SAS had a tough comparison. Also, you may recall that this business had strong third quarter margins in 2014, driven by the timing of performance that we had previously expected in the fourth quarter. So it's worth noting that IDS, IIS and SAS margins all exceed the guidance range that we provided back in October. 
Missile Systems did come in slightly below our guidance, driven by program mix. 
So on Page 7, you'll see both the fourth quarter and full year EPS. In the fourth quarter, 2014, our EPS was $1.86 and for the full year was $6.97. And on an adjusted basis, was $1.71 in the fourth quarter and $6.12 for the full year. EPS for the quarter was strong and included the extension of the R&D tax credit, which was not in our prior guidance. As I previously mentioned, the company generated strong operating cash flow of $2.1 billion in 2014. Again, this includes the $600 million pretax or $400 million after tax discretionary pension contribution, which was also not in our prior guidance. Excluding the net discretionary cash contribution, our operating cash flow in 2014 would have been $2.5 billion. It's worth noting that on this basis, we exceeded the guidance that we provided you on October due to the timing of collections. 
Moving on to the 2015 guidance on Page 8. We see sales in the range of $22.3 million to $22.8 billion, flat to slightly down from 2014. As for pension, we see the 2015 FAS/CAS adjustment at a positive $197 million, which I'll further discuss in just a minute. We expect net interest expense to be $225 million to $235 million. We see our average diluted shares outstanding to be between $305 million and $307 million on a full year basis. 
As for our effective tax rate, we expect it to be approximately 27.5%. Our 2015 tax rate is higher than 2014, primarily due to the laps of the R&D tax credit, which, again, is not included in our 2015 guidance. If the R&D tax credit is extended, it will favorably impact the affected tax rate by about 110 basis points and our EPS by approximately $0.10. 
As a reminder, we had an $83 million foreign tax credit in the first quarter of 2014, which also impacted the effective tax rate. And for 2015, we are anticipating a non-cash $88 million tax settlement in the second quarter. 
In 2015, we our EPS to be in the range of $6.20 to $6.35 and our adjusted EPS to be in the range of $5.49 to $5.64. Our operating cash flow guidance for 2015 is expected to increase to between $2.3 billion and $2.6 billion. 
Before moving to Page 9, I want to mention that we expect the 2015 book-to-bill ratio to be between 1.0x and 1.05x, driven by continued demand from a broad base of domestic and international customers. And we, again, expect stronger bookings in the second half of this year similar to both 2013 and 2014. 
So if you move to Page 9. Here, we provided our initial 2015 guidance by business. Consistent with our prior comments, we expect 2015 adjusted margins to continue to be solid in the 12.1% to 12.3% range. Our margin for 2015 will be impacted by a change in program mix as well as higher investments in technology, with the objective of returning to top line growth. The investments we've made in GaN and cyber are paying off in significant ways today. We fully expect these new investments in radars, directed energy, EW and advanced propulsion to lay the foundation for growth over the next few years. 
At IDS, we see margins in the 15.1% to 15.3% range. The change from 2014 is driven by mix, most notably, the planned completion of some of our international Patriot programs. And in 2015, we are ramping up on several new programs, including Qatar Patriot and the new international Patriot award expected in Q1. As you know, we typically see lower margins at the exception of longer duration programs, which can improve over time as we retire risks and drive operational improvements. Longer-term, we see IDS margins improving after 2015, as the overall business mix improves and as these new large international programs progress through the production cycle. 
Additionally, you should note that we expect IIS margins of 7.4% to 7.6% to be impacted by approximately 60 basis points due to the Blackbird Technologies acquisition related cost. Excluding this, IIS margins would be in the range of 8% to 8.2%. 
SAS margins are expected to be down, driven by mix from lower volume as a result of completing some international programs as well as some higher business investments in 2015. 
Looking ahead, from a company level perspective, as domestic development programs transition to production and our international programs mature, we do see opportunities that will improve margins in 2016 and beyond. 
If you'd now turn to Page 10. We provided you with our 2015 outlook by quarter. You'll notice the sales ramp throughout the year. In addition, the second quarter EPS is favorably impacted due to the previously mentioned non-cash $88 million tax settlement. 
And finally, on Page 11. As we've done in the past, we provided a summary of the financial impact from pensions in 2014 as well as the projected 2015 through 2017 impact, holding all assumptions constant. 
As I mentioned earlier, we see the 2015 FAS/CAS adjustment at a positive $197 million, which reflects our investment returns in 2014 of over 6% on our U.S. pension assets and the December 31 discount rate of 4.1%. The discount rate is down 100 basis points from last year. 
Further, we reduced our long-term return on asset assumptions from 8.75% to 8% due to a change in the allocation of our planned assets and related investment strategies. 
Taken together, these result in a lower favorable FAS/CAS pension impact in 2015 compared to '14. 
Looking beyond 2015, it's important to keep in mind for each 25 basis point change in the discount rate, a result of $65 million to $75 million change in FAS/CAS takes place. 
Lastly, required pension contributions are decreasing in the near term as CAS recovery is increasing. This has a favorable impact on our pretax net cash flow over the forecast horizon. 
Before concluding, I would also like to take this opportunity to congratulate Toby on his promotion. I've worked with Toby for 9 years and I can tell you that he understands Raytheon, has a strong network and is well-respected across the entire company. He has a deep understanding of finance, the industry and our customers. And he also has a strong commercial background, having been the CFO of Raytheon Aircraft for close to 5 years. His extensive and broad background provides a strong foundation for his and Raytheon's future success. Now on a personal note, I would like to mention that it's been great to work with all of you since joining Raytheon. And I'm looking very forward to my new role. I'm sure I'll see you at future Raytheon events. 
Let me conclude by saying that in 2014, Raytheon, again, delivered solid operating performance with bookings, margins, earnings and operating cash flow, all on or ahead of expectations. Book-to-bill was strong and our international business continues to grow. We have a strong balance sheet, which gives us a substantial flexibility and options to continue to drive shareholder value. With that, we'll open up the call to questions."

In 2014, we had 2 items that impacted cash flow at the end of the year. We had the discretionary pension contribution of $400 million on a net basis. And we also saw some year-end collections in Q4 that we had expected in the first quarter of 2015. That's between roughly $100 million and $150 million. So when you normalize for these 2 items, 2014, we did achieve the high end of our guidance at roughly $2,350,000,000. And for 2015, adjusting for the earlier collections, the range would be $2.4 billion to $2.7 billion. So if you look at this year-over-year on a normalized basis, 2015 is roughly $300 million to $400 million higher than '14 at the high end of the range. So I hope that clarifies it for you.

So again, we're projecting 12.1% to 12.3%. Now there's a number of areas that are important to mention here. Firstly, there is the program mix, particularly at IDS. And we talked about the cadence of the longer duration production programs coming down in '15, as we start out on the new programs that we were recently awarded and fully expect to be awarded in the first quarter and throughout the year. Secondly and maybe more importantly, we are increasing our spend in IRAD and program investments. Lastly, we closed out the year last year with IRAD at just a little over 2% of sales. And as we look at 2015, we expect it to be closer to 3% of sales. And that -- those are important technology investments that Tom addressed earlier. That positions us well for both the top line and bottom line growth. And then, lastly, we mentioned this a little earlier as well, IIS, the acquisition of Blackbird Technologies, from an IIS standpoint, there's about 60 basis points of impact from the amortization of acquisition cost of intangibles. And at the company level, that's about 15 to 20 basis points. Now what I just went through, there is an offset there. There continues to be a higher productivity as a result of the focused efforts throughout the company.

So as I hope that helps and clarifies the way we're thinking about other company in '15 and beyond."

Raytheon concluded 2014 with a strong fourth quarter, driven by global demand for advanced technologies and solid executions across the company.

Raytheon concluded 2014 with a strong fourth quarter, driven by global demand for advanced technologies and solid executions across the company. Bookings were better than expected at $7.1 billion, yielding a book-to-bill ratio of 1.16 for Q4. Sales were up nearly 5% in the quarter as both domestic and international sales increased, and cash flow and margins were strong as well. 
These results were made possible by the dedicated efforts of the entire at Raytheon team and I want to thank everyone on the team for the strong quarter and solid year. 
As I look back on 2014, I'm pleased with our overall performance. We had a book-to-bill ratio of 1.05 for the year, bookings of $24.1 billion exceeded the high end of our expectations. 
The company capitalized on key domestic and international opportunities in missile defense, electronic warfare, cybersecurity, C4ISR and training. This highlights our continued alignment with our customers' priorities and our strong competitive position. Furthermore, we're especially proud that we delivered better-than-expected bookings performance, even as one of our anticipated large international Patriot awards moved into the first quarter of 2014. 
Operationally, we continue to focus on reducing cost, improving affordability and delivering strong returns, while at the same time, we follow through on our commitment to invest in our future. As we look forward to 2015, we expect to continue to perform well. Dave will walk you through our 2015 guidance in a few minutes. 
Demand from our broad base of customers continue to drive growth in our international business. Over the past few months, I continue to receive feedback from our international customers and investing in national security remains a top priority, given the global threat environment, and you can see this in both our fourth quarter and full year results. 
Full year 2014 international bookings were up 27% over 2013 and were 35% of the total company bookings. I will note that our international book-to-bill ratio for the year was 1.28 and I look for -- at the fourth quarter, it was 2.0. So we finished the year with very solid international bookings. 
We saw strong demand across our international portfolio during the year, including bookings from Qatar for Patriot and an air defense operating center; Kuwait for Patriot fire units; Canada for the North Warning System; several countries for AMRAAM; South Korea for GEM-T missiles and the Australia for the Air Warfare Destroyer, among a host of others. 
At the end of Q4, international backlog increased to 40% of our total backlog. Our domestic bookings in 2014 also improved over 2013. We received key awards in training, SM-3, AMRAAM, Tomahawk and the FAA STARS program. We also closed on a key competitive awards, including the family of advanced beyond line of sight terminal. And last summer, we also had successful tested the Exoatmospheric Kill Vehicle that allowed us to move forward on this important program that protects the homeland. 
We saw strong bookings in our classified business which includes both domestic and international, and our overall classified bookings increased by 29% in 2014. 
We feel good about the outlook for 2015 and we expect another year with a book-to-bill ratio above 1. International bookings are expected to continue to be strong, representing approximately 1/3 of our total 2015 bookings, driven by opportunities from a broad base of global customers and across a wide range of our products and solutions, including missiles, tactical radars and Command and Control systems. 
In addition, demand for the proven Patriot systems air and missile defense capability continues. New opportunities in Asia and the Middle East as well as competitive awards continue to develop. As I just mentioned, we are close to finalizing a $2 billion Patriot order from an international customer in Q1. We also expect to conclude negotiations on the Patriot upgrade program in South Korea within the next 6 to 9 months. Keep in mind the GEM-T missile upgrade awarded to us in Q3 of 2014 is a precursor for Korea's expected follow-on hardware upgrade to Configuration-3 plus. 
In Europe, Poland is expected to make the final down select for their medium-range integrated air and missile defense competition by the end of this year. Patriot is 1 of 2 systems in the final round of the competition. 
From a domestic perspective, the final agreement on the fiscal year 2015 DoD base budget was reached in December. Modernization accounts came in several billion dollars higher than requested, yielding funding increases for several Raytheon programs. We expect the administration to submit its fiscal year 2016 defense budget request next week. While we won't speculate on what the final funding level for DoD will be in fiscal year 2016, we will point out that even if the Budget Control Act caps are not raised at all, DoD base budget funding will be several billion dollars higher in fiscal year 2016 than fiscal year 2015. While the domestic market is still constrained, the trajectory of the DoD base budget is finally starting to trend upwards. 
We see considerable opportunities in the domestic market. The growing sophistication of the threat to our national security is creating demand for new innovative solutions. As a result, we are investing more to develop the discriminating technologies and differentiated capabilities that will enable us to provide our customers what they need in areas such as missile defense, electronic warfare, high-energy lasers, advanced propulsion and undersea sensors. These investments will position us to capture future franchise programs and lay the foundation for growth. 
Another area where we see continually evolving a persuasive threat is in cyber. In fact, we've seen a nomenclature change for certain areas of the industry. Whereas C3ISR expanded to C4ISR, this is now evolving to C5ISR where the latest C stands for cyber. Consistent with this, many of our customers are turning to us to incorporate the latest cyber protection into their networks and systems so that they are more secure. As always, we stand ready to help our global customers with our advanced cyber capabilities. At the end of the last decade, we began adding to our organic cyber capabilities through acquisitions and we've made a number of cyber-related acquisitions since then, positioning us as a technology leader in this growing market. 
Our latest cyber-related acquisition was Blackbird technologies which we completed in the fourth quarter. Blackbird not only adds unique cyber and other capabilities but also expands key market channels in the special operations and Intel markets for Raytheon. It is a great fit and we welcome their employees to the Raytheon team. 
One of the key strengths of Raytheon is our ongoing commitment to our core values and in 2014, we were recognized for our achievements in the area of ethics and integrity, health and safety and sustainability. We were awarded the 2014 corporate leadership award by Transparency International-USA for our commitment to shape initiatives that promote high business standards, transparency and anticorruption in the U.S. and internationally. We achieved the best safety record in our history, significantly reducing both lost workdays and recordable injuries. 
We received the ENERGY STAR Partner award for an EPA and have been recognized as one of the top green companies in America for our strong greenhouse gas reduction program and sound energy practices. We were also recognized as one of the 100 best corporate citizens by Corporate Responsibility magazine. Our goal is to continue to build on these successes. 
Before wrapping up, I'd like to highlight another significant attribute that we pride ourselves on here at Raytheon: that is having a deep bench of management talent as a result of our strong leadership development and succession planning programs. Over recent weeks, we've made announcements that clearly demonstrate this. I'd like to again congratulate Dave Wajsgras on his new role as President of IIS. Dave has been CFO of Raytheon since 2006. His tenure as CFO has been an integral component of an exceptional period of value creation for the company. His deep industry background and broad experience working with both customers and industry partners will be key in driving the global growth strategy in IIS. Dave will be succeeding Lynn Dugle who will be retiring after serving more than 10 years with the company, including 6 years as a President of IIS where she delivered solid operating results and outstanding leadership. 
I'd also like to welcome Toby O'Brien to his new role as CFO of Raytheon. As many of you know, Toby has been with the company for nearly 30 years and has held a number of business CFO roles in the company. He was CFO at IDS when I led the business. So I've had the pleasure of working with Toby before and look forward to doing so again. I'm confident he'll do a great job. 
In summary, we had another great year at Raytheon and we have a solid outlook for 2015. With that, let me turn it over to Dave."

So during my remarks, I'll be referring to the web slides that we issued earlier this morning which are posted on the Raytheon website. 
Okay, if everyone could please move to Page 3. We delivered solid results in both the quarter and the full year. Fourth quarter operating margin was 14.1% and on an adjusted basis was 13%. For the full year, operating margin was 13.9% and 12.7% on an adjusted basis. Our fourth quarter EPS from continuing operations was $1.86 and on an adjusted basis, was $1.71. For the full year, EPS from continuing operations was $6.97 and our adjusted EPS was $6.12. Our sales for the quarter was $6.1 billion and $22.8 billion for the year. We also generated strong operating cash flow of over $825 million for the quarter and $2.1 billion for the year, after a $600 million pretax discretionary pension contribution which was not in our prior guidance. 
Additionally, the company repurchased 7.7 million shares of common stock for approximately $750 million in 2014. The company ended the year with a strong balance sheet and net debt of $611 million. 
Also, as previously announced, the company acquired Blackbird technologies in the fourth quarter for approximately $425 million. 
If you turn to Page 4, let me go through some of the details of our fourth quarter and full year results. We had strong bookings of $7.1 billion in the quarter and $24.1 billion for the full year, resulting in a year end backlog of $33.6 billion. Our book-to-bill ratio in the quarter was 1.16 and 1.05 for the year, and the company ended 2014 with a funded backlog of $23.1 billion. 
For the quarter, international orders represented 50% of our total company bookings and for the full year, was 35% of total bookings. At the end of 2014, approximately 40% of our total backlog was international. 
Turning now to Page 5. We had fourth quarter sales of $6.1 billion, up 5% over the same period in 2013 and again, was consistent with our expectations. So looking at the businesses, all had higher sales than the same period last year. Net sales at IDS were $1.6 billion in the quarter. Compared to last year's fourth quarter, the increase was primarily due to higher sales on international Patriot programs. 
IIS net sales of $1.5 billion in the quarter were up from the same period last year, primarily due to higher volume on classified programs. 
Missile Systems had fourth quarter 2014 net sales of $1.7 billion, up 5% compared to the fourth quarter of 2013. The increase was primarily due to higher sales on AMRAAM and evolved Sea Sparrow missile programs. And SAS had net sales of $1.7 billion in Q4, higher than the comparable period last year, primarily due to increased sales on an Electronic Warfare systems program. 
For the year, sales were $22.8 billion, down 3.7%, again, consistent with our expectations. International sales growth partially offset a decline in domestic sales. 
So moving ahead to Page 6, we delivered solid operational performance in the quarter and for the full year. Looking at business margins in the quarter, at IDS, IIS and missiles, margins were essentially in-line with or better than last year. In the fourth quarter 2014, IDS achieved some important program milestones and I did briefly discuss this on the call in October. 
And at SAS, fourth quarter 2013 benefited from the timing of profit adjustments. Said another way, SAS had a tough comparison. Also, you may recall that this business had strong third quarter margins in 2014, driven by the timing of performance that we had previously expected in the fourth quarter. It's worth noting that IDS, IIS and SAS, margins all exceed the guidance range that we provided back in October. 
Missile Systems did come in slightly below our guidance, driven by program mix. 
So on Page 7, you'll see both the fourth quarter and full year EPS. In the fourth quarter 2014, our EPS was $1.86 and for the full year was $6.97. And on an adjusted basis, was $1.71 in the fourth quarter and $6.12 for the full year. EPS for the quarter was strong and included the extension of the R&D tax credit which was not in our prior guidance. As I previously mentioned, the company generated strong operating cash flow of $2.1 billion in 2014. Again, this includes the $600 million pretax or $400 million after tax discretionary pension contribution which was also not in our prior guidance. Excluding the net discretionary cash contribution, our operating cash flow in 2014 would have been $2.5 billion. It's worth noting that on this basis, we exceeded the guidance that we provided you on October due to the timing of collections. 
Moving on to the 2015 guidance on Page 8. We see sales in the range of $22.3 million to $22.8 billion flat to slightly down from 2014. As for pension, we see the 2015 FAS/CAS adjustment at a positive $197 million which I'll further discuss in just a minute. We expect net interest expense to be between $225 million to $235 million. We see our average diluted shares outstanding to be between $305 million and $307 million on a full year basis. 
As for our effective tax rate, we expect it to be approximately 27.5%. Our 2015 tax rate is higher than 2014, primarily due to the lapse of the R&D tax credit which, again, is not included in our 2015 guidance. If the R&D tax credit is extended, it would favorably impact the effective tax rate by about 110 basis points and our EPS by approximately $0.10. 
As a reminder, we had an $83 million foreign tax credit in the first quarter of 2014 which also impacted the effective tax rate. And for 2015, we are anticipating a non-cash $88 million tax settlement in the second quarter. 
In 2015, we show our EPS to be in the range of $6.20 to $6.35 and our adjusted EPS to be in the range of $5.49 to $5.64. Our operating cash flow guidance for 2015 is expected to increase to between $2.3 billion and $2.6 billion. 
Before moving to Page 9, I want to mention that we expect the 2015 book-to-bill ratio to be between 1.0x and 1.05x, driven by continued demand from a broad base of domestic and international customers. And we, again, expect stronger bookings in the second half of this year similar to both 2013 and 2014. 
So if you move to Page 9. Here, we provided our initial 2015 guidance by business. Consistent with our prior comments, we expect 2015 adjusted margins to continue to be solid in the 12.1% to 12.3% range. Our margin for 2015 will be impacted by a change in program mix as well as higher investments in technology, with the objective of returning to top line growth. The investments we've made in GaN and cyber are paying off in significant ways today. We fully expect these new investments in radars, directed energy, EW and advanced propulsion to lay the foundation for growth over the next few years. 
At IDS, we see margins in the 15.1% to 15.3% range. The change from 2014 is driven by mix, most notably, the planned completion of some of our international Patriot programs. And in 2015, we are ramping up on several new programs, including Qatar Patriot and the new international Patriot award expected in Q1. As you know, we typically see lower margins at the inception of longer duration programs which can improve over time as we retire risks and drive operational improvements. Longer-term, we see IDS margins improving after 2015 as the overall business mix improves and as these new large international programs progress through the production cycle. 
Additionally, you should note that we expect IIS margins of 7.4% to 7.6% to be impacted by approximately 60 basis points due to the Blackbird Technologies acquisition related cost. Excluding these, IIS margins would be in the range of 8% to 8.2%. 
SAS margins are expected to be down, driven by mix from lower volume as a result of completing some international programs as well as some higher business investments in 2015. 
Looking ahead, from a company level perspective, as domestic development programs transition to production and our international programs mature, we do see opportunity to improve margins in 2016 and beyond. 
If you'd now turn to Page 10. We've provided you with our 2015 outlook by quarter. You'll notice the sales ramp throughout the year. In addition, the second quarter EPS is favorably impacted due to the previously mentioned non-cash $88 million tax settlement. 
And finally, on Page 11. As we've done in the past, we provided a summary of the financial impact from pensions in 2014 as well as the projected 2015 through 2017 impact, holding all assumptions constant. 
As I mentioned earlier, we see the 2015 FAS/CAS adjustment at a positive $197 million which reflects our investment returns in 2014 of over 6% on our U.S. pension assets and the December 31 discount rate of 4.1%. The discount rate is down 100 basis points from last year. 
Further, we reduced our long-term return on asset assumptions from 8.75% to 8% due to a change in the allocation of our planned assets and related investment strategies. 
Taken together, these result in a lower favorable FAS/CAS pension impact in 2015 compared to '14. 
Looking beyond 2015, it's important to keep in mind for each 25 basis point change in the discount rate, a result of $65 million to $75 million change in FAS/CAS takes place. 
Lastly, required pension contributions are decreasing in the near term as CAS recovery is increasing. This has a favorable impact on our pretax net cash flow over the forecast horizon. 
Before concluding, I would also like to take this opportunity to congratulate Toby on his promotion. I've worked with Toby for 9 years and I can tell you that he understands Raytheon, has a strong network and is well-respected across the entire company. He has a deep understanding of finance, the industry and our customers and he also has a strong commercial background, having been the CFO of Raytheon Aircraft for close to 5 years. His extensive and broad background provides a strong foundation for his and Raytheon's future success. Now on a personal note, I would like to mention that it's been great to work with all of you since joining Raytheon, and I'm looking very forward to my new role. I'm sure I'll see you at future Raytheon events. 
Let me conclude by saying that in 2014, Raytheon, again, delivered solid operating performance with bookings, margins, earnings and operating cash flow, all on or ahead of expectations. Book-to-bill was strong and our international business continues to grow. We have a strong balance sheet which gives us substantial flexibility and options to continue to drive shareholder value. With that, we'll open up the call to questions."

And for 2015, adjusting for the earlier collections, the range would be $2.4 billion to $2.7 billion.

So again, we're projecting 12.1% to 12.3%. Now there's a number of areas that are important to mention here. Firstly, there is the program mix, particularly at IDS. And we talked about the cadence of the longer duration production programs coming down in '15 as we start out on the new programs that we were recently awarded and fully expect to be awarded in the first quarter and throughout the year. Secondly and maybe more importantly, we are increasing our spend in IRAD and program investments. Lastly, we closed out the year last year with IRAD at just a little over 2% of sales. And as we look at 2015, we expect it to be closer to 3% of sales and those are important technology investments that Tom addressed earlier that positions us well for both the top line and bottom line growth. And then lastly, we mentioned this a little earlier as well, IIS, the acquisition of Blackbird Technologies, from an IIS standpoint, there's about 60 basis points of impact from the amortization of acquisition cost through intangibles. And at the company level, that's about 15 to 20 basis points. Now what I just went through, there is an offset there. There continues to be a higher productivity as a result of the focused efforts throughout the company.

There are many things that can impact margins but really, the story with IDS margins in 2015 is driven by mix, program mix and timing. And I think the thing to understand is that we've seen this before a few years ago, where IDS margins did fluctuate year-over-year and then they did come back, okay? And at that point in time, it was the same thing, it was a combination of the mix and the timing related to the program completions and program startups, the same things that are impacting us here in 2015.

Raytheon concluded 2014 with a strong fourth quarter, driven by global demand for advanced technologies and solid executions across the company. Bookings were better than expected at $7.1 billion, yielding a book-to-bill ratio of 1.16 for Q4. Sales were up nearly 5% in the quarter as both domestic and international sales increased, and cash flow and margins were strong as well. 
These results were made possible by the dedicated efforts of the entire Raytheon team and I want to thank everyone on the team for the strong quarter and solid year. 
As I look back on 2014, I'm pleased with our overall performance. We had a book-to-bill ratio of 1.05 for the year. Bookings of $24.1 billion exceeded the high end of our expectations. 
The company capitalized on key domestic and international opportunities in missile defense, electronic warfare, cybersecurity, C4ISR and training. This highlights our continued alignment with our customers' priorities and our strong competitive position. Furthermore, we're especially proud that we delivered better-than-expected bookings performance, even as one of our anticipated large international Patriot awards moved into the first quarter of 2015. 
Operationally, we continue to focus on reducing costs, improving affordability and delivering strong returns, while at the same time, we follow through on our commitment to invest in our future. As we look forward to 2015, we expect to continue to perform well. Dave will walk you through our 2015 guidance in a few minutes. 
Demand from our broad base of customers continues to drive growth in our international business. Over the past few months, I continue to receive feedback from our international customers and investing in national security remains a top priority, given the global threat environment, and you can see this in both our fourth quarter and full year results. 
Full year 2014 international bookings were up 27% over 2013 and were 35% of the total company bookings. I would note that our international book-to-bill ratio for the year was 1.28 and at 4 -- at the fourth quarter, it was 2.0. So we finished the year with very solid international bookings. 
We saw strong demand across our international portfolio during the year, including bookings from Qatar for Patriot and an air defense operating center; Kuwait for Patriot fire units; Canada for the North Warning System; several countries for AMRAAM; South Korea for GEM-T missiles and the Australia for the Air Warfare Destroyer, among a host of others. 
At the end of Q4, international backlog increased to 40% of our total backlog. Our domestic bookings in 2014 also improved over 2013. We received key awards in training, SM-3, AMRAAM, Tomahawk and the FAA STARS program. We also closed on a key competitive awards, including the family of advanced beyond line of sight terminal. And last summer, we also had successful test of the Exoatmospheric Kill Vehicle that allows us to move forward on this important program that protects the homeland. 
We saw strong bookings in our classified business, which includes both domestic and international, and our overall classified bookings increased by 29% in 2014. 
We feel good about the outlook for 2015 and we expect another year with a book-to-bill ratio above 1. International bookings are expected to continue to be strong, representing approximately 1/3 of our total 2015 bookings, driven by opportunities from a broad base of global customers and across a wide range of our products and solutions, including missiles, tactical radars and Command and Control systems. 
In addition, demand for the proven Patriot systems air and missile defense capability continues. New opportunities in Asia and the Middle East as well as competitive awards in Europe continue to develop. As I just mentioned, we are close to finalizing a $2 billion Patriot order from an international customer in Q1. We also expect to conclude negotiations on a Patriot upgrade program in South Korea within the next 6 to 9 months. Keep in mind the GEM-T missile upgrade awarded to us in Q3 of 2014 is a precursor for Korea's expected follow-on hardware upgrade to Configuration-3 plus. 
In Europe, Poland is expected to make the final down select for their medium-range integrated air and missile defense competition by the end of this year. Patriot is 1 of 2 systems in the final round of the competition. 
From a domestic perspective, the final agreement on the fiscal year 2015 DoD base budget was reached in December. Modernization accounts came in several billion dollars higher than requested, yielding funding increases for several Raytheon programs. We expect the Administration to submit its fiscal year 2016 defense budget request next week. While we won't speculate on what the final funding level for DoD will be in fiscal year 2016, we will point out that even if the Budget Control Act caps are not raised at all, DoD base budget funding will be several billion dollars higher in fiscal year 2016 than fiscal year 2015. While the domestic market is still constrained, the trajectory of the DoD base budget is finally starting to trend upwards. 
We see considerable opportunities in the domestic market. The growing sophistication of the threat to our national security is creating demand for new innovative solutions. As a result, we are investing more to develop the discriminating technologies and differentiated capabilities that will enable us to provide our customers what they need in areas such as missile defense, electronic warfare, high-energy lasers, advanced propulsion and undersea sensors. These investments will position us to capture future franchise programs and lay the foundation for growth. 
Another area where we see continually evolving a pervasive threat is in cyber. In fact, we've seen a nomenclature change for certain areas of the industry. Whereas C3ISR expanded to C4ISR, this is now evolving to C5ISR where the latest C stands for cyber. Consistent with this, many of our customers are turning to us to incorporate the latest cyber protection into their networks and systems so that they are more secure. As always, we stand ready to help our global customers with our advanced cyber capabilities. At the end of the last decade, we began adding to our organic cyber capabilities through acquisitions and we've made a number of cyber-related acquisitions since then, positioning us as a technology leader in this growing market. 
Our latest cyber-related acquisition was Blackbird technologies, which we completed in the fourth quarter. Blackbird not only adds unique cyber and other capabilities but also expands key market channels in the special operations and Intel markets for Raytheon. It is a great fit and we welcome their employees to the Raytheon team. 
One of the key strengths of Raytheon is our ongoing commitment to our core values and in 2014, we were recognized for our achievements in the area of ethics and integrity, health and safety and sustainability. We were awarded the 2014 corporate leadership award by Transparency International-USA for our commitment to shape initiatives that promote high business standards, transparency and anticorruption in the U.S. and internationally. We achieved the best safety record in our history, significantly reducing both lost workdays and recordable injuries. 
We received the ENERGY STAR Partner award for an EPA and have been recognized as one of the top green companies in America for our strong greenhouse gas reduction program and sound energy practices. We were also recognized as one of the 100 best corporate citizens by Corporate Responsibility magazine. Our goal is to continue to build on these successes. 
Before wrapping up, I'd like to highlight another significant attribute that we pride ourselves on here at Raytheon: that is having a deep bench of management talent as a result of our strong leadership development and succession planning programs. Over recent weeks, we've made announcements that clearly demonstrate this. I'd like to again congratulate Dave Wajsgras on his new role as President of IIS. Dave has been CFO of Raytheon since 2006. His tenure as CFO has been an integral component of an exceptional period of value creation for the company. His deep industry background and broad experience working with both customers and industry partners will be key in driving the global growth strategy in IIS. Dave will be succeeding Lynn Dugle who will be retiring after serving more than 10 years with the company, including 6 years as a President of IIS where she delivered solid operating results and outstanding leadership. 
I'd also like to welcome Toby O'Brien to his new role as CFO of Raytheon. As many of you know, Toby has been with the company for nearly 30 years and has held a number of business CFO roles in the company. He was CFO at IDS when I led the business. So I've had the pleasure of working with Toby before and look forward to doing so again. I'm confident he'll do a great job. 
In summary, we had another great year at Raytheon and we have a solid outlook for 2015. With that, let me turn it over to Dave."

I have a few opening remarks, starting with the fourth quarter and full year results, then I'll discuss our outlook for 2015 and after that, we'll open up the call for questions. So during my remarks, I'll be referring to the web slides",1861,"Okay. Thanks, Tom. I have a few opening remarks, starting with the fourth quarter and full year results, then I'll discuss our outlook for 2015 and after that, we'll open up the call for questions. So during my remarks, I'll be referring to the web slides that we issued earlier this morning, which are posted on the Raytheon website. 
Okay, if everyone could please move to Page 3. We delivered solid results in both the quarter and the full year. Fourth quarter operating margin was 14.1% and on an adjusted basis was 13%. For the full year, operating margin was 13.9% and 12.7% on an adjusted basis. Our fourth quarter EPS from continuing operations was $1.86 and on an adjusted basis, was $1.71. For the full year, EPS from continuing operations was $6.97 and our adjusted EPS was $6.12. Our sales for the quarter were $6.1 billion and $22.8 billion for the year. We also generated strong operating cash flow of over $825 million for the quarter and $2.1 billion for the year, after a $600 million pretax discretionary pension contribution, which was not in our prior guidance. 
Additionally, the company repurchased 7.7 million shares of common stock for approximately $750 million in 2014. The company ended the year with a strong balance sheet and net debt of $611 million. 
Also, as previously announced, the company acquired Blackbird technologies in the fourth quarter for approximately $425 million. 
If you turn to Page 4, let me go through some of the details of our fourth quarter and full year results. We had strong bookings of $7.1 billion in the quarter and $24.1 billion for the full year, resulting in a year end backlog of $33.6 billion. Our book-to-bill ratio in the quarter was 1.16 and 1.05 for the year, and the company ended 2014 with a funded backlog of $23.1 billion. 
For the quarter, international orders represented 50% of our total company bookings and for the full year, was 35% of total bookings. At the end of 2014, approximately 40% of our total backlog was international. 
Turning now to Page 5. We had fourth quarter sales of $6.1 billion, up 5% over the same period in 2013 and again, was consistent with our expectations. So looking at the businesses, all had higher sales than the same period last year. Net sales at IDS were $1.6 billion in the quarter. Compared to last year's fourth quarter, the increase was primarily due to higher sales on international Patriot programs. 
IIS net sales of $1.5 billion in the quarter were up from the same period last year, primarily due to higher volume on classified programs. 
Missile Systems had fourth quarter 2014 net sales of $1.7 billion, up 5% compared to the fourth quarter of 2013. The increase was primarily due to higher sales on AMRAAM and evolved Sea Sparrow missile programs. And SAS had net sales of $1.7 billion in Q4, higher than the comparable period last year, primarily due to increased sales on an Electronic Warfare systems program. 
For the year, sales were $22.8 billion, down 3.7%, again, consistent with our expectations. International sales growth partially offset a decline in domestic sales. 
So moving ahead to Page 6, we delivered solid operational performance in the quarter and for the full year. Looking at business margins in the quarter, at IDS, IIS and missiles, margins were essentially in-line with or better than last year. In the fourth quarter 2014, IDS achieved some important program milestones and I did briefly discuss this on the call in October. 
And at SAS, fourth quarter 2013 benefited from the timing of profit adjustments. Said another way, SAS had a tough comparison. Also, you may recall that this business had strong third quarter margins in 2014, driven by the timing of performance that we had previously expected in the fourth quarter. It's worth noting that at IDS, IIS and SAS, margins all exceed the guidance range that we provided back in October. 
Missile Systems did come in slightly below our guidance, driven by program mix. 
So on Page 7, you'll see the both the fourth quarter and full year EPS. In the fourth quarter 2014, our EPS was $1.86 and for the full year was $6.97. And on an adjusted basis, was $1.71 in the fourth quarter and $6.12 for the full year. EPS for the quarter was strong and included the extension of the R&D tax credit, which was not in our prior guidance. As I previously mentioned, the company generated strong operating cash flow of $2.1 billion in 2014. Again, this includes the $600 million pretax or $400 million after tax discretionary pension contribution, which was also not in our prior guidance. Excluding the net discretionary cash contribution, our operating cash flow in 2014 would have been $2.5 billion. It's worth noting that on this basis, we exceeded the guidance that we provided you in October due to the timing of collections. 
Moving on to the 2015 guidance on Page 8. We see sales in the range of $22.3 billion to $22.8 billion, flat to slightly down from 2014. As for pension, we see the 2015 FAS/CAS adjustment at a positive $197 million, which I'll further discuss in just a minute. We expect net interest expense to be between $225 million to $235 million. We see our average diluted shares outstanding to be between $305 million and $307 million on a full year basis. 
As for our effective tax rate, we expect it to be approximately 27.5%. Our 2015 tax rate is higher than 2014, primarily due to the lapse of the R&D tax credit, which, again, is not included in our 2015 guidance. If the R&D tax credit is extended, it would favorably impact the effective tax rate by about 110 basis points and our EPS by approximately $0.10. 
As a reminder, we had an $83 million foreign tax credit in the first quarter of 2014, which also impacted the effective tax rate. And for 2015, we are anticipating a non-cash $88 million tax settlement in the second quarter. 
In 2015, we show our EPS to be in the range of $6.20 to $6.35 and our adjusted EPS to be in the range of $5.49 to $5.64. Our operating cash flow guidance for 2015 is expected to increase to between $2.3 billion and $2.6 billion. 
Before moving to Page 9, I want to mention that we expect the 2015 book-to-bill ratio to be between 1.0x and 1.05x, driven by continued demand from a broad base of domestic and international customers. And we, again, expect stronger bookings in the second half of this year similar to both 2013 and 2014. 
So if you move to Page 9. Here, we provided our initial 2015 guidance by business. Consistent with our prior comments, we expect 2015 adjusted margins to continue to be solid in the 12.1% to 12.3% range. Our margins for 2015 will be impacted by a change in program mix as well as higher investments in technology, with the objective of returning to top line growth. The investments we've made in GaN and cyber are paying off in significant ways today. We fully expect these new investments in radars, directed energy, EW and advanced propulsion to lay the foundation for growth over the next few years. 
At IDS, we see margins in the 15.1% to 15.3% range. The change from 2014 is driven by mix, most notably, the planned completion of some of our international Patriot programs. And in 2015, we are ramping up on several new programs, including Qatar Patriot and the new international Patriot award expected in Q1. As you know, we typically see lower margins at the inception of longer duration programs, which can improve over time as we retire risks and drive operational improvements. Longer-term, we see IDS margins improving after 2015 as the overall business mix improves and as these new large international programs progress through the production cycle. 
Additionally, you should note that we expect IIS margins of 7.4% to 7.6% to be impacted by approximately 60 basis points due to the Blackbird Technologies acquisition related costs. Excluding these, IIS margins would be in the range of 8% to 8.2%. 
SAS margins are expected to be down, driven by mix from lower volume as a result of completing some international programs as well as from higher business investments in 2015. 
Looking ahead, from a company level perspective, as domestic development programs transition to production and our international programs mature, we do see opportunity to improve margins in 2016 and beyond. 
If you'd now turn to Page 10. We've provided you with our 2015 outlook by quarter. You'll notice the sales ramp throughout the year. In addition, the second quarter EPS is favorably impacted due to the previously mentioned non-cash $88 million tax settlement. 
And finally, on Page 11. As we've done in the past, we provided a summary of the financial impact from pensions in 2014 as well as the projected 2015 through 2017 impact, holding all assumptions constant. 
As I mentioned earlier, we see the 2015 FAS/CAS adjustment at a positive $197 million, which reflects our investment returns in 2014 of over 6% on our U.S. pension assets and the December 31 discount rate of 4.1%. The discount rate is down 100 basis points from last year. 
Further, we reduced our long-term return on asset assumptions from 8.75% to 8% due to a change in the allocation of our planned assets and related investment strategies. 
Taken together, these result in a lower favorable FAS/CAS pension impact in 2015 compared to '14. 
Looking beyond 2015, it's important to keep in mind for each 25 basis point change in the discount rate, a result of $65 million to $75 million change in FAS/CAS takes place. 
Lastly, required pension contributions are decreasing in the near term as CAS recovery is increasing. This has a favorable impact on our pretax net cash flow over the forecast horizon. 
Before concluding, I would also like to take this opportunity to congratulate Toby on his promotion. I've worked with Toby for 9 years and I can tell you that he understands Raytheon, has a strong network and is well respected across the entire company. He has a deep understanding of finance, the industry and our customers and he also has a strong commercial background, having been the CFO of Raytheon Aircraft for close to 5 years. His extensive and broad background provides a strong foundation for his and Raytheon's future success. Now on a personal note, I would like to mention that it's been great to work with all of you since joining Raytheon, and I'm looking very forward to my new role. I'm sure I'll see you at future Raytheon events. 
Let me conclude by saying that in 2014, Raytheon, again, delivered solid operating performance with bookings, margins, earnings and operating cash flow, all on or ahead of expectations. Book-to-bill was strong and our international business continues to grow. We have a strong balance sheet which gives us substantial flexibility and options to continue to drive shareholder value. With that, we'll open up the call to questions."

So when you normalize for these 2 items, 2014, we did achieve the high end of our guidance at roughly $2,350,000,000. And for 2015, adjusting for the earlier collections, the range would be $2.4 billion to $2.7 billion.

And we talked about the cadence of the longer duration production programs coming down in '15 as we start out on the new programs that we were recently awarded and fully expect to be awarded in the first quarter and throughout the year.

And as we look at 2015, we expect it to be closer to 3% of sales and that is -- those are important technology investments that Tom addressed earlier that position us well for both the top line and the bottom line growth. And then lastly, we mentioned this a little earlier as well, IIS, the acquisition of Blackbird Technologies, from an IIS standpoint, there's about 60 basis points of impact from the amortization of acquisition cost through intangibles. And at the company level, that's about 15 to 20 basis points. Now what I just went through, there is an offset there. There continues to be higher productivity as a result of the focused efforts throughout the company. But when you stand back and look at this, 2015 is a very strong year and positions us well for 2016 and beyond."

After 2015, we do see opportunity for margins to increase on an adjusted basis, not from only a FAS/CAS basis. And it's driven by a number of different initiatives, in addition to the overall business mix improving over time. Tom and I both talked about strategic sourcing, facility optimization, expanding what we call our Global Business Services, which is our shared service initiative internally. So when you look at all this together, I think you framed it correctly. We do see growing margins in 2016 and beyond.

There are many things that can impact margins but really, the story with IDS margins in 2015 is driven by mix, program mix and timing. And I think the thing to understand is that we've seen this before a few years ago, where IDS margins did fluctuate year-over-year and then they did come back, okay?

So Pete, as Todd mentioned, I won't officially be in the CFO seat here until early March, but capital deployment is something I've spent some time on and given some thought. And Tom and Dave have described our priorities for capital deployment for a while and they've been pretty consistent. And I do believe that our approach has and will continue to serve us and our shareholders well. So bottom line at this point, I don't foresee the need for any meaningful changes to our current approach or priorities. That said, we will continue with an active share repurchase program. We will continue to recommend annual dividend increases to our Board. And given the funded status of the pension plans and where we are now forecasting markets over the next 3 years, we are not currently seeing any need for further discretionary pension contributions. And lastly, as you know, our global growth objective, it's very key to us and will continue to be a priority. And acquisitions that create shareholder value, meaning that they have to make sense economically, they have to fill a gap from a product technology or market channel standpoint. They will become a focus more than they have in prior years and Tom just described Black Border -- Blackbird -- excuse me and that's a good example of an acquisition that met that criteria."

Raytheon concluded 2014 with a strong fourth quarter, driven by global demand for advanced technologies and solid executions across the company.

Raytheon concluded 2014 with a strong fourth quarter, driven by global demand for advanced technologies and solid executions across the company. Bookings were better than expected at $7.1 billion, yielding a book-to-bill ratio of 1.16 for Q4. Sales were up nearly 5% in the quarter as both domestic and international sales increased, and cash flow and margins were strong as well. 
These results were made possible by the dedicated efforts of the entire Raytheon team and I want to thank everyone on the team for the strong quarter and solid year. 
As I look back on 2014, I'm pleased with our overall performance. We had a book-to-bill ratio of 1.05 for the year. Bookings of $24.1 billion exceeded the high end of our expectations. 
The company capitalized on key domestic and international opportunities in missile defense, electronic warfare, cybersecurity, C4ISR and training. This highlights our continued alignment with our customers' priorities and our strong competitive position. Furthermore, we're especially proud that we delivered better-than-expected bookings performance, even as one of our anticipated large international Patriot awards moved into the first quarter of 2015. 
Operationally, we continue to focus on reducing costs, improving affordability and delivering strong returns, while at the same time, we follow through on our commitment to invest in our future. As we look forward to 2015, we expect to continue to perform well. Dave will walk you through our 2015 guidance in a few minutes. 
Demand from our broad base of customers continues to drive growth in our international business. Over the past few months, I continue to receive feedback from our international customers and investing in national security remains a top priority, given the global threat environment, and you can see this in both our fourth quarter and full year results. 
Full year 2014 international bookings were up 27% over 2013 and were 35% of the total company bookings. I would note that our international book-to-bill ratio for the year was 1.28 and at 4 -- at the fourth quarter, it was 2.0. So we finished the year with very solid international bookings. 
We saw strong demand across our international portfolio during the year, including bookings from Qatar for Patriot and an air defense operating center; Kuwait for Patriot fire units; Canada for the North Warning System; several countries for AMRAAM; South Korea for GEM-T missiles and the Australia for the Air Warfare Destroyer, among a host of others. 
At the end of Q4, international backlog increased to 40% of our total backlog. Our domestic bookings in 2014 also improved over 2013. We received key awards in training, SM-3, AMRAAM, Tomahawk and the FAA STARS program. We also closed on a key competitive awards, including the family of advanced beyond line of sight terminal. And last summer, we also had successful test of the Exoatmospheric Kill Vehicle that allows us to move forward on this important program that protects the homeland. 
We saw strong bookings in our classified business, which includes both domestic and international, and our overall classified bookings increased by 29% in 2014. 
We feel good about the outlook for 2015 and we expect another year with a book-to-bill ratio above 1. International bookings are expected to continue to be strong, representing approximately 1/3 of our total 2015 bookings, driven by opportunities from a broad base of global customers and across a wide range of our products and solutions, including missiles, tactical radars and Command and Control systems. 
In addition, demand for the proven Patriot systems air and missile defense capability continues. New opportunities in Asia and the Middle East as well as competitive awards in Europe continue to develop. As I just mentioned, we are close to finalizing a $2 billion Patriot order from an international customer in Q1. We also expect to conclude negotiations on a Patriot upgrade program in South Korea within the next 6 to 9 months. Keep in mind the GEM-T missile upgrade awarded to us in Q3 of 2014 is a precursor for Korea's expected follow-on hardware upgrade to Configuration-3 plus. 
In Europe, Poland is expected to make the final down select for their medium-range integrated air and missile defense competition by the end of this year. Patriot is 1 of 2 systems in the final round of the competition. 
From a domestic perspective, the final agreement on the fiscal year 2015 DoD base budget was reached in December. Modernization accounts came in several billion dollars higher than requested, yielding funding increases for several Raytheon programs. We expect the Administration to submit its fiscal year 2016 defense budget request next week. While we won't speculate on what the final funding level for DoD will be in fiscal year 2016, we will point out that even if the Budget Control Act caps are not raised at all, DoD base budget funding will be several billion dollars higher in fiscal year 2016 than fiscal year 2015. While the domestic market is still constrained, the trajectory of the DoD base budget is finally starting to trend upwards. 
We see considerable opportunities in the domestic market. The growing sophistication of the threat to our national security is creating demand for new innovative solutions. As a result, we are investing more to develop the discriminating technologies and differentiated capabilities that will enable us to provide our customers what they need in areas such as missile defense, electronic warfare, high-energy lasers, advanced propulsion and undersea sensors. These investments will position us to capture future franchise programs and lay the foundation for growth. 
Another area where we see continually evolving a pervasive threat is in cyber. In fact, we've seen a nomenclature change for certain areas of the industry. Whereas C3ISR expanded to C4ISR, this is now evolving to C5ISR where the latest C stands for cyber. Consistent with this, many of our customers are turning to us to incorporate the latest cyber protection into their networks and systems so that they are more secure. As always, we stand ready to help our global customers with our advanced cyber capabilities. At the end of the last decade, we began adding to our organic cyber capabilities through acquisitions and we've made a number of cyber-related acquisitions since then, positioning us as a technology leader in this growing market. 
Our latest cyber-related acquisition was Blackbird technologies, which we completed in the fourth quarter. Blackbird not only adds unique cyber and other capabilities but also expands key market channels in the special operations and Intel markets for Raytheon. It is a great fit and we welcome their employees to the Raytheon team. 
One of the key strengths of Raytheon is our ongoing commitment to our core values and in 2014, we were recognized for our achievements in the area of ethics and integrity, health and safety and sustainability. We were awarded the 2014 corporate leadership award by Transparency International-USA for our commitment to shape initiatives that promote high business standards, transparency and anticorruption in the U.S. and internationally. We achieved the best safety record in our history, significantly reducing both lost workdays and recordable injuries. 
We received the ENERGY STAR Partner award for an EPA and have been recognized as one of the top green companies in America for our strong greenhouse gas reduction program and sound energy practices. We were also recognized as one of the 100 best corporate citizens by Corporate Responsibility magazine. Our goal is to continue to build on these successes. 
Before wrapping up, I'd like to highlight another significant attribute that we pride ourselves on here at Raytheon: that is having a deep bench of management talent as a result of our strong leadership development and succession planning programs. Over recent weeks, we've made announcements that clearly demonstrate this. I'd like to again congratulate Dave Wajsgras on his new role as President of IIS. Dave has been CFO of Raytheon since 2006. His tenure as CFO has been an integral component of an exceptional period of value creation for the company. His deep industry background and broad experience working with both customers and industry partners will be key in driving the global growth strategy in IIS. Dave will be succeeding Lynn Dugle who will be retiring after serving more than 10 years with the company, including 6 years as a President of IIS where she delivered solid operating results and outstanding leadership. 
I'd also like to welcome Toby O'Brien to his new role as CFO of Raytheon. As many of you know, Toby has been with the company for nearly 30 years and has held a number of business CFO roles in the company. He was CFO at IDS when I led the business. So I've had the pleasure of working with Toby before and look forward to doing so again. I'm confident he'll do a great job. 
In summary, we had another great year at Raytheon and we have a solid outlook for 2015. With that, let me turn it over to Dave."

I have a few opening remarks, starting with the fourth quarter and full year results, then I'll discuss our outlook for 2015 and after that, we'll open up the call for questions. So during my remarks, I'll be referring to the web slides that we issued earlier this morning, which are posted on the Raytheon website. 
Okay, if everyone could please move to Page 3. We delivered solid results in both the quarter and the full year. Fourth quarter operating margin was 14.1% and on an adjusted basis was 13%. For the full year, operating margin was 13.9% and 12.7% on an adjusted basis. Our fourth quarter EPS from continuing operations was $1.86 and on an adjusted basis, was $1.71. For the full year, EPS from continuing operations was $6.97 and our adjusted EPS was $6.12. Our sales for the quarter were $6.1 billion and $22.8 billion for the year. We also generated strong operating cash flow of over $825 million for the quarter and $2.1 billion for the year, after a $600 million pretax discretionary pension contribution, which was not in our prior guidance. 
Additionally, the company repurchased 7.7 million shares of common stock for approximately $750 million in 2014. The company ended the year with a strong balance sheet and net debt of $611 million. 
Also, as previously announced, the company acquired Blackbird technologies in the fourth quarter for approximately $425 million. 
If you turn to Page 4, let me go through some of the details of our fourth quarter and full year results. We had strong bookings of $7.1 billion in the quarter and $24.1 billion for the full year, resulting in a year-end backlog of $33.6 billion. Our book-to-bill ratio in the quarter was 1.16 and 1.05 for the year, and the company ended 2014 with a funded backlog of $23.1 billion. 
For the quarter, international orders represented 50% of our total company bookings and for the full year, was 35% of total bookings. At the end of 2014, approximately 40% of our total backlog was international. 
Turning now to Page 5. We had fourth quarter sales of $6.1 billion, up 5% over the same period in 2013 and again, was consistent with our expectations. So looking at the businesses, all had higher sales than the same period last year. Net sales at IDS were $1.6 billion in the quarter. Compared to last year's fourth quarter, the increase was primarily due to higher sales on international Patriot programs. 
IIS net sales of $1.5 billion in the quarter were up from the same period last year, primarily due to higher volume on classified programs. 
Missile Systems had fourth quarter 2014 net sales of $1.7 billion, up 5% compared to the fourth quarter of 2013. The increase was primarily due to higher sales on AMRAAM and evolved Sea Sparrow missile programs. And SAS had net sales of $1.7 billion in Q4, higher than the comparable period last year, primarily due to increased sales on an Electronic Warfare systems program. 
For the year, sales were $22.8 billion, down 3.7%, again, consistent with our expectations. International sales growth partially offset a decline in domestic sales. 
So moving ahead to Page 6, we delivered solid operational performance in the quarter and for the full year. Looking at business margins in the quarter, at IDS, IIS and missiles, margins were essentially in-line with or better than last year. In the fourth quarter 2014, IDS achieved some important program milestones and I did briefly discuss this on the call in October. 
And at SAS, fourth quarter 2013 benefited from the timing of profit adjustments. Said another way, SAS had a tough comparison. Also, you may recall that this business had strong third quarter margins in 2014, driven by the timing of performance that we had previously expected in the fourth quarter. It's worth noting that at IDS, IIS and SAS, margins all exceed the guidance range that we provided back in October. 
Missile Systems did come in slightly below our guidance, driven by program mix. 
So on Page 7, you'll see the both the fourth quarter and full year EPS. In the fourth quarter 2014, our EPS was $1.86 and for the full year was $6.97. And on an adjusted basis, was $1.71 in the fourth quarter and $6.12 for the full year. EPS for the quarter was strong and included the extension of the R&D tax credit, which was not in our prior guidance. As I previously mentioned, the company generated strong operating cash flow of $2.1 billion in 2014. Again, this includes the $600 million pretax or $400 million after tax discretionary pension contribution, which was also not in our prior guidance. Excluding the net discretionary cash contribution, our operating cash flow in 2014 would have been $2.5 billion. It's worth noting that on this basis, we exceeded the guidance that we provided you in October due to the timing of collections. 
Moving on to the 2015 guidance on Page 8. We see sales in the range of $22.3 billion to $22.8 billion, flat to slightly down from 2014. As for pension, we see the 2015 FAS/CAS adjustment at a positive $197 million, which I'll further discuss in just a minute. We expect net interest expense to be between $225 million to $235 million. We see our average diluted shares outstanding to be between $305 million and $307 million on a full year basis. 
As for our effective tax rate, we expect it to be approximately 27.5%. Our 2015 tax rate is higher than 2014, primarily due to the lapse of the R&D tax credit, which, again, is not included in our 2015 guidance. If the R&D tax credit is extended, it would favorably impact the effective tax rate by about 110 basis points and our EPS by approximately $0.10. 
As a reminder, we had an $83 million foreign tax credit in the first quarter of 2014, which also impacted the effective tax rate. And for 2015, we are anticipating a non-cash $88 million tax settlement in the second quarter. 
In 2015, we show our EPS to be in the range of $6.20 to $6.35 and our adjusted EPS to be in the range of $5.49 to $5.64. Our operating cash flow guidance for 2015 is expected to increase to between $2.3 billion and $2.6 billion. 
Before moving to Page 9, I want to mention that we expect the 2015 book-to-bill ratio to be between 1.0x and 1.05x, driven by continued demand from a broad base of domestic and international customers. And we, again, expect stronger bookings in the second half of this year similar to both 2013 and 2014. 
So if you move to Page 9. Here, we provided our initial 2015 guidance by business. Consistent with our prior comments, we expect 2015 adjusted margins to continue to be solid in the 12.1% to 12.3% range. Our margins for 2015 will be impacted by a change in program mix as well as higher investments in technology, with the objective of returning to top line growth. The investments we've made in GaN and cyber are paying off in significant ways today. We fully expect these new investments in radars, directed energy, EW and advanced propulsion to lay the foundation for growth over the next few years. 
At IDS, we see margins in the 15.1% to 15.3% range. The change from 2014 is driven by mix, most notably, the planned completion of some of our international Patriot programs. And in 2015, we are ramping up on several new programs, including Qatar Patriot and the new international Patriot award expected in Q1. As you know, we typically see lower margins at the inception of longer duration programs, which can improve over time as we retire risks and drive operational improvements. Longer-term, we see IDS margins improving after 2015 as the overall business mix improves and as these new large international programs progress through the production cycle. 
Additionally, you should note that we expect IIS margins of 7.4% to 7.6% to be impacted by approximately 60 basis points due to the Blackbird Technologies acquisition related costs. Excluding these, IIS margins would be in the range of 8% to 8.2%. 
SAS margins are expected to be down, driven by mix from lower volume as a result of completing some international programs as well as from higher business investments in 2015. 
Looking ahead, from a company level perspective, as domestic development programs transition to production and our international programs mature, we do see opportunity to improve margins in 2016 and beyond. 
If you'd now turn to Page 10. We've provided you with our 2015 outlook by quarter. You'll notice the sales ramp throughout the year. In addition, the second quarter EPS is favorably impacted due to the previously mentioned non-cash $88 million tax settlement. 
And finally, on Page 11. As we've done in the past, we provided a summary of the financial impact from pensions in 2014 as well as the projected 2015 through 2017 impact, holding all assumptions constant. 
As I mentioned earlier, we see the 2015 FAS/CAS adjustment at a positive $197 million, which reflects our investment returns in 2014 of over 6% on our U.S. pension assets and the December 31 discount rate of 4.1%. The discount rate is down 100 basis points from last year. 
Further, we reduced our long-term return on asset assumptions from 8.75% to 8% due to a change in the allocation of our planned assets and related investment strategies. 
Taken together, these result in a lower favorable FAS/CAS pension impact in 2015 compared to '14. 
Looking beyond 2015, it's important to keep in mind for each 25 basis point change in the discount rate, a result of $65 million to $75 million change in FAS/CAS takes place. 
Lastly, required pension contributions are decreasing in the near term as CAS recovery is increasing. This has a favorable impact on our pretax net cash flow over the forecast horizon. 
Before concluding, I would also like to take this opportunity to congratulate Toby on his promotion. I've worked with Toby for 9 years and I can tell you that he understands Raytheon, has a strong network and is well respected across the entire company. He has a deep understanding of finance, the industry and our customers and he also has a strong commercial background, having been the CFO of Raytheon Aircraft for close to 5 years. His extensive and broad background provides a strong foundation for his and Raytheon's future success. Now on a personal note, I would like to mention that it's been great to work with all of you since joining Raytheon, and I'm looking very forward to my new role. I'm sure I'll see you at future Raytheon events. 
Let me conclude by saying that in 2014, Raytheon, again, delivered solid operating performance with bookings, margins, earnings and operating cash flow, all on or ahead of expectations. Book-to-bill was strong and our international business continues to grow. We have a strong balance sheet which gives us substantial flexibility and options to continue to drive shareholder value. With that, we'll open up the call to questions."

And for 2015, adjusting for the earlier collections, the range would be $2.4 billion to $2.7 billion.

So again, we're projecting 12.1% to 12.3%. Now there's a number of areas that are important to mention here. Firstly, there is the program mix, particularly at IDS. And we talked about the cadence of the longer duration production programs coming down in '15 as we start out on the new programs that we were recently awarded and fully expect to be awarded in the first quarter and throughout the year. Secondly and maybe more importantly, we are increasing our spend in IRAD and program investments. Last -- we closed out the year last year with IRAD at just a little over 2% of sales. And as we look at 2015, we expect it to be closer to 3% of sales and that is -- those are important technology investments that Tom addressed earlier that position us well for both the top line and the bottom line growth. And then lastly, we mentioned this a little earlier as well, IIS, the acquisition of Blackbird Technologies, from an IIS standpoint, there's about 60 basis points of impact from the amortization of acquisition cost through intangibles. And at the company level, that's about 15 to 20 basis points. Now what I just went through, there is an offset there. There continues to be higher productivity as a result of the focused efforts throughout the company.

So in either case, there will be a larger base budget. And as part of that base budget the modernization is also going up. And so we believe that the domestic, we will have some uptick business. We're also seeing -- and that's why we're making some investments this year with the evolving threat out there, there's some opportunities for some -- inserting some new technology in -- starting in '16 and '17. And so that's another area why we're moving forward on that. On the LISC, the LISC is a great win for us. It's a joint venture that we have with General Dynamics, and that does give us insight into the ranges across an entire Air Force. So it's a great program for us there just on the base program itself, but giving us insight into what technologies we can bring to bear to the Air Force to help them as they move forward to get to a more affordable solution for all of the ranges. And then the other major area we have is the Warfighter FOCUS Program in terms of training. And we're working with our customers to ensure they have the appropriate training moving forward to be more efficient and from an affordability perspective."

Now importantly, that's only one element of our overall R&D focus. Every year, we book and bill, essentially, between $1 billion and $1.5 billion of customer funded R&D. And this is another important element of our overall focus on technologies.

Before we get started, I would like to welcome Toby O'Brien to his first  earnings conference call as CFO, a role which he officially assumed on March 2. Toby will walk you through additional details regarding our first quarter financial results in just a moment. 
I am pleased to report that the company delivered solid operating results in the quarter, with sales, EPS and cash flow that are all either in line or ahead of our expectations. Our international business continue to grow in the quarter and represented 28% of total revenue. International also represented 34% of our total bookings in the quarter. And our international backlog was 41% of total backlog at quarter's end.
This backlog percentage will go higher with the $2 billion international Patriot award we announced last week, which was from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. 
I will note that we continue to see strong demand signals beyond our bookings activity for solutions of our global customers. In the quarter and the weeks immediately following, you will see important part of our global growth strategy play out. We've announced significant bookings across our portfolio, particularly in the international Patriot that position the company for future growth. And we announced strategic investment and partnership to harness rapid growth in the global cybersecurity market. Overall, we've made a considerable progress on these 3 fronts and continue to move forward with our growth strategy.
During the quarter, we also raised our dividend by 10.7%, the 11th consecutive annual increase and we remain on track to reduce our shares outstanding for the year. This reflects our long-term trend of returning cash to shareholders, something we will continue to do in line with our balanced capital deployment strategy.
We've come out of the gate strong after the close of the first quarter, with approximately $3 billion in bookings within the initial weeks of the second quarter, including the $2 billion Patriot bookings for Saudi Arabia; and a $507 million booking to upgrade the evolved Sea Sparrow missile, a premiership defense missile for the U.S. Navy and international customers. 
I'd like to take a moment to talk about our Patriot Integrated Air and Missile Defense franchise. Over the past 15 months, we have received nearly $7 billion in bookings for Patriot production and support services from a range of customers. This includes the recent Saudi $2 billion award, as well as the Kuwait, Qatar, South Korea and the U.S. Army. This provides the company with years of production work and backlog and predictability to the manufacturing outlook and the opportunity to achieve higher production efficiencies.
Looking forward, we continue to see significant opportunities for Patriot. Earlier this week, we were notified that the Patriot was selected by Poland, for their medium-range, integrated air and missile defense system. We'll be working with our Polish customer on the final offering and anticipate receiving a booking in 2016. 
Additionally, we're in the final down select process in Germany. If selected, we anticipate this will also translate into a booking opportunity in 2016. 
Patriot continues to evolve, ensuring that it will be capable in meeting next-generation threats. Over the next few years, you will see us in collaboration with our current and future customers with new capabilities, including our 360-degree capability and other enhancements. These capabilities will position Patriot to be the leading integrated air and missile defense solution for the next several decades. 
As you know, Raytheon is much more than just Patriot. And to that point, we've seen considerable recent order activity domestically and internationally across a wide range of our systems and products, particularly in our missiles business. Demand for missiles is being driven by the evolving threats, as well as our incorporation of technological advances into our products. One example of this is AMRAAM, where we received a $539 million award in the first quarter for the latest version of the missile. We received a similar sized award in December of last year, so within the past 6 months alone, we have received more than $1 billion in orders for AMRAAM.
We continue to make important progress on many other key programs that will drive future growth. For example, on small diameter Bomb 2, the premier precision weapon for both current and next-generation platforms, we competed systems verification review in early April. This sets the stage for milestones C, which will complete the development phase, allowing the program to move into low rate, initial production.
Our Next Generation Jammer program remains a significant part of our electronic warfare initiative. The program continues to execute on or ahead of schedule and cost and also completed key testing milestones in the quarter.
Turning to our broader market perspective, domestically I'm encouraged by recent developments on the fiscal year '16 defense budget process, for both the Administration and Congress have presented initial budget proposals that could exceed previously established budget caps. Many of our leaders agree that the cap levels are not sufficient to contend with today's dynamic threat environment, and are therefore seeking ways to add more resources.
While we won't speculate on what the final funding level for the DoD will be in 2016, even if the budget control caps are not raised at all, the DoD base budget funding will be several billion dollars higher in 2016 than 2015. Bottom line is, the trajectory of the DoD base budget is finally starting to trend upward.
Late in the first quarter, we announced a settlement with the U.K. Home Office relating to Raytheon Systems Limited eBorders contract. Under this settlement, we received a cash payment equal to approximately $226 million in exchange for the resolution of all claims and counterclaims of both parties.
Toby will walk you through the details in his remarks.
As we announced earlier this week, consistent with our strategy to position Raytheon for global growth, we are now entering into a partnership with Vista Equity Partners, combining their premier commercial cybersecurity business, Websense, with Raytheon's Cyber Products to form a new company. This new company will provide a broad set of integrated, defense-grade, cybersecurity products and services to the global marketplace.
We are very excited about this opportunity. We see significant revenue synergies and look forward to closing some time late in the second quarter.
In conclusion, I am pleased with our performance in the first quarter, progress in setting the foundation for future global growth. And I'd like to thank our employees for their hard work and dedication for this great start of the year. With that, let me turn it over to Toby."

I have a few opening remarks, starting with the first quarter highlights, and then we'll move on to questions. During my remarks, I'll be referring to the web slides that we issued earlier this morning.If everyone would turn to Page 3",1565,"Okay. Thanks, Tom. I have a few opening remarks, starting with the first quarter highlights, and then we'll move on to questions. During my remarks, I'll be referring to the web slides that we issued earlier this morning.
If everyone would turn to Page 3. We are pleased with the solid performance the team delivered in the first quarter, with sales, EPS and operating cash flow all at or better than our expectations. It's a good start to the year and we're positioned well for achieving our full year outlook. 
Our EPS from continuing operations was $1.78. And on an adjusted basis, EPS was $1.26. I'll discuss this in more detail in just a moment. 
Operating margin was solid at 15.9% and included the previously announced eBorders settlement with the U.K. Home Office.
And on an adjusted basis, our operating margin was 11.5%. 
Sales of $5.3 billion were slightly higher than our guidance. During the quarter, the company bought back 2.8 million shares of common stock under the share repurchase program for $300 million. And we announced last month that we increased our dividend by 10.7%. We have now raised our annual dividend every year for the past 11 years. 
I also want to point out that we're raising the guidance that we provided in January to include the eBorders settlement. I'll discuss guidance further in just a few minutes.
Turning now to Page 4. Let me start by providing some detail on our first quarter results. Company bookings for the first quarter were $4.5 billion. International awards represented 34% of the total. And on a trailing 4 quarter basis, the book-to-bill ratio is 1.07.
A couple of key bookings in the first quarter included a $769 million award for Patriot from the Republic of Korea; and a $539 million award for AMRAAM for the U.S. Air Force, U.S. Navy and international customers. And as Tom mentioned a few minutes ago, just after the end of the first quarter, we received significant orders from both domestic and international customers. We're off to a strong start in the second quarter. And the year-to-date bookings will help drive our second half performance.
Backlog at the end of the first quarter was $32.5 billion; and on a funded basis, was $23.7 billion, an increase of almost $1 billion compared to the first quarter of 2014.
It's worth noting that we ended the first quarter of 2015 with approximately 41% of our backlog now comprised of international programs.
If you'd now move to Page 5. As I just mentioned, for the first quarter 2015, sales were slightly higher than the guidance we set in January. As a reminder, the first quarter of 2015 had one less work day than the first quarter of 2014, and this equates to about $100 million in sales overall. As we said in January, we expected the first quarter to be the most challenging. We still expect sales to ramp up throughout the year. 
Looking now at sales by business. IDS had first quarter 2015 net sales of $1.4 billion. The change from Q1 2014 was primarily due to the planned completion of certain production phases on international Patriot programs. We expect IDS sales to increase as we move through the year, as the recently awarded Patriot international programs begin to ramp up. 
In the first quarter of 2015, IIS had net sales of $1.4 billion. Compared with the same quarter last year, the change is primarily due to our training programs. 
Missile Systems had first quarter 2015 net sales of $1.5 billion. The change from the first quarter 2014 was primarily due to both the Tomahawk and SM-3 programs. And SAS had net sales of $1.4 billion. Secure Communication Systems programs contributed to the change versus last year. 
Moving ahead to Page 6. We were pleased by our overall company margins. Our operating margin was 15.9%. And on an adjusted basis, was 11.5%.
As a reminder, our first quarter 2015 adjusted margin excludes both the favorable FAS/CAS adjustment, which was worth 90 basis points or $0.10 per share; and 340 basis points, or $0.42 per share, for the eBorders settlement. And as we discussed on the last earnings call in January, compared to 2014, we expect our margins for 2015 will be impacted by a change in program mix, as well as higher IR&D and program investments. We continue to invest in ourselves with the objective of positioning the company for future growth. 
So looking at the business margins. The change in margin at IDS was primarily driven by a change in program mix on international Patriot programs nearing completion. IAS margin in the first quarter 2015 benefited from the eBorders settlement that I previously discussed, which contributed $181 million to operating income.
Without the settlement, IIS margins would be 7.5% or in line with our expectations. 
Missiles margin was up in the quarter compared to the same period last year. This year's first quarter benefited from a $25 million or approximately 170 basis point favorable resolution of a contractual issue, which was previously expected later in the year.
And SAS margin of 12.7% was down compared to the same period last year, primarily driven by higher net program efficiencies in the first quarter of 2014. 
Overall, the company continues to perform well. 
Turning now to Page 7. First quarter 2015 EPS was $1.78, and on adjusted basis was $1.26. EPS for the first quarter 2015 was better than expected, primarily due to the e-Borders settlement and from timing at missiles. 
On Page 8, we are updating the company's financial outlook for 2015, which now includes the impact of the e-Borders settlement.
As Tom mentioned, earlier in the week we announced the Websense transaction. We expect this transaction to close late in the second quarter and we will update our financial guidance subsequent to the closing.
We still expect our full year 2015 net sales to be in the range of between $22.3 billion and $22.8 billion. We have raised our full year 2015 EPS, which is now expected to be in a range of between $6.67 and $6.82. We expect adjusted EPS to be within a range of between $5.49 and $5.64, which is unchanged from our prior guidance. As a reminder, we have not included the possible extension of the R&D tax credit in our 2015 guidance. If the legislation passes, it would favorably impact the effective tax rate by about 110 basis points and our EPS by about $0.10.
As I mentioned earlier, we repurchased 2.8 million of common stock for $300 million in the quarter, and continue to see our diluted share count in the range of between $305 million and $307 million for 2015, a 2% reduction at the midpoint of the range. 
Operating cash flow for the quarter was in line with our prior guidance. As a result of the e-Borders settlement, we now see our 2015 guidance for operating cash flow to be between $2.4 billion and $2.7 billion. We received the settlement payment in the second quarter.
And as you can see on Page 9, we've included guidance by business, which is unchanged from our prior outlook, except for IIS and total company margin, which now include the e-Borders settlement.
On Page 10, we provided some directional guidance on how we currently see the quarterly cadence for sales, EPS and operating cash flow for the balance of 2015. As we discussed on the call in January, sales are expected to ramp up throughout the year. In the first half of 2015, we still expect sales to be down on a percentage basis. Sales in the back half of the year are expected to be in line to slightly up versus 2014. And if you compare second half sales to  first half sales, we expect to see mid-single digit growth. As you may recall, our 2014 bookings finished strong, particularly with respect to international. This, taken together with the combined first quarter and early second quarter 2015 bookings, are all key drivers of our second half sales expectations.
And as we discussed on the January call, our effective tax rate in the second quarter is expected to be impacted by a favorable noncash tax settlement of $88 million or $0.29 per diluted share. 
Before concluding, I'd like to spend a minute to talk about our capital deployment strategy. We expect to continue to generate strong free cash flow and maintain a strong balance sheet going forward. We will remain focused on deploying capital to create value for our shareholders, including internal investments to support our growth plans, as well as share buybacks and dividend increases that are subject to board approval.  And as we sit here today, possibly smaller targeted acquisitions that fit our technology and global growth needs. 
In summary, we saw good performance in the first quarter. We continue to execute well. Our bookings were ahead of last year's first quarter. And sales, EPS and operating cash flow from operations were all in line or higher than the guidance we set in January. 
We remain well positioned with our domestic customer's priority areas and continue to be aligned with the evolving priorities of our international customers. Our objective is to drive the business to maximize value for our customers and shareholders. 
With that, Tom and I will now open up the call for questions."

Number one, one of the strategies that IIS is actually executing very well is to expand its cybercapabilities and core competencies into both the international and now the Commercial Markets space. As we discussed on prior calls that we have had some significant wins on the international marketplace. And so we're showing that we're globally competitive in the cyber arena. So we're seeing an expansion in that area. We're also seeing them expand in their training worldwide. And some of it's under their Warfire focused program, but we're also expanding into other areas of training in the International markets with the requisite international governments. So that's another big area that they're moving out on. The other play is essentially upgrading a lot of the systems that are out there, in terms of adding in Information Assurance capability, taking the knowledge that they've gained from the GPS Soci X program and leveraging that into other programs. And then the last one is, hopefully you've been watching and noticing that they've been winning quite a few programs out there. For example, they won the program. The only just won the NES program. So they've been winning more than their fair shares of programs. And we're very, I would say, upbeat relative to IIS and their ability to grow and exceed the industry in their area in terms of growth."

And then I also mentioned previously the upgrade for the 360 radar, that will be a new upgrade for all the Patriot systems, and there's over 200 of those radars to be upgraded. So I think the way of looking at it is that these 14 countries are a market surrounded around Patriot. And so we are working with those customers to continually to upgrade those systems, to counter the evolving threat. So there's a base program that does software upgrade and other things as the threat changes and that we work across those countries. And then also as new technology comes onboard to improve the capability of the system, we then insert that technology across those 14 countries of Patriot systems. So essentially, it's a market on its own that we look to continually to upgrade and provide a support activity. So it's a great franchise business. And it also does, for the customers, it allows them to share in the cost for any software upgrades for the evolving threat. And then also to share in the cost of the development of new technology.

So essentially, it's replenishing the backlog for that factory and allowing us to gain those efficiencies as we move forward. So that's the good news on either. But don't forget, IDS was also once major programs. For example, the air and missile defense program that they have, that they're often running, they also have won the 3 dealer, which is in process. So in addition to the Patriot franchise, getting reinvented to a certain extent and all the upgrade potential for it, they also have some brand-new franchises that are on the horizon that they have in hand. The AMDR is in development. That's going to be transitioning into production, that's going to go into U.S. domestic and international coalition partners.

Before we get started, I'd like to welcome Toby O'Brien to his first earnings conference call as CFO, a role which he officially assumed on March 2.

Before we get started, I'd like to welcome Toby O'Brien to his first earnings conference call as CFO, a role which he officially assumed on March 2. Toby will walk you through additional details regarding our first quarter financial results in just a moment. 
I'm pleased to report that the company delivered solid operating results in the quarter, with sales, EPS and cash flow that were all either in line or ahead of our expectations. Our international business continued to grow in the quarter and represented 28% of total revenue. International also represented 34% of our total bookings in the quarter, and our international backlog was 41% of total backlog at quarter's end.
This backlog percentage will go higher with the $2 billion international Patriot award we announced last week, which was from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. 
I will note that we continue to see strong demand signals beyond our recent bookings activity for solutions from our global customers. In the quarter and the weeks immediately following, you will see important parts of our global growth strategy play out. We've announced significant recent bookings across our portfolio, particularly in the international Patriot, that position the company for future growth. And we announced strategic investment and partnership to harness rapid growth in the global cybersecurity market. Overall, we've made a considerable progress on these 3 fronts and continue to move forward with our growth strategy.
During the quarter, we also raised our dividend by 10.7%, the 11th consecutive annual increase, and we remain on track to reduce our shares outstanding for the year. This reflects our long-term trend of returning cash to shareholders, something we will continue to do in line with our balanced capital deployment strategy.
We've come out of the gate strong after the close of the first quarter with approximately $3 billion in bookings within the initial weeks of the second quarter, including the $2 billion Patriot booking from Saudi Arabia and a $507 million booking to upgrade the evolved Sea Sparrow missile, a premier ship defense missile for the U.S. Navy and international customers. 
I'd like to take a moment to talk about our Patriot integrated air and missile defense franchise. Over the past 15 months, we have received nearly $7 billion in bookings for Patriot production and support services from a range of customers. This includes the recent Saudi $2 billion award as well as the Kuwait, Qatar, South Korea and the U.S. Army. This provides the company with years of production work and backlog and predictability to the manufacturing outlook and the opportunity to achieve higher production efficiencies.
Looking forward, we continue to see significant opportunities for Patriot. Earlier this week, we were notified that the Patriot was selected by Poland for their medium-range integrated air and missile defense system. We'll be working with our Polish customer on the final offering and anticipate receiving a booking in 2016. 
Additionally, we're in the final down-select process in Germany. If selected, we anticipate that this will also translate into a booking opportunity in 2016. 
Patriot continues to evolve, ensuring that it will be capable of meeting next-generation threats. Over the next few years, you'll see us in collaboration with our current and future customers and new capabilities, including a 360-degree AESA radar capability and other enhancements. These capabilities will position Patriot to be the leading integrated air and missile defense solution for the next several decades. 
But as you know, Raytheon is much more than just Patriot. And to that point, we've seen considerable recent order activity domestically and internationally across a wide range of our systems and products, particularly in our missiles business. Demand for missiles is being driven by the evolving threats as well as our incorporation of technological advances into our products. One example of this is AMRAAM, where we received a $539 million award in the first quarter for the latest version of the missile. We received a similar sized award in December of last year. So within the past 6 months alone, we have received more than $1 billion in orders for AMRAAM.
We continue to make important progress on many other key programs that will drive future growth. For example, on Small Diameter Bomb II, the premier precision weapon for both current and next-generation platforms, we competed systems verification review in early April. This sets the stage for Milestone C, which will be -- complete the development phase, allowing the program to move into low-rate initial production.
Our Next Generation Jammer program remains a significant part of our electronic warfare initiative. The program continues to execute on or ahead of schedule and cost and also completed key testing milestones in the quarter.
Turning to a broader market perspective, domestically, I'm encouraged by recent developments on the fiscal year '16 defense budget process, where both the Administration and Congress have presented initial budget proposals that could exceed previously established budget caps. Many of our leaders agree that the cap levels are not sufficient to contend with today's dynamic threat environment and are therefore seeking ways to add more resources.
While we won't speculate on what the final funding level for DoD will be in 2016, even if the Budget Control Act caps are not raised at all, the DoD base budget funding will be several billion dollars higher in 2016 than 2015. Bottom line is, the trajectory of the DoD base budget is finally starting to trend upward.
Late in the first quarter, we announced a settlement with the U.K. Home Office relating to Raytheon Systems Limited eBorders contract. Under this settlement, we received a cash payment equal to approximately $226 million in exchange for the resolution of all claims and counterclaims of both parties. Toby will walk you through the details in his remarks.
As we announced earlier this week, consistent with our strategy to position Raytheon for global growth, we are now entering into a partnership with Vista Equity Partners, combining their premier commercial cybersecurity business, Websense, with Raytheon's Cyber Products to form a new company. This new company will provide a broad set of integrated defense-grade cybersecurity products and services to the global marketplace.
We are very excited about this opportunity. We see significant revenue synergies and look forward to closing sometime late in the second quarter.
In conclusion, I'm pleased with our performance in the first quarter, progress in setting the foundation for future global growth. And I'd like to thank our employees for their hard work and dedication for this great start to the year.
With that, let me turn it over to Toby."
105612,291306765,792993,"Raytheon Company, Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2015",2015-04-23,"Earnings Calls","Raytheon Company","Executives","Okay. Thanks, Tom. I have a few opening remarks, starting with the first quarter highlights, and then we'll move on to questions. During my remarks, I'll be referring to the web slides that we issued earlier this morning.If everyone would turn to Page 3",1567,"Okay. Thanks, Tom. I have a few opening remarks, starting with the first quarter highlights, and then we'll move on to questions. During my remarks, I'll be referring to the web slides that we issued earlier this morning.
If everyone would turn to Page 3. We are pleased with the solid performance the team delivered in the first quarter, with sales, EPS and operating cash flow all at or better than our expectations. It's a good start to the year and we're positioned well for achieving our full year outlook. 
Our EPS from continuing operations was $1.78, and on an adjusted basis, EPS was $1.26. I'll discuss this in more detail in just a moment. 
Operating margin was solid at 15.9% and included the previously announced eBorders settlement with the U.K. Home Office. And on an adjusted basis, our operating margin was 11.5%. 
Sales of $5.3 billion were slightly higher than our guidance. During the quarter, the company bought back 2.8 million shares of common stock under the share repurchase program for $300 million. And we announced last month that we increased our dividend by 10.7%. We have now raised our annual dividend every year for the past 11 years. 
I also want to point out that we're raising the guidance that we provided in January to include the eBorders settlement. I'll discuss guidance further in just a few minutes.
Turning now to Page 4. Let me start by providing some detail on our first quarter results. Company bookings for the first quarter were $4.5 billion. International awards represented 34% of the total. And on a trailing 4-quarter basis, the book-to-bill ratio is 1.07.
A couple of key bookings in the first quarter included a $769 million award for Patriot from the Republic of Korea and a $539 million award for AMRAAM for the U.S. Air Force, U.S. Navy and international customers. And as Tom mentioned a few minutes ago, just after the end of the first quarter, we received significant orders from both domestic and international customers. We're off to a strong start in the second quarter and the year-to-date bookings will help drive our second half performance.
Backlog at the end of the first quarter was $32.5 billion and on a funded basis was $23.7 billion, an increase of almost $1 billion compared to the first quarter 2014.
It's worth noting that we ended the first quarter of 2015 with approximately 41% of our backlog now comprised of international programs.
If you'd now move to Page 5. As I just mentioned, for the first quarter 2015, sales were slightly higher than the guidance we set in January. As a reminder, the first quarter of 2015 had one less work day than the first quarter of 2014, and this equates to about $100 million in sales overall. As we said in January, we expected the first quarter to be the most challenging. We still expect sales to ramp up throughout the year. 
Looking now at sales by business. IDS had first quarter 2015 net sales of $1.4 billion. The change from Q1 2014 was primarily due to the planned completion of certain production phases on international Patriot programs. We expect IDS sales to increase as we move through the year as the recently awarded Patriot international programs begin to ramp up. 
In the first quarter 2015, IIS had net sales of $1.4 billion. Compared with the same quarter last year, the change was primarily due to our training programs. 
Missile Systems had first quarter 2015 net sales of $1.5 billion. The change from the first quarter 2014 was primarily due to both the Tomahawk and SM-3 programs. And SAS had net sales of $1.4 billion. Secure communication systems programs contributed to the change versus last year. 
Moving ahead to Page 6. We were pleased by our overall company margins. Our operating margin was 15.9% and on an adjusted basis was 11.5%.
As a reminder, our first quarter 2015 adjusted margin excludes both the favorable FAS/CAS adjustment, which was worth 90 basis points or $0.10 per share, and 340 basis points or $0.42 per share for the eBorders settlement. And as we discussed on the last earnings call in January, compared to 2014, we expect our margins for 2015 will be impacted by a change in program mix as well as higher IR&D and program investments. We continue to invest in ourselves with the objective of positioning the company for future growth. 
So looking at the business margins. The change in margin at IDS was primarily driven by a change in program mix on international Patriot programs nearing completion. IIS margin in the first quarter 2015 benefited from the eBorders settlement that I previously discussed, which contributed $181 million to operating income. Without the settlement, IIS margins would be 7.5% or in line with our expectations. 
Missiles margin was up in the quarter compared to the same period last year. This year's first quarter benefited from a $25 million or approximately 170 basis point favorable resolution of a contractual issue, which was previously expected later in the year.
And SAS margin of 12.7% was down compared to the same period last year, primarily driven by higher net program efficiencies in the first quarter of 2014. 
Overall, the company continues to perform well. 
Turning now to Page 7. First quarter 2015 EPS was $1.78 and on an adjusted basis was $1.26. EPS for the first quarter 2015 was better than expected, primarily due to the eBorders settlement and from timing at missiles. 
On Page 8, we are updating the company's financial outlook for 2015, which now includes the impact of the eBorders settlement.
As Tom mentioned, earlier in the week, we announced the Websense transaction. We expect this transaction to close late in the second quarter and we will update our financial guidance subsequent to the closing.
We still expect our full year 2015 net sales to be in the range of between $22.3 billion and $22.8 billion. We have raised our full year 2015 EPS, which is now expected to be in a range of between $6.67 and $6.82. We expect adjusted EPS to be within a range of between $5.49 and $5.64, which is unchanged from our prior guidance. As a reminder, we have not included the possible extension of the R&D tax credit in our 2015 guidance. If the legislation passes, it would favorably impact the effective tax rate by about 110 basis points and our EPS by about $0.10.
As I mentioned earlier, we repurchased 2.8 million of common stock for $300 million in the quarter and continue to see our diluted share count in the range of between 305 million and 307 million shares for 2015, a 2% reduction at the midpoint of the range. 
Operating cash flow in the quarter was in line with our prior guidance. As a result of the eBorders settlement, we now see our 2015 guidance for operating cash flow to be between $2.4 billion and $2.7 billion. We received the settlement payment in the second quarter.
And as you can see on Page 9, we've included guidance by business, which is unchanged from our prior outlook, except for IIS and total company margin, which now include the eBorders settlement.
On Page 10, we provided some directional guidance on how we currently see the quarterly cadence for sales, EPS and operating cash flow for the balance of 2015. As we discussed on the call in January, sales are expected to ramp up throughout the year. In the first half of 2015, we still expect sales to be down on a percentage basis. Sales in the back half of the year are expected to be in line to slightly up versus 2014. And if you compare second half sales to first half sales, we expect to see mid single-digit growth. As you may recall, our 2014 bookings finished strong, particularly with respect to international. This, taken together with the combined first quarter and early second quarter 2015 bookings, are all key drivers of our second half sales expectations.
And as we discussed on the January call, our effective tax rate in the second quarter is expected to be impacted by a favorable noncash tax settlement of $88 million or $0.29 per diluted share. 
Before concluding, I'd like to spend a minute to talk about our capital deployment strategy. We expect to continue to generate strong free cash flow and maintain a strong balance sheet going forward. We will remain focused on deploying capital to create value for our shareholders, including internal investments to support our growth plans as well as share buybacks and dividend increases that are subject to board approval, and as we sit here today, possibly smaller targeted acquisitions that are -- that fit our technology and global growth needs. 
In summary, we saw good performance in the first quarter. We continue to execute well. Our bookings were ahead of last year's first quarter, and sales, EPS and operating cash flow from operations were all in line or higher than the guidance we set in January. 
We remain well positioned with our domestic customers' priority areas and continue to be aligned with the evolving priorities of our international customers. Our objective is to drive the business to maximize value for our customers and shareholders. 
With that, Tom and I will now open up the call for questions."

And so we're seeing expansion in that area. We're also seeing them expand in their training worldwide and some of it's under the Warfighter FOCUS program. But we're also expanding into other areas of training into international markets with the requisite international governments. So that's another big area that they're moving out on. The other play is essentially upgrading a lot of the systems that are out there in terms of adding in, in information assurance capability, taking the knowledge that they've gained from the GPS OCX program and leveraging that into other programs. And then the last one is, hopefully, you've been watching and noticing that they've been winning quite a few programs out there in -- for example, they won the LISC program.

The area, and this is actually part of our strategy, is an investment we call new emerging areas. So we are investing in new-generation radars, high-energy lasers, hypersonics.

That was for the development and demonstration of technologies to enable air-launched tactical-range hypersonic boost glide systems.

There are also the upgrade capabilities with each of the partner countries that have the Patriot System. And right now, we've been doing something called Configuration-3 Plus. You may have heard us talk about that on some of the calls. That's a major upgrade to the Patriot System that we are off and working with the -- our customers on. And as of today, there's 72 fire units that are still there for upgrade potential and we are working with those customers to upgrade those systems. And then I also mentioned previously the upgrade for the 360 AESA radar. That will be a new upgrade for all the Patriot Systems, and there's over 200 of those radars to be upgraded. So I think the way of looking at it is that these 14 countries are a market surrounded around Patriot, and so we are working with those customers to continually to upgrade those systems to counter the evolving threat. So there's a base program that does software upgrades and other things as the threat changes and that we work across those countries. And then also as new technology comes onboard to improve the capability of the system, we then insert that technology across those 14 countries' Patriot Systems. So essentially, it's a market on its own that we look to continually to upgrade and provide a support activity. So it's a great franchise business. And it also does, for the customers, it allows them to share in the cost for any software upgrades for the evolving threat and then also to share in the cost of the development of new technology. So it's a great win-win situation for both sides."

So essentially, it's replenishing the backlog for that factory and allowing us to gain those efficiencies as you move forward. So that's a good news on IDS. But don't forget, IDS has also won some major programs. For example, the air and missile defense radar program that they have, they're off and running. They also have won the 3DELRR, which is in protest. So in addition to the Patriot franchise getting reinvented to a certain extent and all the upgrade potential for it, they also have some brand-new franchises that are on the horizon that they have in hand and that the AMDR is in development. That's going to be transitioning into production. That's going to go into both U.S. domestic and also international coalition partners. And then we have the 3DELRR, which is in protest right now. But when that comes out of protest, assuming Raytheon's on the right side of that, that is another program that has a significant -- actually, it was set up by OSD to be an international program on day 1. So a brand-new franchise for them there. So bottom line is, is IDS is much more than just Patriot moving forward. And I have that same -- I can give you that same play for each of the other businesses. All the businesses are coming up with, I would call it, new franchises and they're also reinventing their existing franchises. We talked about AMRAAM. AMRAAM has just gone through a whole new upgrade system. It's called the AIM-120D. It's a brand-new missile, great capabilities.

Before we get started, I'd like to welcome Toby O'Brien to his first earnings conference call as CFO, a role which he officially assumed on March 2.

Before we get started, I'd like to welcome Toby O'Brien to his first earnings conference call as CFO, a role which he officially assumed on March 2. Toby will walk you through additional details regarding our first quarter financial results in just a moment. 
I'm pleased to report that the company delivered solid operating results in the quarter, with sales, EPS and cash flow that were all either in line or ahead of our expectations. Our international business continued to grow in the quarter and represented 28% of total revenue. International also represented 34% of our total bookings in the quarter, and our international backlog was 41% of total backlog at quarter's end.
This backlog percentage will go higher with the $2 billion international Patriot award we announced last week, which was from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. 
I will note that we continue to see strong demand signals beyond our recent bookings activity for solutions from our global customers. In the quarter and the weeks immediately following, you will see important parts of our global growth strategy play out. We've announced significant recent bookings across our portfolio, particularly in the international Patriot, that position the company for future growth. And we announced strategic investment and partnership to harness rapid growth in the global cybersecurity market. Overall, we've made a considerable progress on these 3 fronts and continue to move forward with our growth strategy.
During the quarter, we also raised our dividend by 10.7%, the 11th consecutive annual increase, and we remain on track to reduce our shares outstanding for the year. This reflects our long-term trend of returning cash to shareholders, something we will continue to do in line with our balanced capital deployment strategy.
We've come out of the gate strong after the close of the first quarter with approximately $3 billion in bookings within the initial weeks of the second quarter, including the $2 billion Patriot booking from Saudi Arabia and a $507 million booking to upgrade the evolved Sea Sparrow missile, a premier ship defense missile for the U.S. Navy and international customers. 
I'd like to take a moment to talk about our Patriot integrated air and missile defense franchise. Over the past 15 months, we have received nearly $7 billion in bookings for Patriot production and support services from a range of customers. This includes the recent Saudi $2 billion award as well as the Kuwait, Qatar, South Korea and the U.S. Army. This provides the company with years of production work in backlog and predictability to the manufacturing outlook and the opportunity to achieve higher production efficiencies.
Looking forward, we continue to see significant opportunities for Patriot. Earlier this week, we were notified that the Patriot was selected by Poland for their medium-range integrated air and missile defense system. We'll be working with our Polish customer on the final offering and anticipate receiving a booking in 2016. 
Additionally, we're in the final down-select process in Germany. If selected, we anticipate that this will also translate into a booking opportunity in 2016. 
Patriot continues to evolve, ensuring that it will be capable of meeting next-generation threats. Over the next few years, you'll see us in collaboration with our current and future customers add new capabilities, including a 360-degree AESA radar capability and other enhancements. These capabilities will position Patriot to be the leading integrated air and missile defense solution for the next several decades. 
But as you know, Raytheon is much more than just Patriot. And to that point, we've seen considerable recent order activity domestically and internationally across a wide range of our systems and products, particularly in our missiles business. Demand for missiles is being driven by the evolving threats as well as our incorporation of technological advances into our products. One example of this is AMRAAM, where we received a $539 million award in the first quarter for the latest version of the missile. We received a similar sized award in December of last year. So within the past 6 months alone, we have received more than $1 billion in orders for AMRAAM.
We continue to make important progress on many other key programs that will drive future growth. For example, on Small Diameter Bomb II, the premier precision weapon for both current and next-generation platforms, we completed systems verification review in early April. This sets the stage for Milestone C, which will be -- complete the development phase, allowing the program to move into low-rate initial production.
Our Next Generation Jammer program remains a significant part of our electronic warfare initiative. The program continues to execute on or ahead of schedule and cost and also completed key testing milestones in the quarter.
Turning to a broader market perspective, domestically, I'm encouraged by recent developments on the fiscal year '16 defense budget process, where both the Administration and Congress have presented initial budget proposals that could exceed previously established budget caps. Many of our leaders agree that the cap levels are not sufficient to contend with today's dynamic threat environment and are therefore seeking ways to add more resources.
While we won't speculate on what the final funding level for DoD will be in 2016, even if the Budget Control Act caps are not raised at all, the DoD base budget funding will be several billion dollars higher in 2016 than 2015. Bottom line is, the trajectory of the DoD base budget is finally starting to trend upward.
Late in the first quarter, we announced a settlement with the U.K. Home Office relating to Raytheon Systems Limited eBorders contract. Under this settlement, we received a cash payment equal to approximately $226 million in exchange for the resolution of all claims and counterclaims of both parties. Toby will walk you through the details in his remarks.
As we announced earlier this week, consistent with our strategy to position Raytheon for global growth, we are now entering into a partnership with Vista Equity Partners, combining their premier commercial cybersecurity business, Websense, with Raytheon's Cyber Products to form a new company. This new company will provide a broad set of integrated defense-grade cybersecurity products and services to the global marketplace.
We are very excited about this opportunity. We see significant revenue synergies and look forward to closing sometime late in the second quarter.
In conclusion, I'm pleased with our performance in the first quarter, progress in setting the foundation for future global growth. And I'd like to thank our employees for their hard work and dedication for this great start to the year.
With that, let me turn it over to Toby."
105612,291306765,793246,"Raytheon Company, Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2015",2015-04-23,"Earnings Calls","Raytheon Company","Executives","Okay. Thanks, Tom. I have a few opening remarks, starting with the first quarter highlights, and then we'll move on to questions. During my remarks, I'll be referring to the web slides that we issued earlier this morning.If everyone would turn to Page 3",1567,"Okay. Thanks, Tom. I have a few opening remarks, starting with the first quarter highlights, and then we'll move on to questions. During my remarks, I'll be referring to the web slides that we issued earlier this morning.
If everyone would turn to Page 3. We are pleased with the solid performance the team delivered in the first quarter, with sales, EPS and operating cash flow all at or better than our expectations. It's a good start to the year and we're positioned well for achieving our full year outlook. 
Our EPS from continuing operations was $1.78, and on an adjusted basis, EPS was $1.26. I'll discuss this in more detail in just a moment. 
Operating margin was solid at 15.9% and included the previously announced eBorders settlement with the U.K. Home Office. And on an adjusted basis, our operating margin was 11.5%. 
Sales of $5.3 billion were slightly higher than our guidance. During the quarter, the company bought back 2.8 million shares of common stock under the share repurchase program for $300 million. And we announced last month that we increased our dividend by 10.7%. We have now raised our annual dividend every year for the past 11 years. 
I also want to point out that we're raising the guidance that we provided in January to include the eBorders settlement. I'll discuss guidance further in just a few minutes.
Turning now to Page 4. Let me start by providing some detail on our first quarter results. Company bookings for the first quarter were $4.5 billion. International awards represented 34% of the total. And on a trailing 4-quarter basis, the book-to-bill ratio is 1.07.
A couple of key bookings in the first quarter included a $769 million award for Patriot from the Republic of Korea and a $539 million award for AMRAAM for the U.S. Air Force, U.S. Navy and international customers. And as Tom mentioned a few minutes ago, just after the end of the first quarter, we received significant orders from both domestic and international customers. We're off to a strong start in the second quarter and the year-to-date bookings will help drive our second half performance.
Backlog at the end of the first quarter was $32.5 billion and on a funded basis was $23.7 billion, an increase of almost $1 billion compared to the first quarter 2014.
It's worth noting that we ended the first quarter of 2015 with approximately 41% of our backlog now comprised of international programs.
If you'd now move to Page 5. As I just mentioned, for the first quarter 2015, sales were slightly higher than the guidance we set in January. As a reminder, the first quarter of 2015 had one less work day than the first quarter of 2014, and this equates to about $100 million in sales overall. As we said in January, we expected the first quarter to be the most challenging. We still expect sales to ramp up throughout the year. 
Looking now at sales by business. IDS had first quarter 2015 net sales of $1.4 billion. The change from Q1 2014 was primarily due to the planned completion of certain production phases on international Patriot programs. We expect IDS sales to increase as we move through the year as the recently awarded Patriot international programs begin to ramp up. 
In the first quarter 2015, IIS had net sales of $1.4 billion. Compared with the same quarter last year, the change was primarily due to our training programs. 
Missile Systems had first quarter 2015 net sales of $1.5 billion. The change from the first quarter 2014 was primarily due to both the Tomahawk and SM-3 programs. And SAS had net sales of $1.4 billion. Secure communication systems programs contributed to the change versus last year. 
Moving ahead to Page 6. We were pleased by our overall company margins. Our operating margin was 15.9% and on an adjusted basis was 11.5%.
As a reminder, our first quarter 2015 adjusted margin excludes both the favorable FAS/CAS adjustment, which was worth 90 basis points or $0.10 per share, and 340 basis points or $0.42 per share for the eBorders settlement. And as we discussed on the last earnings call in January, compared to 2014, we expect our margins for 2015 will be impacted by a change in program mix as well as higher IR&D and program investments. We continue to invest in ourselves with the objective of positioning the company for future growth. 
So looking at the business margins. The change in margin at IDS was primarily driven by a change in program mix on international Patriot programs nearing completion. IIS margin in the first quarter 2015 benefited from the eBorders settlement that I previously discussed, which contributed $181 million to operating income. Without the settlement, IIS margins would be 7.5% or in line with our expectations. 
Missiles margin was up in the quarter compared to the same period last year. This year's first quarter benefited from a $25 million or approximately 170 basis point favorable resolution of a contractual issue, which was previously expected later in the year.
And SAS margin of 12.7% was down compared to the same period last year, primarily driven by higher net program efficiencies in the first quarter of 2014. 
Overall, the company continues to perform well. 
Turning now to Page 7. First quarter 2015 EPS was $1.78 and on an adjusted basis was $1.26. EPS for the first quarter 2015 was better than expected, primarily due to the eBorders settlement and from timing at missiles. 
On Page 8, we are updating the company's financial outlook for 2015, which now includes the impact of the eBorders settlement.
As Tom mentioned, earlier in the week, we announced the Websense transaction. We expect this transaction to close late in the second quarter and we will update our financial guidance subsequent to the closing.
We still expect our full year 2015 net sales to be in the range of between $22.3 billion and $22.8 billion. We have raised our full year 2015 EPS, which is now expected to be in a range of between $6.67 and $6.82. We expect adjusted EPS to be within a range of between $5.49 and $5.64, which is unchanged from our prior guidance. As a reminder, we have not included the possible extension of the R&D tax credit in our 2015 guidance. If the legislation passes, it would favorably impact the effective tax rate by about 110 basis points and our EPS by about $0.10.
As I mentioned earlier, we repurchased 2.8 million of common stock for $300 million in the quarter and continue to see our diluted share count in the range of between 305 million and 307 million shares for 2015, a 2% reduction at the midpoint of the range. 
Operating cash flow in the quarter was in line with our prior guidance. As a result of the eBorders settlement, we now see our 2015 guidance for operating cash flow to be between $2.4 billion and $2.7 billion. We received the settlement payment in the second quarter.
And as you can see on Page 9, we've included guidance by business, which is unchanged from our prior outlook, except for IIS and total company margin, which now include the eBorders settlement.
On Page 10, we provided some directional guidance on how we currently see the quarterly cadence for sales, EPS and operating cash flow for the balance of 2015. As we discussed on the call in January, sales are expected to ramp up throughout the year. In the first half of 2015, we still expect sales to be down on a percentage basis. Sales in the back half of the year are expected to be in line to slightly up versus 2014. And if you compare second half sales to first half sales, we expect to see mid single-digit growth. As you may recall, our 2014 bookings finished strong, particularly with respect to international. This, taken together with the combined first quarter and early second quarter 2015 bookings, are all key drivers of our second half sales expectations.
And as we discussed on the January call, our effective tax rate in the second quarter is expected to be impacted by a favorable noncash tax settlement of $88 million or $0.29 per diluted share. 
Before concluding, I'd like to spend a minute to talk about our capital deployment strategy. We expect to continue to generate strong free cash flow and maintain a strong balance sheet going forward. We will remain focused on deploying capital to create value for our shareholders, including internal investments to support our growth plans as well as share buybacks and dividend increases that are subject to board approval, and as we sit here today, possibly smaller targeted acquisitions that are -- that fit our technology and global growth needs. 
In summary, we saw good performance in the first quarter. We continue to execute well. Our bookings were ahead of last year's first quarter, and sales, EPS and operating cash flow from operations were all in line or higher than the guidance we set in January. 
We remain well positioned with our domestic customers' priority areas and continue to be aligned with the evolving priorities of our international customers. Our objective is to drive the business to maximize value for our customers and shareholders. 
With that, Tom and I will now open up the call for questions."

Number one, one of the strategies that IIS is actually executing very well is to expand its cybercapabilities and core competencies into both the international and now the commercial market space. As we discussed on prior calls, we have had some significant wins on the international marketplace and so we're showing that we're globally competitive in the cyber arena. And so we're seeing expansion in that area. We're also seeing them expand in their training worldwide and some of it's under the Warfighter FOCUS program. But we're also expanding into other areas of training into international markets with the requisite international governments. So that's another big area that they're moving out on. The other play is essentially upgrading a lot of the systems that are out there in terms of adding in, in information assurance capability, taking the knowledge that they've gained from the GPS OCX program and leveraging that into other programs. And then the last one is, hopefully, you've been watching and noticing that they've been winning quite a few programs out there in -- for example, they won the LISC program. They've also just recently won the NISC program. So they've been winning more than their fair shares of programs. And we're very, I would say, upbeat relative to IIS and their ability to continue to grow and exceed the industry in their area in terms of growth."

Very -- I'll tell you, it's a very great system. And the other area that we are pursuing right now, we should learn in 2017, is a pursuit in Poland. This is the -- we already got selected for the Patriot System for their, I would called, their medium integrated air missile defense system.

We can deliver right out of the factory in, I would call, the quickest time possible. The other element is the fact that they have a lot of their folks who are already trained on using the Patriot.

On the GaN technology we started investing in 10 years ago, when folks thought GaN, you couldn't make GaN work. And we continue to invest in over the years and essentially we proved them wrong that it can work and it can provide a great capability. And that put us in a great position on multiple wins, AMDR, Next Generation Jammers, 3DELRR, and there's actually a few radar competitions coming up now. So we do invest to essentially establish discriminators for us to go win in the future. And that's where we're putting our efforts moving forward. The area, and this is actually part of our strategy, is an investment we call new emerging areas. So we are investing in next-generation radars, high-energy lasers, hypersonics. In fact, we just recently won a major hypersonics contract from DARPA. It's called the tactical boost glide program. That was for the development and demonstration of technologies to enable air-launched tactical-range hypersonic boost glide systems. And so we've been investing in that area and having -- they gave us the technologies to go win this advanced DARPA program. We also are investing in undersea capabilities. We believe the undersea offers a lot of significant opportunities moving forward based on the whole arena of anti-access/area denial. EW, that's part of our strategy to continue to invest in EW and grow our business in that area. That's kind a few of the areas that we're investing in.

So in terms of who would buy these systems, with Poland coming onboard, there are now 14 countries that have the Patriot System. And if you said you had to go off and you wanted to have an opportunity to replace those radars, existing radars, on those Patriots, this is just one example. It would be 200-plus radars and that would be up for grabs to replace to -- or with these 360 AESA radars or AESAs for Patriot.

We do see still the majority of the cash flow being weighted in the second half of the year, really driven by the timing of significant program milestones."

There are also the upgrade capabilities with each of the partner countries that have the Patriot System. And right now, we've been doing something called Configuration-3 Plus. You may have heard us talk about that on some of the calls. That's a major upgrade to the Patriot System that we are off and working with the -- our customers on. And as of today, there's 72 fire units that are still there for upgrade potential and we are working with those customers to upgrade those systems. And then I also mentioned previously the upgrade for the 360 AESA radar. That will be a new upgrade for all the Patriot Systems, and there's over 200 of those radars to be upgraded. So I think the way of looking at it is that these 14 countries are a market surrounded around Patriot, and so we are working with those customers to continually to upgrade those systems to counter the evolving threat. So there's a base program that does software upgrades and other things as the threat changes and that we work across those countries. And then also as new technology comes onboard to improve the capability of the system, we then insert that technology across those 14 countries' Patriot Systems. So essentially, it's a market on its own that we look to continually to upgrade and provide a support activity. So it's a great franchise business. And it also does, for the customers, it allows them to share in the cost for any software upgrades for the evolving threat and then also to share in the cost of the development of new technology. So it's a great win-win situation for both sides."

But the bottom line is at IDS, with all these Patriots coming in, in some case bumper-to-bumper, in some case coming in on top of each other, what that's doing, that's allowing us to stack all this up in the factory to gain significant, I would call, production efficiencies and getting IDS margins back to what we've traditionally have had in that business. So essentially, it's replenishing the backlog for that factory and allowing us to gain those efficiencies as you move forward. So that's a good news on IDS. But don't forget, IDS has also won some major programs. For example, the air and missile defense radar program that they have, they're off and running. They also have won the 3DELRR, which is in protest. So in addition to the Patriot franchise getting reinvented to a certain extent and all the upgrade potential for it, they also have some brand-new franchises that are on the horizon that they have in hand and that the AMDR is in development. That's going to be transitioning into production. That's going to go into both U.S. domestic and also international coalition partners. And then we have the 3DELRR, which is in protest right now. But when that comes out of protest, assuming Raytheon's on the right side of that, that is another program that has a significant -- actually, it was set up by OSD to be an international program on day 1. So a brand-new franchise for them there. So bottom line is, is IDS is much more than just Patriot moving forward. And I have that same -- I can give you that same play for each of the other businesses. All the businesses are coming up with, I would call it, new franchises and they're also reinventing their existing franchises. We talked about AMRAAM. AMRAAM has just gone through a whole new upgrade system. It's called the AIM-120D. It's a brand-new missile, great capabilities. And so it's essentially been reinvented, and just in the last year, over $1 billion worth of AMRAAM orders.

Sales exceeded our guidance, increasing by 3% over second quarter 2014. This was driven by IDS and missiles and was primarily organic. With this solid revenue performance, we now see an opportunity for top line growth in 2015. 
EPS and cash flow also exceeded our expectations in the quarter. This performance demonstrates that our focus on global growth is exceeding.
As a result, we've updated our financial outlook to reflect our solid year-to-date performance and the acquisition of Websense in late May. Toby will walk you through those details in a few minutes.
Global demand for Advanced Technologies drove an 11.9% increase in bookings in the compared to the second quarter 2014. International bookings were particularly strong, representing 46% of total bookings led by the $2 billion Saudi Patriot award, as well as a number of missile awards.
Domestic bookings were also solid, with awards from across our portfolio, including Standard Missile 3, [indiscernible] Sea Sparrow Missile, next generation radars for P8 and maritime aircraft, as well as $626 million in classified awards at both SAS and IIS.
Given the strength of our overall bookings year-to-date, we now expect full year 2015 bookings to be approximately $24.5 billion, plus or minus $500 million. The Raytheon team and I had the opportunity to meet with many of our global customers last month at the Paris Airshow. The feedback reinforced what we've been seeing over the last year, that as many of them are investing in strong defense to deter evolving threats. I would note that compared to the Farmborough Airshow last year, the demand to strengthen deterrents has increased, particularly from our customers in Eastern Europe, the Middle East and North Africa and the Asia Pacific region.
We see this increase demand reflected in our results. For example, at the end of the second quarter of 2015, approximately 44% of our total backlog was international, a new high for the company. This compares to 38% at the end of the second quarter 2014. 
Total backlog increased to $1.5 billion year-over-year to $34.5 billion. This is important because it sets the stage for growth and provides future margin expansion opportunity. 
I'd like to take a moment to further highlight our missile business. As many of you know, Raytheon is a premier provider of missile and ship defense systems. Whether it's for newbuild or upgrading existing ships, most of them will have one or more Raytheon missile solutions system on them. Our core product within this domain is our standard missile family of interceptors. Standard Missile 6, also known as SM-6 is designed to provide over-the-horizon defense against aircraft and anti-ship cruise missiles. In the second quarter an SM-6 successfully intercepted a supersonic target in an over-the-horizon test, a key demonstration of the missile's capability. Further, SM6 moved from low rate initial production to full rate production in the second quarter. 
We also received $143 million booking in the quarter, which drove year-to-date bookings for SM-6 to approximately $250 million.
Another version of our standard missile is SM-3, which is used by the U.S. Navy to intercept short to intermediate range ballistic missile threats. This is one of the company's largest program. In the second quarter, we received a $512 million award for the 1B version of this missile, supporting the ongoing ramp up in production. The SM-3 1B will be deployed on the U.S. and allied navy ships. It will also be deployed at the end of the year on land in Europe as an integral part on the phase adaptive approach missile defense system.
The next generation of SM-3 has also taken flight. In the second quarter, SM-32A which we are developing in partnership with Japan had its first flight test, which was successful and is expected to enter production later in the decade. 
Taken altogether, standard missile programs have driven over $800 million of bookings year-to-date.
Beyond standard missile, the missile business segment is also benefiting from significant demand for a wide range of other solutions, including global demand for Pei Wei and the Evolve Sea Sparrow missile, which saw strong bookings in the quarter. Our missile portfolio was well aligned with the evolving priorities of our global customers and that provides a strong foundation for our future growth.
Looking at our domestic market from a broader perspective, the defense budget environment remains fluid. Where there have been positive signs coming from Washington, there are still differences between the Congress and Administration in their approaches to fund fiscal year '16 defense spending. Additional time may be needed to resolve these differences, which increases the probability of another continuing resolution this fall. We've had CRs for the past several years. We will not expect a significant impact in our results should we have another one this year.
Now turning to our capital deployment strategy. As part of our balanced approach, we are increasing our expectation for the share repurchase program. We now expect the share repurchase for full year 2015 to be around $1 billion, which represents a $250 million increase both over 2014 and our original expectation for 2015. This follow the 10.7% increase in the dividend in the first quarter and the Websense transaction in May. As I mentioned, we closed on the Websense acquisition in the second quarter and the integration is on track. The combination of Raytheon and Websense is a great fit, allowing us to bring our advanced cybersecurity capabilities to government and commercial customers around the world.
We welcome Websense employees to the Raytheon team. 
Overall, I'm pleased with our performance in the quarter. The members of our team are proud and passionate about what they do for our global customers, our investors and our company, and our focus and enthusiasm contributed to our success and help drive our results. I'd like to thank the Raytheon team for it's hard work and dedication. 
With that, let me turn it over to Toby."

I have a few opening remarks starting with the second quarter highlights. And then we'll move on to questions. During my remarks, I'll be referring to the web slides that we issued earlier this morning.
Okay, if everyone would please turn to Page 3. We are pleased with the solid performance the team delivered in the second quarter, with sales, EPS and operating cash flow all better than our expectations. We had strong bookings in the second quarter at $7.6 billion, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.3.
Sales were $5.8 billion in the quarter, up by 3% led by our IDS business.
You should note that with the acquisition of Websense, we have moved away from presenting adjusted numbers, but have provided additional information that should help you with your understanding of the financial performance of the company. 
Our EPS from continuing operations was $1.65, which I'll give a little more color on in a few minutes.
An operating cash flow of $376 million was better than our prior guidance driven by the timing of collections. Second quarter 2015 operating cash flow was higher than last year's second quarter primarily due to the timing of required pension contributions and the expected collection of the eBorders settlement with the U.K. Home Office, which was resolved in the first quarter 2015, partially offset by higher cash taxes. 
During the quarter, the company repurchased 1.9 million shares of common stock for $200 million, bringing the year-to-date share repurchase to 4.6 million shares for $500 million.
As Tom mentioned, we closed on the Websense transaction on May 29 and formed Raytheon/Websense, a new joint venture company that was created through the combination of Websense Inc. and Raytheon cyberproducts.
The Raytheon/Websense segment results have been presented to reflect Raytheon cyberproduct results for all periods and Websense results after the acquisition date.
Our full year 2015 guidance, which I'll discuss in a few minutes, has been updated to include Websense as well as improve operating performance for the first half of the year, which I'll address further in a few minutes.
Turning now to Page 4. Let me start by providing some detail on our second quarter results. Company bookings for the quarter were $7.6 billion, an increase of over $800 million compared to the second quarter 2014. And on a year-to-date basis were $12.1 billion, an increase of approximately $1 billion over the same period last year.
It's worth noting that on a trailing 4-quarter basis, our book-to-bill ratio was 1.1x. 
For the quarter, international was 46% of total company bookings, and on a year-to-date basis, was 41%. For the year, we expect international to be in the range of 32% to 35% of total bookings. 
As Tom just mentioned, we booked several significant awards in the second quarter, including a $2 billion contract for Patriot for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia; $538 million on the Warfighter FOCUS Program; $529 million for Standard Missile 3; $511 million on Evolve Sea Sparrow missile; and $363 million for Pei Wei. 
Backlog at the second quarter was $34.5 billion, an increase of an approximately $1.5 billion compared to the second quarter of last year. And on a funded basis, backlog was $25.3 billion, an increase of almost $1.8 billion [ph] compared to the last year's comparable quarter.
If you now move to Page 5. As I mentioned earlier, for the second quarter 2015, sales exceeded the high end of the guidance range we set in April primarily due to better than expected performance at IDS and Missiles.
For the second quarter, our international sales were approximately 30% of total sales, and all of our businesses were at or above our expectations. 
Looking now at sales by business. IDS had second quarter 2015 net sales of $1.7 billion, an increase of approximately 10% compared to the second quarter of 2014. The increase was primarily due to 2 recent international Patriot awards. It is important to note that the second quarter 2015 included the recognition of additional sales for precontract work that had previously been deferred. We now expect full year growth to be closer to 4%.
In the second quarter 2015, IIS and missiles had net sales of $1.5 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively, in line to slightly up when compared with the same quarter last year.
SAS had net sales of $1.4 billion. The change versus last year was driven by volume on international tactical radar systems programs. And for Raytheon/Websense, keep in mind that the results for the second quarter of 2015 include Raytheon cyberproducts for the full quarter and Websense results for the month of June. 
Moving ahead to Page 6. Overall, the company continues to perform well. Our operating margin was 11.1%, both on a total company and the business segment basis. On a year-to-date basis, our operating margin was 13.4% and on a business segment basis, was 13.2%. As we discussed on the last few earnings calls, compared to 2014, our margins for 2015 have been impacted by a change in program mix as well as higher IR&D and program investments. We continue to invest in ourselves with the objective of positioning the company for future growth.
So looking now at the business margins. The change in margins at IDS was primarily driven by a change in program mix on international Patriot programs nearing completion. Included in the IDS operating income in the second quarter of 2015 was an adjustment of $33 million to eliminate all remaining estimated-incentive fees related to the Air Warfare Destroyer program due to the shipbuilder expanding the planned schedule and related increase in cost to complete its portion of the program. Although Raytheon's performance continues on plan for both a cost and schedule standpoint, the shipbuilder is now estimating an increase in its cost to complete the program, which drove the decrease and estimated incentive fees.
The change in margin at IIS was primarily driven by a change in program mix. Missiles and SAS margins were down in the quarter compared with the same period last year, primarily driven by higher net program efficiencies in the second quarter of 2014.
And at Raytheon/Websense, the second quarter 2015 operating margin reflects higher Raytheon cyber expenses to develop and launch new commercial products compared to the second quarter 2014, as well as approximately $5 million of restructuring cost associated with the combination of Websense and Raytheon cyber products.
When you normalize for these 2 items, Raytheon/Websense margin would be in the high teens range. 
Before turning to the next page, I wanted to spend a minute discussing the purchase accounting adjustments and corporate items related to the Websense acquisition. In the second quarter of 2015, we had a deferred revenue adjustment of approximately $10 million, and about $8 million for the amortization of acquired intangible assets.
In addition, I want to point out that on the corporate line, there is approximately $23 million of Websense acquisition-related cost. 
Turning now to Page 7. Second quarter 2015 EPS was $1.65, better than expected driven by higher sales. Of note, second quarter 2015 included a favorable $0.29 noncash tax settlement, as reflected on our prior guidance and an unfavorable $0.09 associated with the Websense acquisition. 
On Page 9, we are updating the company's financial outlook for 2015 to include Websense, as well as our improved operating performance to date compared to our prior guidance. We're increasing full year 2015 net sales by $400 million, of which approximately $300 million is driven by IDS and missiles; and approximately $100 million is driven by the Websense acquisition. Now expect our full year 2015 net sales to be between $22.7 billion and $23.2 billion, which is flat to up 2% over 2014. 
We now expect the EPS impact from the Websense acquisition to be $0.25 dilutive for 2015, compared with the original estimate of $0.48 we provided you back on April 20. This change is driven by the completion of our fair value analysis. And as a result, we have updated our acquisition accounting adjustments.
We've now incorporated this EPS impact into our updated 2015 guidance. Our full year 2015 EPS is now expected to be in the range of $6.47 to $6.62, which were normalized for the acquisition is an improvement of about $0.05 over our previous guidance. And as a reminder, we have not included in our 2015 guidance the potential extension of the R&D tax credit.
As I mentioned earlier, we repurchased 1.9 million shares of common stock for $200 million in the quarter. We are increasing our expected share repurchases for the year and now expect to repurchase approximately $1 billion, an increase of about $250 million from our initial outlook. We have tightened the rein on share count and now see our diluted share count to be between 305 million and 306 million shares for 2015.
Also, we have raised the low end of the range for our 2015 operating cash flow guidance and now see it between $2.5 billion and $2.7 billion. 
And as you can see on Page 9, we've updated the sales guidance range for 3 of our businesses and for the addition of Raytheon/Websense.
We've increased sales at both IDS and Missiles to reflect stronger bookings and higher than expected volumes to date. At IIS, we adjusted sales to reflect the realignment of Raytheon cyber products to the new Raytheon/Websense segment. 
Turning to margin. We've updated the margin guidance range for the company to reflect the Websense acquisition and now see operating margin to be between 13.1% and 13.3% for the full year. At the business segment level, we see business segment operating margin in a range of 13.2% to 13.4% for the full year. It's worth noting that we expect operating margins at Raytheon/Websense to be between 9% and 10% for the full year. And excluding acquisition related costs, their margins would be about [ph] 17% to 18%.
On Page 10, we've provided some directional guidance on how we currently see the quarterly cadence for sales, earnings per share and operating cash flow from continuing operations for the balance of 2015.
And on Page 12, we have provided a 4-year [ph] outlook of the Raytheon/Websense acquisition accounting adjustments to help you with your long-term modeling.
Please note that you will see a significant decline in the deferred revenue adjustment over the period. And the amortization of acquired intangible assets will begin to decline more significantly after 2018. We now expect the joint venture to be accretive to GAAP earnings in 2 to 3 years compared to our original expectations of 3 to 4 years.
Before concluding, with regard to our capital deployment strategy, we expect to continue to generate strong free cash flow and maintain a strong balance sheet going forward. We remain focused on deploying capital to create value for our shareholders and customers. This includes internal investments to support our growth plans, as well as returning capital to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends, and as we sit here today possibly smaller targeted acquisitions that fits our technology and global growth needs.
In summary, if you stand back and look at the quarter, we have solid performance. Bookings were strong with a book-to-bill ratio of 1.3. Our sales, EPS and operating cash from operations were all higher than expected. Based on this performance and our near-term expectations, we increased our guidance for 2015 sales. And if you exclude the impact of the Websense transaction, we raised EPS guidance by $0.05.
We had strong cash flow generation and have increased our planned share repurchases from approximately $750 million to approximately $1 billion for the year.
With that, Bob and I will open up the call for questions."

One is air missile defense radar, one is Next Generation Jammer, [indiscernible], we've also won a couple that are still on protest. But the ones we're finishing up -- we'll be finishing up development on will be about the '18, '19 time frame, which then will start going into LRIP and then by '20 going into full rate production. So on the domestic side, we are going to see an uptick relative to more production programs coming online. So I think that's good on the domestic front. You're also seeing a -- based on the budget drills this year, that both the administration and also Congress are aligned with the fact that they believe the budget needs to increase over the Budget Control Act of 2011 caps. The issue that they're having is how to go off and achieve that increase. But the bottom line is that their both aligned and the Administration and Congress on their need for increase. So we're very positive the breakthrough here in the next, hopefully next year, relative to the '16 budget and increasing over the Budget Control Act caps. However, we do have plans to the budget control that caps, which are about 1% increase over the fiscal year 2015. So we do see the domestic budget increasing over time. On international, we talked about some major awards. We were down slightly by Poland. That contract will be definitized over the next 1.5 year on the details starting wrapping up on late 2016, late 2017. So we see that program picking up and hitting the production numbers in about 2020. So again, and uplift in the 2020 time frame and taking us into 2025.

So a few -- a couple of those orders were FMS, right, which do not have advanced payments. What you're really seeing here is a timing issue, right? And if I take it back up to a higher level, not specific to those orders, we have seen the advanced account on the balance sheet, to your point David, fluctuate over time, driven by the timing of those advances and then when they are subsequently liquidated.

To your point as well, slightly below our 5-year average, which has been around $2.2 billion. And really, the main driver on that was timing. Back last year on the first quarter, we received a significant advance from a customer, and we have fully liquidated that here through the first quarter of '15. On some of that new awards, we have milestone payments as well that are more weighted towards the back half of the year. That all said, from an overall point of view, we would expect our advances to remain in the range of about 9% of sales this year, which is pretty much in line with prior periods, in that $2 billion range."

105612,306694223,836835,"Raytheon Company, Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 23, 2015",2015-07-23,"Earnings Calls","Raytheon Company","Executives","Thank you, Todd. Good morning, everyone. This morning, Raytheon reported solid second quarter operating results. Sales exceeded our guidance, increasing by 3% over second quarter 2014.

Sales exceeded our guidance, increasing by 3% over second quarter 2014. This was driven by IDS and Missiles and was primarily organic. With this solid revenue performance, we now see an opportunity for top line growth in 2015. EPS and cash flow also exceeded our expectations in the quarter. This performance demonstrates that our focus on global growth is exceeding.
As a result, we've updated our financial outlook to reflect our solid year-to-date performance and the acquisition of Websense in late May. Toby will walk you through those details in a few minutes.
Global demand for advanced technologies drove an 11.9% increase in bookings in the quarter compared to the second quarter 2014. International bookings were particularly strong, representing 46% of total bookings, led by the $2 billion Saudi Patriot award as well as a number of Missile awards. Domestic bookings were also solid, with awards from across our portfolio, including Standard Missile-3, Evolved SeaSparrow Missile, next generation radars for P-8 and Maritime Aircraft, as well as $626 million in classified awards at both SAS and IIS. Given the strength of our overall bookings year-to-date, we now expect full year 2015 bookings to be approximately $24.5 billion, plus or minus $500 million. 
The Raytheon team and I had the opportunity to meet with many of our global customers last month at the Paris Air Show. The feedback reinforced what we've been seeing over the last year, that as many of them are investing in strong defense to deter evolving threats. I would note that compared to the Farmborough Airshow last year, the demand to strengthen the deterrents has increased, particularly from our customers in Eastern Europe, the Middle East and North Africa and the Asia Pacific region.
We see this increased demand reflected in our results. For example, at the end of the second quarter of 2015, approximately 44% of our total backlog was international, a new high for the company. This compares to 38% at the end of the second quarter 2014. Total backlog increased $1.5 billion year-over-year to $34.5 billion. This is important because it sets the stage for growth and provides future margin expansion opportunity.
I'd like to take a moment to further highlight our Missile business. As many of you know, Raytheon is a premier provider of missile and ship defense systems. Whether it's for new build or upgrading existing ships, most of them will have one or more Raytheon Missile Systems solutions on them. Our core product within this domain is our Standard Missile family of interceptors. Standard Missile-6, also known as SM-6, is designed to provide over-the-horizon defense against aircraft and anti-ship cruise missiles. In the second quarter, an SM-6 successfully intercepted a supersonic target in an over-the-horizon test, a key demonstration of the missile's capability. Further, SM-6 moved from low rate initial production to full rate production in the second quarter. We also received a $143 million booking in the quarter, which drove year-to-date bookings for SM-6 to approximately $250 million.
Another version of our Standard Missile is SM-3, which is used by the U.S. Navy to intercept short to intermediate range ballistic missile threats. This is one of the company's largest programs. In the second quarter, we received a $512 million award for the IB version of this missile, supporting the ongoing ramp-up in production. The SM-3 IB will be deployed on U.S. and allied navy ships. It will also be deployed at the end of the year on land in Europe as an integral part on the Phased Adaptive Approach missile defense system.
The next generation of SM-3 has also taken flight. In the second quarter, SM-3 IIA, which we are developing in partnership with Japan, had its first flight test which was successful and is expected to enter production later in the decade.
Taken altogether, Standard Missile programs have driven over $800 million of bookings year-to-date.
Beyond Standard Missile, the Missile business segment is also benefiting from significant demand for a wide range of other solutions, including global demand for Paveway and the Evolved SeaSparrow Missile, which saw strong bookings in the quarter. Our Missile portfolio was well aligned with the evolving priorities of our global customers and that provides a strong foundation for our future growth.
Looking at our domestic market from a broader perspective, the defense budget environment remains fluid. While there have been positive signs coming from Washington, there are still differences between Congress and the Administration in their approaches to fund fiscal year '16 defense spending. Additional time may be needed to resolve these differences, which increases the probability of another continuing resolution this fall. We've had CRs for the past several years, and we would not expect a significant impact on our results should we have another one this year.
Now turning to our capital deployment strategy. As part of our balanced approach, we are increasing our expectation for the share repurchase program. We now expect the share repurchase for full year 2015 to be around $1 billion, which represents a $250 million increase, both over 2014 and our original expectation for 2015. This follows the 10.7% increase in the dividend in the first quarter and the Websense transaction in May. 
As I mentioned, we closed on the Websense acquisition in the second quarter, and the integration is on track. The combination of Raytheon and Websense is a great fit, allowing us to bring our advanced cybersecurity capabilities to government and commercial customers around the world. We welcome Websense employees to the Raytheon team.
Overall, I'm pleased with our performance in the quarter. The members of our team are proud and passionate about what they do for our global customers, our investors and our company, and their focus and enthusiasm contributed to our success and helped drive our results. I'd like to thank the Raytheon team for its hard work and dedication.
With that, let me turn it over to Toby."

Okay. If everyone would please turn to Page 3. We are pleased with the solid performance the team delivered in the second quarter, with sales, EPS and operating cash flow all better than our expectations. We had strong bookings in the second quarter at $7.6 billion, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.3x. Sales were $5.8 billion in the quarter, up 3%, led by our IDS business.
You should note that with the acquisition of Websense, we have moved away from presenting adjusted numbers, but have provided additional information that should help you with your understanding of the financial performance of the company. 
Our EPS from continuing operations was $1.65, which I'll give a little more color on in a few minutes. 
An operating cash flow of $376 million was better than our prior guidance, driven by the timing of collections. Second quarter 2015 operating cash flow was higher than last year's second quarter, primarily due to the timing of required pension contributions and the expected collection of the eBorders settlement with the U.K. Home Office, which was resolved in the first quarter 2015, partially offset by higher cash taxes.
During the quarter, the company repurchased 1.9 million shares of common stock for $200 million, bringing the year-to-date share repurchase to 4.6 million shares for $500 million.
As Tom mentioned, we closed on the Websense transaction on May 29 and formed Raytheon|Websense, a new joint venture company that was created through the combination of Websense, Inc. and Raytheon Cyber Products. The Raytheon|Websense segment results have been presented to reflect Raytheon Cyber Product results for all periods and Websense results after the acquisition date.
Our full year 2015 guidance, which I'll discuss in a few minutes, has been updated to include Websense as well as improved operating performance for the first half of the year, which I'll address further in a few minutes.
Turning now to Page 4. Let me start by providing some detail on our second quarter results. Company bookings for the quarter were $7.6 billion, an increase of over $800 million compared to the second quarter 2014, and on a year-to-date basis were $12.1 billion, an increase of approximately $1 billion over the same period last year. It's worth noting that on a trailing 4-quarter basis, our book-to-bill ratio was 1.1x.
For the quarter, international was 46% of total company bookings, and on a year-to-date basis, was 41%. For the year, we expect international to be in the range of 32% to 35% of total bookings.
As Tom just mentioned, we booked several significant awards in the second quarter, including a $2 billion contract for Patriot for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia; $538 million on the Warfighter FOCUS Program; $529 million for Standard Missile-3; $511 million on Evolved SeaSparrow Missile; and $363 million for Paveway. 
Backlog at the end of the second quarter was $34.5 billion, an increase of an approximately $1.5 billion compared to the second quarter of last year. And on a funded basis, backlog was $25.3 billion, an increase of almost $1.8 billion compared to the last year's comparable quarter.
If you now move to Page 5. As I mentioned earlier, for the second quarter 2015, sales exceeded the high end of the guidance range we set in April, primarily due to better than expected performance at IDS and Missiles.
For the second quarter, our international sales were approximately 30% of total sales, and all of our businesses were at or above our expectations.
Looking now at sales by business. IDS had second quarter 2015 net sales of $1.7 billion, an increase of approximately 10% compared to the second quarter of 2014. The increase was primarily due to 2 recent international Patriot awards. It is important to note that the second quarter 2015 included the recognition of additional sales for precontract work that had previously been deferred. We now expect full year growth to be closer to 4%. In the second quarter 2015, IIS and Missiles had net sales of $1.5 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively, in line to slightly up when compared with the same quarter last year. SAS had net sales of $1.4 billion. The change versus last year was driven by volume on international tactical radar systems programs. And for Raytheon|Websense, keep in mind that the results for the second quarter of 2015 include Raytheon Cyber Products for the full quarter and Websense results for the month of June.
Moving ahead to Page 6. Overall, the company continues to perform well. Our operating margin was 11.1%, both on a total company and a business segment basis. On a year-to-date basis, our operating margin was 13.4%, and on a business segment basis, was 13.2%. 
As we discussed on the last few earnings calls, compared to 2014, our margins for 2015 have been impacted by a change in program mix as well as higher IR&D and program investments. We continue to invest in ourselves with the objective of positioning the company for future growth.
So looking now at the business margins. The change in margins at IDS was primarily driven by a change in program mix on international Patriot programs nearing completion. Included in IDS operating income in the second quarter of 2015 was an adjustment of $33 million to eliminate all remaining estimated incentive fees related to the Air Warfare Destroyer program due to the shipbuilder extending the planned schedule and related increase in cost to complete its portion of the program. Although Raytheon's performance continues on plan for both a cost and schedule standpoint, the shipbuilder is now estimating an increase in its cost to complete the program, which drove the decrease in estimated incentive fees.
The change in margin at IIS was primarily driven by a change in program mix. Missiles and SAS margins were down in the quarter compared with the same period last year, primarily driven by higher net program efficiencies in the second quarter of 2014.
And at Raytheon|Websense, the second quarter 2015 operating margin reflects higher Raytheon Cyber expenses to develop and launch new commercial products compared to the second quarter 2014, as well as approximately $5 million of restructuring cost associated with the combination of Websense and Raytheon Cyber Products. When you normalize for these 2 items, Raytheon|Websense margin would be in the high teens range.
Before turning to the next page, I wanted to spend a minute discussing the purchase accounting adjustments and corporate items related to the Websense acquisition. In the second quarter of 2015, we had a deferred revenue adjustment of approximately $10 million and about $8 million for the amortization of acquired intangible assets. In addition, I want to point out that on the corporate line, there is approximately $23 million of Websense acquisition-related cost.
Turning now to Page 7. Second quarter 2015 EPS was $1.65, better than expected driven by higher sales. Of note, the second quarter 2015 included a favorable $0.29 noncash tax settlement as reflected in our prior guidance and an unfavorable $0.09 associated with the Websense acquisition.
On Page 9, we are updating the company's financial outlook for 2015 to include Websense, as well as our improved operating performance to-date compared to our prior guidance. We're increasing full year 2015 net sales by $400 million, of which approximately $300 million is driven by IDS and Missiles, and approximately $100 million is driven by the Websense acquisition. We now expect our full year 2015 net sales to be between $22.7 billion and $23.2 billion, which is flat to up 2% over 2014.
We now expect the EPS impact from the Websense acquisition to be $0.25 dilutive for 2015, compared with the original estimate of $0.48 we provided you back on April 20. This change is driven by the completion of our fair value analysis. And as a result, we have updated our acquisition accounting adjustments.
We've now incorporated this EPS impact into our updated 2015 guidance. Our full year 2015 EPS is now expected to be in the range of $6.47 to $6.62, which were normalized for the acquisition, is an improvement of about $0.05 over our previous guidance. And as a reminder, we have not included in our 2015 guidance the potential extension of the R&D tax credit.
As I mentioned earlier, we repurchased 1.9 million shares of common stock for $200 million in the quarter. We are increasing our expected share repurchases for the year and now expect to repurchase approximately $1 billion, an increase of about $250 million from our initial outlook. We have tightened the range on share count and now see our diluted share count to be between 305 million and 306 million shares for 2015.
Also, we have raised the low end of the range for our 2015 operating cash flow guidance and now see it between $2.5 billion and $2.7 billion. 
And as you can see on Page 9, we've updated the sales guidance range for 3 of our businesses and for the addition of Raytheon|Websense. We've increased sales at both IDS and Missiles to reflect stronger bookings and higher than expected volume to-date. At IIS, we adjusted sales to reflect the realignment of Raytheon Cyber Products to the new Raytheon|Websense segment.
Turning to margin. We've updated the margin guidance range for the company to reflect the Websense acquisition and now see operating margin to be between 13.1% and 13.3% for the full year. At the business segment level, we see business segment operating margin in a range of 13.2% to 13.4% for the full year. It's worth noting that we expect operating margins at Raytheon|Websense to be between 9% and 10% for the full year. And excluding acquisition-related costs, their margins would be about 17% to 18%.
On Page 10, we've provided some directional guidance on how we currently see the quarterly cadence for sales, earnings per share and operating cash flow from continuing operations for the balance of 2015.
And on Page 12, we have provided a 4-year outlook of the Raytheon|Websense acquisition accounting adjustments to help you with your long-term modeling.
Please note that you will see a significant decline in the deferred revenue adjustment over the period, and the amortization of acquired intangible assets will begin to decline more significantly after 2018. We now expect the joint venture to be accretive to GAAP earnings in 2 to 3 years compared to our original expectations of 3 to 4 years.
Before concluding, with regard to our capital deployment strategy, we expect to continue to generate strong free cash flow and maintain a strong balance sheet going forward. We remain focused on deploying capital to create value for our shareholders and customers. This includes internal investments to support our growth plans as well as returning capital to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends and, as we sit here today, possibly smaller targeted acquisitions that fit our technology and global growth needs.
In summary, if you stand back and look at the quarter, we have solid performance. Bookings were strong with a book-to-bill ratio of 1.3x. Our sales, EPS and operating cash flow from operations were all higher than expected. Based on this performance and our near-term expectations, we increased our guidance for 2015 sales. And if you exclude the impact of the Websense transaction, we raised EPS guidance by $0.05. We had strong cash flow generation and have increased our planned share repurchases from approximately $750 million to approximately $1 billion for the year.
With that, Tom and I will open up the call for questions."

There's a new company that comes online every day that's having some type of a breach. And so we're continuing to get input and demand signals from commercial companies across the board.

That said, the margin in Q2 was in line with our expectations. So even though we had the unfavorable adjustment on AWD, we did see some other performance improvements in the quarter that essentially offset that. That, again, is consistent with lower margins in the first half of the year. We still expect a ramp-up on IDS margins, particularly in Q4, as the overall business mix improves due to the ramp-up of the international awards that we saw at the end of last year and then into the early part of this year."

Right off the bat, we -- and -- I'll just go back to the discussions we've had at the last call. And we've won some major domestic programs that we're in development on right now. One is the Air Missile Defense Radar and the other one is the Next Generation Jammer, FAB-T. We've also won a couple that are still on protest. But the ones we're finishing up -- we'll be finishing up on development on, it will be in about the '18, '19 time frame, which then will start going into LRIP, and then by '20 going into full rate production. So on the domestic side, we are going to start to see an uptick relative to more production programs coming online. So I think that's good on the domestic front. 
You're also seeing a -- based on the budget drills this year, that both the Administration and also Congress are aligned with the fact that they believe that the budget needs to increase over the Budget Control Act of 2011 caps. The issue that they're having is how to go off and achieve that increase. But the bottom line is that they're both aligned, the Administration and Congress, on the need for the increase. So we're very -- we feel very positive about some breakthrough here in the next -- hopefully, next year relative to '16's budget and increasing over the Budget Control Act caps. However, we do have planted the Budget Control Act caps, which are about 1% increase over the fiscal year 2015. So we do see the domestic budget increasing over time. 
On the international, we talked about some major awards. We were now selected by Poland. That contract will be definitized over the next 1.5 year on the details, starting ramping up in late 2016, in 2017. So we see that program picking up and hitting the production numbers in about 2020. So again, an uplift in the 2020 time frame and taking us into 2025.

But how do you look at that equation where the services market becomes more and more competitive relative to the cost structure that's somewhat required for your hardware sensitive businesses?"

Raytheon never went down the path of getting into the Fed IT business. So I don't know if you realize that. So we recognized a long time ago that, that was not a business that we wanted to be in really because we saw that would eventually get commoditized. So we -- you don't have any of that effort going on within the company. 
The services that we do or -- most of it is associated with our products, and so that helps us in maintaining our products, the logistics associated with our products. For example, we do a lot of performance-based logistics relative to our products and that's -- it essentially comes under the umbrella of the services. 
And then, in IIS, where most of the traditional services are located, they are leaders in advanced solutions and capabilities and providing cyber services, intelligence, mission support, and I would call high consequence training in key markets. And it's not just for the U.S. government, it's also for governments worldwide. So it's a pretty strong business for us. 
Again, we are not in the Fed IT, never were. So that's an area that I think is -- it's hard to compare us against some of these other companies that are shedding their services because a lot of that shedding is associated with the Fed IT."

I think that will be the next thing that we're seeing with some of these other customers who have other air defense assets. They want them integrated with -- in one common operating picture so that they can get the synergy of having everything together in one place and operated by one operator.

It wasn't the technology or the underlying technology. It wasn't the products. It wasn't the personnel. It was essentially not having access to the market channels that's required in the commercial business. And so that was the lesson learned. And so we took that lesson learned, and we went out and we started in 2013 looking at what was the best company out there that we could potentially acquire, that would enable us to unlock the capabilities we had from the other acquisitions, but into the commercial marketplace, and someone that already had a strong position, already had a new product, a new platform, allowing us to move forward.

To your point as well, slightly below our 5-year average, which has been around $2.2 billion. And really, the main driver on that was timing.

Sales exceeded our guidance, increasing by 3% over second quarter 2014. This was driven by IDS and Missiles and was primarily organic. With this solid revenue performance, we now see an opportunity for top line growth in 2015. EPS and cash flow also exceeded our expectations in the quarter. This performance demonstrates that our focus on global growth is succeeding.
As a result, we've updated our financial outlook to reflect our solid year-to-date performance and the acquisition of Websense in late May. Toby will walk you through those details in a few minutes.
Global demand for our advanced technologies drove an 11.9% increase in bookings in the quarter compared to the second quarter 2014. International bookings were particularly strong, representing 46% of total bookings, led by the $2 billion Saudi Patriot award as well as a number of Missile awards. Domestic bookings were also solid, with awards from across our portfolio, including Standard Missile-3, Evolved SeaSparrow Missile, next generation radars for P-8 and Maritime Aircraft, as well as $626 million in classified awards at both SAS and IIS. Given the strength of our overall bookings year-to-date, we now expect full year 2015 bookings to be approximately $24.5 billion, plus or minus $500 million. 
The Raytheon team and I had the opportunity to meet with many of our global customers last month at the Paris Air Show. The feedback reinforced what we've been seeing over the last year, that as many of them are investing in strong defense to deter evolving threats. I would note that compared to the Farmborough Airshow last year, the demand to strengthen the deterrents has increased, particularly from our customers in Eastern Europe, the Middle East and North Africa and the Asia Pacific region.
We see this increased demand reflected in our results. For example, at the end of the second quarter of 2015, approximately 44% of our total backlog was international, a new high for the company. This compares to 38% at the end of the second quarter 2014. Total backlog increased $1.5 billion year-over-year to $34.5 billion. This is important because it sets the stage for growth and provides future margin expansion opportunity.
I'd like to take a moment to further highlight our Missile business. As many of you know, Raytheon is a premier provider of missile and ship defense systems. Whether it's for new build or upgrading existing ships, most of them will have one or more Raytheon Missile Systems solutions on them. Our core product within this domain is our Standard Missile family of interceptors. Standard Missile-6, also known as SM-6, is designed to provide over-the-horizon defense against aircraft and anti-ship cruise missiles. In the second quarter, an SM-6 successfully intercepted a supersonic target in an over-the-horizon test, a key demonstration of the missile's capability. Further, SM-6 moved from low rate initial production to full rate production in the second quarter. We also received a $143 million booking in the quarter, which drove year-to-date bookings for SM-6 to approximately $250 million.
Another version of our Standard Missile is SM-3, which is used by the U.S. Navy to intercept short to intermediate range ballistic missile threats. This is one of the company's largest programs. In the second quarter, we received a $512 million award for the IB version of this missile, supporting the ongoing ramp-up in production. The SM-3 IB will be deployed on U.S. and allied navy ships. It will also be deployed at the end of the year on land in Europe as an integral part on the Phased Adaptive Approach missile defense system.
The next generation of SM-3 has also taken flight. In the second quarter, SM-3 IIA, which we are developing in partnership with Japan, had its first flight test which was successful and is expected to enter production later in the decade.
Taken altogether, Standard Missile programs have driven over $800 million of bookings year-to-date.
Beyond Standard Missile, the Missile business segment is also benefiting from significant demand for a wide range of other solutions, including global demand for Paveway and the Evolved SeaSparrow Missile, which saw strong bookings in the quarter. Our Missile portfolio was well aligned with the evolving priorities of our global customers and that provides a strong foundation for our future growth.
Looking at our domestic market from a broader perspective, the defense budget environment remains fluid. While there have been positive signs coming from Washington, there are still differences between Congress and the Administration in their approaches to fund fiscal year '16 defense spending. Additional time may be needed to resolve these differences, which increases the probability of another continuing resolution this fall. We've had CRs for the past several years, and we would not expect a significant impact on our results should we have another one this year.
Now turning to our capital deployment strategy. As part of our balanced approach, we are increasing our expectation for the share repurchase program. We now expect the share repurchase for full year 2015 to be around $1 billion, which represents a $250 million increase, both over 2014 and our original expectation for 2015. This follows a 10.7% increase in the dividend in the first quarter and the Websense transaction in May. 
As I mentioned, we closed on the Websense acquisition in the second quarter, and the integration is on track. The combination of Raytheon and Websense is a great fit, allowing us to bring our advanced cybersecurity capabilities to government and commercial customers around the world. We welcome Websense employees to the Raytheon team.
Overall, I'm pleased with our performance in the quarter. The members of our team are proud and passionate about what they do for our global customers, our investors and our company, and their focus and enthusiasm contributed to our success and helped drive our results. I'd like to thank the Raytheon team for its hard work and dedication.
With that, let me turn it over to Toby."
105612,306694223,837001,"Raytheon Company, Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 23, 2015",2015-07-23,"Earnings Calls","Raytheon Company","Executives","Okay. Thanks, Tom. I have a few opening remarks starting with the second quarter highlights, and then we'll move on to questions. During my remarks, I'll be referring to the web slides that we issued earlier this morning.Okay. If everyone would please t",1954,"Okay. Thanks, Tom. I have a few opening remarks starting with the second quarter highlights, and then we'll move on to questions. During my remarks, I'll be referring to the web slides that we issued earlier this morning.
Okay. If everyone would please turn to Page 3. We are pleased with the solid performance the team delivered in the second quarter, with sales, EPS and operating cash flow all better than our expectations. We had strong bookings in the second quarter at $7.6 billion, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.3x. Sales were $5.8 billion in the quarter, up 3%, led by our IDS business.
You should note that with the acquisition of Websense, we have moved away from presenting adjusted numbers, but have provided additional information that should help you with your understanding of the financial performance of the company. 
Our EPS from continuing operations was $1.65, which I'll give a little more color on in a few minutes. 
An operating cash flow of $376 million was better than our prior guidance, driven by the timing of collections. Second quarter 2015 operating cash flow was higher than last year's second quarter, primarily due to the timing of required pension contributions and the expected collection of the eBorders settlement with the U.K. Home Office, which was resolved in the first quarter 2015, partially offset by higher cash taxes.
During the quarter, the company repurchased 1.9 million shares of common stock for $200 million, bringing the year-to-date share repurchase to 4.6 million shares for $500 million.
As Tom mentioned, we closed on the Websense transaction on May 29 and formed Raytheon|Websense, a new joint venture company that was created through the combination of Websense, Inc. and Raytheon Cyber Products. The Raytheon|Websense segment results have been presented to reflect Raytheon Cyber Product results for all periods and Websense results after the acquisition date.
Our full year 2015 guidance, which I'll discuss in a few minutes, has been updated to include Websense as well as improved operating performance for the first half of the year, which I'll address further in a few minutes.
Turning now to Page 4. Let me start by providing some detail on our second quarter results. Company bookings for the quarter were $7.6 billion, an increase of over $800 million compared to the second quarter 2014, and on a year-to-date basis were $12.1 billion, an increase of approximately $1 billion over the same period last year. It's worth noting that on a trailing 4-quarter basis, our book-to-bill ratio was 1.1x.
For the quarter, international was 46% of total company bookings, and on a year-to-date basis, was 41%. For the year, we expect international to be in the range of 32% to 35% of total bookings.
As Tom just mentioned, we booked several significant awards in the second quarter, including a $2 billion contract for Patriot for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia; $538 million on the Warfighter FOCUS Program; $529 million for Standard Missile-3; $511 million on Evolved SeaSparrow Missile; and $363 million for Paveway. 
Backlog at the end of the second quarter was $34.5 billion, an increase of an approximately $1.5 billion compared to the second quarter of last year. And on a funded basis, backlog was $25.3 billion, an increase of almost $1.8 billion compared to the last year's comparable quarter.
If you now move to Page 5. As I mentioned earlier, for the second quarter 2015, sales exceeded the high end of the guidance range we set in April, primarily due to better than expected performance at IDS and Missiles.
For the second quarter, our international sales were approximately 30% of total sales, and all of our businesses were at or above our expectations.
Looking now at sales by business. IDS had second quarter 2015 net sales of $1.7 billion, an increase of approximately 10% compared to the second quarter of 2014. The increase was primarily due to 2 recent international Patriot awards. It is important to note that the second quarter 2015 included the recognition of additional sales for precontract work that had previously been deferred. We now expect full year growth to be closer to 4%. In the second quarter 2015, IIS and Missiles had net sales of $1.5 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively, in line to slightly up when compared with the same quarter last year. SAS had net sales of $1.4 billion. The change versus last year was driven by volume on international tactical radar systems programs. And for Raytheon|Websense, keep in mind that the results for the second quarter of 2015 include Raytheon Cyber Products for the full quarter and Websense results for the month of June.
Moving ahead to Page 6. Overall, the company continues to perform well. Our operating margin was 11.1%, both on a total company and a business segment basis. On a year-to-date basis, our operating margin was 13.4%, and on a business segment basis, was 13.2%. 
As we discussed on the last few earnings calls, compared to 2014, our margins for 2015 have been impacted by a change in program mix as well as higher IR&D and program investments. We continue to invest in ourselves with the objective of positioning the company for future growth.
So looking now at the business margins. The change in margins at IDS was primarily driven by a change in program mix on international Patriot programs nearing completion. Included in IDS operating income in the second quarter of 2015 was an adjustment of $33 million to eliminate all remaining estimated incentive fees related to the Air Warfare Destroyer program due to the shipbuilder extending the planned schedule and related increase in cost to complete its portion of the program. Although Raytheon's performance continues on plan for both a cost and schedule standpoint, the shipbuilder is now estimating an increase in its cost to complete the program, which drove the decrease in estimated incentive fees.
The change in margin at IIS was primarily driven by a change in program mix. Missiles and SAS margins were down in the quarter compared with the same period last year, primarily driven by higher net program efficiencies in the second quarter of 2014.
And at Raytheon|Websense, the second quarter 2015 operating margin reflects higher Raytheon Cyber expenses to develop and launch new commercial products compared to the second quarter 2014, as well as approximately $5 million of restructuring cost associated with the combination of Websense and Raytheon Cyber Products. When you normalize for these 2 items, Raytheon|Websense margin would be in the high teens range.
Before turning to the next page, I wanted to spend a minute discussing the purchase accounting adjustments and corporate items related to the Websense acquisition. In the second quarter of 2015, we had a deferred revenue adjustment of approximately $10 million and about $8 million for the amortization of acquired intangible assets. In addition, I want to point out that on the corporate line, there is approximately $23 million of Websense acquisition-related cost.
Turning now to Page 7. Second quarter 2015 EPS was $1.65, better than expected driven by higher sales. Of note, the second quarter 2015 included a favorable $0.29 noncash tax settlement as reflected in our prior guidance and an unfavorable $0.09 associated with the Websense acquisition.
On Page 9, we are updating the company's financial outlook for 2015 to include Websense, as well as our improved operating performance to-date compared to our prior guidance. We're increasing full year 2015 net sales by $400 million, of which approximately $300 million is driven by IDS and Missiles, and approximately $100 million is driven by the Websense acquisition. We now expect our full year 2015 net sales to be between $22.7 billion and $23.2 billion, which is flat to up 2% over 2014.
We now expect the EPS impact from the Websense acquisition to be $0.25 dilutive for 2015, compared with the original estimate of $0.48 we provided you back on April 20. This change is driven by the completion of our fair value analysis. And as a result, we have updated our acquisition accounting adjustments.
We've now incorporated this EPS impact into our updated 2015 guidance. Our full year 2015 EPS is now expected to be in the range of $6.47 to $6.62, which when normalized for the acquisition, is an improvement of about $0.05 over our previous guidance. And as a reminder, we have not included in our 2015 guidance the potential extension of the R&D tax credit.
As I mentioned earlier, we repurchased 1.9 million shares of common stock for $200 million in the quarter. We are increasing our expected share repurchases for the year and now expect to repurchase approximately $1 billion, an increase of about $250 million from our initial outlook. We have tightened the range on share count and now see our diluted share count to be between 305 million and 306 million shares for 2015.
Also, we have raised the low end of the range for our 2015 operating cash flow guidance and now see it between $2.5 billion and $2.7 billion. 
And as you can see on Page 9, we've updated the sales guidance range for 3 of our businesses and for the addition of Raytheon|Websense. We've increased sales at both IDS and Missiles to reflect stronger bookings and higher than expected volume to-date. At IIS, we adjusted sales to reflect the realignment of Raytheon Cyber Products to the new Raytheon|Websense segment.
Turning to margin. We've updated the margin guidance range for the company to reflect the Websense acquisition and now see operating margin to be between 13.1% and 13.3% for the full year. At the business segment level, we see business segment operating margin in a range of 13.2% to 13.4% for the full year. It's worth noting that we expect operating margins at Raytheon|Websense to be between 9% and 10% for the full year. And excluding acquisition-related costs, their margins would be about 17% to 18%.
On Page 10, we've provided some directional guidance on how we currently see the quarterly cadence for sales, earnings per share and operating cash flow from continuing operations for the balance of 2015.
And on Page 12, we have provided a 4-year outlook of the Raytheon|Websense acquisition accounting adjustments to help you with your long-term modeling.
Please note that you will see a significant decline in the deferred revenue adjustment over the period, and the amortization of acquired intangible assets will begin to decline more significantly after 2018. We now expect the joint venture to be accretive to GAAP earnings in 2 to 3 years compared to our original expectations of 3 to 4 years.
Before concluding, with regard to our capital deployment strategy, we expect to continue to generate strong free cash flow and maintain a strong balance sheet going forward. We remain focused on deploying capital to create value for our shareholders and customers. This includes internal investments to support our growth plans as well as returning capital to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends and, as we sit here today, possibly smaller targeted acquisitions that fit our technology and global growth needs.
In summary, if you stand back and look at the quarter, we had solid performance. Bookings were strong with a book-to-bill ratio of 1.3x. Our sales, EPS and operating cash flow from operations were all higher than expected. Based on this performance and our near-term expectations, we increased our guidance for 2015 sales. And if you exclude the impact of the Websense transaction, we raised EPS guidance by $0.05. We had strong cash flow generation and have increased our planned share repurchases from approximately $750 million to approximately $1 billion for the year.
With that, Tom and I will open up the call for questions."

But I can tell you that we are very excited about our Websense acquisition and our expansion into the commercial cyber market. The reasons we decided to do this are still solid and sound. We've been doing a very heavy integration effort for the last 2 months. And several reasons, and number one is that, as you can see from reading the paper every day, the cyber threat continues relative to commercial companies. There's a new company that comes online every day that's having some type of a breach. And so we're continuing to get input and demand signals from commercial companies across the board. And their demand is they're looking for higher end, I would call it, defense-grade cyber solutions that will continue to -- and we see that increasing into the foreseeable future.

That said, the margin in Q2 was in line with our expectations. So even though we had the unfavorable adjustment on AWD, we did see some other performance improvements in the quarter that essentially offset that. That, again, is consistent with lower margins in the first half of the year.

So let me and I'll -- and then, I'll turn it over to Toby and he can put some numbers behind what I say. 
Right off the bat, we -- and -- I'll just go back to the discussions we've had at the last call. And we've won some major domestic programs that we're in development on right now. One is the Air Missile Defense Radar and the other one is the Next Generation Jammer, FAB-T. We've also won a couple that are still on protest. But the ones we're finishing up -- we'll be finishing up on development on, it will be in about the '18, '19 time frame, which then will start going into LRIP, and then by '20 going into full rate production. So on the domestic side, we are going to start to see an uptick relative to more production programs coming online. So I think that's good on the domestic front. 
You're also seeing a -- based on the budget drills this year, that both the Administration and also Congress are aligned with the fact that they believe that the budget needs to increase over the Budget Control Act of 2011 caps. The issue that they're having is how to go off and achieve that increase. But the bottom line is that they're both aligned, the Administration and Congress, on the need for the increase. So we're very -- we feel very positive about some breakthrough here in the next -- hopefully, next year relative to '16's budget and increasing over the Budget Control Act caps. However, we do have -- planned to the Budget Control Act caps, which are about 1% increase over the fiscal year 2015. So we do see the domestic budget increasing over time. 
On the international, we talked about some major awards. We were now selected by Poland. That contract will be definitized over the next 1.5 year on the details, starting ramping up in late 2016, in 2017. So we see that program picking up and hitting the production numbers in about 2020. So again, an uplift in the 2020 time frame and taking us into 2025. 
So overall, boast -- both on the domestic and on the international, we see a significant pipeline that will take us well beyond 2020."

And to answer your question about when we would see a return to growth domestically, right now, as best we can tell, maybe late next year, and if not, into '17 for our revenue to start growing domestically. I think what Tom just commented on, from the international combined with the 44% backlog that's international today, that pipeline Tom referred to, the 30% of our sales that were international, that sets us up nicely for international to grow including into next year. And obviously, as we said, we now see top line growth this year with our outlook of being flat to up 2%. Previously, we had looked at '16 as a return to growth.

But on the international side, as Toby mentioned, we've had some significant bookings here in the last 1.5 year. The area that we're working right now, and I think it's a great sign here, is we're bringing on more suppliers. We're increasing the number of shifts we have in the factory, adding on days.

So a few -- a couple of those orders were FMS, right, which do not have the advanced payments. What you're really seeing here is a timing issue, right? And if I take it back up to a higher level, not specific to those orders, we have seen the advanced account on the balance sheet, to your point, David, fluctuate over time, driven by the timing of those advances and then when they are subsequently liquidated. On average, historically, we have run at a rate of about 9% to 10% of sales, okay? At the end of the first quarter, the balance was about $2 billion. To your point as well, slightly below our 5-year average, which has been around $2.2 billion. And really, the main driver on that was timing. Back last year in the first quarter, we had received a significant advance from a customer and we had fully liquidated that here through the first quarter of '15. On some of the new awards, we have milestone payments as well that are more weighted towards the back half of the year. That all said, from an overall point of view, we would expect our advances to remain in the range of about 9% of sales this year, which is pretty much in line with prior periods, in that $2 billion range."

Good morning, everyone. A little over a year ago, we laid out a strategy to return the company to growth by evolving our approach to international markets, increasing investments in key technologies to better position the company for the future. Our strong growth during the third quarter reflects the traction that we are gaining from this strategy. In the quarter, our revenue increased by 6% due in primarily by missiles and ICS as well as from an increased contribution from Raytheon|Websense. 
International revenue, which grew by 13% over last year's third quarter, rose to 32% of the company's total revenue. This is a record level for the company and was driven by customers across various regions turning to Raytheon's advanced technology to address the rapidly evolving threats. 
I would also note that our growth was backed by a strong cash flow generation, reinforcing our strong financial foundation. Domestic revenue also increased in the quarter and was up a solid 3%, driven in part by classifieds.
Turning now to bookings. In the third quarter, international drove 26% of our total bookings. Key international awards included the second phase of the air defense operations center for Qatar plus missiles, training and radars for a number of other international customers.
Domestically, bookings included training, classified as well as various Missile programs, including a 9x, the joint standoff weapon and SM-3.
Given our year-to-date booking strength and our expectation for a strong finish to the year, we are now raising our full year 2015 bookings outlook to $25.5 billion, plus or minus $500 million, which translates into a book-to-bill ratio of approximately 1.1 for the year.
This is $1 billion increase to the prior bookings range that we gave you last quarter, driven by strong demand from our global customers.
Further, it sets the stage for solid top line growth in 2016, which Toby will talk about in a moment.
In the quarter, IIS received good news on 2 key awards, 1 from the U.S. Air Force and the other from the Department of Homeland Security. For the U.S. Air Force contract, which is often referred to as NISk, Raytheon will be providing products and sustainment services that support in its mission to provide air, missile and space threat warnings as well as critical command and control capabilities. NISk has a $700 million ceiling value of over 5 years. This competitive win was initially awarded to Raytheon in April of this year but was protested. The protest was resolved in our favor late in the third quarter. I would add that this award follows a series of recent program wins that IIS for value added services. These wins reflect our modernization through sustainment strategy. 
As for the Department of Homeland Security award, Raytheon was selected to be the prime contractor for the development and sustainment of the national cyber security protection system, a system providing the vital infrastructure that assists more than 100 federal civilian government agencies with the protection of their networks against advanced cyber threats. This award has a ceiling value in excess of $1 billion over 7-year period. While this too has been protested, the customer recognized our compelling cyber strength when making the award. Another strong validation of our cyber strategy and capabilities.
In addition, we have a been supporting our long term growth strategy by increasing investments in our business and advanced technologies. Consistent with our discussions on prior calls, IR&D is being directed to areas that we believe will be future growth markets, including directed energy and hypersonics and undersea, to name just a few. Investments in these technologies will position us well for the future as our customers look for capabilities to counter increasingly sophisticated threats that are developing on the horizon.
I'd like to shift years and take a minute to touch on our capital deployment strategy. We continue forward with the balanced approach, and we are on track to achieve our $1 billion share buyback target for 2015 that we outlined back in July.
After the close of the quarter, we did announced a small acquisition that fills the cybersecurity technology GAAP and enhances our position in high-value managed security services, one of the fastest-growing areas in the cybersecurity market. This is consistent with our go-forward strategy of pursuing smaller targeted bolt-on acquisitions.
Before concluding, I would like to note that the Websense integration is on track. As you will recall, we are currently in the process of combining our legacy Raytheon cyber products business with the Websense acquisition that we completed in May. The business segment has solid margin performance in the quarter and we continue to work to integrate Raytheon cyber products technology into the Websense architecture.
To close, I want to say how proud I am of the Raytheon team and their hard work and dedication that has allowed us to deliver growth despite sequestration. And I want to thank them for their focus on performance, which benefits our customers, our company and our shareholders. 
With that, let me turn it over to Toby."
105612,313821587,879469,"Raytheon Company, Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 22, 2015",2015-10-22,"Earnings Calls","Raytheon Company","Executives","Thanks, Tom. I have a few opening remarks, starting with the third quarter highlights, and then we'll move on to questions. During my remarks, I'll be referring to the web slides that we issued earlier this morning.If everyone would please turn to Page",1775,"Thanks, Tom. I have a few opening remarks, starting with the third quarter highlights, and then we'll move on to questions. During my remarks, I'll be referring to the web slides that we issued earlier this morning.
If everyone would please turn to Page 3. We are pleased with the solid performance that the team delivered in the third quarter with sales, EPS and operating cash flow all at or better than our expectations. We had solid bookings in the third quarter of $5.3 billion. Sales were $5.8 billion in the quarter, up 6%, led by our IDS, Missiles and Raytheon|Websense businesses. EPS from continuing operations was $1.47, which I'll give a little more color on in a few minutes. And operating cash flow of $1.1 billion was better than our prior guidance, driven by the timing of collections.
Third quarter 2015 operating cash flow was significantly higher than last year's third quarter, primarily due to the improvement in working capital and the timing of cash taxes paid in the quarter.
During the quarter, the company repurchased 2.4 million shares of common stock for $250 million, bringing the year-to-date share repurchase to 7 million shares for $750 million.
Turning now to Page 4. Let me start by providing some detail on our third quarter results. Company bookings for the third quarter were $5.3 billion. On a year-to-date basis, bookings were $17.4 billion, an increase of approximately $425 million over the same period last year. It's worth noting that on a trailing 4 quarter basis, our book-to-bill ratio was 1.06. And as Tom just mentioned, given the strength of our overall bookings year-to-date, we now expect full year 2015 bookings to be approximately $25.5 billion, plus or minus $500 million, an increase of over $1 billion from the outlook on the last call in July. This provides a solid foundation for sales growth in 2016. 
For the quarter, international was 26% of our total company bookings. And on a year-to-date basis, was 37%. For the year, we expect international to be approximately 35% of total bookings.
Backlog at the end of the third quarter was $33.6 billion compared to $33.2 billion at the end of the third quarter of last year. And on a funded basis, backlog was $24.4 billion, an increase of almost $1.5 billion compared to last year's third quarter. We expect 2015 year-end total backlog to be up between 4% and 8% from year-end 2014.
If you now move to Page 5. Sales on the third quarter of 2015 were strong, primarily due to the performance at IDS and Missiles. 
Looking now at sales by business. IDS had third quarter 2015 net sales of $1.5 billion, an increase of approximately 7% compared to the third quarter of 2014. This increase was primarily due to 2 recent international Patriot awards. 
Missiles had net sales of $1.6 billion in the third quarter 2015, an increase of approximately 11%. This increase was driven by higher sales for across various production programs, including the total and Missile program and certain missile-defense programs.
In the third quarter 2015, IIS had net sales of $1.4 billion, down slightly when compared with the same quarter last year. SIS had net sales of $1.4 billion. The change versus last year was driven by volume on international tactical radar programs.
And for Raytheon|Websense, the increase was primarily due to the acquisition of Websense, which we completed in the second quarter of 2015. As a reminder, third quarter 2014 included the results for only Raytheon Cyber Products.
Moving ahead to Page 6. Overall, the company continues to perform well. Our operating margin was 12.1% for the total company and 12.3% on a business segment basis. Year-to-date, operating margin was 12.9% at both the total company and the business segment level.
As we discussed on the last few earnings calls, compared to 2014, our margins for 2015 has been impacted by a change in program mix as well as higher investments. We continue to invest in ourselves with the objective of positioning the company for future growth. 
So looking now at the business margins. The change in margins at IDS was primarily driven by a change in program mix on international Patriot programs nearing completion, which is somewhat what we've experienced in the past when we've completed certain programs and ramped up on others. We expect IDS margins to be strong in the fourth quarter, driven by strong performance as well as from an expected contractual modifications. The change in margins at IIS was primarily driven by a change in program mix and acquisition-related costs.
Missiles margins increased 40 basis points in the third quarter 2015, primarily due to a change in program mix. SAS margins were down in the quarter as expected, compared with the same period last year, primarily driven by higher net program efficiencies in the third quarter of 2014.
And at Raytheon|Websense, the third quarter 2015 operating margin was driven by strong operating performance as well as the timing of restructuring expenses in the quarter. We expect restructuring costs to increase in the fourth quarter, reducing margin sequentially, but still on track to meet the full-year 2015 margin outlook.
Turning now to Page 7. Third quarter 2015 EPS was $1.47, better than expected, driven by an improved margin, primarily at Missiles and SAS.
As you look at the EPS walk, operations has been impacted by the investments we are making in the business and the program mix. These are largely offset by our reduced share count. The timing of tax-related items and noncash expenses related to the Raytheon|Websense acquisition make up the difference.
On Page 8, we've tightened the full range for full year 2015 net sales, increasingly the high-end by $100 million. We now expect net sales to be $23 billion and $23.3 billion.
As we have done in prior years, during the third quarter, we updated our actuarial estimates related to our pension plans. As a result of this update, the FAS/CAS Adjustment for the year decreased by $12 million from $197 million to $185 million or an unfavorable impact of $0.30 per share.
We're reaffirming our full year 2015 EPS outlook of $6.47 to $6.62. While this outlook is unchanged from our prior guidance, I would note that we were able to absorb the impact of the unfavorable $0.03 FAS/CAS Adjustment. And as a reminder, we have not included in our 2015 guidance the potential extension of the R&D tax credit. If the legislation passes, it would favorably impact the effective tax rate by about 130 basis points and our EPS by about $0.11 per share.
As I mentioned earlier, we repurchased 2.4 million shares of common stock for $250 million in the quarter, and now see our diluted share count to be approximately 305 million shares for 2015.
Operating cash flow in the third quarter was strong, primarily due to the timing of collections. We continue to see our full year 2015 operating cash flow outlook coming in between $2.5 billion to $2.7 billion. 
And as you can see on Page 9, we've included guidance by business. We have increased and tightened the full year sales outlook at both IDS and Missiles. At IDS, this is driven by the program mix and performance to date that I discussed earlier. Missiles had also experienced better-than-expected year-to-date growth. In addition, we tightened the full year sales range for IIS and SAS. 
Now turning to margins. We've increased the range and expect higher full year operating margin performance for Missiles and SAS. The strong year-to-date results exceeded our prior estimates. We lowered the range of our full year operating margin guidance for IDS, driven by the change in program mix and performance to date. 
Now turning to next year. As we have done in the past, we intend to provide detailed 2016 guidance on our fourth quarter earnings call in January. However, as we sit here today, we currently see strong sales growth for 2016 at 3% to 4% over the midpoint of our 2015 outlook, driven in part by some new development awards we are expecting. We expect segment margins to be flat to up for 2016 compared to 2015, excluding the eBorders settlement in 2015 and depending upon the mix from higher volume in 2016. This positions us well going forward with further margin expansion over time as new development wins lead to production.
I would also add that we currently expect FAS/CAS to improve in 2016 over 2015, which I'll talk about in a moment.
In addition, we expect operating cash flow from continuing operations to be higher in 2016 versus 2015 after adjusting for the eBorders settlement. Of course, I want to caveat all this by saying our assumptions are based on the defense budget being approved in Washington before year end, thereby avoiding an extended CRR for a government shutdown.
So if you could please move to Page 10. We have provided a FAS/CAS pension adjustment matrix for 2016 as we've done in prior years as. I just mentioned, we expect to see improvements to the FAS/CAS Adjustment in 2016 compared to 2015, given the current interest rate environment and asset returns. That said, and just to be clear, the discount rate and the actual asset returns won't be known until we close out 2015.  We'll provide a more detailed pension outlook on our January year-end call.
Before concluding, as we have discussed on past earnings calls with regard to our capital deployment strategy, we expect to continue to generate strong free cash flow and maintain a strong balance sheet at our current credit rate going forward. We remain focused on deploying capital to create value for our shareholders and customers. This includes internal investments to support our growth plans as well as returning capital to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends, making smaller, targeted acquisitions that fit our technology and global growth needs. And from time-to-time, making discretionary contributions to our pension plans.
And as a reminder, as we said on the second quarter earnings call in July, we increased our share buyback by $250 million from our original expectation, bringing the full year 2015 buyback to approximately $1 billion. 
In summary, we saw solid performance in the third quarter. Bookings are strong. Our sales, EPS and operating cash flow from continuing operations were all at or above our expectations. And our strong cash flow and balance sheet will allow us to continue to drive value for our customers and our shareholders. We are well positioned for continued growth in 2016. 
With that, Tom and I will open up the call for questions."

And one of the elements of our international strategy was not just have 1 but to have 3 or 4 binaries. So that we were never relying on any given one.

Good morning, everyone. A little over a year ago, we laid out a strategy to return the company to growth by evolving our approach to international markets, increasing investments in key technologies to better position the company for the future.  Our strong growth during the third quarter reflects the traction that we are gaining from this strategy. 
In the quarter, our revenue increased by 6% due primarily by missiles and IDS as well as from an increased contribution from Raytheon|Websense. 
International revenue, which grew by 13% over last year's third quarter, rose to 32% of the company's total revenue. This is a record level for the company and was driven by customers across various regions turning to Raytheon's advanced technology to address the rapidly evolving threats.  I would also note that our growth was backed by strong cash flow generation, reinforcing our strong financial foundation.  Domestic revenue also increased in the quarter and was up a solid 3%, driven in part by classified.
Turning now to bookings. In the third quarter, international drove 26% of our total bookings. Key international awards included the second phase of the air defense operations center for Qatar, plus missiles, training and radars for a number of other international customers.
Domestically, bookings included training, classified as well as various missile programs, including AIM-9X, the Joint Standoff Weapon and SM-3.
Given our year-to-date booking strength and our expectation for a strong finish to the year, we are now raising our full year 2015 bookings outlook to $25.5 billion, plus or minus $500 million, which translates into a book-to-bill ratio of approximately 1.1 for the year.  This is $1 billion increase to the prior bookings range that we gave you last quarter, driven by strong demand from our global customers.  Further, it sets the stage for solid top line growth in 2016, which Toby will talk about in a moment.
In the quarter, IIS received good news on 2 key awards, one from the U.S. Air Force and the other from the Department of Homeland Security. For the U.S. Air Force contract, which is often referred to as NISSC, Raytheon will be providing products and sustainment services that support NORAD in its mission to provide air, missile and space threat warnings as well as critical command and control capabilities. NISSC has a $700 million ceiling value over 5 years.  This competitive win was initially awarded to Raytheon in April of this year, but was protested. The protest was resolved in our favor late in the third quarter. I would add that this award follows a series of recent program wins that IIS for high value-added services. These wins reflect our modernization through sustainment strategy. 
As for the Department of Homeland Security award, Raytheon was selected to be the prime contractor for the development and sustainment of the National Cybersecurity Protection System, a system providing the vital infrastructure that assists more than 100 federal civilian and government agencies with the protection of their networks against advanced cyber threats.  This award has a ceiling value in excess of $1 billion over 7-year period. While this too has been protested, the customer recognized our compelling cyber strength when making the award, another strong validation of our cyber strategy and capabilities.
In addition, we have a been supporting our long-term growth strategy by increasing investments in our business and advanced technologies. Consistent with our discussions on prior calls, IR&D is being directed to areas that we believe will be future growth markets, including directed energy and hypersonics and undersea, to name just a few. Investments in these technologies will position us well for the future, as our customers look for capabilities to counter increasingly sophisticated threats that are developing on the horizon.
I'd like to shift gears and take a minute to touch on our capital deployment strategy. We continue forward with the balanced approach, and we are on track to achieve our $1 billion share buyback target for 2015 that we outlined back in July.
After the close of the quarter, we did announce a small acquisition that fills the cybersecurity technology GAAP and enhances our position in high value-managed security services, one of the fastest growing areas in the cybersecurity market. This is consistent with our go-forward strategy of pursuing smaller targeted bolt-on acquisitions.
Before concluding, I would like to note that the Websense integration is on track. As you will recall, we are currently in the process of combining our legacy Raytheon Cyber Products business with the Websense acquisition that we completed in May. The business segment has solid margin performance in the quarter, and we continued to work to integrate Raytheon Cyber Products technology into the Websense architecture.
To close, I want to say how proud I am of the Raytheon team and their hard work and dedication that has allowed us to deliver growth despite sequestration. And I want to thank them for their focus on performance, which benefits our customers, our company and our shareholders. 
With that, let me turn it over to Toby."
105612,313821587,879920,"Raytheon Company, Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 22, 2015",2015-10-22,"Earnings Calls","Raytheon Company","Executives","Thanks, Tom. I have a few opening remarks, starting with the third quarter highlights, and then we'll move on to questions. During my remarks, I'll be referring to the web slides that we issued earlier this morning.If everyone would please turn to Page",1770,"Thanks, Tom. I have a few opening remarks, starting with the third quarter highlights, and then we'll move on to questions. During my remarks, I'll be referring to the web slides that we issued earlier this morning.
If everyone would please turn to Page 3. We are pleased with the solid performance the team delivered in the third quarter, with sales, EPS and operating cash flow all at or better than our expectations. 
We had solid bookings in the third quarter of $5.3 billion. Sales were $5.8 billion in the quarter, up 6%, led by our IDS, missiles and Raytheon|Websense businesses.  
EPS from continuing operations was $1.47, which I'll give a little more color on in a few minutes. 
And operating cash flow of $1.1 billion was better than our prior guidance, driven by the timing of collections.  Third quarter 2015 operating cash flow was significantly higher than last year's third quarter, primarily due to the improvement in working capital and the timing of cash taxes paid in the quarter.
During the quarter, the company repurchased 2.4 million shares of common stock for $250 million, bringing the year-to-date share repurchase to 7 million shares for $750 million.
Turning now to Page 4. Let me start by providing some detail on our third quarter results. Company bookings for the third quarter were $5.3 billion. On a year-to-date basis, bookings were $17.4 billion, an increase of approximately $425 million over the same period last year. It's worth noting that on a trailing 4-quarter basis, our book-to-bill ratio was 1.06. And as Tom just mentioned, given the strength of our overall bookings year-to-date, we now expect full year 2015 bookings to be approximately $25.5 billion, plus or minus $500 million, an increase of over $1 billion from the outlook on the last call in July. This provides a solid foundation for sales growth in 2016.
For the quarter, international was 26% of our total company bookings, and on a year-to-date basis was 37%. For the year, we expect international to be approximately 35% of total bookings.
Backlog at the end of the third quarter was $33.6 billion compared to $33.2 billion at the end of the third quarter of last year. And on a funded basis, backlog was $24.4 billion, an increase of almost $1.5 billion compared to last year's third quarter. We expect 2015 year-end total backlog to be up between 4% and 8% from year-end 2014.
If you now move to Page 5, sales in the third quarter of 2015 were strong, primarily due to the performance at IDS and missiles.
Looking now at sales by business. IDS had third quarter 2015 net sales of $1.5 billion, an increase of approximately 7% compared to the third quarter of 2014. This increase was primarily due to 2 recent international Patriot awards. 
Missiles had net sales of $1.6 billion in the third quarter 2015, an increase of approximately 11%. This increase was driven by higher sales [ph] across various production programs, including the TOW missile program and certain missile defense programs.
In the third quarter 2015, IIS had net sales of $1.4 billion, down slightly when compared with the same quarter last year. SIS had net sales of $1.4 billion. The change versus last year was driven by volume on international tactical radar programs.
And for Raytheon|Websense, the increase was primarily due to the acquisition of Websense, which we completed in the second quarter of 2015. As a reminder, third quarter 2014 included the results for only Raytheon Cyber Products.
Moving ahead to Page 6. Overall, the company continues to perform well. Our operating margin was 12.1% for the total company and 12.3% on a business segment basis. Year-to-date, operating margin was 12.9% at both the total company and business segment level.
As we discussed on the last few earnings calls, compared to 2014, our margins for 2015 has been impacted by a change in program mix as well as higher investments. We continue to invest in ourselves with the objective of positioning the company for future growth.
So looking now at the business margins. The change in margins at IDS was primarily driven by a change in program mix on international Patriot programs nearing completion, which is similar to what we've experienced in the past when we've completed certain programs and ramped up on others. We expect IDS margins to be strong in the fourth quarter, driven by strong performance, as well as from an expected contractual modification. The change in margins at IIS was primarily driven by a change in program mix and acquisition-related cost.
Missiles margins increased 40 basis points in the third quarter 2015, primarily due to a change in program mix. SAS margins were down in the quarter, as expected, compared with the same period last year, primarily driven by higher net program efficiencies in the third quarter of 2014.
And at Raytheon|Websense, the third quarter 2015 operating margin was driven by strong operating performance as well as the timing of restructuring expenses in the quarter. We expect restructuring cost to increase in the fourth quarter, reducing margin sequentially, but still on track to meet the full year 2015 margin outlook.
Turning now to Page 7. Third quarter 2015 EPS was $1.47, better than expected, driven by improved margin, primarily at missiles and SAS.
As you look at the EPS walk, operations has been impacted by the investments we are making in the business and program mix. These are largely offset by our reduced share count. The timing of tax-related items and noncash expenses related to the Raytheon|Websense acquisition make up the difference.
On Page 8, we've tightened the full range for full year 2015 net sales, increasingly the high end by $100 million. We now expect net sales to be $23 billion and $23.3 billion.
As we have done in prior years, during the third quarter, we updated our actuarial estimates related to our pension plans. As a result of this update, the FAS/CAS Adjustment for the year decreased by $12 million from $197 million to $185 million or an unfavorable impact of $0.03 per share.
We're reaffirming our full year 2015 EPS outlook of $6.47 to $6.62. While this outlook is unchanged from our prior guidance, I would note that we were able to absorb the impact of the unfavorable $0.03 FAS/CAS Adjustment. And as a reminder, we have not included in our 2015 guidance the potential extension of the R&D tax credit. If the legislation passes, it would favorably impact the effective tax rate by about 130 basis points and our EPS by about $0.11 per share.
As I mentioned earlier, we repurchased 2.4 million shares of common stock for $250 million in the quarter and now see our diluted share count to be approximately 305 million shares for 2015.
Operating cash flow in the third quarter was strong, primarily due to the timing of collections. We continue to see our full year 2015 operating cash flow outlook coming in between $2.5 billion to $2.7 billion. 
And as you can see on Page 9, we've included guidance by business. We've increased and tightened the full year sales outlook at both IDS and missiles. At IDS, this is driven by the program mix and performance to-date that I discussed earlier. Missiles has also experienced better-than-expected year-to-date growth. In addition, we tightened the full year sales range for IIS and SAS. 
Now turning to margins. We've increased the range and expect higher full year operating margin performance for missiles and SAS. The strong year-to-date results exceeded our prior estimates. We lowered the range of our full year operating margin guidance for IDS, driven by the change in program mix and performance to-date. 
Now turning to next year. As we have done in the past, we intend to provide detailed 2016 guidance on our fourth quarter earnings call in January. However, as we sit here today, we currently see strong sales growth for 2016 at 3% to 4% over the midpoint of our 2015 outlook, driven in part by some new development awards we are expecting. We expect segment margins to be flat to up for 2016 compared to 2015, excluding the eBorders settlement in 2015 and depending upon the mix from higher volume in 2016. This positions us well going forward with further margin expansion over time, as new development wins lead to production.
I would also add that we currently expect FAS/CAS to improve in 2016 over 2015, which I'll talk about in a moment.
In addition, we expect operating cash flow from continuing operations to be higher in 2016 versus 2015, after adjusting for the eBorders settlement. Of course, I want to caveat all this by saying our assumptions are based on the defense budget being approved in Washington before year-end, thereby avoiding an extended CR for a government shutdown.
So if you could please move to Page 10, we have provided a FAS/CAS pension adjustment matrix for 2016 as we've done in prior years. As I just mentioned, we expect to see improvement to the FAS/CAS Adjustment in 2016 compared to 2015, given the current interest rate environment and asset returns. That said, and just to be clear, the discount rate and the actual asset returns won't be known until we close out 2015.  We'll provide a more detailed pension outlook on our January year-end call.
Before concluding, as we have discussed on past earnings calls with regard to our capital deployment strategy, we expect to continue to generate strong free cash flow and maintain a strong balance sheet at our current credit rate going forward. We remain focused on deploying capital to create value for our shareholders and customers. This includes internal investments to support our growth plans as well as returning capital to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends, making smaller, targeted acquisitions that fit our technology and global growth needs, and from time-to-time, making discretionary contributions to our pension plans.
And as a reminder, as we said on the second quarter earnings call in July, we increased our share buyback by $250 million from our original expectation, bringing the full year 2015 buyback to approximately $1 billion. 
In summary, we saw a solid performance in the third quarter. Bookings were strong. Our sales, EPS and operating cash flow from continuing operations were all at or above our expectations. And our strong cash flow and balance sheet will allow us to continue to drive value for our customers and our shareholders. We are well positioned for continued growth in 2016.
With that, Tom and I will open up the call for questions."

Specifically, we are seeing more development work on programs like AMDR, and we have had some increase in our content on AWD. Combine that with the fact that we're still ramping up on some of our other large recent awards, which we've talked about in the past, they start out at lower margins, they expand their margins over time as they progress to the cycle and retire risk.

We saw it initially in South Korea with Patriot orders, but we are also seeing it in the areas relative to replenishing the weapons that they have. So it's not just in one region.

I do want to mention something -- go back to something that Toby said about the binaries, and in the past, we've always had one of these big $1 billion, multibillion-dollar binaries who were waiting. And one of the elements of our international strategy was to not just have 1 but to have 3 or 4 binaries so that we were never relying on any given one. And that's actually the position -- a great position we're in today. We don't just have one order we're waiting for to be able to achieve several billion dollars worth of international bookings. And it's kind of a different -- it's a totally different feel here. It's a great feel, by the way, that we don't have to hang our head into one big binary in any quarter.

That's getting ready to go through congressional notification. And it earlier had a congressional notification. But the customer wanted to increase the size of the radar, so we have to go back.

Good morning, everyone. A little over a year ago, we laid out a strategy to return the company to growth by evolving our approach to international markets, increasing investments in key technologies to better position the company for the future.  Our strong growth during the third quarter reflects the traction that we are gaining from this strategy. 
In the quarter, our revenue increased by 6% due primarily by missiles and IDS as well as from an increased contribution from Raytheon|Websense.  International revenue, which grew by 13% over last year's third quarter, rose to 32% of the company's total revenue. This is a record level for the company and was driven by customers across various regions turning to Raytheon's advanced technology to address the rapidly evolving threats.  I would also note that our growth was backed by strong cash flow generation, reinforcing our strong financial foundation.  Domestic revenue also increased in the quarter and was up a solid 3%, driven in part by classified.
Turning now to bookings. In the third quarter, international drove 26% of our total bookings. Key international awards included the second phase of the air defense operations center for Qatar, plus missiles, training and radars for a number of other international customers. Domestically, bookings included training, classified as well as various missile programs, including AIM-9X, the Joint Standoff Weapon and SM-3. Given our year-to-date booking strength and our expectation for a strong finish to the year, we are now raising our full year 2015 bookings outlook to $25.5 billion, plus or minus $500 million, which translates into a book-to-bill ratio of approximately 1.1 for the year.  This is a $1 billion increase to the prior bookings range that we gave you last quarter, driven by strong demand from our global customers.  Further, it sets the stage for solid top line growth in 2016, which Toby will talk about in a moment.
In the quarter, IIS received good news on 2 key awards, one from the U.S. Air Force and the other from the Department of Homeland Security. For the U.S. Air Force contract, which is often referred to as NISSC, Raytheon will be providing products and sustainment services that support NORAD in its mission to provide air, missile and space threat warnings as well as critical command and control capabilities. NISSC has a $700 million ceiling value over 5 years.  This competitive win was initially awarded to Raytheon in April of this year, but was protested. The protest was resolved in our favor late in the third quarter. I would add that this award follows a series of recent program wins at IIS for high value-added services. These wins reflect our modernization through sustainment strategy. 
As for the Department of Homeland Security award, Raytheon was selected to be the prime contractor for the development and sustainment of the National Cybersecurity Protection System, a system providing the vital infrastructure that assists more than 100 federal civilian and government agencies with the protection of their networks against advanced cyber threats.  This award has a ceiling value in excess of $1 billion over 7-year period. While this too has been protested, the customer recognized our compelling cyber strength when making the award, another strong validation of our cyber strategy and capabilities.
In addition, we have been supporting our long-term growth strategy by increasing investments in our business and advanced technologies. Consistent with our discussions on prior calls, IR&D is being directed to areas that we believe will be future growth markets, including directed energy and hypersonics and undersea, to name just a few. Investments in these technologies will position us well for the future, as our customers look for capabilities to counter increasingly sophisticated threats that are developing on the horizon.
I'd like to shift gears and take a minute to touch on our capital deployment strategy. We continue forward with a balanced approach, and we are on track to achieve our $1 billion share buyback target for 2015 that we outlined back in July. After the close of the quarter, we did announce a small acquisition that fills the cybersecurity technology gap and enhances our position in high value-managed security services, one of the fastest growing areas in the cybersecurity market. This is consistent with our go-forward strategy of pursuing smaller targeted bolt-on acquisitions.
Before concluding, I would like to note that the Websense integration is on track. As you will recall, we are currently in the process of combining our legacy Raytheon Cyber Products business with the Websense acquisition that we completed in May. The business segment has solid margin performance in the quarter, and we continue to work to integrate Raytheon Cyber Products technology into the Websense architecture. To close, I want to say how proud I am of the Raytheon team and their hard work and dedication that has allowed us to deliver growth despite sequestration. And I want to thank them for their focus on performance, which benefits our customers, our company and our shareholders. 
With that, let me turn it over to Toby."

I have a few opening remarks, starting with the third quarter highlights, and then we'll move on to questions. During my remarks, I'll be referring to the web slides that we issued earlier this morning.If everyone would please turn to Page",1770,"Thanks, Tom. I have a few opening remarks, starting with the third quarter highlights, and then we'll move on to questions. During my remarks, I'll be referring to the web slides that we issued earlier this morning.
If everyone would please turn to Page 3. We are pleased with the solid performance the team delivered in the third quarter, with sales, EPS and operating cash flow all at or better than our expectations. We had solid bookings in the third quarter of $5.3 billion. Sales were $5.8 billion in the quarter, up 6%, led by our IDS, missiles and Raytheon|Websense businesses.  EPS from continuing operations was $1.47, which I'll give a little more color on in a few minutes. And operating cash flow of $1.1 billion was better than our prior guidance, driven by the timing of collections.  Third quarter 2015 operating cash flow was significantly higher than last year's third quarter, primarily due to the improvement in working capital and the timing of cash taxes paid in the quarter. During the quarter, the company repurchased 2.4 million shares of common stock for $250 million, bringing the year-to-date share repurchase to 7 million shares for $750 million.
Turning now to Page 4. Let me start by providing some detail on our third quarter results. Company bookings for the third quarter were $5.3 billion. On a year-to-date basis, bookings were $17.4 billion, an increase of approximately $425 million over the same period last year. It's worth noting that on a trailing 4-quarter basis, our book-to-bill ratio was 1.06. And as Tom just mentioned, given the strength of our overall bookings year-to-date, we now expect full year 2015 bookings to be approximately $25.5 billion, plus or minus $500 million, an increase of over $1 billion from the outlook on the last call in July. This provides a solid foundation for sales growth in 2016. 
For the quarter, international was 26% of our total company bookings, and on a year-to-date basis was 37%. For the year, we expect international to be approximately 35% of total bookings. Backlog at the end of the third quarter was $33.6 billion compared to $33.2 billion at the end of the third quarter of last year. And on a funded basis, backlog was $24.4 billion, an increase of almost $1.5 billion compared to last year's third quarter. We expect 2015 year-end total backlog to be up between 4% and 8% from year-end 2014.
If you now move to Page 5. Sales in the third quarter of 2015 were strong, primarily due to the performance at IDS and missiles. Looking now at sales by business. IDS had third quarter 2015 net sales of $1.5 billion, an increase of approximately 7% compared to the third quarter of 2014. This increase was primarily due to 2 recent international Patriot awards. Missiles had net sales of $1.6 billion in the third quarter 2015, an increase of approximately 11%. This increase was driven by higher sales spread across various production programs, including the TOW missile program and certain missile defense programs.
In the third quarter 2015, IIS had net sales of $1.4 billion, down slightly when compared with the same quarter last year. SIS had net sales of $1.4 billion. The change versus last year was driven by volume on international tactical radar programs. And for Raytheon|Websense, the increase was primarily due to the acquisition of Websense, which we completed in the second quarter of 2015. As a reminder, third quarter 2014 included the results for only Raytheon Cyber Products.
Moving ahead to Page 6. Overall, the company continues to perform well. Our operating margin was 12.1% for the total company and 12.3% on a business segment basis. Year-to-date, operating margin was 12.9% at both the total company and business segment level. As we discussed on the last few earnings calls, compared to 2014, our margins for 2015 has been impacted by a change in program mix as well as higher investments. We continue to invest in ourselves with the objective of positioning the company for future growth.
So looking now at the business margins. The change in margins at IDS was primarily driven by a change in program mix on international Patriot programs nearing completion, which is similar to what we've experienced in the past when we've completed certain programs and ramped up on others. We expect IDS margins to be strong in the fourth quarter, driven by strong performance, as well as from an expected contractual modification. The change in margins at IIS was primarily driven by a change in program mix and acquisition-related cost.
Missiles margins increased 40 basis points in the third quarter 2015, primarily due to a change in program mix. SAS margins were down in the quarter, as expected, compared with the same period last year, primarily driven by higher net program efficiencies in the third quarter of 2014. And at Raytheon|Websense, the third quarter 2015 operating margin was driven by strong operating performance as well as the timing of restructuring expenses in the quarter. We expect restructuring cost to increase in the fourth quarter, reducing margin sequentially, but still on track to meet the full year 2015 margin outlook.
Turning now to Page 7. Third quarter 2015 EPS was $1.47, better than expected, driven by improved margin, primarily at missiles and SAS. As you look at the EPS walk, operations has been impacted by the investments we are making in the business and program mix. These are largely offset by our reduced share count. The timing of tax-related items and noncash expenses related to the Raytheon|Websense acquisition make up the difference.
On Page 8, we've tightened the full range for full year 2015 net sales, increasingly the high end by $100 million. We now expect net sales to be $23 billion and $23.3 billion. As we have done in prior years, during the third quarter, we updated our actuarial estimates related to our pension plans. As a result of this update, the FAS/CAS Adjustment for the year decreased by $12 million from $197 million to $185 million or an unfavorable impact of $0.03 per share.
We're reaffirming our full year 2015 EPS outlook of $6.47 to $6.62. While this outlook is unchanged from our prior guidance, I would note that we were able to absorb the impact of the unfavorable $0.03 FAS/CAS Adjustment. And as a reminder, we have not included in our 2015 guidance the potential extension of the R&D tax credit. If the legislation passes, it would favorably impact the effective tax rate by about 130 basis points and our EPS by about $0.11 per share. As I mentioned earlier, we repurchased 2.4 million shares of common stock for $250 million in the quarter and now see our diluted share count to be approximately 305 million shares for 2015. Operating cash flow in the third quarter was strong, primarily due to the timing of collections. We continue to see our full year 2015 operating cash flow outlook coming in between $2.5 billion to $2.7 billion. 
And as you can see on Page 9, we've included guidance by business. We've increased and tightened the full year sales outlook at both IDS and missiles. At IDS, this is driven by the program mix and performance to-date that I discussed earlier. Missiles has also experienced better-than-expected year-to-date growth. In addition, we tightened the full year sales range for IIS and SAS. 
Now turning to margins. We've increased the range and expect higher full year operating margin performance for missiles and SAS. The strong year-to-date results exceeded our prior estimates. We lowered the range of our full year operating margin guidance for IDS, driven by the change in program mix and performance to-date. 
Now turning to next year. As we have done in the past, we intend to provide detailed 2016 guidance on our fourth quarter earnings call in January. However, as we sit here today, we currently see strong sales growth for 2016 at 3% to 4% over the midpoint of our 2015 outlook, driven in part by some new development awards we are expecting. We expect segment margins to be flat to up for 2016 compared to 2015, excluding the eBorders settlement in 2015 and depending upon the mix from higher volume in 2016. This positions us well going forward with further margin expansion over time, as new development wins lead to production.
I would also add that we currently expect FAS/CAS to improve in 2016 over 2015, which I'll talk about in a moment. In addition, we expect operating cash flow from continuing operations to be higher in 2016 versus 2015, after adjusting for the eBorders settlement. Of course, I want to caveat all this by saying our assumptions are based on the defense budget being approved in Washington before year-end, thereby avoiding an extended CR or a government shutdown.
So if you could please move to Page 10, we have provided a FAS/CAS pension adjustment matrix for 2016 as we've done in prior years. As I just mentioned, we expect to see improvement to the FAS/CAS Adjustment in 2016 compared to 2015, given the current interest rate environment and asset returns. That said, and just to be clear, the discount rate and the actual asset returns won't be known until we close out 2015.  We'll provide a more detailed pension outlook on our January year-end call.
Before concluding, as we have discussed on past earnings calls with regard to our capital deployment strategy, we expect to continue to generate strong free cash flow and maintain a strong balance sheet at our current credit rate going forward. We remain focused on deploying capital to create value for our shareholders and customers. This includes internal investments to support our growth plans as well as returning capital to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends, making smaller, targeted acquisitions that fit our technology and global growth needs, and from time-to-time, making discretionary contributions to our pension plans. And as a reminder, as we said on the second quarter earnings call in July, we increased our share buyback by $250 million from our original expectation, bringing the full year 2015 buyback to approximately $1 billion. 
In summary, we saw a solid performance in the third quarter. Bookings were strong. Our sales, EPS and operating cash flow from continuing operations were all at or above our expectations. And our strong cash flow and balance sheet will allow us to continue to drive value for our customers and our shareholders. We are well positioned for continued growth in 2016.
With that, Tom and I will open up the call for questions."

So for IDS, as I mentioned, we still expect margins in Q4 to be strong. We did, however, adjust our guidance. It does reflect, as you just suggested, an update in mix and our performance to-date. Specifically, we are seeing more development work on programs like AMDR, and we have had some increase in our content on AWD. Combine that with the fact that we're still ramping up on some of our other large recent awards, which we've talked about in the past, they start out at lower margins, they expand their margins over time as they progress to the cycle and retire risk. So we're still seeing that mix issue impact as we go through the balance of this year, okay?

I do want to mention something -- go back to something that Toby said about the binaries, and in the past, we've always had one of these big $1 billion or multibillion-dollar binaries who were waiting. And one of the elements of our international strategy was to not just have 1 but to have 3 or 4 binaries so that we were never relying on any given one. And that's actually the position -- great position we're in today. We don't just have one order we're waiting for to be able to achieve several billion dollars' worth of international bookings. And it's kind of a different -- it's a totally different feel here. It's a great feel, by the way, that we don't have to hang our hat on 1 big binary in any quarter.
