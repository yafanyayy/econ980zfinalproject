When we got to 2014, then the comps became very difficult, and so that's what you're seeing if you're looking at Q3, and we show you Q4 in our 10-K, you'll see a similar thing.

I believe most, if not all, of our developments are ahead of schedule in terms of pro forma occupancies and cash flow. They're not ahead of schedule in terms of achieving targeted rents, and that's by design in terms of we use a different pricing strategy for developments than we do for stabilized properties. The Bronx [indiscernible] property is actually about 92% occupied today, which if you would ask me 18 months ago when it opened if we'd be at 92% occupied and 18 months with 4,000 units, I would have laughed.

So what we did on the promotional discounts in the television in Q4 not only helped our position -- our revenue growth in Q4 which accelerated over Q3, but it's positioned us nicely going into Q3 for higher occupancies -- our Q1, excuse me, for higher occupancies and higher in-place rents."

And then second, on the developments, domestic developments, you're starting to deliver that product in the market now. And I was wondering if you could just give us an update, any thoughts on sort of the lease-up time frames here. I know historically, I believe it would take anywhere from maybe 3 or 4 years or so to lease up and stabilize underdevelopment. I know your large Bronx facility leased up much quicker than that. Just curious what you think the average time to get these projects delivered over the next 12 months to stabilization might look like."

It's generally somewhere between 3 and 4 years, depending on the property size. And that achievement of stabilization, part of our underwriting is we impute a cost to carry until we do achieve stabilized NOI. So far, we've been fortunate. I believe most, if not all, of our developments are ahead of schedule in terms of pro forma occupancies and cash flow. They're not ahead of schedule in terms of achieving targeted rents, and that's by design in terms of we use a different pricing strategy for developments than we do for stabilized properties. The Bronx, the Gerard property is actually about 92% occupied today, which if you would ask me 18 months ago when it opened if we'd be at 92% occupied in 18 months with 4,000 units, I would have laughed. So the pricing group, the marketing groups have done a great job in operations in getting that property filled up. And that's kind of the way it's working across the platform. So hopefully, we'll be delivering pleasant surprises with respect to our developments but our underwriting hasn't changed."

With the completion of the private placement in June of last year, refinancing of the debt, Shurgard has a fair amount of free cash flow. And so they've been ramping up their opportunity set in terms of acquisitions and development. And so at year end, I think we have 3 or 4 properties in the pipeline to develop in London. And then we did this acquisition in Germany. And I would anticipate that you'll see more activity out of Shurgard in 2015. We generally don't comment on transactions.

And that achievement of stabilization, part of our underwriting is we impute a cost to carry until we do achieve stabilized NOI. So far, we've been fortunate. I believe most, if not all, of our developments are ahead of schedule in terms of pro forma occupancies and cash flow. They're not ahead of schedule in terms of achieving targeted rents, and that's by design in terms of we use a different pricing strategy for developments than we do for stabilized properties. The Bronx, the Gerard property is actually about 92% occupied today, which if you would ask me 18 months ago when it opened if we'd be at 92% occupied in 18 months with 4,000 units, I would have laughed. So the pricing group, the marketing groups have done a great job in operations in getting that property filled up. And that's kind of the way it's working across the platform. So hopefully, we'll be delivering pleasant surprises with respect to our developments but our underwriting hasn't changed."

So we're really able, with the development teams, to fill in market and sub markets that we want to be in and really improve our market share and the quality of our portfolio in the various markets."

Generally, what we do on properties that aren't what we consider stabilized 90-plus percent occupancy is will tend to be a little aggressive, actually a lot aggressive on rates to fill them up. And as they fill up and stabilize, then we'll start to push the street rate and the in-place rents on customers. Are we filling up faster than we anticipated? Yes. You take the Gerard property, which opened in May or June of '13, 4,000 units. And it ended April at 93.9%. I think we forecast that property taking 4 years to fill up, and it's basically filled up in less than 2. So much faster than we anticipate. However, it is at -- filled up at lower rates than we anticipated but we think we'll make that up. And so, net-net, we'll be ahead of the game, and we're seeing that in both our developments and acquisitions. The table that is in the press release, if you look at the '13 acquisitions, 2013 acquisitions kind of give you an indication of what we're doing. Last year, they were at 86.3%. They ended Q1 at 92.8% so up 7.5%. And then you see the contract rents moving from $13.25 to $14 or up 5.7%. So you should expect in that portfolio that maybe occupancy comes up a little bit in terms of stabilization, but the rates will continue to move up at the above average levels for probably the next couple of years because we fill them up at below-market rate."

If you look at Q1, a big increase item was snow removal. We're up over $1 million over last year. I can't believe we're up $1 million over last year but we were. Utilities are down. Gas prices are down. Oil prices are down. And so I think -- and we've renegotiated some utility contracts, so I think that number could remain flat to slightly down. Advertising is selling when we're 95% occupied. There's not a lot of need for that. I think when we get to Q2, we didn't do advertising in Q2 last year so you won't see advertising this year so that line will probably be flat. And whether we do advertising the balance of this year is yet to be determined. Other direct property costs were up 3 6 [ph] and then allocated overhead was down mainly because we used annual sales in the first quarter, and we moved it into the third and fourth quarters of last year.

I will tell you as you go across the country, markets vary greatly between 2 and 3 square feet per capita and 12 and 15 square feet per capita. And obviously, the ones that have the highest square footage tend to have lower rate growth. If you ask me where development is -- will happen fastest, New York has been working on development programs for a while, so I think we'll see big uptick or a meaningful uptake in supply in the New York area. And then across the country, it'll vary between in-fill markets and then outlying markets where it's easier to get zoning, permitting and land is cheaper.

On the discounting side, at least for the quarter, our discount -- the number of move-ins receiving discounts was -- the percentage was about the same as it has the first quarter of last year, so roughly about 80% of our move-ins were getting a discount.

Advertising to selling, when we're 95% occupied, there's not a lot of need for that. I think when we get to Q2, we didn't do advertising in Q2 last year, so you won't see advertising this year. So that line will probably be flat. And whether we do advertising, the balance of this year is yet to be determined. Other direct property tax costs were up 3.6% and then allocated overhead was down mainly because we used to have our annual sales conference in the first quarter, and we moved it into the third and fourth quarters of last year.

I will tell you as you go across the country, markets vary greatly between 2 and 3 square feet per capita and 12 and 15 square feet per capita. And obviously, the ones that have the highest square footage tend to have lower rate growth. If you ask me where development is -- will happen fastest, New York has been working on development programs for a while, so I think we'll see big uptick or meaningful uptick in supply in the New York area. And then across the country, it'll vary between in-fill markets and then outlying markets, where it's easier to get zoning, permitting and land is cheaper.

You take the Gerard property, which opened in May or June of '13, 4,000 units, and it ended April at 93.9%. I think we forecast that property taking 4 years to fill up, and it's basically filled up in less than 2. So much faster than we anticipated. However, it is at -- filled up at lower rates than we anticipated, but we think we'll make that up. And so net-net, we'll be ahead of the game, and we're seeing that in both our developments and acquisitions. The table that is in the press release, if you look at the '13 acquisitions, 2013 acquisitions, they kind of give you an indication of what we're doing. Last year, they were at 86.3%. They ended Q1 at 92.8%, so up 7.5%. And then you see the contract rents moving from $13.25 to $14 or up 5.7%.

Oil prices are down. And so I think -- and we've renegotiated some utility contracts, so I think that number could remain flat to slightly down. Advertising and selling, when we're 95% occupied, there's not a lot of need for that. I think when we get to Q2, we didn't do advertising in Q2 last year, so you won't see advertising this year. So that line will probably be flat. And whether we do advertising the balance of this year is yet to be determined. Other direct property tax costs were up 3.6% and then allocated overhead was down mainly because we used to have our annual sales conference in the first quarter, and we moved it into the third and fourth quarters of last year.

If you ask me where development is -- will happen fastest, New York has been working on development programs for a while, so I think we'll see big uptick or meaningful uptick in supply in the New York area. And then across the country, it'll vary between in-fill markets and then outlying markets, where it's easier to get zoning, permitting and land is cheaper.

And a good chunk balance of this year first half next year, but it will dribble out through 2016. So if you take that 60 properties, we're 5% of the industry, so that's about 1,200 properties nationwide, right? 100 million to 120 million square feet. It's not all going to firm if you go across the country. We're developing where we see other people develop in the most of our markets where you'd expect, Texas, Florida, Arizona. We're not developing anything in the Midwest, but there are stuff going on there, whereas development not occurring or it's de minimis, Los Angeles, San Francisco, downtown Seattle, downtown Miami, Boston, where it's very challenging to get sites, you're competing with the high rise residential guys, we're simply not available -- land available to build self storage. So it's not uniform across the country. But if you can take our portfolio, our development as a percentage of our portfolio where we are in the industry, 2.5%, 3% industry expansion does it sound unreasonable. That compares with the kind of the natural growth rate, which I've talked about on previous calls of U.S. population growth, which is somewhere between 0.8% and 1% across the country. Again, population growth is not uniform, it's higher in markets like Texas, Florida, Arizona. So maybe the product coming on there can be absorbed by the above average population growth."

What that does to the volume, I don't no. And does our percentage reflective of the industry, maybe we start development a couple of years ago so maybe we're low ahead of the curve.

And if you recall, it was about a $5.5 billion deal, to structure that even though it is was all stock has a taxable transaction, which was very important to us. So with picked up a lot of tax basis in that transaction in 1 shot. In addition, a lot of the merger cost and option exercise cost and severance cost, we waited until the deal closed. So we got a lot of tax benefits from that transaction in '06, '07, a way which helped keep our earnings growing, our payout wasn't changing. And so the spread between earnings and payout got very low to your comment. As time has gone on, the portfolios continued to approve, we've delevered and some of those tax benefits have burned off to where we're basically, our payout is still a taxable income. That strategy has not changed in 25 years, it's still a taxable income. But as the portfolio's grown, we're only able to retain $250 million, $300 million a year. So as the earnings basis grows, that has reduced our percentage of retained cash flow. The absolute numbers about the same. But percentage-wise, therefore, our payout ratio is going up.

So you're looking at the front-end of the that dividend activity increased relative to the current earnings. What we did is projected our earnings for the next 12 months and came up with that dividend level. So I think you'll see it come back a little bit more in line, but it's not going back down at 50%.

It's not occurring in all the uniformity, though, across the country. It's -- where we're developing, where we see other people developing the most, our markets where you would expect, Texas, Florida, Arizona. We're not developing anything in the Midwest, but there are stuff going on there. Where is development not occurring or it's de minimis? Los Angeles, San Francisco, downtown Seattle, downtown Miami, Boston, where it's very challenging to get sites. You're competing with the high-rise residential guys where there's simply not available -- land available to build self-storage. So it's not uniform across the country. But if you then take our portfolio, our development as a percentage of our portfolio, where we are in the industry, 2.5%, 3% industry expansion doesn't sound unreasonable. That compares with kind of the natural growth rate, which I've talked about on previous calls, of U.S. population growth, which is somewhere between 0.8% and 1% across the country. Again, population growth is not uniform. It's higher on markets like Texas, Florida, Arizona. So maybe the product coming on there can be absorbed by the above-average population growth."

The structure of that, even though it was all stock, has a taxable transaction, so -- which was very important to us. So we picked up a lot of tax basis in that transaction in one shot. In addition, a lot of the merger cost and option exercise cost and severance cost, we waited till the deal closed. And so we got a lot of tax benefits from that transaction in '06, '07, '08, which helped keep our -- build our -- our earnings were growing. Our payout wasn't changing. And so the spread between earnings and payout got very low, to your comment. As time has gone on, the portfolios continued to improve. We've delevered, and some of those tax benefits have burned off to where we're -- basically, our payout is still a taxable income. That strategy has not changed in 25 years. It's still a taxable income. But as the portfolio's grown, we're only able to retain $250 million, $300 million a year.

So that was the way we structured the deal, the pricing we came up with the deal. We didn't factor in synergies and we didn't factor in the tax attributes. Those things were icing on the cake, and to take care of the things that we didn't know about in the transaction. So our underwriting on real estate, the way we think about it, what market, submarkets really goes to that question I answered earlier about our strategy of building presence and dominance in market, building and buying A and B locations.

Going forward, on the advertising, I would expect that it's probably going to be relatively flat Q3 and in Q4 because we'll probably go back onto television in those quarters, similar to what we did last year. As for the R&M, I think it's really -- it's down. But it's mostly, I think, timing. I think we're expecting for the full year that R&M will be relatively flat.

          The problem that happens when you start pushing rate too high is you will get a tenant that you'll probably have to continue to provide the dollar special discount and/or you will get a tenant that will not be a very long-term tenant. So it's not necessarily -- the game is not won on the move-in rate. The game is won on getting the tenant that stays long and gets -- becomes very sticky to rate increases.

          Sticking with development for a second. It looks like right now, the pipeline is $450 million to $500 million for development and expansion. Two questions.

          Mike, I think we're -- the team has got their track shoes on and they're going around the track about as fast as they can. With respect to the development team, they're doing a great job. And keep in mind, in terms of the development pipeline, you've got stuff delivering, right? So we've got product, right? The Glendale property delivered in Q2. So that comes out of the pipeline. And so you've got to backfill that just to kind of run in place at $500 million or $480 million. So there's a continuous in, out process on that pipeline of deliveries and in new projects coming into it. So I wouldn't anticipate much more -- that number going much above $500 million, certainly not within the next 6 to 12 months. In terms of what we've got under construction and how long, it will be pretty much third, fourth quarter of '16 before that's all built in out of the ground and operating and then you configure, 2 years after that before it's stabilized. So you're thinking '18 before what we're working on now gets stabilized."

          No. Mike, I think most of what -- and the projects that I kind of used, the 60 properties, either under construction, about to start construction or we're pretty close to getting the deal tied down, I would anticipate that those would be constructed by the end of 2016. A good chunk, balance of this year, first half next year, but it will dribble out through 2016. So if you take that 60 properties, we're 5% of the industry, say, so that's about 1,200 properties nationwide, right, 100 million to 120 million square feet. It's not occurring at all uniformly, though, across the country. It's -- where we're developing, where we see other people developing the most, are markets where you would expect, Texas, Florida, Arizona. We're not developing anything in the Midwest, but there are stuff going on there. Where is development not occurring or it's de minimis? Los Angeles, San Francisco, downtown Seattle, downtown Miami, Boston, where it's very challenging to get sites. You're competing with the high-rise residential guys where there's simply not available -- land available to build self-storage. So it's not uniform across the country. But if you then take our portfolio, our development as a percentage of our portfolio, where we are in the industry, 2.5%, 3% industry expansion doesn't sound unreasonable. That compares with kind of the natural growth rate, which I've talked about on previous calls, of U.S. population growth, which is somewhere between 0.8% and 1% across the country. Again, population growth is not uniform. It's higher on markets like Texas, Florida, Arizona. So maybe the product coming on there can be absorbed by the above-average population growth."

Certainly, the opportunity for a developer to do what is referred to as the C/O deals, where pretty much the other public companies are offering to buy properties, newly developed, takeaway the fill-up risk, the operational risk and from what we've observed, pay close to retail prices on that, that's certainly a very, very strong incentive if you're a local or regional developer for you to build and sell product into the public market via the C/O deals. What that does to the volume, I don't know. And is our percentage reflective of the industry? Well, maybe -- we started development a couple of years ago, so maybe we're a little ahead of the curve. But our feeling here, our observation is certainly development is accelerating.

          Jordan, if you -- let's go back to the -- kind of the middle of your question, start to where were we at the 2008, 2009 kind of the great recession and we were at 50% payout. Why were we that low?  Well, we had done the Shurgard merger in 2006. And if you recall, that was about a $5.5 billion deal. The structure of that, even though it was all stock, has a taxable transaction, so -- which was very important to us. So we picked up a lot of tax basis in that transaction in one shot. In addition, a lot of the merger cost and option exercise cost and severance cost, we waited till the deal closed. And so we got a lot of tax benefits from that transaction in '06, '07, '08, which helped keep our -- build our -- our earnings were growing. Our payout wasn't changing. And so the spread between earnings and payout got very low, to your comment. As time has gone on, the portfolios continued to improve. We've delevered, and some of those tax benefits have burned off to where we're -- basically, our payout is still a taxable income. That strategy has not changed in 25 years. It's still a taxable income. But as the portfolio's grown, we're only able to retain $250 million, $300 million a year. So as the earnings base has grown, that has reduced our percentage of retained cash flow. The absolute number's about the same, but percentage-wise. And therefore, our payout ratio has gone up. John, you want to -- in terms of if we did leverage, would that help us, if it was positive leverage, it'd probably exacerbate the problem."

So it's not -- you're looking at, I think, for one quarter because we just bumped it this past quarter. But it will get back down in the 70s again. So you're looking at the front end of that dividend increase relative to the current earnings. What we did is projected out earnings for the next 12 months and came up with that dividend level. So I think you'll see it come back a little bit more in line, but it's not going back down. At 50%, I think we've probably -- we pretty much hit the wall in terms of, I think, what we can do to reduce taxable income.

Those things were icing on the cake, and to take care of the things that we didn't know about in the transaction. So our underwriting on real estate, the way we think about it, what market, submarkets really goes to that question I answered earlier about our strategy of building presence and dominance in market, building and buying A and B locations.

The velocity of move-ins, the move-ins relative to what we have to sell as a percentage is up quite a bit. So I mean, we can -- I mean, if you took it to an extreme and we were 100% occupied, we would have no move-ins, right?

It's not occurring at all uniformly, though, across the country. It's -- where we're developing, where we see other people developing the most, are markets where you would expect, Texas, Florida, Arizona. We're not developing anything in the Midwest, but there are stuff going on there. Where is development not occurring or it's de minimis? Los Angeles, San Francisco, downtown Seattle, downtown Miami, Boston, where it's very challenging to get sites. You're competing with the high-rise residential guys where there's simply not available -- land available to build self-storage. So it's not uniform across the country. But if you then take our portfolio, our development as a percentage of our portfolio, where we are in the industry, 2.5%, 3% industry expansion doesn't sound unreasonable. That compares with kind of the natural growth rate, which I've talked about on previous calls, of U.S. population growth, which is somewhere between 0.8% and 1% across the country.

But by the same token as your portfolio had seasoned and your leverage had declined relative to the size of the overall portfolio, your payout ratios have climbed.

Why were we that low?  Well, we had done the Shurgard merger in 2006. And if you recall, that was about a $5.5 billion deal. The structure of that, even though it was all stock, has a taxable transaction, so -- which was very important to us. So we picked up a lot of tax basis in that transaction in one shot. In addition, a lot of the merger cost and option exercise cost and severance cost, we waited till the deal closed. And so we got a lot of tax benefits from that transaction in '06, '07, '08, which helped keep our -- build our -- our earnings were growing. Our payout wasn't changing. And so the spread between earnings and payout got very low, to your comment. As time has gone on, the portfolios continued to improve. We've delevered, and some of those tax benefits have burned off to where we're -- basically, our payout is still a taxable income. That strategy has not changed in 25 years. It's still a taxable income. But as the portfolio's grown, we're only able to retain $250 million, $300 million a year. So as the earnings base has grown, that has reduced our percentage of retained cash flow. The absolute number's about the same, but percentage-wise. And therefore, our payout ratio has gone up.

We've enjoyed for the last 2 or 3 years declining advertising and Internet costs because the portfolio has been full. We've been able to extend customer duration, and so we just have not needed to spend as much on promotion. I would be surprised if that number continues to decline in 2016. And then the other categories, I just assume kind of a general inflation rate. So I don't -- quarter-to-date, for the quarter, our advertising promotion was down 19% year-to-date. It's down 18%, and that's really contributed to the big decline or flatlining of expenses. And again, I wouldn't expect that to continue. John, any comments on property taxes?"

New supply is coming, and I believe it will continue to accelerate for all the right, rational reasons. You can build far cheaper that you can buy.

So the fundamentals of the business are exceptional. You can capital to build. So new supply is coming, and at some point, that will start to impact people's pricing power, right? Simple supply and demand. As more supply comes in, that will impact pricing power. I don't see that being a big, negative headwind at least for another year, but it's coming. And then in terms of economy, I can't predict the economy, but the economy is being good. So things that hit the economy tend to be shocks, and then it disrupts the business environment and then you start to have enough uptick in unemployment and layoffs and all those things, which tend to not severely affect us but will slow growth down. So that's probably on the horizon. But I mean, the fundamentals of our business our great because of employment and historical last 4, 5 years, like a new supply."

The point you raised in terms of dichotomy of our, I'll call it, property image, is certainly true. And one of the things that we've been doing for several years is redeveloping properties. And it's a little harder than you think because in many of those kind of infill locations where you're probably driving by, self-storage has been zoned out. And we can't get the city to even reconsider redeveloping the property because they've just assumed it wasn't there. You're down in Florida, so the property down there in Ventura that we redeveloped took us 4 years to get that done. So while we'd like to go through and change up the image of the properties and standardize it, it's a lot more challenging than on the surface. And combined with there's a dichotomy in the portfolio because a lot of it's been acquired from other people that built it to different standards or different specs. And so it's going to look different. And also -- that's also due to -- attributable to different zoning regulations. So even some of the new stuff that we build, I think we've got 1 property where we can't have any orange on it. Not our choice, but that's the zoning regulations."

New supply is coming, and I believe it will continue to accelerate for all the right -- rational reasons. You can build far cheaper than you can buy. Operating fundamentals in the business are unbelievably good for a variety of reasons: full employment; job creation; the economy's doing well; low interest rates. So the fundamentals of the business are exceptional. You get capital to build. So new supply is coming, and at some point, that will start to impact people's pricing power, right? Simple supply and demand. As more supply comes in, that will impact pricing power. I don't see that being a big negative headwind, at least for another year, but it's coming. And then in terms of economy, I can't predict the economy, but the economy is being good. So things that hit the economy tend to be shocks, and then that disrupts the business environment and then you start to have an uptick in unemployment and layoffs and all those things, which tend to not severely affect us, but will slow growth down. So that's probably on the horizon. But barring those, I mean, the fundamentals for our business our great because of the employment and last 4, 5 years, like a new supply."

You're down in Florida, so there is a property down there in Aventura that we redeveloped. It took us 4 years to get that done. So while we'd like to go through and change up the image of the properties and standardize it, it's a lot more challenging than on the surface. And combined with, you have -- there's a dichotomy in the portfolio because a lot of it's been acquired from other people that built it to different standards or different specs.

New supply is coming, and I believe it will continue to accelerate for all the right -- rational reasons. You can build far cheaper than you can buy. Operating fundamentals in the business are unbelievably good for a variety of reasons: full employment; job creation; the economy's doing well; low interest rates. So the fundamentals of the business are exceptional. You can get capital to build. So new supply is coming, and at some point, that will start to impact people's pricing power, right? Simple supply and demand. As more supply comes in, that will impact pricing power. I don't see that being a big negative headwind, at least for another year, but it's coming. And then in terms of the economy, I can't predict the economy, but the economy has been good. So things that hit the economy tend to be shocks, and then that disrupts the business environment and then you start to have an uptick in unemployment and layoffs and all those things, which tend to not severely affect us, but will slow growth down. So that's probably on the horizon. But barring those, I mean, the fundamentals for our business our great because of the employment and the last 4, 5 years, lack of new supply."

But if -- we'll probably grow somewhat in the neighborhood of 3.5%, 4% on an unlevered basis, which in my mind, brings the cost of capital, issuing in common somewhere in the neighborhood of, call it, 6% to 7%, which again, when you combine that with the delevered balance sheet, I think our first choice right now is to lever up the balance sheet with debt and fund our acquisitions and development programs with that method first going forward. It's not to say that we won't issue equity. If for the right transaction, if the transaction came along, we'd certainly consider issuing equity."

And that is so dominant and so powerful, I mean, it's just unbelievable. We can talk for an hour about what it does for us on the Internet, customer awareness, et cetera, et cetera. The point you raised in terms of the dichotomy of our, I'll call it, property image is certainly true. And one of the things that we've been doing for several years is redeveloping properties. And it's a little harder than you think, because in many of those kind of infill locations where you're probably driving by, self-storage has been zoned out. And we can't get the city to even reconsider redeveloping the property because they've just assumed it wasn't there. You're down in Florida, so there is a property down there in Aventura that we redeveloped. It took us 4 years to get that done. So while we'd like to go through and change up the image of the properties and standardize it, it's a lot more challenging than on the surface. And combined with, you have -- there's a dichotomy in the portfolio because a lot of it's been acquired from other people that built it to different standards or different specs. And so it's going to look different. And also -- that's also due -- attributable to different zoning regulations. So even some of the new stuff that we build, I think we've got 1 property where we can't have any orange on it. Not our choice, but that's the zoning regulations."

New supply is coming, and I believe it will continue to accelerate for all the right -- rational reasons. You can build far cheaper than you can buy. Operating fundamentals in the business are unbelievably good for a variety of reasons: full employment; job creation; the economy's doing well; low interest rates. So the fundamentals of the business are exceptional. You can get capital to build. So new supply is coming, and at some point, that will start to impact people's pricing power, right? Simple supply and demand. As more supply comes in, that will impact pricing power. I don't see that being a big negative headwind, at least for another year, but it's coming. And then in terms of the economy, I can't predict the economy, but the economy has been good. So things that hit the economy tend to be shocks, and then that disrupts the business environment and then you start to have an uptick in unemployment and layoffs and all those things, which tend to not severely affect us, but will slow growth down. So that's probably on the horizon. But barring those, I mean, the fundamentals for our business our great because of the employment and the last 4, 5 years, lack of new supply."

So out of those 11 properties, 800,000 square feet, just over 800,000 square feet, you're at about $132 a foot, which is kind of within plus minus 5%, 10% of what we think we can build the properties for."

So even though the rates may be slightly low, the cash we're getting and the net cash flow properties already breaking even generating a profit.

It'll take a couple of years to -- when it stabilizes, to really sit back and say what is the cash-on-cash return and how much extra money do we make by filling up faster versus taking a more traditional approach of starting rates higher and filling it up slower. I'd also say that property is rather iconic, and there's a lot of great things going on in Glendale. So the market was undersupplied. And so there is another aspect of building the right product in the right submarket, and certainly, that property fits the bill there. Did that answer your question?"

The point you raised in terms of the dichotomy of our, I'll call it, property image is certainly true. And one of the things that we've been doing for several years is redeveloping properties. And it's a little harder than you think, because in many of those kind of infill locations where you're probably driving by, self-storage has been zoned out. And we can't get the city to even reconsider redeveloping the property because they've just assumed it wasn't there. You're down in Florida, so there is a property down there in Aventura that we redeveloped. It took us 4 years to get that done. So while we'd like to go through and change up the image of the properties and standardize it, it's a lot more challenging than on the surface. And combined with, you have -- there's a dichotomy in the portfolio because a lot of it's been acquired from other people that built it to different standards or different specs. And so it's going to look different. And also -- that's also due -- attributable to different zoning regulations. So even some of the new stuff that we build, I think we've got 1 property where we can't have any orange on it. Not our choice, but that's the zoning regulations."
