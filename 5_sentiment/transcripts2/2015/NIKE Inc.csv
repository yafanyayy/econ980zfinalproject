For those who need to reference today's press release, you'll find it at investors.nikeinc.com. Leading today's call is Kelley Hall, Vice President, Corporate Finance and Treasurer.
Before I turn the call over to Ms. Hall, let me remind you that participants on this call will make forward-looking statements based on current expectations, and those statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. These risks and uncertainties are detailed in the reports filed with the SEC, including forms 8-K, 10-K and 10-Q. Some forward-looking statements concern future orders that are not necessarily indicative of changes in total revenues for subsequent periods due to a mix of futures and at-once orders, exchange rates fluctuations, order cancellations, changes in timing of shipments, discounts and returns which may vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter. In addition, it is important to remember a significant portion of NIKE, Inc.'s continuing operations, including equipment, NIKE Golf, Converse and Hurley are not included in these futures numbers.
Finally, participants may discuss non-GAAP financial measures, including references to wholesale equivalent sales. References to total wholesale equivalent sales are only intended to provide context as to the overall current market footprints of the brands owned by NIKE, Inc. and should not be relied upon as a financial measure of actual results. Participants may also make references to other nonpublic financial and statistical information and non-GAAP financial measures.

Well, we delivered another strong quarter in Q3. Revenues grew 7% to $7.5 billion, gross margin increased by 140 basis points to 45.9%, and diluted earnings per share increased 19% to $0.89.We were able to deliver",1359,"Thank you, Kelley, and hello, everyone. Well, we delivered another strong quarter in Q3. Revenues grew 7% to $7.5 billion, gross margin increased by 140 basis points to 45.9%, and diluted earnings per share increased 19% to $0.89.
We were able to deliver results like these for the quarter by leveraging the power of the NIKE portfolio. Over the last 3 months, the macroenvironment has become increasingly volatile. Foreign currency headwinds have intensified, product input costs continued to fluctuate, and the political landscape is evolving in many countries around the world. This is the environment in which all multinational companies now operate, and Nike is not immune to it. 
The difference for NIKE, however, is that we see this as an opportunity to create further separation in the marketplace. Our globally diverse portfolio of geographies, categories, brands, product types and distribution channels gives us a distinct competitive advantage.  By going deep into the business, we were able to see opportunities to serve the consumer and drive growth despite the chopper era landscape. This surgical approach to finding new dimensions of growth ensures we capture the full potential of our brands around the world. And that includes driving strong growth in areas of our business that are already well-established such as Western Europe, China, North America in footwear as well as businesses such as women's, young athletes, apparel and e-commerce where we are accelerating development. These are just a few examples of the dimensions of our business where we are continuing to identify further opportunities to expand our reach and drive growth.
And we do this while maintaining a disciplined approach to investing in those opportunities NIKE with the highest potential for return so we can drive growth and manage risk over the short and the long term. This complete offense is how we can continue to deliver sustainable, profitable growth.  As you have seen from NIKE in the past, we know how to operate in a challenging environment better than anyone, and you will continue to see is leverage the breadth and depth of our global portfolio to do just that going forward. 
At NIKE, everything we do starts with the consumer. It's our obsession with serving the consumer that sharpens our focus and drives our growth. The expectations of our consumers are evolving rapidly, and we're able to meet and often exceed those expectations because we know the athlete. By working with athletes at all levels from the elite to the everyday, we have a level of knowledge and insight that is unmatched in our industry. And we are able to use the insights that we gain to create new product and services that drive new levels of performance innovation across all of our categories.
The pace of innovation at NIKE has never been faster, and our pipeline has never been robust. We're leveraging new tools and processes to unlock significant advancements every day. However, the starting point for innovation remains the same, and that's the athlete. Many of our latest innovations have come from going deep into an individual sport to solve a unique athletic need. And let me highlight a few examples in our footwear business from Q3. In Running, the Lunar Temple is a shoe that merges speed with cushioning for a great ride over the longer runs; and then, the newly redesigned Air Max 2015, our most flexible, comfortable Air Max to date. We're seeing very strong response from consumers, and I'm tremendously excited about the pipeline of products in the Running category.
In Basketball, with his 10th signature shoe, Kobe Bryant returned to a low top and once again pushed the limits of design. In addition to great consumer reaction to the KOBE X, players around the NBA wearing it for its great traction and cushioning. 
And in Football, the Nike Vapor Untouchable Cleat was created to provide the game's fastest players with power and position on the field. We've had tremendous feedback on the performance and the look of the Untouchable from the athletes at both the NFL and the collegiate level.
And in Men's Training, the NIKE MedTone 1, a first of its kind high intensity training shoe that has been incredibly popular in the marketplace, and it's just a hint at what's to come in men's training. 
These innovations each deliver a level of performance for the athlete. However, we only truly realize our potential as a company when we continue to leverage those breakthroughs across multiple sports and categories. It's what you've seen from us time and time again. Many of our biggest footwear platforms such as Lunar and Free, Flyknit and Nike Air were initially created to solve a specific athlete need in a specific category. But now they service the foundation for our greatest products across multiple categories.
Similarly, in apparel platforms such as Aeroloft and Dri-FIT, both originally introduced in Running, set the standard for thermoregulation and moisture management in multiple categories and product classifications. And our NIKE Pro collection continues to drive energy in all sports, especially our pro bra and tights collections for women.
Individually and collectively, our product innovation is breaking new ground across all of our categories. And as excited as we are about the technical details of these products, what's most important is how well our products are resonating with consumers and athletes, which we clearly saw in the quarter.
Innovation fuels more than product at NIKE. It also drives how we do business and how we connect with the world. In the case of our digital ecosystem, NIKE is growing a connected community of athletes all over the world. This community is seamlessly engaged with the brand, not only by accepting the world's best product but by fueling activity and improving their athletic lives. We know it's not enough to simply to interact. True connections required depth and richness. And in Q3, we strengthened these digital connections and added new dimensions to our digital ecosystem. 
So how does NIKE continue to expand our digital innovation?  Well, we linked experience to commerce. We released the Nike sneakers during the NBA All-Star Game in New York, letting consumers on mobile devices see, share and buy our most coveted footwear products. And we broadened access. We announced several partnerships with the Nike+ Running app to have runners connect to Nike+ experiences to even more of their devices and fitness equipment. And we glow -- we grow our global reach. We added more sharing capabilities to our Nike+ Training Club app. We expanded it to 18 languages. It's work like this that will continue to power our digital experiences for years to come.
At the same time in Q3, we continued to see tremendous growth in our e-commerce business as NIKE.com was up 42% in the quarter. Traffic and conversion both increased. And for the first time in our history, mobile traffic exceeded desktop traffic, helped in part by the introduction of our sneakers app. going forward, we will continue to invest in this area to best serve our consumers.  Additionally, we'll continue to drive growth in our e-commerce business by increasing consumer access to product customization. In Q3 for example, we brought exclusive new Flyknit options to NIKEiD, giving consumers the ability to take customization to yet another level. Overall, we continue to see tremendous potential for growth in our e-commerce business as we leverage our digital platform to continue to deliver premium products, services and experiences for our consumers.
As we head into the final quarter of fiscal 2015 and beyond, I continue to see tremendous opportunity for NIKE around the world. You've heard me say many times that I see more potential for growth going forward than at any time in our history, and I certainly continue to believe that today.
While the current macroenvironment is challenging, it is not new to us. We have a highly experienced and outlined management team that knows how to continue to deliver profitable growth by turning challenges into opportunities. It's what we've always done in the past, and it's what you can expect for him from us going forward. 
Thanks. And now, here's Trevor."

Q3 is a great example about how the strength of the NIKE Brand drives growth around the world even in a more challenging macroenvironment. As Mark mentioned, the impact of foreign exchange has intensified, and Don will talk more about our work to mitigate those impacts. As I normally do, I'll speak to our results on a constant-currency basis. While we consider the impact of foreign exchange as part of the overall management of our business, currency-neutral results provide a clearer view of the underlying operational performance.
So let's take a look at the numbers. The NIKE Brand revenue grew 11% with strong growth in Western Europe, Greater China and the emerging markets as well as in our Sportswear and Basketball categories. NIKE Brand DTC revenue increased 29%, driven by all concepts in all geographies. And as Mike mentioned, we also saw continued strong growth in NIKE.com. And global futures are up 11%, reflecting the strong growth despite comparisons to the prior year, which included strong World Cup demand. Excluding the impact of the World Cup, we estimate future orders would have grown in the mid-teens.
As Q3 growth -- our Q3 growth is a result of the deep relationships both with consumers through the category offense. Our laser focus on individual consumers strengthens our -- those connections, whether they are online, at retail or in live experiences. NIKE's consistent focus on serving the consumer to through the lens of their chosen sports helps enable continued profitable growth.
What's more, only NIKE has the global scale to execute this consumer-focused strategy in markets around the world. As we further drive the category offense globally, we continue to prove our ability to connect our brands to consumers and build compelling retail destinations globally, that elevates, segment and differentiate the markets around the globe.
To see the category offense in action, let's first take a look at 2 of our key categories: Basketball and Running. Both NIKE and the Jordan Brand continue to deliver the absolute best in Basketball with innovative products and groundbreaking experiences. Q3 was the 14th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth for the Basketball category. And as game expands around the globe, we continue to see amazing opportunity for growth in this important category.  Q3 was a great example of the combined power of Nike Basketball and Brand Jordan to create excitement and energy in the marketplace. I was in New York City for the NBA All-Star weekend, and it was clearly an electric experience for hundreds and thousands of basketball fans who took part. All over the city, NIKE and Brand Jordan executed retail concepts and consumer experiences that showcase basketball's unique culture and passion.
Nike Basketball invited fans to visit the Zoom City Arena, offering them a chance to play on the first digital LED court in the United States. Brand Jordan transformed the Pavilion into an interactive consumer experience where fans can relive Michael Jordan's iconic game-winning shots. And both brands created elevated retail executions at NIKETOWN at House of Hoops locations with Foot Locker and pop-up locations around the city. All of these combined to deliver a truly one of a kind experience for our consumers, something only NIKE can do.
In addition to delivering highly engaging consumer experiences, we continued to lead with innovative product. In the quarter, Kyrie Irving, one of the most exciting young players in the game today, became the newest signature artist for Nike with the launch of the KYRIE 1. Offering security superior traction with Hyperfuse construction, the KYRIE 1 is an excellent example of how we never stop improving. Also seeing huge consumer next response was the KOBE X, the most coveted show yet for the popular Kobe line.
Next, let's talk about Running. As you know, Running is our heritage and our largest performance category. The NIKE Brand continues to resonate with runners, fueled by the Nike+ Run Club and grassroots running events around the world. And the Running category continues to deliver strong results in key geographies including Europe, China and the emerging markets. That said, our footwear within the Running category isn't performing as well as we would like, particularly in North America. As a result, we are highly focused on delivering new innovation into our core product offerings to ensure we continue to serve our consumer with the absolute best.
With our premium performance products, we continue to see strong sell-through for footwear styles like the Air Max 2015, the Lunar TEMPO and the Air Zoom Pegasus 31. In addition, our premium performance apparel continues to drive growth, and we saw strong consumer response to the styles such as new epic and epic run types.
As part of our amplified strategy, we leveraged the heritage of our running into sportswear to deliver great style for consumers who appreciate the aesthetic of running. This is our complete offense in the Running category. And running-inspired sportswear performed extremely well in the quarter, led by strong consumer response to the Roshe platform and the Roshe Flyknit in particular. The Air Max 1 collection also add had strong performance in the quarter. 
Looking ahead, we will continue to build on what's working in Running as we further strengthen our business to accelerate growth. We're excited to have a robust, continuous pipeline of groundbreaking footwear innovations which we will bring to the market over the next 18 months. And we will also leverage the momentum in platforms such as the Lunar, Flyknit and our Air Max to continue to drive growth.  Overall, Running continues to be a tremendous source of innovation and inspiration for Nike and one of our key long-term growth drivers.
So let's talk about a few of our key geographies: first, North America, which delivered 6% revenue growth in the quarter. Consumer demand continues to be very strong in North America as most key categories grew and futures were up 15%. That said, revenue growth was somewhat lower than expected in the quarter due to challenges related to the port congestion on the West Coast, which escalated late in our fiscal quarter 3. As a result, some shipments originally expected for delivery in Q3 were delayed. Looking ahead, we expect revenue growth in quarter 4 to accelerate as the flow of product through the supply chain begins to normalize. However, we do expect it will take a few quarters to return to for the normalized product flow as there are significant number of containers to be cleared from the ports on the West Coast.
To be very clear, there continues to be tremendous momentum for the NIKE Brand in North America, thanks to innovative product that continues to resonate with our consumers. And the category offense continues to help us deliver segmented and differentiated retail destinations with our wholesale partners in our stores and online. Executions such as the Field House with Dick's Sporting Goods and the House of Hoops with Foot Locker performed very well in the quarter, as did our DTC business, which delivered revenue growth of 15% and continued strong growth on NIKE.com.  Overall, we continue to see tremendous potential for growth in North America as demand remains strong and our brand continues to resonate with consumers.
In Western Europe, we're seeing broad-based demand with revenue growth of 21% in the quarter. We saw growth across all categories and territories with particular strength in AGS, the U.K. and Southern Europe. A critical part of our successful growth strategy in Western Europe is the work we've done to transform the marketplace along the category offense. We continue to develop more differentiated retail executions with our wholesale partners in our stores and online while continuing to bring innovative products into the marketplace.
The JV omni-channel store at Trafford and the Pro Direct digital store in London are great example of powerful avenues we have to differentiate the NIKE Brand. In addition, we continue to see strong performance in our stores, with DTC up 40% and strong growth on NIKE.com.  It remains early days yet, but the market growth we're seeing in nearly every territory, coupled with the market share gains, prove the success of our efforts in Western Europe.
Let's turn to the emerging markets where revenue grew 12% in the quarter, with 6 of the 9 territories growing double digits. We also saw strong growth coming from Sportswear, Running and Basketball. While we feel good about the third quarter results in the emerging markets, we do anticipate some choppiness going forward. Futures declined 6% for the period, in part the result of tough comparisons to the strong World Cup orders in prior year. We are also taking proactive steps to reduce the supply to ensure a healthy marketplace in Mexico and Brazil, 2 of our largest territories in the emerging markets.
In Mexico, as we have discussed on previous calls, inventory levels in the marketplace were higher than we would like, largely a result of transition issues with our distribution center in early fiscal 2014. We've made significant progress in clearing the excess inventory in Mexico, and we expect to return to more normalized levels by the end of fiscal year '15. To ensure a healthy pull market, we've also worked proactively with our wholesale partners to adjust the flow of product into the marketplace, which contributes to the year-over-year decline in future orders for the emerging markets.
In Brazil, Q3 revenue growth was modest as volatile macroeconomic conditions made for a challenging operating environment. The NIKE Brand continues to be incredibly strong in Brazil, and we see great opportunity to reposition this critical market for sustainable, profitable growth. As we successfully did in North America, China and Western Europe, we will leverage the category offense to segment and differentiate our points of distribution. In doing so, we will increase the productivity and profitability of the marketplace.  We will accomplish this by elevating the retail experiences for our consumers and presenting our products in more compelling and premium execution. As we start to reset the market in Brazil, we're working proactively with our wholesale partners to pace the flow of product into the market. As with Mexico, this is also contributing to the year-over-year to line in the emerging markets futures orders. 
We are confident that our actions in Mexico and Brazil with will help us to reach our goal in operating in a healthy pull market in these important territories. And long term, we remain confident that the emerging markets geography will drive significant growth for the NIKE Brand.
Lastly, in Greater China, we continue to see the benefits of our strategy to reset the marketplace. Q3 revenue growth was 17%, and futures are up 23%. This reflects the continued strength of the NIKE Brand in the market along with our efforts to execute a more consumer-focused distribution strategy. Our wholesale partners have continued to see strong comp store growth and expanded profitability in the doors that have been re-profiled. This success aligns with the results we've seen in our own retail doors. Additionally, inventory levels in China continue to be healthy, letting us better serve the consumer and maintain a strong pull market.  Given the success we've seen in the marketplace over the last several quarters, we are now focused on evolving from a reset strategy to a new normal of how we do business in China. As we look ahead, we continue to see tremendous opportunity for growth in these key geographies.
Ultimately, I feel great about the results we delivered in Q3. And while we will continue to face macroeconomic challenges going forward, we know there's tremendous momentum in the marketplace. And we know the NIKE Brand continues to resonate with consumers all around the world, and we know our relentless focus on serving the consumer will keep us in the lead. We know all this. And because we do, I personally could not be more excited about what the future holds.
Thanks. Now, here's Don."

In his opening remarks, Mark spoke about the tremendous macroeconomic volatility we've seen in recent months. In particular over the last 90 days, the U.S. dollar has appreciated against virtually every other major currency. There's no question that this has and will continue to have an impact on multinational companies including Nike. We see these times as opportunities to distinguish ourselves, both in how we deliver for our consumers and how we deliver for our shareholders. The power of our brands and our portfolio, the strength of our balance sheet and the experience of our management team all give us the ability to navigate these conditions in a way few companies can.  
We've always run our business to deliver appropriate near-term profitability, invest for long-term growth and manage risk. That approach hasn't changed. That doesn't mean that this is business as usual. It does mean we'll use all the levers of our business to deliver profitable growth, even in the face of strong macro headwinds. We'll continue to make focused investments to build strong brand connections, deliver innovative products and services and create compelling retail experiences for consumers. We'll leverage our strength with consumers to grow revenues and expand gross margins. We'll apply innovation and operational discipline to increase cost productivity. And we'll continue to deliver increasing profitability and cash returns to shareholders.  We've been here before, and we're confident we have the business capabilities and momentum to deliver growth and profitability even under difficult economic circumstances.
With that introduction, I'll now recap our Q3 results.  Third quarter reported revenue for NIKE, Inc. increased 7%. On a currency-neutral basis, revenue increased 13%, in line with our expectations as the NIKE Brand grew 11% and Converse increased 33%. Also on a currency-neutral basis, NIKE Brand futures orders grew 11%, driven by a 6% increase in average selling price and a 5% increase in units. The growth reflects continued strong demand across the NIKE Brand portfolio led by double-digit growth in North America, China in Central and Eastern Europe.
From a category perspective, the growth reflected strong demand across multiple categories, including Sportswear, Basketball and Running. This overall growth is especially noteworthy, given last year's robust orders in advance of the 2014 World Cup, which particularly affected futures orders in Europe and in the emerging markets. As Trevor mentioned earlier, excluding the impact of World Cup, we estimate futures would have increased at a mid-teens rate.  On a reported basis, futures grew 2%, reflecting weaker international currencies, particularly the euro, reai, ruble, pound and yen. 
Third quarter diluted EPS increased 19% to $0.89, driven by revenue growth, gross margin expansion and a lower share count, partially offset by higher SG&A investments and a higher tax rate. rate. In Q3, the impact of FX was insignificant as the impact of the stronger dollar was largely offset by other currency hedging programs.
Gross margin expanded 140 basis points in the quarter. The increase was driven by a continued shift to higher-margin products, partially offset by higher product input and warehousing costs.
Third quarter demand creation was flat to last year as higher investments in digital and sports marketing were largely offset by lower advertising expenses due to changes in the timing of product launches.  Q3 operating overhead increased 15%, reflecting growth in our higher gross margin, higher cost DTC business, investments in operational infrastructure and continued investments in digital including consumer engagement. 
The Q3 effective tax rate was 24.4%, a 190 basis point increase versus the prior year quarter, primarily due to the impact of tax expense on intercompany transactions, partially offset by the retroactive reinstatement of the U.S. R&D tax credit.
At the end of Q3, NIKE, Inc. inventories were up 12%, primarily driven by unit growth in North America and Europe. As Trevor mentioned earlier, our North America business was affected by congestion at West Coast ports, reducing Q3 revenue growth and increasing Q3 inventories. While we anticipate the flow of product will soon begin to return to normal, we expect we will have somewhat higher inventory levels and lower margins in North America for the next few quarters as work to rebalance supply and demand in the market.
Now let's take a look at some of the performance highlights by segment. In North America, Q3 revenue increased 6% on both a reported and currency-neutral basis led by Basketball and Sportswear. Direct-to-Consumer revenues grew 15%, driven by the rapid expansion of NIKE.com, 7% comp store sales growth and the addition of new stores. On a reported basis, Q3 EBIT for North America grew 14%, driven by revenue growth, gross margin expansion and SG&A leverage.
In Western Europe, Q3 revenues increased 21% on a currency-neutral basis. The growth was broad-based as nearly every territory increased at a double-digit rate and every key category grew led by double-digit growth in Sportswear, Men's Training -- sorry, Women's Training and Running. Despite a weaker euro, reported Q3 revenue for Western Europe increased 10% and EBIT increased 22%, driven by revenue growth, gross margin expansion and SG&A leverage.
In Central and Eastern Europe, Q3 revenue increased 7% on a currency-neutral basis. Most territories delivered double-digit revenue growth, but revenues in Russia in Russia, Israel and Turkey declined. Nearly every key category expanded, led by Sportswear, Women's Training and Running. Reported revenue for CEE declined 10% and EBIT fell 35%, reflecting significantly weaker currencies, most significantly in Russia. 
In Greater China, Q3 revenues increased 17% on a currency-neutral basis, led by double-digit growth in Sportswear, Basketball and Running. On a reported basis, Q3 revenue for China increased 15%, while EBIT increased 7%, driven by strong revenue growth and gross margin expansion, partially offset by investments in demand creation and DTC.
In the emerging markets geography, Q3 revenue grew 12% on a currency-neutral basis, driven by strong growth in all territories except Brazil, which grew at a single-digit rate, and Mexico, which declined mid-teens. From a category perspective, the growth was led by Sportswear, Running and Basketball. On a reported basis, emerging markets revenue increased 2% and EBIT increased 3%, reflecting significant currency headwinds.
As Trevor discussed, we're seeing the results of our work to clear excess inventory Mexico. At the same time, we're taking action to realign the Brazil marketplace along the lines of the category offense. We're confident these steps will set us up to continue to deliver sustainable, profitable growth in these territories and to the emerging markets geography as a whole.
At Converse, Q3 revenue grew 33% on a currency-neutral basis, boosted by the acceleration of Q4 shipments in advance of a major systems go live. The balance of the growth was driven by continued strength in North America, the conversion of several European markets to direct distribution and strong growth in DTC.
On a reported basis, Converse revenue increased 28% and EBIT increased 23%, driven by revenue growth, partially offset by higher investments in infrastructure, DTC and demand creation to enable long-term growth.
We've seen strong momentum in our business year-to-date, and we expect that momentum to continue into Q4 and beyond. That said, FX headwinds have intensified significantly in the last 90 days, especially from the erosion of the value of the euro. While our hedging programs have significantly reduced the impact of FX on profitability, we cannot eliminate all currency risk. 
Based on what we know today, we expect the following for Q4 and full year FY '15: We expect constant dollar revenue growth for Q4 in the low double digits, with reported revenue growth 8 to 9 points lower, reflecting the significantly stronger dollar. For the full year, we expect constant dollar revenue growth in the low teens, with reported revenue growth 4 to 5 points lower. 
We now expect Q4 gross margin to be flat to up about 25 basis points as the impact of higher closeouts, particularly in North America and Europe, largely offset the ongoing benefits of mix shifts to higher-margin products and businesses.  For the full year, we now expect gross margin expansion of about 100 basis points. 
We expect demand creation to decrease at a high single-digit rate for Q4 as we anniversary investments in the World Cup marketing in Q4 of FY '14.  For the full year, we now expect demand creation to grow at a mid-single-digit rate. 
We expect operating overhead to grow at a high single to low double-digit rate for Q4 and at a mid-teens rate for the full year, reflecting higher DTC expenses as well as investments in digital innovation and new operating capabilities. 
We continue to expect the effective tax rate for FY '15 will be approximately 24.5%.
Looking ahead to FY '16, we haven't yet completed our planning but can provide some initial thoughts. We expect to see continued strong momentum in our business and anticipate currency-neutral revenue growth for FY '16 slightly above our high single-digit target range. When combined with the impact of our ongoing work to expand gross margins and ongoing investments in our growth strategies, we would have expected EPS growth at or above our long-term mid-teens target.
That said, the appreciation of the U.S. dollar against nearly every other major currency will reduce next year's reported revenue, gross margin and profit. Assuming exchange rates remain in about the same range as they are today, we expect FY '16 reported revenue growth in the mid-single digits and EPS growth in the high single to low double-digit range.  Currency markets remain volatile, so we will provide an update on our FY '16 expectations on our Q4 earnings call.
On our last conference call, I spoke about one of our NIKE maxims, and today, I'd like to highlight another. We are on the offense always. As Mark said at the outset, we view a challenging operating environment as an opportunity to create further competitive separation. By staying focused on consumers and leveraging our strengths, we're confident we can continue to deliver strong financial performance and create value for our shareholders even in a challenging macroeconomic environment.

We gain the insights from the athletes that really ultimately drive innovation that fuels NIKE's brand strength and our growth as a company. So that's always been the case. I can't imagine that it wouldn't be going forward. We're selective in the choices that we make in terms of where we think we have the greatest opportunity. And we look at those opportunities in a very complete, sort of holistic way. Very, very happy with where we are in Basketball, and tremendous potential going forward.

So we're getting some of the benefit that you're talking about here of matching sourcing currencies and selling currencies even within our existing structure. The second thing is that we've adjusted or we do adjust payments to the factories on the basis of how those currencies move. So we are getting some offsetting sourcing benefits right now from the fact that currencies in a lot of our sourcing countries are weakening. So that helps us also net down our foreign exchange exposure.

Before I turn the call over to Ms. Hall, let me remind you that participants on this call will make forward-looking statements based on current expectations, and those statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. These risks and uncertainties are detailed in the reports filed with the SEC, including Forms 8-K, 10-K and 10-Q. Some forward-looking statements concern future orders that are not necessarily indicative of changes in total revenues for subsequent periods due to a mix of futures and at-once orders, exchange rates fluctuations, order cancellations, changes in the timing of shipments, discounts and returns which may vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter. In addition, it is important to remember a significant portion of NIKE, Inc.'s continuing operations, including equipment, NIKE Golf, Converse and Hurley, are not included in these futures numbers.
Finally, participants may discuss non-GAAP financial measures, including references to wholesale equivalent sales. References to total wholesale equivalent sales are only intended to provide context as to the overall current market footprint of the brands owned by NIKE, Inc. and should not be relied upon as a financial measure of actual results. Participants may also make references to other nonpublic financial and statistical information and non-GAAP financial measures.

Well, we delivered another strong quarter in Q3. Revenues grew 7% to $7.5 billion, gross margin increased by 140 basis points to 45.9%, and diluted earnings per share increased 19% to $0.89.We were able to deliver",1362,"Thank you, Kelley, and hello, everyone. Well, we delivered another strong quarter in Q3. Revenues grew 7% to $7.5 billion, gross margin increased by 140 basis points to 45.9%, and diluted earnings per share increased 19% to $0.89.
We were able to deliver results like these for the quarter by leveraging the power of the NIKE portfolio. Over the last 3 months, the macro environment has become increasingly volatile. Foreign currency headwinds have intensified, product input costs continued to fluctuate, and the political landscape is evolving in many countries around the world. This is the environment in which all multinational companies now operate, and Nike is not immune to it.
The difference for NIKE, however, is that we see this as an opportunity to create further separation in the marketplace. Our globally diverse portfolio of geographies, categories, brands, product types and distribution channels gives us a distinct competitive advantage. By going deep into the business, we were able to see opportunities to serve the consumer and drive growth despite the choppier landscape. This surgical approach to finding new dimensions of growth ensures we capture the full potential of our brands around the world. And that includes driving strong growth in the areas of our business that are already well established such as Western Europe, China, North America in footwear as well as businesses such as women's, young athletes, apparel and e-commerce where we are accelerating development. These are just a few examples of the dimensions of our business where we are continuing to identify further opportunities to expand our reach and drive growth.
And we do this while maintaining a disciplined approach to investing in those opportunities with the highest potential for return so we can drive growth and manage risk over the short and the long term. This complete offense is how we can continue to deliver sustainable, profitable growth. As you have seen from NIKE in the past, we know how to operate in a challenging environment better than anyone, and you will continue to see us leverage the breadth and depth of our global portfolio to do just that going forward.
At NIKE, everything we do starts with the consumer. It's our obsession with serving the consumer that sharpens our focus and drives our growth. The expectations of our consumers are evolving rapidly, and we're able to meet and often exceed those expectations because we know the athlete. By working with athletes at all levels, from the elite to the everyday, we have a level of knowledge and insight that is unmatched in our industry. And we are able to use the insights that we gain to create new product and services that drive new levels of performance innovation across all of our categories.
The pace of innovation at NIKE has never been faster, and our pipeline has never been more robust. We're leveraging new tools and processes to unlock significant advancements every day. However, the starting point for innovation remains the same, and that's the athlete. Many of our greatest innovations have come from going deep into an individual sport to solve a unique athletic need. And let me highlight a few examples in our footwear business from Q3.
In Running, the LunarTempo is a shoe that merges speed with cushioning for a great ride over the longer runs; and then the newly redesigned Air Max 2015, our most flexible, comfortable Air Max to date. We're seeing very strong response from consumers, and I'm tremendously excited about the pipeline of products in the Running category.
In Basketball, with his 10th signature shoe, Kobe Bryant returned to a low top and once again pushed the limits of design. In addition to great consumer reaction to the KOBE X, players around the NBA are wearing it for its great traction and cushioning.
And in Football, the Nike Vapor Untouchable cleat was created to provide the game's fastest players with power and precision on the field. We've had tremendous feedback on the performance and the look of the Untouchable from the athletes at both the NFL and the collegiate level.
And in Men's Training, the Nike MetCon 1, a first of its kind high-intensity training shoe that has been incredibly popular in the marketplace, and it's just a hint at what's to come in Men's Training.
These innovations each deliver a new level of performance for the athlete. However, we only truly realize our potential as a company when we continue to leverage those breakthroughs across multiple sports and categories. It's what you've seen from us time and time again. Many of our biggest footwear platforms such as Lunar and Free, Flyknit and Nike Air were initially created to solve a specific athlete need in a specific category. But now they service the foundation for our greatest products across multiple categories.
Similarly, in apparel, platforms such as Aeroloft and Dri-FIT, both originally introduced in Running, set the standard for thermoregulation and moisture management in multiple categories and product classifications. And our Nike Pro collection continues to drive energy in all sports, especially our Pro Bra and Tight collections for women.
Individually and collectively, our product innovation is breaking new ground across all of our categories. And as excited as we are about the technical details of these products, what's most important is how well our products are resonating with consumers and athletes, which we clearly saw in the quarter.
Innovation fuels more than product at NIKE. It also drives how we do business and how we connect with the world. In the case of our digital ecosystem, NIKE is growing a connected community of athletes all over the world. This community is seamlessly engaged with the brand not only by accepting the world's best product but by fueling activity and improving their athletic lives. We know it's not enough to simply to interact. True connections require depth and richness. And in Q3, we strengthened these digital connections and added new dimensions to our digital ecosystem.
So how does NIKE continue to expand our digital innovation?  Well, we linked experience to commerce. We released the Nike SNKRS app during the NBA All-Star Game in New York, letting consumers on mobile devices see, share and buy our most coveted footwear products. And we broadened access. We announced several partnerships with the Nike+ Running app to let runners connect to Nike+ experiences to even more of their devices and fitness equipment. And we glow -- we grow our global reach. We added more sharing capabilities to our Nike+ Training Club app. We expanded it to 18 languages. It's work like this that will continue to power our digital experiences for years to come.
At the same time, in Q3, we continued to see tremendous growth in our e-commerce business as NIKE.com was up 42% in the quarter. Traffic and conversion both increased. And for the first time in our history, mobile traffic exceeded desktop traffic, helped in part by the introduction of our SNKRS app. And going forward, we will continue to invest in this area to best serve our consumers. Additionally, we'll continue to drive growth in our e-commerce business by increasing consumer access to product customization. In Q3, for example, we brought exclusive new Flyknit options to NIKEiD, giving consumers the ability to take customization to yet another level. Overall, we continue to see tremendous potential for growth in our e-commerce business as we leverage our digital platform to continue to deliver premium products, services and experiences for our consumers.
As we head into the final quarter of fiscal 2015 and beyond, I continue to see tremendous opportunity for NIKE around the world. You've heard me say many times that I see more potential for growth going forward than at any time in our history, and I certainly continue to believe that today.
While the current macro environment is challenging, it is not new to us. We have a highly experienced and aligned management team that knows how to continue to deliver profitable growth by turning challenges into opportunities. It's what we've always done in the past, and it's what you can expect from us going forward.
Thanks. And now here's Trevor."

Q3 is a great example about how the strength of the NIKE Brand drives growth around the world even in a more challenging macro environment. As Mark mentioned, the impact of foreign exchange has intensified, and Don will talk more about our work to mitigate those impacts. As I normally do, I'll speak to our results on a constant-currency basis. While we consider the impact of foreign exchange as part of the overall management of our business, currency-neutral results provide a clearer view of the underlying operational performance.
So let's take a look at the numbers. The NIKE Brand revenue grew 11% with strong growth in Western Europe, Greater China and the emerging markets as well as in our Sportswear and Basketball categories. NIKE Brand DTC revenue increased 29%, driven by all concepts in all geographies. And as Mark mentioned, we also saw continued strong growth at NIKE.com. And global futures are up 11%, reflecting the strong growth despite comparisons to the prior year, which included strong World Cup demand. Excluding the impact of the World Cup, we estimate future orders would have grown in the mid-teens.
As Q3 growth -- our Q3 growth is a result of the deep relationships we've built with consumers through the category offense. Our laser focus on individual consumers strengthens our -- those connections, whether they are online, at retail or live experiences. NIKE's consistent focus on serving the consumer to through the lens of their chosen sports helps enable continued profitable growth.
What's more, only NIKE has the global scale to execute this consumer-focused strategy in markets around the world. As we further drive the category offense globally, we continue to prove our ability to connect our brands to consumers and build compelling retail destinations that elevate, segment and differentiate the markets around the globe.
To see the category offense in action, let's first take a look at 2 of our key categories: Basketball and Running. Both NIKE and the Jordan Brand continue to deliver the absolute best in Basketball with innovative products and groundbreaking experiences. Q3 was the 14th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth for the Basketball category. And as the game expands around the globe, we continue to see amazing opportunity for growth in this important category. Q3 was a great example of the combined power of Nike Basketball and Brand Jordan to create excitement and energy in the marketplace. I was in New York City for the NBA All-Star weekend, and it was clearly an electric experience for hundreds and thousands of basketball fans who took part. All over the city, NIKE and Brand Jordan executed retail concepts and consumer experiences that showcase basketball's unique culture and passion.
Nike Basketball invited fans to visit the Zoom City Arena, offering them a chance to play on the first digital LED court in the United States. Brand Jordan transformed the Penn Pavilion into an interactive consumer experience where fans could relive Michael Jordan's iconic game-winning shots. And both brands created elevated retail executions at NIKETOWN at House of Hoops locations with Foot Locker and at pop-up locations around the city. All of these combined to deliver a truly one-of-a-kind experience for our consumers, something only NIKE can do.
In addition to delivering highly engaging consumer experiences, we continued to lead with innovative product. In the quarter, Kyrie Irving, one of the most exciting young players in the game today, became the newest signature athlete for Nike with the launch of the KYRIE 1. Offering superior traction with the Hyperfuse construction, the KYRIE 1 is an excellent example of how we never stop improving. Also, seeing huge consumer response was the KOBE X, the most coveted shoe yet for the popular KOBE line.
Next, let's talk about Running. As you know, Running is our heritage and our largest performance category. The NIKE Brand continues to resonate with runners, fueled by the Nike+ Run Club and grassroots running events around the world. And the Running category continues to deliver strong results in key geographies, including Europe, China and the emerging markets. That said, core footwear within the Running category isn't performing as well as we would like, particularly in North America. As a result, we are highly focused on delivering new innovation into our core product offerings to ensure we continue to serve our consumer with the absolute best.
With our premium performance products, we continue to see strong sell-through for footwear styles like the Air Max 2015, the LunarTempo and the Air Zoom Pegasus 31. In addition, our premium performance apparel continues to drive growth, and we saw strong consumer response to the styles such as new Epic Lux and Epic Running Tights.
As part of our Amplify strategy, we leveraged the heritage of our Running into Sportswear to deliver great style for consumers who appreciate the aesthetic of running. This is our complete offense in the Running category. And Running-inspired Sportswear performed extremely [ph] well in the quarter, led by strong consumer response to the Roshe platform and the Roshe Flyknit in particular. The Air Max 1 Collection also had strong performance in the quarter.
Looking ahead, we will continue to build on what's working in Running as we further strengthen our business to accelerate growth. We are excited to have a robust, continuous pipeline of groundbreaking footwear innovations, which we will bring to the market over the next 18 months. And we will also leverage the momentum in platforms such as the Lunar, Flyknit and our Air Max to continue to drive growth. Overall, Running continues to be a tremendous source of innovation and inspiration for NIKE and one of our key long-term growth drivers.
Let's talk about a few of our key geographies. First, North America, which delivered 6% revenue growth in the quarter. Consumer demand continues to be very strong in North America as most key categories grew and futures were up 15%. That said, revenue growth was somewhat lower than expected in the quarter due to challenges related to the port congestion on the West Coast, which escalated late in our fiscal quarter 3. As a result, some shipments originally expected for delivery in Q3 were delayed. Looking ahead, we expect revenue growth in quarter 4 to accelerate as the flow of product through the supply chain begins to normalize. However, we do expect it will take a few quarters to return to fully normalized product flow as there are significant number of containers to be cleared from the ports on the West Coast.
To be very clear, there continues to be tremendous momentum for the NIKE Brand in North America, thanks to innovative product that continues to resonate with our consumers. And the category offense continues to help us deliver segmented and differentiated retail destinations with our wholesale partners in our stores and online. Executions such as the Fieldhouse with Dick's Sporting Goods and the House of Hoops with Foot Locker performed very well in the quarter, as did our DTC business, which delivered revenue growth of 15% and continued strong growth on NIKE.com. Overall, we continue to see tremendous potential for growth in North America as demand remains strong and our brand continues to resonate with consumers.
In Western Europe, we're seeing broad-based demand with revenue growth of 21% in the quarter. We saw growth across all categories and territories with particular strength in AGS, the U.K. and Southern Europe. A critical part of our successful growth strategy in Western Europe is the work we've done to transform the marketplace along the category offense. We continue to develop more differentiated retail executions with our wholesale partners in our stores and online while continuing to bring innovative products into the marketplace.
The JD omni-channel store at Trafford and the Pro Direct digital store in London are great example of powerful avenues we have to differentiate the NIKE Brand. In addition, we continue to see strong performance in our stores, with DTC up 40% and strong growth on NIKE.com. It remains early days yet, but the market growth we're seeing in nearly every territory, coupled with the market share gains, prove the success of our efforts in Western Europe.
Let's turn to the emerging markets where revenue grew 12% in the quarter, with 6 of the 9 territories growing double digits. We also saw strong growth coming from Sportswear, Running and Basketball. While we feel good about the third quarter results in the emerging markets, we do anticipate some choppiness going forward. Futures declined 6% for the period, in part the result of tough comparisons to the strong World Cup orders in the prior year. We are also taking proactive steps to reduce the supply to ensure a healthy marketplace in Mexico and Brazil, 2 of our largest territories in the emerging markets.
In Mexico, as we have discussed on previous calls, inventory levels in the marketplace were higher than we would like, largely a result of transition issues with our distribution center in early fiscal 2014. We've made significant progress in clearing the excess inventory in Mexico, and we expect to return to more normalized levels by the end of fiscal year '15. To ensure a healthy pull market, we've also worked proactively with our wholesale partners to adjust the flow of product into the marketplace, which contributes to the year-over-year decline in future orders for the emerging markets.
In Brazil, Q3 revenue growth was modest as volatile macroeconomic conditions made for a challenging operating environment. The NIKE Brand continues to be incredibly strong in Brazil, and we see great opportunity to reposition this critical market for sustainable, profitable growth. As we successfully did in North America, China and Western Europe, we will leverage the category offense to segment and differentiate our points of distribution. In doing so, we will increase the productivity and profitability of the marketplace. We will accomplish this by elevating the retail experiences for our consumers and presenting our products in more compelling and premium execution. As we start to reset the market in Brazil, we are working proactively with our wholesale partners to pace the flow of product into the market. As with Mexico, this is also contributing to the year-over-year decline in the emerging markets futures orders.
We are confident that our actions in Mexico and Brazil will help us to reach our goal of operating a healthy pull market in these important territories. And long term, we remain confident that the emerging markets geography will drive significant growth for the NIKE Brand.
Lastly, in Greater China, we continue to see the benefits of our strategy to reset the marketplace. Q3 revenue growth was 17%, and futures are up 23%. This reflects the continued strength of the NIKE Brand in the market along with our efforts to execute a more consumer-focused distribution strategy. Our wholesale partners have continued to see strong comp store growth and expanded profitability in the doors that have been re-profiled. This success aligns with the results we've seen in our own retail doors. Additionally, inventory levels in China continue to be healthy, letting us better serve the consumer and maintain a strong pull market. Given the success we've seen in the marketplace over the last several quarters, we are now focused on evolving from a reset strategy to a new normal of how we do business in China. As we look ahead, we continue to see tremendous opportunity for growth in this key geography.
Ultimately, I feel great about the results we delivered in Q3. And while we will continue to face macroeconomic challenges going forward, we know there's tremendous momentum in the marketplace. And we know the NIKE Brand continues to resonate with consumers all around the world, and we know our relentless focus on serving the consumer will keep us in the lead. We know all of this, and because we do, I personally could not be more excited about what the future holds.
Thanks. Now here's Don."

In his opening remarks, Mark spoke about the tremendous macroeconomic volatility we've seen in recent months. In particular, over the last 90 days, the U.S. dollar has appreciated against virtually every other major currency. There's no question that this has and will continue to have an impact on multinational companies, including NIKE. We see these times as opportunities to distinguish ourselves, both in how we deliver for our consumers and how we deliver for our shareholders. The power of our brands and our portfolio, the strength of our balance sheet and the experience of our management team all give us the ability to navigate these conditions in a way few companies can.
We've always run our business to deliver appropriate near-term profitability, invest for long-term growth and manage risk. That approach hasn't changed. That doesn't mean this is business as usual. It does mean we'll use all the levers of our business to deliver profitable growth even in the face of strong macro headwinds. We'll continue to make focused investments to build strong brand connections, deliver innovative products and services and create compelling retail experiences for consumers. We'll leverage our strength with consumers to grow revenues and expand gross margins. We'll apply innovation and operational discipline to increase cost productivity. And we'll continue to deliver increasing profitability and cash returns to shareholders. We've been here before, and we're confident we have the business capabilities and momentum to deliver growth and profitability even under difficult economic circumstances.
With that introduction, I'll now recap our Q3 results. Third quarter reported revenue for NIKE, Inc. increased 7%. On a currency-neutral basis, revenue increased 13%, in line with our expectations, as the NIKE Brand grew 11% and Converse increased 33%. Also on a currency-neutral basis, NIKE Brand futures orders grew 11%, driven by a 6% increase in average selling price and a 5% increase in units. The growth reflects continued strong demand across the NIKE Brand portfolio led by double-digit growth in North America, China and Central and Eastern Europe.
From a category perspective, the growth reflected strong demand across multiple categories, including Sportswear, Basketball and Running. This overall growth is especially noteworthy given last year's robust orders in advance of the 2014 World Cup, which particularly affected futures orders in Europe and the emerging markets. As Trevor mentioned earlier, excluding the impact of World Cup, we estimate futures would have increased at a mid-teens rate. On a reported basis, futures grew 2%, reflecting weaker international currencies, particularly the euro, reais, ruble, pound and yen.
Third quarter diluted EPS increased 19% to $0.89, driven by revenue growth, gross margin expansion and a lower share count, partially offset by higher SG&A investments and a higher tax rate. In Q3, the impact of FX was insignificant as the impact of the stronger dollar was largely offset by our currency hedging programs.
Gross margin expanded 140 basis points in the quarter. The increase was driven by a continued shift to higher-margin products, partially offset by higher product input and warehousing costs.
Third quarter demand creation was flat to last year as higher investments in digital and sports marketing were largely offset by lower advertising expenses due to changes in the timing of product launches. Q3 operating overhead increased 15%, reflecting growth in our higher gross margin, higher-cost DTC business, investments in operational infrastructure and continued investments in digital, including consumer engagement.
The Q3 effective tax rate was 24.4%, a 190 basis point increase versus the prior year quarter, primarily due to the impact of tax expense on intercompany transactions, partially offset by the retroactive reinstatement of the U.S. R&D tax credit.
At the end of Q3, NIKE, Inc. inventories were up 12%, primarily driven by unit growth in North America and Europe. As Trevor mentioned earlier, our North America business was affected by congestion at West Coast ports, reducing Q3 revenue growth and increasing Q3 inventories. While we anticipate the flow of product will soon begin to return to normal, we expect we will have somewhat higher inventory levels and lower margins in North America for the next few quarters as we work to rebalance supply and demand in the market.
Now let's take a look at some of the performance highlights by segment. In North America, Q3 revenue increased 6% on both a reported and currency-neutral basis, led by Basketball and Sportswear. Direct-to-Consumer revenues grew 15%, driven by the rapid expansion of NIKE.com, 7% comp store sales growth and the addition of new stores. On a reported basis, Q3 EBIT for North America grew 14%, driven by revenue growth, gross margin expansion and SG&A leverage.
In Western Europe, Q3 revenues increased 21% on a currency-neutral basis. The growth was broad-based as nearly every territory increased at a double-digit rate and every key category grew, led by double-digit growth in Sportswear, Men's Training -- sorry, Women's Training and Running. Despite the weaker euro, reported Q3 revenue for Western Europe increased 10% and EBIT increased 22%, driven by revenue growth, gross margin expansion and SG&A leverage.
In Central and Eastern Europe, Q3 revenue increased 7% on a currency-neutral basis. Most territories delivered double-digit revenue growth, but revenues in Russia, Israel and Turkey declined. Nearly every key category expanded, led by Sportswear, Women's Training and Running. Reported revenue for CEE declined 10% and EBIT fell 35%, reflecting significantly weaker currencies, most significantly in Russia.
In Greater China, Q3 revenues increased 17% on a currency-neutral basis, led by double-digit growth in Sportswear, Basketball and Running. On a reported basis, Q3 revenue for China increased 15% while EBIT increased 7%, driven by strong revenue growth and gross margin expansion, partially offset by investments in demand creation and DTC.
In the emerging markets geography, Q3 revenue grew 12% on a currency-neutral basis, driven by strong growth in all territories except Brazil, which grew at a single-digit rate, and Mexico, which declined mid-teens. From a category perspective, the growth was led by Sportswear, Running and Basketball. On a reported basis, emerging markets revenue increased 2% and EBIT increased 3%, reflecting significant currency headwinds.
As Trevor discussed, we're seeing the results of our work to clear excess inventory in Mexico. At the same time, we're taking action to realign the Brazil marketplace along the lines of the category offense. We're confident these steps will set us up to continue to deliver sustainable, profitable growth in these territories and to the emerging markets geography as a whole.
At Converse, Q3 revenue grew 33% on a currency-neutral basis, boosted by the acceleration of Q4 shipments in advance of a major systems go live. The balance of the growth was driven by continued strength in North America, the conversion of several European markets to direct distribution and strong growth in DTC. On a reported basis, Converse revenue increased 28% and EBIT increased 23%, driven by revenue growth, partially offset by higher investments in infrastructure, DTC and demand creation to enable long-term growth.
We've seen strong momentum in our business year-to-date, and we expect that momentum to continue into Q4 and beyond. That said, FX headwinds have intensified significantly in the last 90 days, especially from the erosion of the value of the euro. While our hedging programs have significantly reduced the impact of FX on profitability, we cannot eliminate all currency risk.
Based on what we know today, we expect the following for Q4 and full year FY '15. We expect constant dollar revenue growth for Q4 in the low double digits, with reported revenue growth 8 to 9 points lower, reflecting the significantly stronger dollar. For the full year, we expect constant dollar revenue growth in the low teens, with reported revenue growth 4 to 5 points lower.
We now expect Q4 gross margin to be flat to up about 25 basis points as the impact of higher closeouts, particularly in North America and Europe, largely offset the ongoing benefits of mix shifts to higher-margin products and businesses. For the full year, we now expect gross margin expansion of about 100 basis points.
We expect demand creation to decrease at a high single-digit rate for Q4 as we anniversary investments in World Cup marketing in Q4 of FY '14. For the full year, we now expect demand creation to grow at a mid-single-digit rate.
We expect operating overhead to grow at a high single to low double-digit rate for Q4 and at a mid-teens rate for the full year, reflecting higher DTC expenses as well as investments in digital innovation and new operating capabilities.
We continue to expect the effective tax rate for FY '15 will be approximately 24.5%.
Looking ahead to FY '16, we haven't yet completed our planning but can provide some initial thoughts. We expect to see continued strong momentum in our business and anticipate currency-neutral revenue growth for FY '16 slightly above our high single-digit target range. When combined with the impact of our ongoing work to expand gross margins and ongoing investments in our growth strategies, we would have expected EPS growth at or above our long-term mid-teens target.
That said, the appreciation of the U.S. dollar against nearly every other major currency will reduce next year's reported revenue, gross margin and profit. Assuming exchange rates remain in about the same range as they are today, we expect FY '16 reported revenue growth in the mid-single digits and EPS growth in the high single to low double-digit range. Currency markets remain volatile, so we will provide an update on our FY '16 expectations on our Q4 earnings call.
On our last conference call, I spoke about one of our NIKE maxims, and today, I'd like to highlight another. We are on the offense always. As Mark said at the outset, we view a challenging operating environment as an opportunity to create further competitive separation. By staying focused on consumers and leveraging our strengths, we're confident we can continue to deliver strong financial performance and create value for our shareholders even in a challenging macroeconomic environment.
We're now ready to take your questions."

We are, as you would imagine, always talking to the leagues, clubs and federations, but really nothing more to report on any specific conversations with the NBA sponsorship.

I can't imagine that it wouldn't be going forward. We're selective in the choices that we make in terms of where we think we have the greatest opportunities.

For example, on the NFL, we've had to do some very different approaches to make sure that we're able to respond very quickly to changes in demand, whether it be for specific teams or specific athletes. And that goes all the way to the manufacturing revolution type of investments we've made around technologies like Flyknit.

The second thing is that we've adjusted -- or we do adjust payments to the factories on the basis of how those currencies move.

Andy Campion is really a seasoned NIKE veteran, and he's been under the tutelage of Don and the incredible financial leadership team here at NIKE. And I have tremendous confidence in Andy's ability to take the reins and continue the momentum that Don's helped create for us going forward. More on that as we move forward."

First, Trevor, you mentioned in your comments the core footwear in Running in North America not performing quite as well as you guys would like. I was wondering if you might share with us sort of more what is going on there. Is it a fashion shift? Is this a product presentation? Or what are some of the things that we should be looking for that could get that going again? And then the second question is just as you look over the next year or so in Europe, the sort of need and ability to raise prices over there to offset all the FX changes and how you guys are thinking about that?"

Really [ph] the first thing I want to just maybe communicate is that Running -- our brand continues to really resonate with runners in North America. And one of the things I want to do will be unpack [ph] a little bit about how we view the business. And what we always talk, what we say is the amplified offense, which really gives you a greater view of the marketplace. And so when you take a look at it, you have the performance segment, you have the core segment, and you have the Running-inspired segment. And so if you break those down in the performance segment, we're seeing tremendous success of the new parts that we've been bringing to marketplace. So we -- whether you take the Air Pegasus 31 or the Max 2015 or any of those products, they're doing really, really well. And so we feel obviously very, very confident about that. As I mentioned in the core footwear, we think there's opportunity for us to do better in that zone. And so as Mark said, we're going to continue to bring more innovation and strengthen that part of the business. The other dimension is the Running-inspired business, which I mentioned, which are things like the Roshe, which really speak to more of aesthetic side or certainly people who like the aesthetic for the style component of Running. And that's doing really well. So all in all, the Running business core performance is where we see some challenges, but the rest of the business really continues to do really well. In addition, the apparel is also doing really, really well in the marketplace. So we feel we're connected with runners in a great way. Lastly, I would say that I'm very confident about the innovations we're going to continue to bring in the marketplace over the next 18 months. We have a robust pipeline. So I'm really excited about doing that and making sure that we continue. Futures are actually up 15%. So we feel confident about the Running business and its impact in the marketplace."

Before I turn the call over to Ms. Hall, let me remind you that participants on this call will make forward-looking statements based on current expectations, and those statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially. These risks and uncertainties are detailed in the reports filed with the SEC, including Forms 8-K, 10-K and 10-Q. 
Some forward-looking statements concern future orders that are not necessarily indicative of changes in total revenues for subsequent periods due to mix of futures and at-once orders, exchange rates fluctuations, order cancellations, changes in the timing of shipments, discounts and returns which may vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter. In addition, it is important to remember a significant portion of NIKE, Inc.'s continuing operations, including equipment, NIKE Golf, Converse and Hurley, are not included in these futures numbers.
Finally, participants may discuss non-GAAP financial measures, including references to wholesale equivalent sales. References to total wholesale equivalent sales are only intended to provide context as to the overall current market footprint of the brands owned by NIKE, Inc. and should not be relied upon as a financial measure of actual results. 
Participants may also make references to other nonpublic financial and statistical information and non-GAAP financial measures. Discussion of nonpublic financial and statistical information and presentations of comparable GAAP measures and quantitative reconciliations can be found at NIKE's website, investors.nike.com.

Well, we delivered another strong quarter in Q3. Revenues grew 7% to $7.5 billion; gross margin increased by 140 basis points to 45.9%; and diluted earnings per share increased 19% to $0.89.We were able to deliver",1363,"Thank you, Kelley, and hello, everyone. Well, we delivered another strong quarter in Q3. Revenues grew 7% to $7.5 billion; gross margin increased by 140 basis points to 45.9%; and diluted earnings per share increased 19% to $0.89.
We were able to deliver results like these for the quarter by leveraging the power of the NIKE portfolio. Over the last 3 months, the macro environment has become increasingly volatile. Foreign currency headwinds have intensified, product input costs continued to fluctuate and the political landscape is evolving in many countries around the world. This is the environment in which all multinational companies now operate, and NIKE is not immune to it.
The difference for NIKE, however, is that we see this as an opportunity to create further separation in the marketplace. Our globally diverse portfolio of geographies, categories, brands, product types and distribution channels gives us a distinct competitive advantage. By going deep into the business, we are able to see opportunities to serve the consumer and drive growth despite the choppier landscape. This surgical approach to finding new dimensions of growth ensures we capture the full potential of our brands around the world. And that includes driving strong growth in the areas of our business that are already well established such as Western Europe, China, North America in footwear as well as businesses such as women's, young athletes, apparel and e-commerce where we are accelerating development. These are just a few examples of the dimensions of our business where we are continuing to identify further opportunities to expand our reach and drive growth.
And we do this while maintaining a disciplined approach to investing in those opportunities with the highest potential for return so we can drive growth and manage risk over the short and the long term. This complete offense is how we can continue to deliver sustainable, profitable growth. As you have seen from NIKE in the past, we know how to operate in a challenging environment better than anyone, and you will continue to see us leverage the breadth and depth of our global portfolio to do just that going forward.
At NIKE, everything we do starts with the consumer. It's our obsession with serving the consumer that sharpens our focus and drives our growth. The expectations of our consumers are evolving rapidly, and we're able to meet and often exceed those expectations because we know the athlete. By working with athletes at all levels, from the elite to the everyday, we have a level of knowledge and insight that is unmatched in our industry. And we are able to use the insights that we gain to create new product and services that drive new levels of performance innovation across all of our categories.
The pace of innovation at NIKE has never been faster, and our pipeline has never been more robust. We're leveraging new tools and processes to unlock significant advancements every day. However, the starting point for innovation remains the same, and that's the athlete. Many of our greatest innovations have come from going deep into an individual sport to solve a unique athletic need. And let me highlight a few examples in our footwear business from Q3.
In Running, the LunarTempo is a shoe that merges speed with cushioning for a great ride over the longer runs; and then the newly redesigned Air Max 2015, our most flexible, comfortable Air Max to date. We're seeing very strong response from consumers, and I'm tremendously excited about the pipeline of products in the Running category.
In Basketball, with his 10th signature shoe, Kobe Bryant returned to a low top and once again pushed the limits of design. In addition to great consumer reaction to the KOBE X, players around the NBA are wearing it for its great traction and cushioning.
And in Football, the Nike Vapor Untouchable cleat was created to provide the game's fastest players with power and precision on the field. We've had tremendous feedback on the performance and the look of the Untouchable from the athletes at both the NFL and the collegiate level.
And in Men's Training, the Nike MetCon 1, a first of its kind high-intensity training shoe that has been incredibly popular in the marketplace, and it's just a hint at what's to come in Men's Training.
These innovations each deliver a new level of performance for the athlete. However, we only truly realize our potential as a company when we continue to leverage those breakthroughs across multiple sports and categories. It's what you've seen from us time and time again. Many of our biggest footwear platforms such as Lunar and Free, Flyknit and Nike Air were initially created to solve a specific athlete need in a specific category. But now they serve as the foundation for our greatest products across multiple categories.
Similarly, in apparel, platforms such as Aeroloft and Dri-FIT, both originally introduced in Running, set the standard for thermoregulation and moisture management in multiple categories and product classifications. And our Nike Pro collection continues to drive energy in all sports, especially our Pro Bra and Tight collections for women.
Individually and collectively, our product innovation is breaking new ground across all of our categories. And as excited as we are about the technical details of these products, what's most important is how well our products are resonating with athletes and consumers, which we clearly saw in the quarter.
Innovation fuels more than product at NIKE. It also drives how we do business and how we connect with the world. In the case of our digital ecosystem, NIKE is growing a connected community of athletes all over the world. This community is seamlessly engaged with the brand not only by accepting the world's best product, but by fueling activity and improving their athletic lives. We know it's not enough to simply to interact. True connections require depth and richness. And in Q3, we strengthened these digital connections and added new dimensions to our digital ecosystem.
So how does NIKE continue to expand our digital innovation?  Well, we linked experience to commerce. We released the Nike SNKRS app during the NBA All-Star Game in New York, letting consumers on mobile devices see, share and buy our most coveted footwear products. And we broadened access. We announced several partnerships with the Nike+ Running app to let runners connect to Nike+ experiences to even more of their devices and fitness equipment. And we glow -- we grow our global reach. We added more sharing capabilities to our Nike+ Training Club app. We expanded it to 18 languages. It's work like this that will continue to power our digital experiences for years to come.
At the same time, in Q3, we continued to see tremendous growth in our e-commerce business as NIKE.com was up 42% in the quarter. Traffic and conversion both increased. And for the first time in our history, mobile traffic exceeded desktop traffic, helped in part by the introduction of our SNKRS app. And going forward, we will continue to invest in this area to best serve our consumer. 
Additionally, we'll continue to drive growth in our e-commerce business by increasing consumer access to product customization. In Q3, for example, we brought exclusive new Flyknit options to NIKEiD, giving consumers the ability to take customization to yet another level. Overall, we continue to see tremendous potential for growth in our e-commerce business as we leverage our digital platform to continue to deliver premium products, services and experiences for our consumers.
As we head into the final quarter of fiscal 2015 and beyond, I continue to see tremendous opportunity for NIKE around the world. You've heard me say many times that I see more potential for growth going forward than at any time in our history, and I certainly continue to believe that today.
While the current macro environment is challenging, it is not new to us. We have a highly experienced and aligned management team that knows how to continue to deliver profitable growth by turning challenges into opportunities. It's what we've always done in the past, and it's what you can expect from us going forward.
Thanks. And now here's Trevor."

Q3 is a great example about how the strength of the NIKE Brand drives growth around the world, even in a more challenging macro environment. As Mark mentioned, the impact of foreign exchange has intensified, and Don will talk more about our work to mitigate those impacts. As I normally do, I'll speak to our results on a constant-currency basis. While we consider the impact of foreign exchange as part of the overall management of our business, currency-neutral results provide a clearer view of the underlying operational performance.
So let's take a look at the numbers. The NIKE Brand revenue grew 11% with strong growth in Western Europe, Greater China and the emerging markets, as well as in our Sportswear and Basketball categories. NIKE Brand DTC revenue increased 29%, driven by all concepts in all geographies. And as Mark mentioned, we also saw continued strong growth in NIKE.com. And global futures are up 11%, reflecting the strong growth despite comparisons to the prior year, which included strong World Cup demand. Excluding the impact of the World Cup, we estimate future orders would have grown in the mid-teens.
As Q3 growth -- our Q3 growth is a result of the deep relationships we've built with consumers through the category offense. Our laser focus on individual consumers strengthens our -- those connections, whether they are online, at retail or at live experiences. NIKE's consistent focus on serving the consumer through the lens of their chosen sports helps enable continued profitable growth.
What's more, only NIKE has the global scale to execute this consumer-focused strategy in markets around the world. As we further drive the category offense globally, we continue to prove our ability to connect our brands to consumers and build compelling retail destinations that elevate, segment and differentiate the markets around the globe.
To see the category offense in action, let's first take a look at 2 of our key categories: Basketball and Running. Both NIKE and the Jordan Brand continue to deliver the absolute best in Basketball, with innovative products and groundbreaking experiences. Q3 was the 14th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth for the Basketball category. And as the game expands around the globe, we continue to see amazing opportunity for growth in this important category. Q3 was a great example of the combined power of Nike Basketball and Brand Jordan to create excitement and energy in the marketplace. I was in New York City for the NBA All-Star weekend, and it was clearly an electric experience for hundreds and thousands of basketball fans who took part. All over the city, NIKE and Brand Jordan executed retail concepts and consumer experiences that showcase basketball's unique culture and passion.
Nike Basketball invited fans to visit the Zoom City Arena, offering them a chance to play on the first digital LED court in the United States. Brand Jordan transformed the Penn Pavilion into an interactive consumer experience where fans could relive Michael Jordan's iconic game-winning shots. And both brands created elevated retail executions at NIKETOWN at House of Hoops locations with Foot Locker and at pop-up locations around the city. All of this combined to deliver a truly one-of-a-kind experience for our consumers, something only NIKE can do.
In addition to delivering highly engaging consumer experiences, we continued to lead with innovative product. In the quarter, Kyrie Irving, one of the most exciting young players in the game today, became the newest signature athlete for NIKE with the launch of the KYRIE 1. Offering superior traction with the Hyperfuse construction, the KYRIE 1 is an excellent example of how we never stop improving. Also, seeing huge consumer response was the KOBE X, the most coveted shoe yet for the popular KOBE line.
Next, let's talk about Running. As you know, Running is our heritage and our largest performance category. The NIKE Brand continues to resonate with runners, fueled by the Nike+ Run Club and grassroots running events around the world. And the Running category continues to deliver strong results in key geographies, including Europe, China and the emerging markets. That said, core footwear within the Running category isn't performing as well as we would like, particularly in North America. As a result, we are highly focused on delivering new innovation into our core product offerings to ensure we continue to serve our consumer with the absolute best.
With our premium performance products, we continue to see strong sell-through for footwear styles like the Air Max 2015, the LunarTempo and the Air Zoom Pegasus 31. In addition, our premium performance apparel continues to drive growth, and we saw strong consumer response to the styles such as the new Epic Lux and the Epic Run Tights.
As part of our Amplify strategy, we leverage the heritage of our Running into Sportswear to deliver great style for consumers who appreciate the aesthetic of running. This is our complete offense in the Running category. And Running-inspired Sportswear performed exceedingly well in the quarter, led by strong consumer response to the Roshe platform and the Roshe Flyknit in particular. The Air Max 1 Collection also had strong performance in the quarter.
Looking ahead, we will continue to build on what's working in Running as we further strengthen our business to accelerate growth. We are excited to have a robust, continuous pipeline of groundbreaking footwear innovations, which we will bring to the market over the next 18 months. And we will also leverage the momentum in platforms such as the Lunar, Flyknit and our Air Max to continue to drive growth. Overall, Running continues to be a tremendous source of innovation and inspiration for NIKE and one of our key long-term growth drivers.
Let's talk about a few of our key geographies. First, North America, which delivered 6% revenue growth in the quarter. Consumer demand continues to be very strong in North America as most key categories grew and futures were up 15%. That said, revenue growth was somewhat lower than expected in the quarter due to challenges related to the port congestion on the West Coast, which escalated late in our fiscal quarter 3. As a result, some shipments originally expected for delivery in Q3 were delayed. Looking ahead, we expect revenue growth in quarter 4 to accelerate as the flow of product through the supply chain begins to normalize. However, we do expect it will take a few quarters to return to fully normalized product flow as there are a significant number of containers to be cleared from the ports on the West Coast.
To be very clear, there continues to be tremendous momentum for the NIKE Brand in North America, thanks to innovative product that continues to resonate with our consumers. And the category offense continues to help us deliver segmented and differentiated retail destinations with our wholesale partners in our stores and online. Executions such as the Fieldhouse with Dick's Sporting Goods and the House of Hoops with Foot Locker performed very well in the quarter, as did our DTC business, which delivered revenue growth of 15% and continued strong growth on NIKE.com. Overall, we continue to see tremendous potential for growth in North America as demand remains strong and our brand continues to resonate with consumers.
In Western Europe, we're seeing broad-based demand with revenue growth of 21% in the quarter. We saw growth across all categories and territories with particular strength in AGS, the U.K. and Southern Europe. A critical part of our successful growth strategy in Western Europe is the work we've done to transform the marketplace along the category offense. We continue to develop more differentiated retail executions with our wholesale partners in our stores and online while continuing to bring innovative products into the marketplace.
The JD omni-channel store at Trafford and the Pro Direct digital store in London are a great example of powerful avenues we have to differentiate the NIKE Brand. In addition, we continue to see strong performance in our stores, with DTC up 40% and strong growth on NIKE.com. It remains early days yet, but the market growth we're seeing in nearly every territory, coupled with the market share gains, prove the success of our efforts in Western Europe.
Let's turn to the emerging markets where revenue grew 12% in the quarter, with 6 of the 9 territories growing double-digits. We also saw strong growth coming from Sportswear, Running and Basketball. While we feel good about the third quarter results in the emerging markets, we do anticipate some choppiness going forward. Futures declined 6% for the period, in part the result of tough comparisons to the strong World Cup orders in the prior year. We are also taking proactive steps to reduce the supply to ensure a healthy marketplace in Mexico and Brazil, 2 of our largest territories in the emerging markets.
In Mexico, as we have discussed on previous calls, inventory levels in the marketplace were higher than we would like, largely a result of transition issues with our distribution center in early fiscal 2014. We've made significant progress in clearing the excess inventory in Mexico, and we expect to return to more normalized levels by the end of fiscal year '15. To ensure a healthy pull market, we've also worked proactively with our wholesale partners to adjust the flow of product into the marketplace, which contributes to the year-over-year decline in future orders for the emerging markets.
In Brazil, Q3 revenue growth was modest as volatile macroeconomic conditions made for a challenging operating environment. The NIKE Brand continues to be incredibly strong in Brazil, and we see great opportunity to reposition this critical market for sustainable, profitable growth. As we successfully did in North America, China and Western Europe, we will leverage the category offense to segment and differentiate our points of distribution. In doing so, we will increase the productivity and profitability of the marketplace. We will accomplish this by elevating the retail experiences for our consumers and presenting our products in more compelling and premium execution. As we start to reset the market in Brazil, we are working proactively with our wholesale partners to pace the flow of product into the market. As with Mexico, this is also contributing to the year-over-year decline in the emerging markets futures orders.
We are confident that our actions in Mexico and Brazil will help us to reach our goal of operating a healthy pull market in these important territories. And long term, we remain confident that the emerging markets geography will drive significant growth for the NIKE Brand.
Lastly, in Greater China, we continue to see the benefits of our strategy to reset the marketplace. Q3 revenue growth was 17%, and futures are up 23%. This reflects the continued strength of the NIKE Brand in the market along with our efforts to execute a more consumer-focused distribution strategy. Our wholesale partners have continued to see strong comp store growth and expanded profitability in the doors that have been re-profiled. This success aligns with the results we've seen in our own retail doors. Additionally, inventory levels in China continue to be healthy, letting us better serve the consumer and maintain a strong pull market. Given the success we've seen in the marketplace over the last several quarters, we are now focused on evolving from a reset strategy to a new normal of how we do business in China. As we look ahead, we continue to see tremendous opportunity for growth in this key geography.
Ultimately, I feel great about the results we delivered in Q3. And while we will continue to face macroeconomic challenges going forward, we know there's tremendous momentum in the marketplace. And we know the NIKE Brand continues to resonate with consumers all around the world, and we know our relentless focus on serving the consumer will keep us in the lead. We know all of this, and because we do, I personally could not be more excited about what the future holds.
Thanks. Now here's Don."

In his opening remarks, Mark spoke about the tremendous macroeconomic volatility we've seen in recent months. In particular, over the last 90 days, the U.S. dollar has appreciated against virtually every other major currency. There's no qu",1670,"Thanks, Trevor. In his opening remarks, Mark spoke about the tremendous macroeconomic volatility we've seen in recent months. In particular, over the last 90 days, the U.S. dollar has appreciated against virtually every other major currency. There's no question that this has and will continue to have an impact on multinational companies, including NIKE. We see these times as opportunities to distinguish ourselves, both in how we deliver for our consumers and how we deliver for our shareholders. The power of our brands and our portfolio, the strength of our balance sheet and the experience of our management team all give us the ability to navigate these conditions in a way few companies can.
We've always run our business to deliver appropriate near-term profitability, invest for long-term growth and manage risk. That approach hasn't changed. That doesn't mean this is business as usual. It does mean we'll use all the levers of our business to deliver profitable growth even in the face of strong macro headwinds. We'll continue to make focused investments to build strong brand connections, deliver innovative products and services and create compelling retail experiences for consumers. We'll leverage our strength with consumers to grow revenues and expand gross margins. We'll apply innovation and operational discipline to increase cost productivity. And we'll continue to deliver increasing profitability and cash returns to shareholders. We've been here before, and we're confident we have the business capabilities and momentum to deliver growth and profitability even under difficult economic circumstances.
With that introduction, I'll now recap our Q3 results. Third quarter reported revenue for NIKE, Inc. increased 7%. On a currency-neutral basis, revenue increased 13%, in line with our expectations, as the NIKE Brand grew 11% and Converse increased 33%. Also on a currency-neutral basis, NIKE Brand futures orders grew 11%, driven by a 6% increase in average selling price and a 5% increase in units. The growth reflects continued strong demand across the NIKE Brand portfolio led by double-digit growth in North America, China and Central and Eastern Europe.
From a category perspective, the growth reflected strong demand across multiple categories, including Sportswear, Basketball and Running. This overall growth is especially noteworthy given last year's robust orders in advance of the 2014 World Cup, which particularly affected futures orders in Europe and the emerging markets. As Trevor mentioned earlier, excluding the impact of World Cup, we estimate futures would have increased at a mid-teens rate. On a reported basis, futures grew 2%, reflecting weaker international currencies, particularly the euro, reais, ruble, pound and yen.
Third quarter diluted EPS increased 19% to $0.89, driven by revenue growth, gross margin expansion and a lower share count, partially offset by higher SG&A investments and a higher tax rate. In Q3, the impact of FX was insignificant as the impact of the stronger dollar was largely offset by our currency hedging programs.
Gross margin expanded 140 basis points in the quarter. The increase was driven by a continued shift to higher-margin products, partially offset by higher product input and warehousing costs.
Third quarter demand creation was flat to last year as higher investments in digital and sports marketing were largely offset by lower advertising expenses due to changes in the timing of product launches. Q3 operating overhead increased 15%, reflecting growth in our higher gross margin, higher-cost DTC business, investments in operational infrastructure and continued investments in digital, including consumer engagement.
The Q3 effective tax rate was 24.4%, a 190 basis point increase versus the prior year quarter, primarily due to the impact of tax expense on intercompany transactions, partially offset by the retroactive reinstatement of the U.S. R&D tax credit.
At the end of Q3, NIKE, Inc. inventories were up 12%, primarily driven by unit growth in North America and Europe. As Trevor mentioned earlier, our North America business was affected by congestion at West Coast ports, reducing Q3 revenue growth and increasing Q3 inventories. While we anticipate the flow of product will soon begin to return to normal, we expect we will have somewhat higher inventory levels and lower margins in North America for the next few quarters as we work to rebalance supply and demand in the market.
Now let's take a look at some of the performance highlights by segment. In North America, Q3 revenue increased 6% on both a reported and currency-neutral basis, led by Basketball and Sportswear. Direct-to-Consumer revenues grew 15%, driven by the rapid expansion of NIKE.com, 7% comp store sales growth and the addition of new stores. On a reported basis, Q3 EBIT for North America grew 14%, driven by revenue growth, gross margin expansion and SG&A leverage.
In Western Europe, Q3 revenues increased 21% on a currency-neutral basis. The growth was broad-based as nearly every territory increased at a double-digit rate and every key category grew, led by double-digit growth in Sportswear, Men's Training -- sorry, Women's Training and Running. Despite the weaker euro, reported Q3 revenue for Western Europe increased 10% and EBIT increased 22%, driven by revenue growth, gross margin expansion and SG&A leverage.
In Central and Eastern Europe, Q3 revenue increased 7% on a currency-neutral basis. Most territories delivered double-digit revenue growth, but revenues in Russia, Israel and Turkey declined. Nearly every key category expanded, led by Sportswear, Women's Training and Running. Reported revenue for CEE declined 10% and EBIT fell 35%, reflecting significantly weaker currencies, most significantly in Russia.
In Greater China, Q3 revenues increased 17% on a currency-neutral basis, led by double-digit growth in Sportswear, Basketball and Running. On a reported basis, Q3 revenue for China increased 15% while EBIT increased 7%, driven by strong revenue growth and gross margin expansion, partially offset by investments in demand creation and DTC.
In the emerging markets geography, Q3 revenue grew 12% on a currency-neutral basis, driven by strong growth in all territories except Brazil, which grew at a single-digit rate, and Mexico, which declined mid-teens. From a category perspective, the growth was led by Sportswear, Running and Basketball. On a reported basis, emerging markets revenue increased 2% and EBIT increased 3%, reflecting significant currency headwinds.
As Trevor discussed, we're seeing the results of our work to clear excess inventory in Mexico. At the same time, we're taking action to realign the Brazil marketplace along the lines of the category offense. We're confident these steps will set us up to continue to deliver sustainable, profitable growth in these territories and to the emerging markets geography as a whole.
At Converse, Q3 revenue grew 33% on a currency-neutral basis, boosted by the acceleration of Q4 shipments in advance of a major systems go live. The balance of the growth was driven by continued strength in North America, the conversion of several European markets to direct distribution and strong growth in DTC. On a reported basis, Converse revenue increased 28% and EBIT increased 23%, driven by revenue growth, partially offset by higher investments in infrastructure, DTC and demand creation to enable long-term growth.
We've seen strong momentum in our business year-to-date, and we expect that momentum to continue into Q4 and beyond. That said, FX headwinds have intensified significantly in the last 90 days, especially from the erosion of the value of the euro. While our hedging programs have significantly reduced the impact of FX on profitability, we cannot eliminate all currency risk. 
Based on what we know today, we expect the following for Q4 and full year FY '15. We expect constant dollar revenue growth for Q4 in the low-double digits, with reported revenue growth 8 to 9 points lower, reflecting the significantly stronger dollar. For the full year, we expect constant dollar revenue growth in the low-teens, with reported revenue growth 4 to 5 points lower.
We now expect Q4 gross margin to be flat to up about 25 basis points as the impact of higher closeouts, particularly in North America and Europe, largely offset the ongoing benefits of mix shifts to higher-margin products and businesses. For the full year, we now expect gross margin expansion of about 100 basis points.
We expect demand creation to decrease at a high-single digit rate for Q4 as we anniversary investments in World Cup marketing in Q4 of FY '14. For the full year, we now expect demand creation to grow at a mid-single digit rate.
We expect operating overhead to grow at a high-single to low-double digit rate for Q4 and at a mid-teens rate for the full year, reflecting higher DTC expenses, as well as investments in digital innovation and new operating capabilities.
We continue to expect the effective tax rate for FY '15 will be approximately 24.5%.
Looking ahead to FY '16, we haven't yet completed our planning but can provide some initial thoughts. We expect to see continued strong momentum in our business and anticipate currency-neutral revenue growth for FY '16, slightly above our high-single digit target range. When combined with the impact of our ongoing work to expand gross margins and ongoing investments in our growth strategies, we would have expected EPS growth at or above our long-term mid-teens target.
That said, the appreciation of the U.S. dollar against nearly every other major currency will reduce next year's reported revenue, gross margin and profit. Assuming exchange rates remain in about the same range as they are today, we expect FY '16 reported revenue growth in the mid-single digits and EPS growth in the high-single to low-double digit range. Currency markets remain volatile, so we will provide an update on our FY '16 expectations on our Q4 earnings call.
On our last conference call, I spoke about one of our NIKE maxims, and today, I'd like to highlight another. We are on the offense always. As Mark said at the outset, we view a challenging operating environment as an opportunity to create further competitive separation. By staying focused on consumers and leveraging our strengths, we're confident we can continue to deliver strong financial performance and create value for our shareholders even in a challenging macroeconomic environment.

Our Basketball business is very strong at the moment. And we feel it will continue to be strong because we have an incredible pipeline of new innovations that we keep bringing into the marketplace. So obviously, as you saw when we brought the Kyrie Irving -- the KYRIE shoe into the marketplace, we're just seeing tremendous response to those products. So we continue to feel, again, very confident about our ability to keep the excitement in the Basketball category while continuing to serve all the various segments, whether you're coming through the House of Hoops like at Foot Locker or you work in certainly more of a mid-tier account."

They have been -- you and the industry largely have been producing in Asia and markets where the currencies are tied to the dollar, and the dollar, as you said, has seeing unprecedented strength against all other major currencies. Is now the time to kind of accelerate the process of maybe pulling manufacturing out of some of these markets and taking manufacturing to the end markets and using some of the automated technologies to allow yourself to produce in markets -- in the end markets where the costs will be aligned, at least from a currency perspective, where the sales are?

So we're getting some of the benefit that you're talking about here of matching sourcing currencies and selling currencies even within our existing structure. The second thing is that we've adjusted -- or we do adjust payments to the factories on the basis of how those currencies move. So we are getting some offsetting sourcing benefits right now from the fact that currencies in a lot of our sourcing countries are weakening. So that helps us also net down our foreign exchange exposure. With respect to your overall premise of trying to make sure that our manufacturing is closer both in proximity and time to where the product is sold, that is absolutely part of the strategy from a consumer standpoint. So I think when you look at the financial side of it, we're getting some of the benefits that you're describing through the way we've set up our trading company.

The -- I think the first thing I want to just maybe communicate is that Running -- our brand continues to really resonate with runners in North America. And one of the things I want to do is maybe unpack a little bit about how we view the business. And we always talk about what we say is the amplified offense, which really gives you a greater view of the marketplace. And so when you take a look at it, you have the performance segment, you have the core segment, and you have the Running-inspired segment. And so if you break those down, in the performance segment, we're seeing tremendous success of the new parts that we've been bringing to marketplace. So we -- whether you take the Air Pegasus 31 or the Max 2015 or any of those products, they're doing really, really well. And so we feel obviously very, very confident about that. As I mentioned, in the core footwear, we think there's opportunity for us to do better in that zone. And so as Mark said, we're going to continue to bring more innovation and strengthen that part of the business. The other dimension is the Running-inspired business, which I mentioned, which are things like the Roshe, which really speak to more the aesthetic side or certainly people who like the aesthetic for the style component of Running. And that's doing really well. So all in all, the Running business core performance is where we see some challenges, but the rest of the business really continues to do really well. In addition, the apparel is also doing really, really well in the marketplace. So we feel we're connected with runners in a great way. Lastly, I would say that I'm very confident about the innovations we're going to continue to bring in the marketplace over the next 18 months. We have a robust pipeline.

Before I turn the call over to Ms. Hall, let me remind you that participants on this call will make forward-looking statements based on current expectations, and those statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially. These risks and uncertainties are detailed in the reports filed with the SEC, including Forms 8-K, 10-K and 10-Q. 
Some forward-looking statements concern future orders that are not necessarily indicative of changes in total revenues for subsequent periods due to mix of futures and at-once orders, exchange rates fluctuations, order cancellations, changes in the timing of shipments, discounts and returns which may vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter. In addition, it is important to remember a significant portion of NIKE, Inc.'s continuing operations, including equipment, NIKE Golf, Converse and Hurley, are not included in these futures numbers.
Finally, participants may discuss non-GAAP financial measures, including references to wholesale equivalent sales. References to total wholesale equivalent sales are only intended to provide context as to the overall current market footprint of the brands owned by NIKE, Inc. and should not be relied upon as a financial measure of actual results.

Well, we delivered another strong quarter in Q3. Revenues grew 7% to $7.5 billion; gross margin increased by 140 basis points to 45.9%; and diluted earnings per share increased 19% to $0.89.We were able to deliver",1363,"Thank you, Kelley, and hello, everyone. Well, we delivered another strong quarter in Q3. Revenues grew 7% to $7.5 billion; gross margin increased by 140 basis points to 45.9%; and diluted earnings per share increased 19% to $0.89.
We were able to deliver results like these for the quarter by leveraging the power of the NIKE portfolio. Over the last 3 months, the macro environment has become increasingly volatile. Foreign currency headwinds have intensified, product input costs continued to fluctuate and the political landscape is evolving in many countries around the world. This is the environment in which all multinational companies now operate, and NIKE is not immune to it.
The difference for NIKE, however, is that we see this as an opportunity to create further separation in the marketplace. Our globally diverse portfolio of geographies, categories, brands, product types and distribution channels gives us a distinct competitive advantage. By going deep into the business, we are able to see opportunities to serve the consumer and drive growth despite the choppier landscape. This surgical approach to finding new dimensions of growth ensures we capture the full potential of our brands around the world. And that includes driving strong growth in the areas of our business that are already well established such as Western Europe, China, North America in footwear as well as businesses such as women's, young athletes, apparel and e-commerce where we are accelerating development. These are just a few examples of the dimensions of our business where we are continuing to identify further opportunities to expand our reach and drive growth.
And we do this while maintaining a disciplined approach to investing in those opportunities with the highest potential for return so we can drive growth and manage risk over the short and the long term. This complete offense is how we can continue to deliver sustainable, profitable growth. As you have seen from NIKE in the past, we know how to operate in a challenging environment better than anyone, and you will continue to see us leverage the breadth and depth of our global portfolio to do just that going forward.
At NIKE, everything we do starts with the consumer. It's our obsession with serving the consumer that sharpens our focus and drives our growth. The expectations of our consumers are evolving rapidly, and we're able to meet and often exceed those expectations because we know the athlete. By working with athletes at all levels, from the elite to the everyday, we have a level of knowledge and insight that is unmatched in our industry. And we are able to use the insights that we gain to create new product and services that drive new levels of performance innovation across all of our categories.
The pace of innovation at NIKE has never been faster, and our pipeline has never been more robust. We're leveraging new tools and processes to unlock significant advancements every day. However, the starting point for innovation remains the same, and that's the athlete. Many of our greatest innovations have come from going deep into an individual sport to solve a unique athletic need. And let me highlight a few examples in our footwear business from Q3.
In Running, the LunarTempo is a shoe that merges speed with cushioning for a great ride over the longer runs; and then the newly redesigned Air Max 2015, our most flexible, comfortable Air Max to date. We're seeing very strong response from consumers, and I'm tremendously excited about the pipeline of products in the Running category.
In Basketball, with his 10th signature shoe, Kobe Bryant returned to a low top and once again pushed the limits of design. In addition to great consumer reaction to the KOBE X, players around the NBA are wearing it for its great traction and cushioning.
And in Football, the Nike Vapor Untouchable cleat was created to provide the game's fastest players with power and precision on the field. We've had tremendous feedback on the performance and the look of the Untouchable from the athletes at both the NFL and the collegiate level.
And in Men's Training, the Nike MetCon 1, a first of its kind high-intensity training shoe that has been incredibly popular in the marketplace, and it's just a hint at what's to come in Men's Training.
These innovations each deliver a new level of performance for the athlete. However, we only truly realize our potential as a company when we continue to leverage those breakthroughs across multiple sports and categories. It's what you've seen from us time and time again. Many of our biggest footwear platforms such as Lunar and Free, Flyknit and Nike Air were initially created to solve a specific athlete need in a specific category. But now they serve as the foundation for our greatest products across multiple categories.
Similarly, in apparel, platforms such as Aeroloft and Dri-FIT, both originally introduced in Running, set the standard for thermoregulation and moisture management in multiple categories and product classifications. And our Nike Pro collection continues to drive energy in all sports, especially our Pro Bra and Tight collections for women.
Individually and collectively, our product innovation is breaking new ground across all of our categories. And as excited as we are about the technical details of these products, what's most important is how well our products are resonating with athletes and consumers, which we clearly saw in the quarter.
Innovation fuels more than product at NIKE. It also drives how we do business and how we connect with the world. In the case of our digital ecosystem, NIKE is growing a connected community of athletes all over the world. This community is seamlessly engaged with the brand not only by accepting the world's best product, but by fueling activity and improving their athletic lives. We know it's not enough to simply to interact. True connections require depth and richness. And in Q3, we strengthened these digital connections and added new dimensions to our digital ecosystem.
So how does NIKE continue to expand our digital innovation?  Well, we linked experience to commerce. We released the Nike SNKRS app during the NBA All-Star Game in New York, letting consumers on mobile devices see, share and buy our most coveted footwear products. And we broadened access. We announced several partnerships with the Nike+ Running app to let runners connect to Nike+ experiences to even more of their devices and fitness equipment. And we glow -- we grow our global reach. We added more sharing capabilities to our Nike+ Training Club app. We expanded it to 18 languages. It's work like this that will continue to power our digital experiences for years to come.
At the same time, in Q3, we continued to see tremendous growth in our e-commerce business as NIKE.com was up 42% in the quarter. Traffic and conversion both increased. And for the first time in our history, mobile traffic exceeded desktop traffic, helped in part by the introduction of our SNKRS app. And going forward, we will continue to invest in this area to best serve our consumer. 
Additionally, we'll continue to drive growth in our e-commerce business by increasing consumer access to product customization. In Q3, for example, we brought exclusive new Flyknit options to NIKEiD, giving consumers the ability to take customization to yet another level. Overall, we continue to see tremendous potential for growth in our e-commerce business as we leverage our digital platform to continue to deliver premium products, services and experiences for our consumers.
As we head into the final quarter of fiscal 2015 and beyond, I continue to see tremendous opportunity for NIKE around the world. You've heard me say many times that I see more potential for growth going forward than at any time in our history, and I certainly continue to believe that today.
While the current macro environment is challenging, it is not new to us. We have a highly experienced and aligned management team that knows how to continue to deliver profitable growth by turning challenges into opportunities. It's what we've always done in the past, and it's what you can expect from us going forward.
Thanks. And now here's Trevor."

Q3 is a great example about how the strength of the NIKE Brand drives growth around the world, even in a more challenging macro environment. As Mark mentioned, the impact of foreign exchange has intensified, and Don will talk more about our",1997,"Thanks, Mark. Q3 is a great example about how the strength of the NIKE Brand drives growth around the world, even in a more challenging macro environment. As Mark mentioned, the impact of foreign exchange has intensified, and Don will talk more about our work to mitigate those impacts. As I normally do, I'll speak to our results on a constant-currency basis. While we consider the impact of foreign exchange as part of the overall management of our business, currency-neutral results provide a clearer view of the underlying operational performance.
So let's take a look at the numbers. The NIKE Brand revenue grew 11% with strong growth in Western Europe, Greater China and the emerging markets, as well as in our Sportswear and Basketball categories. NIKE Brand DTC revenue increased 29%, driven by all concepts in all geographies. And as Mark mentioned, we also saw continued strong growth in NIKE.com. And global futures are up 11%, reflecting the strong growth despite comparisons to the prior year, which included strong World Cup demand. Excluding the impact of the World Cup, we estimate future orders would have grown in the mid-teens.
As Q3 growth -- our Q3 growth is a result of the deep relationships we've built with consumers through the category offense. Our laser focus on individual consumers strengthens our -- those connections, whether they are online, at retail or at live experiences. NIKE's consistent focus on serving the consumer through the lens of their chosen sports helps enable continued profitable growth.
What's more, only NIKE has the global scale to execute this consumer-focused strategy in markets around the world. As we further drive the category offense globally, we continue to prove our ability to connect our brands to consumers and build compelling retail destinations that elevate, segment and differentiate the markets around the globe.
To see the category offense in action, let's first take a look at 2 of our key categories: Basketball and Running. Both NIKE and the Jordan Brand continue to deliver the absolute best in Basketball, with innovative products and groundbreaking experiences. Q3 was the 14th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth for the Basketball category. And as the game expands around the globe, we continue to see amazing opportunity for growth in this important category. Q3 was a great example of the combined power of Nike Basketball and Brand Jordan to create excitement and energy in the marketplace. I was in New York City for the NBA All-Star weekend, and it was clearly an electric experience for hundreds and thousands of basketball fans who took part. All over the city, NIKE and Brand Jordan executed retail concepts and consumer experiences that showcase basketball's unique culture and passion.
Nike Basketball invited fans to visit the Zoom City Arena, offering them a chance to play on the first digital LED court in the United States. Brand Jordan transformed the Penn Pavilion into an interactive consumer experience where fans could relive Michael Jordan's iconic game-winning shots. And both brands created elevated retail executions at NIKETOWN at House of Hoops locations with Foot Locker and at pop-up locations around the city. All of this combined to deliver a truly one-of-a-kind experience for our consumers, something only NIKE can do.
In addition to delivering highly engaging consumer experiences, we continued to lead with innovative product. In the quarter, Kyrie Irving, one of the most exciting young players in the game today, became the newest signature athlete for NIKE with the launch of the KYRIE 1. Offering superior traction with the Hyperfuse construction, the KYRIE 1 is an excellent example of how we never stop improving. Also, seeing huge consumer response was the KOBE X, the most coveted shoe yet for the popular KOBE line.
Next, let's talk about Running. As you know, Running is our heritage and our largest performance category. The NIKE Brand continues to resonate with runners, fueled by the Nike+ Run Club and grassroots running events around the world. And the Running category continues to deliver strong results in key geographies, including Europe, China and the emerging markets. That said, core footwear within the Running category isn't performing as well as we would like, particularly in North America. As a result, we are highly focused on delivering new innovation into our core product offerings to ensure we continue to serve our consumer with the absolute best.
With our premium performance products, we continue to see strong sell-through for footwear styles like the Air Max 2015, the LunarTempo and the Air Zoom Pegasus 31. In addition, our premium performance apparel continues to drive growth, and we saw strong consumer response to the styles such as the new Epic Lux and the Epic Run Tights.
As part of our Amplify strategy, we leverage the heritage of our Running into Sportswear to deliver great style for consumers who appreciate the aesthetic of running. This is our complete offense in the Running category. And Running-inspired Sportswear performed exceedingly well in the quarter, led by strong consumer response to the Roshe platform and the Roshe Flyknit in particular. The Air Max 1 Collection also had strong performance in the quarter.
Looking ahead, we will continue to build on what's working in Running as we further strengthen our business to accelerate growth. We are excited to have a robust, continuous pipeline of groundbreaking footwear innovations, which we will bring to the market over the next 18 months. And we will also leverage the momentum in platforms such as the Lunar, Flyknit and our Air Max to continue to drive growth. Overall, Running continues to be a tremendous source of innovation and inspiration for NIKE and one of our key long-term growth drivers.
Let's talk about a few of our key geographies. First, North America, which delivered 6% revenue growth in the quarter. Consumer demand continues to be very strong in North America as most key categories grew and futures were up 15%. That said, revenue growth was somewhat lower than expected in the quarter due to challenges related to the port congestion on the West Coast, which escalated late in our fiscal quarter 3. As a result, some shipments originally expected for delivery in Q3 were delayed. Looking ahead, we expect revenue growth in quarter 4 to accelerate as the flow of product through the supply chain begins to normalize. However, we do expect it will take a few quarters to return to fully normalized product flow as there are a significant number of containers to be cleared from the ports on the West Coast.
To be very clear, there continues to be tremendous momentum for the NIKE Brand in North America, thanks to innovative product that continues to resonate with our consumers. And the category offense continues to help us deliver segmented and differentiated retail destinations with our wholesale partners in our stores and online. Executions such as the Fieldhouse with Dick's Sporting Goods and the House of Hoops with Foot Locker performed very well in the quarter, as did our DTC business, which delivered revenue growth of 15% and continued strong growth on NIKE.com. Overall, we continue to see tremendous potential for growth in North America as demand remains strong and our brand continues to resonate with consumers.
In Western Europe, we're seeing broad-based demand with revenue growth of 21% in the quarter. We saw growth across all categories and territories with particular strength in AGS, the U.K. and Southern Europe. A critical part of our successful growth strategy in Western Europe is the work we've done to transform the marketplace along the category offense. We continue to develop more differentiated retail executions with our wholesale partners in our stores and online while continuing to bring innovative products into the marketplace.
The JD omni-channel store at Trafford and the Pro Direct digital store in London are a great example of powerful avenues we have to differentiate the NIKE Brand. In addition, we continue to see strong performance in our stores, with DTC up 40% and strong growth on NIKE.com. It remains early days yet, but the market growth we're seeing in nearly every territory, coupled with the market share gains, prove the success of our efforts in Western Europe.
Let's turn to the emerging markets where revenue grew 12% in the quarter, with 6 of the 9 territories growing double-digits. We also saw strong growth coming from Sportswear, Running and Basketball. While we feel good about the third quarter results in the emerging markets, we do anticipate some choppiness going forward. Futures declined 6% for the period, in part the result of tough comparisons to the strong World Cup orders in the prior year. We are also taking proactive steps to reduce the supply to ensure a healthy marketplace in Mexico and Brazil, 2 of our largest territories in the emerging markets.
In Mexico, as we have discussed on previous calls, inventory levels in the marketplace were higher than we would like, largely a result of transition issues with our distribution center in early fiscal 2014. We've made significant progress in clearing the excess inventory in Mexico, and we expect to return to more normalized levels by the end of fiscal year '15. To ensure a healthy pull market, we've also worked proactively with our wholesale partners to adjust the flow of product into the marketplace, which contributes to the year-over-year decline in future orders for the emerging markets.
In Brazil, Q3 revenue growth was modest as volatile macroeconomic conditions made for a challenging operating environment. The NIKE Brand continues to be incredibly strong in Brazil, and we see great opportunity to reposition this critical market for sustainable, profitable growth. As we successfully did in North America, China and Western Europe, we will leverage the category offense to segment and differentiate our points of distribution. In doing so, we will increase the productivity and profitability of the marketplace. We will accomplish this by elevating the retail experiences for our consumers and presenting our products in more compelling and premium execution. As we start to reset the market in Brazil, we are working proactively with our wholesale partners to pace the flow of product into the market. As with Mexico, this is also contributing to the year-over-year decline in the emerging markets futures orders.
We are confident that our actions in Mexico and Brazil will help us to reach our goal of operating a healthy pull market in these important territories. And long term, we remain confident that the emerging markets geography will drive significant growth for the NIKE Brand.
Lastly, in Greater China, we continue to see the benefits of our strategy to reset the marketplace. Q3 revenue growth was 17%, and futures are up 23%. This reflects the continued strength of the NIKE Brand in the market along with our efforts to execute a more consumer-focused distribution strategy. Our wholesale partners have continued to see strong comp store growth and expanded profitability in the doors that have been re-profiled. This success aligns with the results we've seen in our own retail doors. Additionally, inventory levels in China continue to be healthy, letting us better serve the consumer and maintain a strong pull market. Given the success we've seen in the marketplace over the last several quarters, we are now focused on evolving from a reset strategy to a new normal of how we do business in China. As we look ahead, we continue to see tremendous opportunity for growth in this key geography.
Ultimately, I feel great about the results we delivered in Q3. And while we will continue to face macroeconomic challenges going forward, we know there's tremendous momentum in the marketplace. And we know the NIKE Brand continues to resonate with consumers all around the world, and we know our relentless focus on serving the consumer will keep us in the lead. We know all of this, and because we do, I personally could not be more excited about what the future holds.
Thanks. Now here's Don."

In his opening remarks, Mark spoke about the tremendous macroeconomic volatility we've seen in recent months. In particular, over the last 90 days, the U.S. dollar has appreciated against virtually every other major currency. There's no qu",1670,"Thanks, Trevor. In his opening remarks, Mark spoke about the tremendous macroeconomic volatility we've seen in recent months. In particular, over the last 90 days, the U.S. dollar has appreciated against virtually every other major currency. There's no question that this has and will continue to have an impact on multinational companies, including NIKE. We see these times as opportunities to distinguish ourselves, both in how we deliver for our consumers and how we deliver for our shareholders. The power of our brands and our portfolio, the strength of our balance sheet and the experience of our management team all give us the ability to navigate these conditions in a way few companies can.
We've always run our business to deliver appropriate near-term profitability, invest for long-term growth and manage risk. That approach hasn't changed. That doesn't mean this is business as usual. It does mean we'll use all the levers of our business to deliver profitable growth even in the face of strong macro headwinds. We'll continue to make focused investments to build strong brand connections, deliver innovative products and services and create compelling retail experiences for consumers. We'll leverage our strength with consumers to grow revenues and expand gross margins. We'll apply innovation and operational discipline to increase cost productivity. And we'll continue to deliver increasing profitability and cash returns to shareholders. We've been here before, and we're confident we have the business capabilities and momentum to deliver growth and profitability even under difficult economic circumstances.
With that introduction, I'll now recap our Q3 results. Third quarter reported revenue for NIKE, Inc. increased 7%. On a currency-neutral basis, revenue increased 13%, in line with our expectations, as the NIKE Brand grew 11% and Converse increased 33%. Also on a currency-neutral basis, NIKE Brand futures orders grew 11%, driven by a 6% increase in average selling price and a 5% increase in units. The growth reflects continued strong demand across the NIKE Brand portfolio led by double-digit growth in North America, China and Central and Eastern Europe.
From a category perspective, the growth reflected strong demand across multiple categories, including Sportswear, Basketball and Running. This overall growth is especially noteworthy given last year's robust orders in advance of the 2014 World Cup, which particularly affected futures orders in Europe and the emerging markets. As Trevor mentioned earlier, excluding the impact of World Cup, we estimate futures would have increased at a mid-teens rate. On a reported basis, futures grew 2%, reflecting weaker international currencies, particularly the euro, reais, ruble, pound and yen.
Third quarter diluted EPS increased 19% to $0.89, driven by revenue growth, gross margin expansion and a lower share count, partially offset by higher SG&A investments and a higher tax rate. In Q3, the impact of FX was insignificant as the impact of the stronger dollar was largely offset by our currency hedging programs.
Gross margin expanded 140 basis points in the quarter. The increase was driven by a continued shift to higher-margin products, partially offset by higher product input and warehousing costs.
Third quarter demand creation was flat to last year as higher investments in digital and sports marketing were largely offset by lower advertising expenses due to changes in the timing of product launches. Q3 operating overhead increased 15%, reflecting growth in our higher gross margin, higher-cost DTC business, investments in operational infrastructure and continued investments in digital, including consumer engagement.
The Q3 effective tax rate was 24.4%, a 190 basis point increase versus the prior year quarter, primarily due to the impact of tax expense on intercompany transactions, partially offset by the retroactive reinstatement of the U.S. R&D tax credit.
At the end of Q3, NIKE, Inc. inventories were up 12%, primarily driven by unit growth in North America and Europe. As Trevor mentioned earlier, our North America business was affected by congestion at West Coast ports, reducing Q3 revenue growth and increasing Q3 inventories. While we anticipate the flow of product will soon begin to return to normal, we expect we will have somewhat higher inventory levels and lower margins in North America for the next few quarters as we work to rebalance supply and demand in the market.
Now let's take a look at some of the performance highlights by segment. In North America, Q3 revenue increased 6% on both a reported and currency-neutral basis, led by Basketball and Sportswear. Direct-to-Consumer revenues grew 15%, driven by the rapid expansion of NIKE.com, 7% comp store sales growth and the addition of new stores. On a reported basis, Q3 EBIT for North America grew 14%, driven by revenue growth, gross margin expansion and SG&A leverage.
In Western Europe, Q3 revenues increased 21% on a currency-neutral basis. The growth was broad-based as nearly every territory increased at a double-digit rate and every key category grew, led by double-digit growth in Sportswear, Men's Training -- sorry, Women's Training and Running. Despite the weaker euro, reported Q3 revenue for Western Europe increased 10% and EBIT increased 22%, driven by revenue growth, gross margin expansion and SG&A leverage.
In Central and Eastern Europe, Q3 revenue increased 7% on a currency-neutral basis. Most territories delivered double-digit revenue growth, but revenues in Russia, Israel and Turkey declined. Nearly every key category expanded, led by Sportswear, Women's Training and Running. Reported revenue for CEE declined 10% and EBIT fell 35%, reflecting significantly weaker currencies, most significantly in Russia.
In Greater China, Q3 revenues increased 17% on a currency-neutral basis, led by double-digit growth in Sportswear, Basketball and Running. On a reported basis, Q3 revenue for China increased 15% while EBIT increased 7%, driven by strong revenue growth and gross margin expansion, partially offset by investments in demand creation and DTC.
In the emerging markets geography, Q3 revenue grew 12% on a currency-neutral basis, driven by strong growth in all territories except Brazil, which grew at a single-digit rate, and Mexico, which declined mid-teens. From a category perspective, the growth was led by Sportswear, Running and Basketball. On a reported basis, emerging markets revenue increased 2% and EBIT increased 3%, reflecting significant currency headwinds.
As Trevor discussed, we're seeing the results of our work to clear excess inventory in Mexico. At the same time, we're taking action to realign the Brazil marketplace along the lines of the category offense. We're confident these steps will set us up to continue to deliver sustainable, profitable growth in these territories and to the emerging markets geography as a whole.
At Converse, Q3 revenue grew 33% on a currency-neutral basis, boosted by the acceleration of Q4 shipments in advance of a major systems go live. The balance of the growth was driven by continued strength in North America, the conversion of several European markets to direct distribution and strong growth in DTC. On a reported basis, Converse revenue increased 28% and EBIT increased 23%, driven by revenue growth, partially offset by higher investments in infrastructure, DTC and demand creation to enable long-term growth.
We've seen strong momentum in our business year-to-date, and we expect that momentum to continue into Q4 and beyond. That said, FX headwinds have intensified significantly in the last 90 days, especially from the erosion of the value of the euro. While our hedging programs have significantly reduced the impact of FX on profitability, we cannot eliminate all currency risk. 
Based on what we know today, we expect the following for Q4 and full year FY '15. We expect constant dollar revenue growth for Q4 in the low-double digits, with reported revenue growth 8 to 9 points lower, reflecting the significantly stronger dollar. For the full year, we expect constant dollar revenue growth in the low-teens, with reported revenue growth 4 to 5 points lower.
We now expect Q4 gross margin to be flat to up about 25 basis points as the impact of higher closeouts, particularly in North America and Europe, largely offset the ongoing benefits of mix shifts to higher-margin products and businesses. For the full year, we now expect gross margin expansion of about 100 basis points.
We expect demand creation to decrease at a high-single digit rate for Q4 as we anniversary investments in World Cup marketing in Q4 of FY '14. For the full year, we now expect demand creation to grow at a mid-single digit rate.
We expect operating overhead to grow at a high-single to low-double digit rate for Q4 and at a mid-teens rate for the full year, reflecting higher DTC expenses, as well as investments in digital innovation and new operating capabilities.
We continue to expect the effective tax rate for FY '15 will be approximately 24.5%.
Looking ahead to FY '16, we haven't yet completed our planning but can provide some initial thoughts. We expect to see continued strong momentum in our business and anticipate currency-neutral revenue growth for FY '16, slightly above our high-single digit target range. When combined with the impact of our ongoing work to expand gross margins and ongoing investments in our growth strategies, we would have expected EPS growth at or above our long-term mid-teens target.
That said, the appreciation of the U.S. dollar against nearly every other major currency will reduce next year's reported revenue, gross margin and profit. Assuming exchange rates remain in about the same range as they are today, we expect FY '16 reported revenue growth in the mid-single digits and EPS growth in the high-single to low-double digit range. Currency markets remain volatile, so we will provide an update on our FY '16 expectations on our Q4 earnings call.
On our last conference call, I spoke about one of our NIKE maxims, and today, I'd like to highlight another. We are on the offense always. As Mark said at the outset, we view a challenging operating environment as an opportunity to create further competitive separation. By staying focused on consumers and leveraging our strengths, we're confident we can continue to deliver strong financial performance and create value for our shareholders even in a challenging macroeconomic environment.

For example, on the NFL, we've had to do some very different approaches to make sure that we're able to respond very quickly to changes in demand, whether it be for specific teams or specific athletes.

They have been -- you and the industry largely have been producing in Asia and markets where the currencies are tied to the dollar, and the dollar, as you said, has seeing unprecedented strength against all other major currencies. Is now the time to kind of accelerate the process of maybe pulling manufacturing out of some of these markets and taking manufacturing to the end markets and using some of the automated technologies to allow yourself to produce in markets -- in the end markets where the costs will be aligned, at least from a currency perspective, where the sales are?

So we're getting some of the benefit that you're talking about here of matching sourcing currencies and selling currencies even within our existing structure. The second thing is that we've adjusted -- or we do adjust payments to the factories on the basis of how those currencies move. So we are getting some offsetting sourcing benefits right now from the fact that currencies in a lot of our sourcing countries are weakening. So that helps us also net down our foreign exchange exposure. With respect to your overall premise of trying to make sure that our manufacturing is closer both in proximity and time to where the product is sold, that is absolutely part of the strategy from a consumer standpoint. So I think when you look at the financial side of it, we're getting some of the benefits that you're describing through the way we've set up our trading company.

And one of the things I want to do is maybe unpack a little bit about how we view the business. And we always talk about what we say is the amplified offense, which really gives you a greater view of the marketplace. And so when you take a look at it, you have the performance segment, you have the core segment, and you have the Running-inspired segment. And so if you break those down, in the performance segment, we're seeing tremendous success of the new parts that we've been bringing to marketplace. So we -- whether you take the Air Pegasus 31 or the Max 2015 or any of those products, they're doing really, really well. And so we feel obviously very, very confident about that. As I mentioned, in the core footwear, we think there's opportunity for us to do better in that zone. And so as Mark said, we're going to continue to bring more innovation and strengthen that part of the business. The other dimension is the Running-inspired business, which I mentioned, which are things like the Roshe, which really speak to more the aesthetic side or certainly people who like the aesthetic for the style component of Running. And that's doing really well. So all in all, the Running business core performance is where we see some challenges, but the rest of the business really continues to do really well. In addition, the apparel is also doing really, really well in the marketplace. So we feel we're connected with runners in a great way.

And we're going to pull all the levers to deliver against our goals. We do have in our expectations for FY '16 that we will continue to migrate consumers to premium. We're continuing to manage mix. And if you look at the way our business has performed over the last few years, I think we've been very successful in moving average price points higher, and we would expect to do that. What I wouldn't look for is trying to get all of a very big move in currency back in the near term with huge price increases in any one piece of geography. We play for the long term."

Before I turn the call over to Ms. Hall, let me remind you that participants on this call will make forward-looking statements based on current expectations, and those statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. These risks and uncertainties are detailed in the reports filed with the SEC, including forms 8-K, 10-K and 10-Q. 
Some forward-looking statements concern future orders that are not necessarily indicative of changes in total revenues for subsequent periods due to a mix of futures and at-once orders, exchange rate fluctuations, order cancellations, discounts and returns, which may vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter.
In addition, it is important to remember the significant portion of NIKE, Inc.'s continuing operations, including equipment, NIKE Golf, Converse and Hurley are not included in these futures numbers.
Finally, participants may discuss non-GAAP financial measures, including references to wholesale equivalent sales. References to wholesale equivalent sales are only intended to provide context as to the overall current market footprints of the brands owned by NIKE, Inc. and should not be relied upon as financial measure of actual results. 
Participants may also make references to other nonpublic financial and statistical information and non-GAAP financial measures.

We've shown once again that NIKE is a growth company. Here are the fiscal '15 highlights. NIKE, Inc. revenues grew 10% to $30.6 billion despite significant FX headwinds. On a currency-neutral basis, NIKE, Inc. revenues grew 14%. Gross margin increased 120 basis points to 46%. Earnings per share rose 25% to $3.70 and we delivered ROIC of 28%. These are the quality results that our shareholders have come to expect from us and that we demand from ourselves.
One of the reasons we're able to deliver results like these are the talented people who work at NIKE around the world. So before going on into the detail on our results, I'd like to thank one of those talented leaders, and that's Don Blair. As you all know, this will be Don's last earnings call with NIKE. And if you keep in track, it's 63 calls. During my tenure as CEO and before that as Co-President, Don has served as a trusted advisor and a valued business partner. He has helped lead the company through great times and challenging times. Always with a calm focus and level of discipline that creates confidence and insures we continue to move forward. Don will always be remembered as the creator of our long-term financial model, which guides our financial planning to this day. But more than that, Don will be remembered for the talented leaders he has developed over the years, both within finance and across the company.
I want to thank Don for his leadership and dedication to NIKE over the last 15 years, and wish him the very best in his future endeavors. Don's successor, Andy Campion, is the testament to Don's commitment to developing talent. Andy has been a great leader during his 8 years with NIKE, helping to develop the strategy that will drive NIKE's growth for years to come, and I'm confident that Andy will continue to build on the strong foundation Don has set for the company as we strive toward our full potential. Andy will assume the CFO role on August 1, and will join us on the next earnings call.
So while I'm proud of the results we delivered this last year, what sets NIKE apart is our ability to deliver sustainable, profitable growth year in and year out. It is our proven track record of driving growth under a variety of macroeconomic conditions that gives us the confidence we can deliver growth for years to come. This past fiscal year, we managed through a volatile currency environment and sharpened our focus in key markets, and we will continue to drive that same level of discipline and focus as we look ahead to fiscal year '16.
As we have consistently done in the past, we will leverage the power of the NIKE portfolio to drive growth. We have demonstrated time and again that our diverse portfolio of brands, categories, geographies and products is a competitive advantage that allows us to serve our consumer and drive growth, better than anyone else. And you can expect us to leverage our portfolio to further allot growth around the world to expand the market and increase share. And we'll do this by staying true to our commitment to the athlete and our commitment to innovation. 
I recently sat with innovation teams for an in-depth review of our future product concepts, and I can tell you, I am incredibly energized by what's to come. Today, we're pushing ourselves to create products and experiences that consumers want and some they never thought possible. The scale and pace at which we're bringing new innovations to market is unprecedented. Let me share a few examples. 
Flyknit, of course, continues to be one of NIKE's great breakthroughs for the athlete and for our company. It's created a whole new model for design and manufacturing. Instead of engineering down to the piece, we can now engineer it down to the pixel to enhance performance, aesthetics and sustainability. And the most exciting part is we're just discovering new ways to use it everyday. We've advanced Flyknit into other sports over the past few years, but there's no doubt last summer's World Cup was the launching pad for Flyknit in Global Football. More than 1/3 of the players chose to where the Magista, our first Flyknit boot, including Mario Barraza, who scored the winning goal in the World Cup final. 
When you look across our business, Flyknit's dynamic strength and lightweight benefit have been applied across our key performance categories: Running, Basketball, Men's and Women's Training as well as into premium Sportswear. With the success of Flyknit, we've been inspired to engineer new types of materials like FlyWeave. This innovative performance weaving process pushes the limits of lightweight for superior strength, and when it was introduced this year with the Jordan 29. And just a few days ago, we revealed the newest signature shoe from Kevin Durant, the KD 8, which utilizes this incredible technology. I'm very excited about the potential for FlyWeave, so keep an eye out for further innovation in this area.
We not only deliver new breakthroughs, but we also push ourselves to reinvent our most iconic products. Products in our Running category are a great example. This year, we matched Zoom Air in its 20th year with the Pegasus 31 to create the fastest, most responsive Pegasus to date. It proves that much better does not always have to be entirely new. We also continue to diversify one of our greatest collections of apparel technologies, Dri-FIT. Dri-FIT is the foundation for everything from shirts to tights, to socks and it adapts to any athlete need. Strong performance this year included Nike Pro Hyperwarm, Running Dri-FIT Knit and Running Dri-FIT Hypercool. One of this year's greatest Dri-FIT innovations was with the Nike Pro Bra Collection. With the broadest assortment of styles and sizes, we're able to provide the athlete with the right fit and support for any type of training or sports.
Finally, Dri-FIT also forms the basis for our most advanced NCAA Basketball uniforms ever. Two of our long standing partners, Duke and UConn, won the respective men's and women's national championships wearing the Nike HyperElite uniform. Our uniforms weigh only 11.4 ounces and we have set every detail from vented waistbands to laser perforations, which enhance cooling and increase mobility. The Hyper Elite truly sets the standard for Basketball apparel. It is examples like these that makes me so excited to bring the full power of NIKE's innovation and creativity to the NBA. With Nike, Jordan and Converse, we can't wait to help grow the game of Basketball even farther across our entire global reach. 
At NIKE, innovation comes in many forms and our growing digital ecosystem is a great example. Consumers are increasingly connected and utilizing premium, personal digital services. Digital is an accelerator of growth that is shaping everything we do. From building deep connections to consumers with digital services and communities to driving rapid expansion of our e-commerce business. This is all made possible because NIKE is one of the world's most engaged brands online. It's where we connect with the consumer 1-to-1 and it's where we connect people to 1 another. And we're constantly looking for new ways to seamlessly connect social platforms to commerce.
Earlier this quarter, for example, Nike Women's launched the Instagram shop, a new tool that allows users to click a photo and be taken directly to NIKE.com product pages. And just last week, we announced that we are one of the first partners to offer curated product collections through Twitter. And there are many more exciting opportunities to come in this space as the power of the NIKE Brand creates strong demand from consumers any time, anywhere on any platform.
We deepen our relationship with consumers through services like Nike+ Run Club and Nike+ Training Club that inspire and enable them to do more and get better. Our Nike+ Training Club app continues to build a motivated community of devoted athletes and now features 135 workouts and is available in 17 languages. Access to NIKE.com to Nike+ Run Club training plans brings together the best Nike expert running guidance to 1 place. There's great potential here to connect more runners to the product they need to meet their goals. And in April, we unveiled a Nike Trainer's Hub that unites the global network of elite trainers to help every athlete reach their peak potential.
We connect, motivate and inspire our community of members with great products and services because ultimately, what sets NIKE apart is our innovative product and e-commerce is rapidly expanding our ability to serve consumers with products for any sport all over the world. Fiscal '15 was a great year for NIKE.com. We delivered 51% revenue growth in Q4 with 55% growth for the full year. We saw increases in both traffic and conversion, fueled by our investments in critical infrastructure to improve the consumer experience on both desktop and mobile. And as I mentioned last quarter, our traffic on mobile has exceeded traffic on desktop, making it a very sharp point for consumer engagement going forward. 
I'm proud to say our e-commerce business surpassed $1 billion in revenue this past year, a fantastic achievement from all of our teams. But really, we're just scratching the surface of our potential in this area. Global consumer spending through e-commerce exceeds $1 trillion, a significant portion of which is done on mobile devices. Tremendous opportunity ahead for us in e-commerce.
What I would just recap is by no means an exhausted list, but it clearly shows how much ground this company can cover in just one year. And while we're pleased with this year's results, at NIKE, we're always moving forward. We are relentless in our pursuit to get better and we see opportunities that no one else can. And most importantly, we have the resources and the talented team to deliver. Fiscal '16 will be no different. We have great momentum and we will continue to drive it by growing our largest categories such as Running, Basketball, Football and our geographies such as North America, Western Europe and China. And by unlocking the areas with the greatest potential for growth such as Women's, Young Athletes and apparel, and also by accelerating new opportunities such as breakthrough technologies and product in Advanced Manufacturing and digital. 
We have one of the strongest brands in the world with the world of opportunities still ahead. And that's why fiscal '16 will be our best year yet.
Thanks, and now here's Trevor."

The NIKE Brand closed the year with a strong finish, demonstrating yet again, the power of the category offense to drive growth. On a constant currency basis, NIKE Brand revenue grew 13% for the quarter. For the year, revenue was up 14%, with double-digit growth in North America, both European geographies and China. NIKE Brand DTC revenue was up 27% for the quarter. For the year, DTC revenue was up 29%, driven by comp store growth of 16%, online growth of 59% and new stores. And finally, global futures accelerated to 13%, reflecting continued strong demand. 
The success in our business is the natural outcome of putting the consumer at the center of everything we do. Our connection with consumers strengthens our brand every day from our own retail to wholesale partners, from in-store to online, from digital experiences to unforgettable live events. It's those deep and authentic connections that power the NIKE Brand around the world.
Within our category offense, we often talk about Amplify, our Amplify strategy to compete, train and express. Sportswear represents the express portion of that equation where consumers express their love and passion for the game with premium sports-inspired products. Sportswear is a key complement to the product assortment for our performance categories, offering an opportunity to elevate the design and technical innovation in traditional Sportswear styles while also creating new ones. This growth drove tremendous growth in the Sportswear in fiscal year '15, which was up 20% for the year.
Now let's turn to a few of our performance categories. First, I'll start with Running. By serving our consumers through product innovation and consumer engagement, we drove growth in this important category with revenue up 9% for the year to nearly $5 billion. Our premium performance footwear continues to resonate with runners, led by the Air Zoom Pegasus 31 and the FlyKnit Lunar 3, and our premium Sportswear styles such as the Air Max 1 and the Roshe, also continue to drive growth. 
We saw a return to growth in our core Running footwear across all markets, including North America. Core Running footwear consists of our products at midtier price zones. This return to growth was led by core performance styles like the downshifter and the wind flow, which features Zoom Air technology. As we continued to drive innovation, Running apparel was once again a key growth driver, led by the continued success of our Dri-FIT Knit tops and our Epic Lux tights. And more than ever, we're expanding our overall Running business by inspiring new generations of runners every day. As Mark discussed, given runners the knowledge and tools they need through digital services have helped to create deeper, meaningful relationships. The opportunity to build new connections with our Nike+ community are virtually unlimited, as we add even more exclusive experiences like special product launches and Running events.
Nike Basketball, which in fiscal year '15, grew 21% to nearly $4 billion. Our Basketball business fueled the strength of our brand and our product innovations has never been stronger. This year, as always, we launched incredibly innovative products for our consumers. Nike Basketball introduced great footwear such as the Lebron 12, completely redesigned to deliver precision and explosive performance and the KYRIE 1, the first signature shoe for this dynamic and exciting young player. And in Jordan -- and in the Jordan Brand, we introduced the Air Jordan 29, the lightest Air Jordan performance shoe ever and the Superfly 3, which employed NIKE's Zoom technology for lightweight, durable cushioning. 
What's more, every year, Nike Basketball and the Jordan Brand put on great consumer experiences and fiscal year '15 was no exception. Standout examples include last quarter's NBA All-Star weekend in New York and the Nike World Basketball Festival in Spain last September was a great example. These events showcase the tremendous combined power of the 2 great Basketball brands, something only Nike can offer. Nike Basketball and Jordan are driving the kind of energy that excites current fans and brings a new ones, growing the market today and into the future. And as Mark mentioned, our partnership with the NBA gives us tremendous opportunity to grow this sport. It's a platform for true innovation, not just for our products, but also for the many ways we can serve our consumers. This partnership will let us share our passion for Basketball in exciting places like Rio to Beijing, to Barcelona. The energy around Basketball is at an all-time high, and we're excited to accelerate its growth around the globe.
Finally, our Women's business continue to drive strong growth. For the year, revenue grew 20% to nearly $6 billion. The strong growth in our Women's business is driven by the innovation and style we bring to the products that matter most to these athletes. Key apparel styles such as the Nike Pro Bra Collection and broad assortments of tights are resonating strongly with consumers and creating excitement in the marketplace. In Q4, we released our biggest ever market initiative for women called Better For It, which in just 2 months, have totaled more than 18 million online views. Better For It resonated with consumers because it wasn't just a campaign. It was a call to action for all athletes to push themselves to be their best. And it was served by the global community of women who interact with NIKE and each other every day for inspiration.
Our new Women's omni-door in London, along with our newly reopened Santa Monica store, exemplify the focus on providing products and services specifically for women. We've also continued to increase the number of stores with premium services such as bra fitting, analysis and pam hemming. That success is mirrored by the strong growth in our Women's business on NIKE.com, which exceeded both man and the total NIKE Brand in the quarter. All told, our work, both in-store and online, is helping to drive strong growth in our overall Women's business.
Now let's talk about a few of our geographies. North America had a great quarter and another remarkable year. Revenues were up 14% for the quarter and 12% for the year despite the headwind from the West Coast port congestion. Growth in the quarter was driven by nearly every key category. We saw continued strong performance from DTC, which grew 13% in the quarter with NIKE.com growing 31%. This performance was complemented by strong executions with our wholesale partners such as the Fieldhouse with Dick's Sporting Goods, House of Hoops with Foot Locker and the Track Club with the Finish Line. 
In Q4, we also remained focused on working through the impact of the West Coast port congestion by diverting some shipments to alternative ports and shipping select products via air freight. As expected, product loads began to normalize in Q4, but we expect it will take a couple of quarters before product flow fully returns to normal. That said, we continue to see great demand for our products in the marketplace and expect to efficiently move through the inventory and maintain a healthy pull market.
We continue to see incredible potential for growth in North America and the reason is simple and familiar. We remain focused on the consumer, delivering innovative products and services through compelling retail experiences. This allows us to expand the market while also taking market share.
Now let's turn to Western Europe, where we're seeing broad-based demand with growth of 17% in the quarter and 21% for the year. Growth in the quarter and throughout the year was fueled by our continued efforts to transform the marketplace in line with the category offense. We saw a strong growth across most key categories, led by Sportswear, Running, Women's Training and Basketball, and in the territories, particularly in AGS, that's Austria, Germany and Switzerland as well as in the U.K. and Ireland. Our execution with our wholesale partners such as JD Sports, Foot Locker and Intersport all performed well in the quarter, as did our own DTC, which had revenue growth of 39%. 
The momentum we've seen in fiscal year '15 in Western Europe, combined with the strength of the NIKE Brand, reinforces our view that there is tremendous growth potential in this important geography. Our focus on the consumer will continue to build on that momentum as we head into fiscal year '16 and beyond.
Now let's turn to the emerging markets. Where quarter 4, revenue declined 3% due in part to comparisons to strong World Cup results last year as well as actions we're taking in Mexico and Brazil to ensure healthy marketplace. For the full year, revenue grew by 8%. For the quarter, we saw 7 of the 9 territories grow, with 6 growing at a double-digit rate. The NIKE Brand continues to be very strong in the emerging markets and our products are resonating with consumers across all territories.
Let's take a closer look at 2 of these territories. In Mexico, we've been actively working to clear excess inventory, which resulted primarily from a distribution center transition in fiscal year '14. Our brand remains very strong, and we're seeing accelerated growth in retail sales. As a result, we're now returning to more normalized inventory levels as of the end of fiscal year '15. We continue to work with our wholesale partners to ensure a healthy pull market in Mexico and we feel confident that the market is now well-positioned for profitable growth.
In Brazil, Q4 revenue was down about 20%, reflecting comparisons to strong World Cup sales in the prior year as well as weak macroeconomic environment. At the same time, we continue to take steps to proactively manage the supply of product in the marketplace. The NIKE Brand remains incredibly strong in Brazil and we continue to see tremendous opportunity for sustainable, profitable growth. To realize this opportunity, we are leveraging the category offense to segment and differentiate our points of distribution. We are confident that these steps will offer our consumers more premium and compelling retail experiences while increasing the productivity and profitability of the market for our wholesale partners and our business.
And finally, in China, where Q4 revenue grew 20%, and we posted a full year growth of 19%. Our strong growth in the quarter was driven primarily by Running, Basketball and Sportswear. For our wholesale partners, doors that have been reprofiled continue to outperform the rest of the fleet and in DTC, we saw a growth of 52%, with continued strong growth in our stores as well as online.
In China, the NIKE Brand is incredibly strong, which provided the foundation to reset the market in line with the category offense. Our strong results throughout fiscal year '15 demonstrated that our strategy has paid off. We returned to strong revenue growth. We've improved profitability and productivity for ourselves and our wholesale partners and inventory in the marketplace is healthy. Going forward, we will leverage the momentum from fiscal year '15 and continue to execute this consumer-led strategy to drive sustainable, profitable growth in this key geography.
At NIKE, viewing sports through the eyes of the consumer isn't just a strategy. It's our obsession. We know what our consumers want and we deliver it. Innovative products, personalized services, unforgettable experiences and the inspiration to go after their biggest goals. And serving our consumers means we lead every day. Our consumer focus, in short, will be out in front in Q4. And in short, it will be out in front in fiscal year '15 and it insurers we'll be out in front in fiscal year '16 and beyond.
Before I hand over to Don, I also want to take a moment to thank him for his hard work and his partnership over the years. Don is an all-star CFO and a great leader for this company, who's work created a foundation of excellence for all those around him. I don't know where the CFO Hall of Fame is located, but Don, you deserve a plaque in it. Thanks for everything. Thanks for your friendship. Over to you."

FY '15's results demonstrated our ability to deliver profitable growth even in a challenging macro environment. We did it by focusing on the fundamentals, building deep connections with consumers and delivering innovative products through a compelling retail experiences. At the same time, we leveraged our global portfolio to manage risk while continuing to invest for future growth and profitability. Our ability to use all the levers in our business to drive growth and manage risk is one of our greatest advantages, and it's why we're confident in our ability to continue to deliver shareholder value all into the future.
So on to the details for Q4 and FY '15. Q4 revenue for NIKE, Inc. increased 5%, up 13% on a currency-neutral basis. For the full year, NIKE, Inc. revenue increased 10% to $30.6 billion. On a currency-neutral basis, both NIKE, Inc. and the NIKE Brand grew 14%, while Converse grew 21%. Growth on the NIKE Brand was broad-based across categories and driven by continued strong performance in 3 of our largest geographies: North America, Western Europe and China.
Also on a currency-neutral basis, NIKE Brand futures orders grew 13%, driven by a 5% increase in average selling price and an 8% increase in units. The growth reflects continued strong demand across the NIKE Brand portfolio, led by double-digit growth in North America, Western Europe and China. On a reported basis, futures grew 2%, reflecting weaker international currencies, particularly the euro, ruble, real and yen.
Fourth quarter diluted EPS increased 26% to $0.98, and full year diluted EPS rose 25% to $3.70, driven by revenue growth, gross margin expansion and a lower tax rate, partially offset by higher SG&A investments. The effects of FX on the quarter and the year were fairly modest as the negative impact of the stronger dollar was largely offset by our FX risk management.
Gross margin expanded 60 basis points in Q4 and 120 basis points for the full year. For both the quarter and the full year, margin expansion was primarily driven by higher average selling prices and continued growth in our higher-margin DTC business, partially offset by higher cost of goods due to labor inflation and higher logistics costs.
Fourth quarter demand creation was 7% below the prior year quarter, which included significant World Cup related expenses. For the full year, demand creation increased 6%, driven by support for key events and product launches, DTC and investments in sports marketing. Operating overhead increased 13% for the quarter and 16% for the full year. This reflected growth on our higher gross margin, higher cost DTC business as well as investments in operational infrastructure and digital, including consumer engagement.
The effective tax rate for FY '15 was 22.2%, lower than last year's 24% rate, primarily due to favorable resolution of tax audits across multiple jurisdictions. The rate was significantly lower in Q4, primarily due to adjustments to reduce tax expense recognized in interim quarters of FY '15 on intercompany transactions. We continue to deliver strong returns on capital as FY '15 ROIC reached 28.1%, up 360 basis points from the prior year. For the year, we returned $3.4 billion in cash to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends.
As of May 31, inventories were up 10%, primarily driven by business growth and the impact of port congestion in North America. As we discussed last quarter, we anticipate the flow of product in North America to return to normal in the first half of FY '16. We expect inventory levels to be somewhat elevated for the next several quarters as we work to rebalance supply and demand in the market.
Now let's look at our performance by segment. North America delivered another remarkable year as FY '15 revenue grew 12% to $13.7 billion, the fifth consecutive year of double-digit revenue. Growth for the year was driven by higher revenues in nearly every key category, led by double-digit growth in Basketball, Sportswear and Women's Training. The growth also reflected strength in both sales to wholesale customers and DTC. Sustained, broad-based growth at this level in a market as developed as North America, demonstrates both the tremendous strength of the NIKE Brand and the effectiveness of the category offense in expanding both the market and our market share.
North America EBIT grew 18% for the full year, driven by strong revenue growth and gross margin expansion. Western Europe also had a great year, as FY '15 revenue reached $5.7 billion, up 15% despite the weakness of the euro. On a currency-neutral basis, revenue grew 21% for FY '15 as every territory grew and we posted double-digit growth in every key category except Golf and Global Football, which grew at a high single-digit rate despite tough comparisons against the World Cup last year. Western Europe EBIT increased 49% in FY '15, driven by revenue growth, gross margin expansion and SG&A leverage.
In Central and Eastern Europe, FY '15 revenue grew 15% on a currency-neutral basis, driven by growth in every territory except Israel, and every key category except Action Sports and Global Football, which declined at a low-single digit rate, reflecting comparisons to last year's World Cup. On a reported basis, FY '15 revenue for CEE grew 2% and EBIT declined 11%, largely reflecting significantly weaker currencies especially the ruble.
In FY '15, China returned to strong, profitable growth as revenues topped $3 billion, up 18% for the year. On a currency-neutral basis, FY '15 revenue grew 19%, driven by the ongoing strength of the brand, a more category assortment tailored for China and new retail formats, including NIKE.com. In addition to driving revenue growth, we've sharply reduced inventory levels in the market and significantly increased the productivity and profitability of retail for NIKE and our wholesale partners. FY '15 EBIT for China grew 22% due to strong revenue growth and expanding gross margins.
In Japan, currency-neutral revenue grew 9% for the year and 19% for the quarter, driven by strong growth in Sportswear, Basketball and Running. Reported results in Japan were significantly reduced by the weaker yen as FY '15 revenue declined 2% and EBIT fell 24%.
In our emerging markets geography, results were mixed. On a currency-neutral basis, FY '15 revenue increased 8%, but Q4 revenue fell 3%. Nearly every key category grew for the year and the quarter. Sportswear, Running and Basketball led the growth for the year, while Global Football declined for both periods as we lapsed strong sales in advance of last year's World Cup. For the year and the quarter, we posted strong currency neutral revenue growth in most territories, led by Soco, Pacific, Korea and Southeast Asia, while revenues in Mexico and Brazil declined for both periods.
As Trevor discussed, we're clearing the excess inventory in Mexico and feel confident the market is now positioned for profitable growth. In Brazil, a weakening macroeconomic environment and changes in the retail marketplace have led to a slowdown in our business. In response, we're taking strong steps to tighten the supply of products as we work to reprofile the marketplace along the lines of the category offense. We're confident we're taking the right actions now to position this market for renewed growth.
FY '15 reported growth for our emerging markets geography was affected by both the marketplace actions we've taken in Mexico and Brazil as well as significant currency headwinds across the region. On a reported basis, FY '15 revenue decreased 1% and EBIT decreased 14%, reflecting lower gross margins and SG&A deleverage.
Converse continues to deliver strong growth as FY '15 revenues reached nearly $2 billion, up 21% on a constant currency basis. The growth was driven by the conversion of several European markets to direct distribution and ongoing strength in the United States. On a reported basis, revenue grew 18% for the year, but only 6% for the quarter as we shifted customer shipments to Q3 in advance of the systems implementation.
EBIT increased 4% for the year, but declined 15% for the fourth quarter as revenue growth was offset by SG&A investments in market transitions, Converse and Converse IP enforcement as well as new systems and infrastructure. In FY '15, NIKE, Inc. delivered strong growth and we had great momentum across the portfolio. Our FY '16 guidance reflects that momentum as well as continued investment in our growth strategies and operational capabilities. While currency markets remain volatile, our growth rate expectations for FY '16 are largely unchanged from what we shared last quarter even though we delivered stronger performance in FY '15 than we expected 90 days ago. 
Specifically, for FY '16, we expect reported revenue growth at a mid-single-digit rate, reflecting low-double digit growth on a currency-neutral basis, partially offset by the impact of the stronger dollar. For Q1, we expect low single-digit reported revenue growth, roughly in line with reported futures growth as FX comparisons are more challenging in the first half of the fiscal year.
We expect gross margin for Q1 and the full year to expand by about 50 basis points, driven by higher average selling prices and rapid growth in our DTC business, including NIKE.com. We also expect to see some benefit from lower oil prices. However, these upsides will be partially offset by ongoing labor cost inflation, higher prices for some raw materials and FX headwinds. For SG&A, including both demand creation and operating overhead, we expect full year growth at a mid-single-digit rate.
For Q1, we expect growth slightly lower than the full year rate as we anniversary World Cup investments in the first quarter of FY '15. We anticipate other income will have a more meaningful impact in our FY '16 results than we've seen historically as a portion of our expected FX hedge gains will be reported in this line item. We currently expect other income will be approximately $50 million for each quarter. For FY '16, we expect the effective tax rate will be approximately 24%.
Before I open the call to questions, I'd like to share a few reflections on my nearly 16 years with NIKE. First, I'd like to thank Mark and Trevor for their kind words today as well as their support and partnership over the years. It's been a privilege to work closely with you both, as well as the rest of the tremendously talented leadership team that has led and will continue to lead NIKE into the future. 
I'm incredibly proud of the results we've delivered and the value we've created for our shareholders. The company today is stronger, more diversified, more profitable and better positioned to drive growth than at any time in our history. Our brands are deeply connected with consumers around the world. We're delivering unmatched innovation and we've become highly effective at creating compelling retail experiences online and in-store across wholesale and DTC. We're better operators than we've ever been and our people are the most talented the industry. That's why I know NIKE will continue to drive profitable growth and shareholder value for years to come.
Finally, I'd like to congratulate Andy on his promotion to the CFO role. I've worked closely with him over the last 8 years and have great confidence in his ability to help lead the company toward its full potential. Andy is a strategic leader with a clear passion for our brands, our business and most importantly, delivering strong results for our shareholders. And he'll be supported by the finest team of financial executives I know. While it won't be easy to depart at the end of October, I know I leave the company and the finance function in good shape and in good hands. 
Thank you, and now we'd like to open it up for questions."

And what we are doing very well is we are connecting very well with runners in the marketplace, so we continue to feel very confident about the business and at the same time, what we have seen is the strengthening in the core as we discussed, which is really about the mid-price -- the midpriced tier zone. And what we've done there is certainly, we've gone in zone there and we've always talked about diving in deeper. That's a great example. We've gone in deeper and focused on that. At the same time, I feel very confident about the innovation that is coming and that has been delivered and continues to be in the pipeline for Running. So overall, I'm very confident about the Running business. There's always room for opportunity and more growth and obviously, for us to continue to excite our consumers.

We are in the middle -- Don has mentioned this briefly, but scaling our Advanced Manufacturing initiatives, which we've really been working on over the past 3 or 4 years. So you're going to start to see those scale. But the opportunity to get some -- translate some duty relief into investing in our Advanced Manufacturing supply chain efforts here in the United States is going to be significant. We hope, I mean that's our goal, so that the ideas that, that will accelerate and we'll see some real benefits from that. I think you're going to see the overall supply chain geographically shift a bit here and there, with the advancements of new manufacturing, innovation that is a major priority for NIKE. It will give us the flexibility to create more localized manufacturing over time, and that will put us closer to market.

But our ability to drive more conversion in the stores where we currently exist still is taking place. So we've been able to increase the sell-through within our own doors.

Before I turn the call over to Ms. Hall, let me remind you that participants on this call will make forward-looking statements based on current expectations, and those statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. These risks and uncertainties are detailed in the reports filed with the SEC, including forms 8-K, 10-K and 10-Q. 
Some forward-looking statements concern future orders that are not necessarily indicative of changes in total revenues for subsequent periods due to a mix of futures and at-once orders, exchange rate fluctuations, order cancellations, changes in the timing of shipments, discounts and returns, which may vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter.
In addition, it is important to remember the significant portion of NIKE, Inc.'s continuing operations, including equipment, NIKE Golf, Converse and Hurley, are not included in these futures numbers.
Finally, participants may discuss non-GAAP financial measures, including references to wholesale equivalent sales. References to wholesale equivalent sales are only intended to provide context as to the overall current market footprint of the brands owned by NIKE, Inc. and should not be relied upon as a financial measure of actual results. 
Participants may also make references to other nonpublic financial and statistical information and non-GAAP financial measures.

We've shown once again that NIKE is a growth company. 
Here are the fiscal '15 highlights. NIKE, Inc. revenues grew 10% to $30.6 billion despite significant FX headwinds. On a currency-neutral basis, NIKE, Inc. revenues grew 14%. Gross margin increased 120 basis points to 46%. Earnings per share rose 25% to $3.70 and we delivered ROIC of 28%. These are the quality results that our shareholders have come to expect from us and that we demand from ourselves.
One of the reasons we're able to deliver results like these are the talented people who work at NIKE around the world. So before going on into the detail on our results, I'd like to thank one of those talented leaders, and that's Don Blair. As you all know, this will be Don's last earnings call with NIKE. And if you're keeping track, it's 63 calls. 
During my tenure as CEO and before that as Co-President, Don has served as a trusted advisor and a valued business partner. He has helped lead the company through great times and challenging times, always with a calm focus and level of discipline that creates confidence and insures we continue to move forward. 
Don will always be remembered as the creator of our long-term financial model, which guides our financial planning to this day. But more than that, Don will be remembered for the talented leaders he has developed over the years, both within finance and across the company.
I want to thank Don for his leadership and dedication to NIKE over the last 15 years, and wish him the very best in his future endeavors. Don's successor, Andy Campion, is a testament to Don's commitment to developing talent. Andy has been a great leader during his 8 years with NIKE, helping to develop the strategy that will drive NIKE's growth for years to come, and I'm confident that Andy will continue to build on the strong foundation Don has set for the company as we strive toward our full potential. Andy will assume the CFO role on August 1 and will join us on the next earnings call.
So while I'm proud of the results we delivered this last year, what sets NIKE apart is our ability to deliver sustainable, profitable growth year in and year out. It is our proven track record of driving growth under a variety of macroeconomic conditions that gives us the confidence we can deliver growth for years to come. This past fiscal year, we managed through a volatile currency environment and sharpened our focus in key markets, and we will continue to drive that same level of discipline and focus as we look ahead to fiscal year '16.
As we have consistently done in the past, we will leverage the power of the NIKE portfolio to drive growth. We have demonstrated time and again that our diverse portfolio of brands, categories, geographies and products is a competitive advantage that allows us to serve our consumer and drive growth better than anyone else. And you can expect us to leverage our portfolio to further allot growth around the world to expand the market and increase share. And we'll do this by staying true to our commitment to the athlete and our commitment to innovation. 
I recently sat with the innovation teams for an in-depth review of our future product concepts, and I can tell you, I am incredibly energized by what's to come. Today we are pushing ourselves to create products and experiences that consumers want and some they never thought possible. The scale and pace at which we are bringing new innovations to market is unprecedented. Let me share a few examples. 
Flyknit, of course, continues to be one of NIKE's great breakthroughs for the athlete and for our company. It's created a whole new model for design and manufacturing. Instead of engineering down to the piece, we can now engineer it down to the pixel to enhance performance, aesthetics and sustainability. And the most exciting part is we're just discovering new ways to use it every day. We've advanced Flyknit into other sports over the past few years, but there's no doubt last summer's World Cup was the launching pad for Flyknit in Global Football. More than 1/3 of the players chose to wear the Magista, our first Flyknit boot, including Mario Götze, who scored the winning goal in the World Cup final. 
When you look across our business, Flyknit's dynamic strength and lightweight benefits have been applied across our key performance categories: Running, Basketball, Men's and Women's Training as well as into premium Sportswear. 
With the success of Flyknit, we've been inspired to engineer new types of materials like Flyweave. This innovative performance weaving process pushes the limits of lightweight with superior strength, and it was introduced this year with the Jordan 29. And just a few days ago, we revealed the newest signature shoe from Kevin Durant, the KD8, which utilizes this incredible technology. I'm very excited about the potential for Flyweave, so keep an eye out for further innovation in this area.
We not only deliver new breakthroughs, but we also push ourselves to reinvent our most iconic products. Products in our Running category are a great example. This year, we matched Zoom Air in its 20th year with the Pegasus 31 to create the fastest, most responsive Pegasus to date. It proves that much better does not always have to be entirely new. 
We also continue to diversify one of our greatest collections of apparel technologies, Dri-FIT. Dri-FIT is the foundation for everything from shirts to tights, to socks, and it adapts to any athlete need. Strong performance this year included Nike Pro Hyperwarm, Running Dri-FIT Knit and Running Dri-FIT Hypercool. 
One of this year's greatest Dri-FIT innovations was with the Nike Pro Bra Collection. With the broadest assortment of styles and sizes, we're able to provide the athlete with the right fit and support for any type of training or sports.
Finally, Dri-FIT also forms the basis for our most advanced NCAA basketball uniforms ever. Two of our longstanding partners, Duke and UConn, won the respective men's and women's national championships wearing the Nike Hyper Elite uniform. Our uniforms weigh only 11.4 ounces, and we have set every detail from vented waistbands to laser perforations, which enhance cooling and increase mobility. The Hyper Elite truly sets the standard for basketball apparel. 
It is examples like these that makes me so excited to bring the full power of NIKE's innovation and creativity to the NBA. With Nike, Jordan and Converse, we can't wait to help grow the game of Basketball even farther across our entire global reach. 
At NIKE, innovation comes in many forms and our growing digital ecosystem is a great example. Consumers are increasingly connected and utilizing premium, personal digital services. Digital is an accelerator of growth that is shaping everything we do, from building deep connections to consumers with digital services and communities to driving rapid expansion of our e-commerce business. This is all made possible because NIKE is one of the world's most engaged brands online. It's where we connect with the consumer 1-to-1 and it's where we connect people to one another. And we're constantly looking for new ways to seamlessly connect social platforms to commerce.
Earlier this quarter, for example, Nike Women launched the Instagram shop, a new tool that allows users to click a photo and be taken directly to NIKE.com product pages. And just last week, we announced that we are one of the first partners to offer curated product collections through Twitter. And there are many more exciting opportunities to come in this space as the power of the NIKE Brand creates strong demand from consumers any time, anywhere on any platform.
We deepen our relationship with consumers through services like Nike+ Run Club and Nike+ Training Club that inspire and enable them to do more and get better. Our Nike+ Training Club app continues to build a motivated community of devoted athletes and now features 135 workouts and is available in 17 languages. Access for NIKE.com to Nike+ Run Club training plans brings together the best Nike expert running guidance to one place. There's great potential here to connect more runners to the product they need to meet their goals. And in April, we unveiled a Nike Trainer's Hub that unites the global network of elite trainers to help every athlete reach their peak potential.
We connect, motivate and inspire our community of members with great products and services because ultimately, what sets NIKE apart is our innovative product, and e-commerce is rapidly expanding our ability to serve consumers with products for any sport all over the world. 
Fiscal '15 was a great year for NIKE.com. We delivered 51% revenue growth in Q4 with 55% growth for the full year. We saw increases in both traffic and conversion, fueled by our investments in critical infrastructure to improve the consumer experience on both desktop and mobile. And as I mentioned last quarter, our traffic on mobile has exceeded traffic on desktop, making it a very sharp point for consumer engagement going forward. 
I'm proud to say our e-commerce business surpassed $1 billion in revenue this past year, a fantastic achievement from all of our teams. But really, we're just scratching the surface of our potential in this area. Global consumer spending through e-commerce exceeds $1 trillion, a significant portion of which is done on mobile devices. Tremendous opportunity ahead for us in e-commerce.
What I just recapped is by no means an exhausted list, but it clearly shows how much ground this company can cover in just 1 year. And while we're pleased with this year's results, at NIKE, we're always moving forward. We are relentless in our pursuit to get better and we see opportunities that no one else can. And most importantly, we have the resources and the talented team to deliver. 
Fiscal '16 will be no different. We have great momentum and we will continue to drive it by growing our largest categories such as Running, Basketball, Football and our geographies such as North America, Western Europe and China. And by unlocking the areas with the greatest potential for growth such as Women's, Young Athletes and apparel, and also by accelerating new opportunities such as breakthrough technologies and product in advanced manufacturing and digital. 
We have one of the strongest brands in the world with the world of opportunities still ahead. And that's why fiscal '16 will be our best year yet.
Thanks, and now here's Trevor."

The NIKE Brand closed the year with a strong finish, demonstrating yet again the power of the category offense to drive growth. On a constant currency basis, NIKE Brand revenue grew 13% for the quarter. For the year, revenue was up 14%, with double-digit growth in North America, both European geographies and China. 
NIKE Brand DTC revenue was up 27% for the quarter. For the year, DTC revenue was up 29%, driven by comp store growth of 16%, online growth of 59% and new stores. And finally, global futures accelerated to 13%, reflecting continued strong demand. 
The success in our business is a natural outcome of putting the consumer at the center of everything we do. Our connection with consumers strengthens our brand every day from our own retail to wholesale partners, from in-store to online, from digital experiences to unforgettable live events. It's those deep and authentic connections that power the NIKE Brand around the world.
Within our category offense, we often talk about Amplify -- our Amplify strategy to compete, train and express. Sportswear represents the express portion of that equation, where consumers express their love and passion for the game with premium sports-inspired products. Sportswear is a key complement to the product assortment for our performance categories, offering an opportunity to elevate the design and technical innovation in traditional Sportswear styles while also creating new ones. This drove tremendous growth in the Sportswear in fiscal year '15, which was up 20% for the year.
Now let's turn to a few of our performance categories. First, I'll start with Running. By serving our consumers through product innovation and consumer engagement, we drove growth in this important category with revenue up 9% for the year to nearly $5 billion. Our premium performance footwear continues to resonate with runners, led by the Air Zoom Pegasus 31 and the FlyKnit Lunar 3, and our premium Sportswear styles such as the Air Max 1 and the Roshe, also continued to drive growth. 
We saw a return to growth in our core Running footwear across all markets, including North America. Core Running footwear consists of our products at mid-tier price zones. This return to growth was led by core performance styles like the Downshifter and the Wind Flow, which features Zoom Air technology. 
As we continued to drive innovation, Running apparel was once again a key growth driver, led by the continued success of our Dri-FIT Knit tops and our Epic Lux tights. 
And more than ever, we're expanding our overall Running business by inspiring new generations of runners every day. As Mark discussed, giving runners the knowledge and tools they need through digital services has helped to create deeper, meaningful relationships. The opportunities to build new connections with our Nike+ community are virtually unlimited, as we add even more exclusive experiences like special product launches and Running events.
Nike Basketball, which in fiscal year '15, grew 21% to nearly $4 billion. Our Basketball business fueled the strength of our brand and our product innovation has never been stronger. 
This year, as always, we launched incredibly innovative products for our consumers. Nike Basketball introduced great footwear such as the LeBron 12, completely redesigned to deliver precision and explosive performance, and the KYRIE 1, the first signature shoe for this dynamic and exciting young player. And in the Jordan Brand, we introduced the Air Jordan 29, the lightest Air Jordan performance shoe ever, and the Super.Fly 3, which employs NIKE's Zoom technology for lightweight, durable cushioning. 
What's more, every year, Nike Basketball and the Jordan Brand put on great consumer experiences and fiscal year '15 was no exception. Standout examples include last quarter's NBA All-Star weekend in New York and the Nike World Basketball Festival in Spain last September was a great example. These events showcase the tremendous combined power of the 2 great basketball brands, something only Nike can offer. 
Nike Basketball and Jordan are driving the kind of energy that excites current fans and brings in new ones, growing the market today and into the future. And as Mark mentioned, our partnership with the NBA gives us tremendous opportunity to grow this sport. It's a platform for true innovation, not just for our products, but also for the many ways we can serve our consumers. This partnership will let us share our passion for Basketball in exciting places like Rio to Beijing, to Barcelona. The energy around Basketball is at an all-time high, and we're excited to accelerate its growth around the globe.
Finally, our Women's business continues to drive strong growth. For the year, revenue grew 20% to nearly $6 billion. The strong growth in our Women's business is driven by the innovation and style we bring to the products that matter most to these athletes. Key apparel styles such as the Nike Pro Bra Collection and broad assortments of tights are resonating strongly with consumers and creating excitement in the marketplace. In Q4, we released our biggest ever market initiative for women called Better For It, which in just 2 months, has totaled more than 18 million online views. Better For It resonated with consumers because it wasn't just a campaign. It was a call to action for all athletes to push themselves to be their best. And it was served by the global community of women who interact with NIKE and each other every day for inspiration.
Our new Women's omni-door [ph] in London, along with our newly reopened Santa Monica store, exemplify the focus on providing products and services specifically for women. We've also continued to increase the number of stores with premium services such as bra fitting, gait analysis and pant hemming. That success is mirrored by the strong growth in our Women's business on NIKE.com, which exceeded both Men and the total NIKE Brand in the quarter. All told, our work, both in-store and online is helping to drive strong growth in our overall Women's business.
Now let's talk about a few of our geographies. North America had a great quarter and another remarkable year. Revenues were up 14% for the quarter and 12% for the year despite the headwind from the West Coast port congestion. Growth in the quarter was driven by nearly every key category. We saw continued strong performance from DTC, which grew 13% in the quarter with NIKE.com growing 31%. This performance was complemented by strong executions with our wholesale partners such as the Fieldhouse with Dick's Sporting Goods, House of Hoops with Foot Locker and the Track Club with the Finish Line. 
In Q4, we also remained focused on working through the impact of the West Coast port congestion by diverting some shipments to alternative ports and shipping select products via air freight. As expected, product flows began to normalize in Q4, but we expect it will take a couple of quarters before product flow fully returns to normal. That said, we continue to see great demand for our products in the marketplace and expect to efficiently move through the inventory and maintain a healthy pull market.
We continue to see incredible potential for growth in North America and the reason is simple and familiar. We remain focused on the consumer, delivering innovative products and services through compelling retail experiences. This allows us to expand the market while also taking market share.
Now let's turn to Western Europe, where we're seeing broad-based demand with growth of 17% in the quarter and 21% for the year. Growth in the quarter and throughout the year was fueled by our continued efforts to transform the marketplace in line with the category offense. We saw strong growth across most key categories, led by Sportswear, Running, Women's Training and Basketball, and in the territories, particularly in AGS, that's Austria, Germany and Switzerland, as well as in the U.K. and Ireland. Our execution with our wholesale partners such as JD Sports, Foot Locker and Intersport all performed well in the quarter, as did our own DTC, which had revenue growth of 39%. 
The momentum we've seen in fiscal year '15 in Western Europe, combined with the strength of the NIKE Brand, reinforces our view that there is tremendous growth potential in this important geography. Our focus on the consumer will continue to build on that momentum as we head into fiscal year '16 and beyond.
 
Now let's turn to the emerging markets, where quarter 4, revenue declined 3% due in part to comparisons to strong World Cup results last year as well as actions we're taking in Mexico and Brazil to ensure healthy marketplace. For the full year, revenue grew by 8%. For the quarter, we saw 7 of the 9 territories grow, with 6 growing at a double-digit rate. The NIKE Brand continues to be very strong in the emerging markets and our products are resonating with consumers across all territories.
Let's take a closer look at 2 of these territories. In Mexico, we've been actively working to clear excess inventory, which resulted primarily from a distribution center transition in fiscal year '14. Our brand remains very strong, and we're seeing accelerated growth in retail sell-through. As a result, we're now returning to more normalized inventory levels as of the end of fiscal year '15. We continue to work with our wholesale partners to ensure a healthy pull market in Mexico and we feel confident that the market is now well-positioned for profitable growth.
In Brazil, Q4 revenue was down about 20%, reflecting comparisons to strong World Cup sales in the prior year as well as weak macroeconomic environment. At the same time, we continue to take steps to proactively manage the supply of product in the marketplace. The NIKE Brand remains incredibly strong in Brazil and we continue to see tremendous opportunity for sustainable, profitable growth. 
To realize this opportunity, we are leveraging the category offense to segment and differentiate our points of distribution. We are confident that these steps will offer our consumers more premium and compelling retail experiences while increasing the productivity and profitability of the market for our wholesale partners and our business.
And finally, in China, where Q4 revenue grew 20%, and we posted a full year growth of 19%. Our strong growth in the quarter was driven primarily by Running, Basketball and Sportswear. For our wholesale partners, doors that have been reprofiled continue to outperform the rest of the fleet. And in DTC, we saw a growth of 52%, with continued strong growth in our stores as well as online.
In China, the NIKE Brand is incredibly strong, which provided the foundation to reset the market in line with the category offense. Our strong results throughout fiscal year '15 demonstrated that our strategy has paid off. We returned to strong revenue growth. We've improved profitability and productivity for ourselves and our wholesale partners and inventory in the marketplace is healthy. Going forward, we will leverage the momentum from fiscal year '15 and continue to execute this consumer-led strategy to drive sustainable, profitable growth in this key geography.
At NIKE, viewing sport through the eyes of the consumer isn't just a strategy. It's our obsession. We know what our consumers want and we deliver it: innovative products, personalized services, unforgettable experiences and the inspiration to go after their biggest goals. And serving our consumers means we lead every day. Our consumer focus, in short, will be out in front in Q4. It, in short, will be out in front in fiscal year '15, and it, in short, will be out in front in fiscal year '16 and beyond.
Before I hand over to Don, I also want to take a moment to thank him for his hard work and his partnership over the years. Don is an all-star CFO and a great leader for this company, who's work created a foundation of excellence for all those around him. I don't know where the CFO Hall of Fame is located, but Don, you deserve a plaque in it. Thanks for everything. Thanks for your friendship. Over to you."

FY '15's results demonstrated our ability to deliver profitable growth even in a challenging macro environment. We did it by focusing on the fundamentals, building deep connections with consumers and delivering innovative products through compelling retail experiences. At the same time, we leveraged our global portfolio to manage risk while continuing to invest for future growth and profitability. Our ability to use all the levers in our business to drive growth and manage risk is one of our greatest advantages, and it's why we're confident in our ability to continue to deliver shareholder value on into the future.
So on to the details for Q4 and FY '15. Q4 revenue for NIKE, Inc. increased 5%, up 13% on a currency-neutral basis. For the full year, NIKE, Inc. revenue increased 10% to $30.6 billion. On a currency-neutral basis, both NIKE, Inc. and the NIKE Brand grew 14%, while Converse grew 21%. Growth in the NIKE Brand was broad-based across categories and driven by continued strong performance in 3 of our largest geographies: North America, Western Europe and China.
Also on a currency-neutral basis, NIKE Brand futures orders grew 13%, driven by a 5% increase in average selling price and an 8% increase in units. The growth reflects continued strong demand across the NIKE Brand portfolio, led by double-digit growth in North America, Western Europe and China. On a reported basis, futures grew 2%, reflecting weaker international currencies, particularly the euro, ruble, real and yen.
Fourth quarter diluted EPS increased 26% to $0.98, and full year diluted EPS rose 25% to $3.70, driven by revenue growth, gross margin expansion and a lower tax rate, partially offset by higher SG&A investments. The effects of FX on the quarter and the year were fairly modest as the negative impact of the stronger dollar was largely offset by our FX risk management.
Gross margin expanded 60 basis points in Q4 and 120 basis points for the full year. For both the quarter and the full year, margin expansion was primarily driven by higher average selling prices and continued growth in our higher-margin DTC business, partially offset by higher cost of goods due to labor inflation and higher logistics costs.
Fourth quarter demand creation was 7% below the prior year quarter, which included significant World Cup related expenses. For the full year, demand creation increased 6%, driven by support for key events and product launches, DTC and investments in sports marketing. 
Operating overhead increased 13% for the quarter and 16% for the full year. This reflected growth on our higher gross margin, higher cost DTC business as well as investments in operational infrastructure and digital, including consumer engagement.
The effective tax rate for FY '15 was 22.2%, lower than last year's 24% rate, primarily due to favorable resolution of tax audits across multiple jurisdictions. The rate was significantly lower in Q4, primarily due to adjustments to reduce tax expense recognized in interim quarters of FY '15 on intercompany transactions. We continue to deliver strong returns on capital as FY '15 ROIC reached 28.1%, up 360 basis points from the prior year. For the year, we returned $3.4 billion in cash to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends.
As of May 31, inventories were up 10%, primarily driven by business growth and the impact of port congestion in North America. As we discussed last quarter, we anticipate the flow of product in North America to return to normal in the first half of FY '16. We expect inventory levels to be somewhat elevated for the next several quarters as we work to rebalance supply and demand in the market.
Now let's look at our performance by segment. North America delivered another remarkable year as FY '15 revenue grew 12% to $13.7 billion, the fifth consecutive year of double-digit revenue growth. Growth for the year was driven by higher revenues in nearly every key category, led by double-digit growth in Basketball, Sportswear and Women's Training. The growth also reflected strength in both sales to wholesale customers and DTC. Sustained, broad-based growth at this level in a market as developed as North America demonstrates both the tremendous strength of the NIKE Brand and the effectiveness of the category offense in expanding both the market and our market share.
North America EBIT grew 18% for the full year, driven by strong revenue growth and gross margin expansion. 
Western Europe also had a great year, as FY '15 revenue reached $5.7 billion, up 15% despite the weakness of the euro. On a currency-neutral basis, revenue grew 21% for FY '15 as every territory grew and we posted double-digit growth in every key category except Golf and Global Football, which grew at a high single-digit rate despite tough comparisons against the World Cup last year. 
Western Europe EBIT increased 49% in FY '15, driven by revenue growth, gross margin expansion and SG&A leverage.
In Central and Eastern Europe, FY '15 revenue grew 15% on a currency-neutral basis, driven by growth in every territory except Israel, and every key category except Action Sports and Global Football, which declined at a low-single digit rate, reflecting comparisons to last year's World Cup. On a reported basis, FY '15 revenue for CEE grew 2% and EBIT declined 11%, largely reflecting significantly weaker currencies, especially the ruble.
In FY '15, China returned to strong, profitable growth as revenues topped $3 billion, up 18% for the year. On a currency-neutral basis, FY '15 revenue grew 19%, driven by the ongoing strength of the brand, a more category assortment tailored for China and new retail formats, including NIKE.com. In addition to driving revenue growth, we've sharply reduced inventory levels in the market and significantly increased the productivity and profitability of retail for NIKE and our wholesale partners. FY '15 EBIT for China grew 22% due to strong revenue growth and expanding gross margins.
In Japan, currency-neutral revenue grew 9% for the year and 19% for the quarter, driven by strong growth in Sportswear, Basketball and Running. Reported results in Japan were significantly reduced by the weaker yen as FY '15 revenue declined 2% and EBIT fell 24%.
In our emerging markets geography, results were mixed. On a currency-neutral basis, FY '15 revenue increased 8%, but Q4 revenue fell 3%. Nearly every key category grew for the year and the quarter. Sportswear, Running and Basketball led the growth for the year, while Global Football declined for both periods as we lapped strong sales in advance of last year's World Cup. For the year and the quarter, we posted strong currency-neutral revenue growth in most territories, led by Soco, Pacific, Korea and Southeast Asia, while revenues in Mexico and Brazil declined for both periods.
As Trevor discussed, we're clearing the excess inventory in Mexico and feel confident the market is now positioned for profitable growth. In Brazil, a weakening macroeconomic environment and changes in the retail marketplace have led to a slowdown in our business. In response, we're taking strong steps to tighten the supply of products as we work to reprofile the marketplace along the lines of the category offense. We're confident we're taking the right actions now to position this market for renewed growth.
FY '15 reported growth for our emerging markets geography was affected by both the marketplace actions we've taken in Mexico and Brazil as well as significant currency headwinds across the region. On a reported basis, FY '15 revenue decreased 1% and EBIT decreased 14%, reflecting lower gross margins and SG&A deleverage.
Converse continues to deliver strong growth as FY '15 revenues reached nearly $2 billion, up 21% on a constant currency basis. The growth was driven by the conversion of several European markets to direct distribution and ongoing strength in the United States. On a reported basis, revenue grew 18% for the year, but only 6% for the quarter as we shifted customer shipments to Q3 in advance of a systems implementation.
EBIT increased 4% for the year but declined 15% for the fourth quarter as revenue growth was offset by SG&A investments in market transitions, Converse and Converse IP enforcement as well as new systems and infrastructure. 
In FY '15, NIKE, Inc. delivered strong growth and we had great momentum across the portfolio. Our FY '16 guidance reflects that momentum as well as continued investment in our growth strategies and operational capabilities. While currency markets remain volatile, our growth rate expectations for FY '16 are largely unchanged from what we shared last quarter even though we delivered stronger performance in FY '15 than we expected 90 days ago. 
Specifically, for FY '16, we expect reported revenue growth at a mid-single-digit rate, reflecting low-double digit growth on a currency-neutral basis, partially offset by the impact of the stronger dollar. For Q1, we expect low single-digit reported revenue growth, roughly in line with reported futures growth as FX comparisons are more challenging in the first half of the fiscal year.
We expect gross margin for Q1 and the full year to expand by about 50 basis points, driven by higher average selling prices and rapid growth in our DTC business, including NIKE.com. We also expect to see some benefit from lower oil prices. However, these upsides will be partially offset by ongoing labor cost inflation, higher prices for some raw materials and FX headwinds. For SG&A, including both demand creation and operating overhead, we expect full year growth at a mid-single-digit rate.
For Q1, we expect growth slightly lower than the full year rate as we anniversary World Cup investments in the first quarter of FY '15. We anticipate other income will have a more meaningful impact on our FY '16 results than we've seen historically as a portion of our expected FX hedge gains will be reported in this line item. We currently expect other income will be approximately $50 million for each quarter. For FY '16, we expect the effective tax rate will be approximately 24%.
Before I open the call to questions, I'd like to share a few reflections on my nearly 16 years with NIKE. First, I'd like to thank Mark and Trevor for their kind words today as well as their support and partnership over the years. It's been a privilege to work closely with you both, as well as the rest of the tremendously talented leadership team that has led and will continue to lead NIKE into the future. 
  
I'm incredibly proud of the results we've delivered and the value we've created for our shareholders. The company today is stronger, more diversified, more profitable and better positioned to drive growth than at any time in our history. Our brands are deeply connected with consumers around the world. We're delivering unmatched innovation and we've become highly effective at creating compelling retail experiences online and in-store across wholesale and DTC. We're better operators than we've ever been and our people are the most talented the industry. That's why I know NIKE will continue to drive profitable growth and shareholder value for years to come.
Finally, I'd like to congratulate Andy on his promotion to the CFO role. I've worked closely with him over the last 8 years and have great confidence in his ability to help lead the company toward its full potential. Andy is a strategic leader, with a clear passion for our brands, our business and, most importantly, delivering strong results for our shareholders. And he'll be supported by the finest team of financial executives I know. While it won't be easy to depart at the end of October, I know I leave the company and the finance function in good shape and in good hands. 
Thank you, and now we'd like to open it up for questions."

Leading today's call is Kelley Hall, Vice President, Corporate Finance and Treasurer.
Before I turn the call over to Ms. Hall, let me remind you that participants on this call will make forward-looking statements based on current expectations, and those statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. These risks and uncertainties are detailed in the reports filed with the SEC, including forms 8-K, 10-K and 10-Q. 
Some forward-looking statements concern future orders that are not necessarily indicative of changes in total revenues for subsequent periods due to a mix of futures and at-once orders, exchange rate fluctuations, order cancellations, changes in the timing of shipments, discounts and returns, which may vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter.
In addition, it is important to remember the significant portion of NIKE, Inc.'s continuing operations, including equipment, NIKE Golf, Converse and Hurley, are not included in these futures numbers.
Finally, participants may discuss non-GAAP financial measures, including references to wholesale equivalent sales. References to wholesale equivalent sales are only intended to provide context as to the overall current market footprint of the brands owned by NIKE, Inc. and should not be relied upon as a financial measure of actual results.

We've shown once again that NIKE is a growth company. 
Here are the fiscal '15 highlights. NIKE, Inc. revenues grew 10% to $30.6 billion despite significant FX headwinds. On a currency-neutral basis, NIKE, Inc. revenues grew 14%. Gross margin increased 120 basis points to 46%. Earnings per share rose 25% to $3.70 and we delivered ROIC of 28%. These are the quality results that our shareholders have come to expect from us and that we demand from ourselves.
One of the reasons we're able to deliver results like these are the talented people who work at NIKE around the world. So before going on into the detail on our results, I'd like to thank one of those talented leaders, and that's Don Blair. As you all know, this will be Don's last earnings call with NIKE. And if you're keeping track, it's 63 calls. 
During my tenure as CEO and before that as Co-President, Don has served as a trusted advisor and a valued business partner. He has helped lead the company through great times and challenging times, always with a calm focus and level of discipline that creates confidence and insures we continue to move forward. 
Don will always be remembered as the creator of our long-term financial model, which guides our financial planning to this day. But more than that, Don will be remembered for the talented leaders he has developed over the years, both within finance and across the company.
I want to thank Don for his leadership and dedication to NIKE over the last 15 years, and wish him the very best in his future endeavors. Don's successor, Andy Campion, is a testament to Don's commitment to developing talent. Andy has been a great leader during his 8 years with NIKE, helping to develop the strategy that will drive NIKE's growth for years to come, and I'm confident that Andy will continue to build on the strong foundation Don has set for the company as we strive toward our full potential. Andy will assume the CFO role on August 1 and will join us on the next earnings call.
So while I'm proud of the results we delivered this last year, what sets NIKE apart is our ability to deliver sustainable, profitable growth year in and year out. It is our proven track record of driving growth under a variety of macroeconomic conditions that gives us the confidence we can deliver growth for years to come. This past fiscal year, we managed through a volatile currency environment and sharpened our focus in key markets, and we will continue to drive that same level of discipline and focus as we look ahead to fiscal year '16.
As we have consistently done in the past, we will leverage the power of the NIKE portfolio to drive growth. We have demonstrated time and again that our diverse portfolio of brands, categories, geographies and products is a competitive advantage that allows us to serve our consumer and drive growth better than anyone else. And you can expect us to leverage our portfolio to further unlock growth around the world to expand the market and increase share. And we'll do this by staying true to our commitment to the athlete and our commitment to innovation. 
I recently sat with the innovation teams for an in-depth review of our future product concepts, and I can tell you, I am incredibly energized by what's to come. Today we are pushing ourselves to create products and experiences that consumers want and some they never thought possible. The scale and pace at which we are bringing new innovations to market is unprecedented. Let me share a few examples. 
Flyknit, of course, continues to be one of NIKE's great breakthroughs for the athlete and for our company. It's created a whole new model for design and manufacturing. Instead of engineering down to the piece, we can now engineer it down to the pixel to enhance performance, aesthetics and sustainability. And the most exciting part is we're just discovering new ways to use it every day. We've advanced Flyknit into other sports over the past few years, but there's no doubt last summer's World Cup was the launching pad for Flyknit in Global Football. More than 1/3 of the players chose to wear the Magista, our first Flyknit boot, including Mario Götze, who scored the winning goal in the World Cup final. 
When you look across our business, Flyknit's dynamic strength and lightweight benefits have been applied across our key performance categories: Running, Basketball, Men's and Women's Training as well as into premium Sportswear. 
With the success of Flyknit, we've been inspired to engineer new types of materials like Flyweave. This innovative performance weaving process pushes the limits of lightweight with superior strength, and it was introduced this year with the Jordan 29. And just a few days ago, we revealed the newest signature shoe from Kevin Durant, the KD8, which utilizes this incredible technology. I'm very excited about the potential for Flyweave, so keep an eye out for further innovation in this area.
We not only deliver new breakthroughs, but we also push ourselves to reinvent our most iconic products. Products in our Running category are a great example. This year, we matched Zoom Air in its 20th year with the Pegasus 31 to create the fastest, most responsive Pegasus to date. It proves that much better does not always have to be entirely new. 
We also continue to diversify one of our greatest collections of apparel technologies, Dri-FIT. Dri-FIT is the foundation for everything from shirts to tights, to socks, and it adapts to any athlete need. Strong performance this year included Nike Pro Hyperwarm, Running Dri-FIT Knit and Running Dri-FIT Hypercool. 
One of this year's greatest Dri-FIT innovations was with the Nike Pro Bra Collection. With the broadest assortment of styles and sizes, we're able to provide the athlete with the right fit and support for any type of training or sports.
Finally, Dri-FIT also forms the basis for our most advanced NCAA basketball uniforms ever. Two of our longstanding partners, Duke and UConn, won the respective men's and women's national championships wearing the Nike Hyper Elite uniform. Our uniforms weigh only 11.4 ounces, and we have set every detail from vented waistbands to laser perforations, which enhance cooling and increase mobility. The Hyper Elite truly sets the standard for basketball apparel. 
It is examples like these that makes me so excited to bring the full power of NIKE's innovation and creativity to the NBA. With Nike, Jordan and Converse, we can't wait to help grow the game of Basketball even farther across our entire global reach. 
At NIKE, innovation comes in many forms and our growing digital ecosystem is a great example. Consumers are increasingly connected and utilizing premium, personal digital services. Digital is an accelerator of growth that is shaping everything we do, from building deep connections to consumers with digital services and communities to driving rapid expansion of our e-commerce business. This is all made possible because NIKE is one of the world's most engaged brands online. It's where we connect with the consumer 1-to-1 and it's where we connect people to one another. And we're constantly looking for new ways to seamlessly connect social platforms to commerce.
Earlier this quarter, for example, Nike Women launched the Instagram shop, a new tool that allows users to click a photo and be taken directly to NIKE.com product pages. And just last week, we announced that we are one of the first partners to offer curated product collections through Twitter. And there are many more exciting opportunities to come in this space as the power of the NIKE Brand creates strong demand from consumers any time, anywhere on any platform.
We deepen our relationship with consumers through services like Nike+ Run Club and Nike+ Training Club that inspire and enable them to do more and get better. Our Nike+ Training Club app continues to build a motivated community of devoted athletes and now features 135 workouts and is available in 17 languages. Access for NIKE.com to Nike+ Run Club training plans brings together the best Nike expert running guidance to one place. There's great potential here to connect more runners to the product they need to meet their goals. And in April, we unveiled a Nike Trainer's Hub that unites the global network of elite trainers to help every athlete reach their peak potential.
We connect, motivate and inspire our community of members with great products and services because ultimately, what sets NIKE apart is our innovative product, and e-commerce is rapidly expanding our ability to serve consumers with products for any sport all over the world. 
Fiscal '15 was a great year for NIKE.com. We delivered 51% revenue growth in Q4 with 55% growth for the full year. We saw increases in both traffic and conversion, fueled by our investments in critical infrastructure to improve the consumer experience on both desktop and mobile. And as I mentioned last quarter, our traffic on mobile has exceeded traffic on desktop, making it a very sharp point for consumer engagement going forward. 
I'm proud to say our e-commerce business surpassed $1 billion in revenue this past year, a fantastic achievement from all of our teams. But really, we're just scratching the surface of our potential in this area. Global consumer spending through e-commerce exceeds $1 trillion, a significant portion of which is done on mobile devices. Tremendous opportunity ahead for us in e-commerce.
What I just recapped is by no means an exhausted list, but it clearly shows how much ground this company can cover in just 1 year. And while we're pleased with this year's results, at NIKE, we're always moving forward. We are relentless in our pursuit to get better and we see opportunities that no one else can. And most importantly, we have the resources and the talented team to deliver. 
Fiscal '16 will be no different. We have great momentum and we will continue to drive it by growing our largest categories such as Running, Basketball, Football and our geographies such as North America, Western Europe and China. And by unlocking the areas with the greatest potential for growth such as Women's, Young Athletes and apparel, and also by accelerating new opportunities such as breakthrough technologies and product in advanced manufacturing and digital. 
We have one of the strongest brands in the world with the world of opportunities still ahead. And that's why fiscal '16 will be our best year yet.
Thanks, and now here's Trevor."

The NIKE Brand closed the year with a strong finish, demonstrating yet again the power of the category offense to drive growth.

The NIKE Brand closed the year with a strong finish, demonstrating yet again the power of the category offense to drive growth. On a constant currency basis, NIKE Brand revenue grew 13% for the quarter. For the year, revenue was up 14%, with double-digit growth in North America, both European geographies and China. 
NIKE Brand DTC revenue was up 27% for the quarter. For the year, DTC revenue was up 29%, driven by comp store growth of 16%, online growth of 59% and new stores. And finally, global futures accelerated to 13%, reflecting continued strong demand. 
The success in our business is a natural outcome of putting the consumer at the center of everything we do. Our connection with consumers strengthens our brand every day from our own retail to wholesale partners, from in-store to online, from digital experiences to unforgettable live events. It's those deep and authentic connections that power the NIKE Brand around the world.
Within our category offense, we often talk about Amplify -- our Amplify strategy to compete, train and express. Sportswear represents the express portion of that equation, where consumers express their love and passion for the game with premium sports-inspired products. Sportswear is a key complement to the product assortment for our performance categories, offering an opportunity to elevate the design and technical innovation in traditional Sportswear styles while also creating new ones. This drove tremendous growth in the Sportswear in fiscal year '15, which was up 20% for the year.
Now let's turn to a few of our performance categories. First, I'll start with Running. By serving our consumers through product innovation and consumer engagement, we drove growth in this important category with revenue up 9% for the year to nearly $5 billion. Our premium performance footwear continues to resonate with runners, led by the Air Zoom Pegasus 31 and the FlyKnit Lunar 3, and our premium Sportswear styles such as the Air Max 1 and the Roshe, also continued to drive growth. 
We saw a return to growth in our core Running footwear across all markets, including North America. Core Running footwear consists of our products at mid-tier price zones. This return to growth was led by core performance styles like the Downshifter and the Wind Flow, which features Zoom Air technology. 
As we continued to drive innovation, Running apparel was once again a key growth driver, led by the continued success of our Dri-FIT Knit tops and our Epic Lux tights. 
And more than ever, we're expanding our overall Running business by inspiring new generations of runners every day. As Mark discussed, giving runners the knowledge and tools they need through digital services has helped to create deeper, meaningful relationships. The opportunities to build new connections with our Nike+ community are virtually unlimited, as we add even more exclusive experiences like special product launches and Running events.
Nike Basketball, which in fiscal year '15, grew 21% to nearly $4 billion. Our Basketball business fueled the strength of our brand and our product innovation has never been stronger. 
This year, as always, we launched incredibly innovative products for our consumers. Nike Basketball introduced great footwear such as the LeBron 12, completely redesigned to deliver precision and explosive performance, and the KYRIE 1, the first signature shoe for this dynamic and exciting young player. And in the Jordan Brand, we introduced the Air Jordan 29, the lightest Air Jordan performance shoe ever, and the Super.Fly 3, which employs NIKE's Zoom technology for lightweight, durable cushioning. 
What's more, every year, Nike Basketball and the Jordan Brand put on great consumer experiences and fiscal year '15 was no exception. Standout examples include last quarter's NBA All-Star weekend in New York and the Nike World Basketball Festival in Spain last September was a great example. These events showcase the tremendous combined power of the 2 great basketball brands, something only Nike can offer. 
Nike Basketball and Jordan are driving the kind of energy that excites current fans and brings in new ones, growing the market today and into the future. And as Mark mentioned, our partnership with the NBA gives us tremendous opportunity to grow this sport. It's a platform for true innovation, not just for our products, but also for the many ways we can serve our consumers. This partnership will let us share our passion for Basketball in exciting places like Rio to Beijing, to Barcelona. The energy around Basketball is at an all-time high, and we're excited to accelerate its growth around the globe.
Finally, our Women's business continues to drive strong growth. For the year, revenue grew 20% to nearly $6 billion. The strong growth in our Women's business is driven by the innovation and style we bring to the products that matter most to these athletes. Key apparel styles such as the Nike Pro Bra Collection and broad assortments of tights are resonating strongly with consumers and creating excitement in the marketplace. In Q4, we released our biggest ever market initiative for women called Better For It, which in just 2 months, has totaled more than 18 million online views. Better For It resonated with consumers because it wasn't just a campaign. It was a call to action for all athletes to push themselves to be their best. And it was served by the global community of women who interact with NIKE and each other every day for inspiration.
Our new Women's only door in London, along with our newly reopened Santa Monica store, exemplify the focus on providing products and services specifically for women. We've also continued to increase the number of stores with premium services such as bra fitting, gait analysis and pant hemming. That success is mirrored by the strong growth in our Women's business on NIKE.com, which exceeded both Men and the total NIKE Brand in the quarter. All told, our work, both in-store and online is helping to drive strong growth in our overall Women's business.
Now let's talk about a few of our geographies. North America had a great quarter and another remarkable year. Revenues were up 14% for the quarter and 12% for the year despite the headwind from the West Coast port congestion. Growth in the quarter was driven by nearly every key category. We saw continued strong performance from DTC, which grew 13% in the quarter with NIKE.com growing 31%. This performance was complemented by strong executions with our wholesale partners such as the Fieldhouse with Dick's Sporting Goods, House of Hoops with Foot Locker and the Track Club with the Finish Line. 
In Q4, we also remained focused on working through the impact of the West Coast port congestion by diverting some shipments to alternative ports and shipping select products via air freight. As expected, product flows began to normalize in Q4, but we expect it will take a couple of quarters before product flow fully returns to normal. That said, we continue to see great demand for our products in the marketplace and expect to efficiently move through the inventory and maintain a healthy pull market.
We continue to see incredible potential for growth in North America and the reason is simple and familiar. We remain focused on the consumer, delivering innovative products and services through compelling retail experiences. This allows us to expand the market while also taking market share.
Now let's turn to Western Europe, where we're seeing broad-based demand with growth of 17% in the quarter and 21% for the year. Growth in the quarter and throughout the year was fueled by our continued efforts to transform the marketplace in line with the category offense. We saw strong growth across most key categories, led by Sportswear, Running, Women's Training and Basketball, and in the territories, particularly in AGS, that's Austria, Germany and Switzerland, as well as in the U.K. and Ireland. Our execution with our wholesale partners such as JD Sports, Foot Locker and Intersport all performed well in the quarter, as did our own DTC, which had revenue growth of 39%. 
The momentum we've seen in fiscal year '15 in Western Europe, combined with the strength of the NIKE Brand, reinforces our view that there is tremendous growth potential in this important geography. Our focus on the consumer will continue to build on that momentum as we head into fiscal year '16 and beyond.
 
Now let's turn to the emerging markets, where quarter 4, revenue declined 3% due in part to comparisons to strong World Cup results last year as well as actions we're taking in Mexico and Brazil to ensure a healthy marketplace. For the full year, revenue grew by 8%. For the quarter, we saw 7 of the 9 territories grow, with 6 growing at a double-digit rate. The NIKE Brand continues to be very strong in the emerging markets and our products are resonating with consumers across all territories.
Let's take a closer look at 2 of these territories. In Mexico, we've been actively working to clear excess inventory, which resulted primarily from a distribution center transition in fiscal year '14. Our brand remains very strong, and we're seeing accelerated growth in retail sell-through. As a result, we're now returning to more normalized inventory levels as of the end of fiscal year '15. We continue to work with our wholesale partners to ensure a healthy pull market in Mexico and we feel confident that the market is now well-positioned for profitable growth.
In Brazil, Q4 revenue was down about 20%, reflecting comparisons to strong World Cup sales in the prior year as well as weak macroeconomic environment. At the same time, we continue to take steps to proactively manage the supply of product in the marketplace. The NIKE Brand remains incredibly strong in Brazil and we continue to see tremendous opportunity for sustainable, profitable growth. 
To realize this opportunity, we are leveraging the category offense to segment and differentiate our points of distribution. We are confident that these steps will offer our consumers more premium and compelling retail experiences while increasing the productivity and profitability of the market for our wholesale partners and our business.
And finally, in China, where Q4 revenue grew 20%, and we posted a full year growth of 19%. Our strong growth in the quarter was driven primarily by Running, Basketball and Sportswear. For our wholesale partners, doors that have been reprofiled continue to outperform the rest of the fleet. And in DTC, we saw a growth of 52%, with continued strong growth in our stores as well as online.
In China, the NIKE Brand is incredibly strong, which provided the foundation to reset the market in line with the category offense. Our strong results throughout fiscal year '15 demonstrated that our strategy has paid off. We returned to strong revenue growth. We've improved profitability and productivity for ourselves and our wholesale partners and inventory in the marketplace is healthy. Going forward, we will leverage the momentum from fiscal year '15 and continue to execute this consumer-led strategy to drive sustainable, profitable growth in this key geography.
At NIKE, viewing sport through the eyes of the consumer isn't just a strategy. It's our obsession. We know what our consumers want and we deliver it: innovative products, personalized services, unforgettable experiences and the inspiration to go after their biggest goals. And serving our consumers means we lead every day. Our consumer focus ensured we will be out in front in Q4. It ensured will be out in front in fiscal year '15, and it ensures we will be out in front in fiscal year '16 and beyond.
Before I hand over to Don, I also want to take a moment to thank him for his hard work and his partnership over the years. Don is an all-star CFO and a great leader for this company, who's work created a foundation of excellence for all those around him. I don't know where the CFO Hall of Fame is located, but Don, you deserve a plaque in it. Thanks for everything. Thanks for your friendship. Over to you."

FY '15's results demonstrated our ability to deliver profitable growth even in a challenging macro environment. We did it by focusing on the fundamentals, building deep connections with consumers and delivering innovative products through compelling retail experiences. At the same time, we leveraged our global portfolio to manage risk while continuing to invest for future growth and profitability. Our ability to use all the levers in our business to drive growth and manage risk is one of our greatest advantages, and it's why we're confident in our ability to continue to deliver shareholder value on into the future.
So on to the details for Q4 and FY '15. Q4 revenue for NIKE, Inc. increased 5%, up 13% on a currency-neutral basis. For the full year, NIKE, Inc. revenue increased 10% to $30.6 billion. On a currency-neutral basis, both NIKE, Inc. and the NIKE Brand grew 14%, while Converse grew 21%. Growth in the NIKE Brand was broad-based across categories and driven by continued strong performance in 3 of our largest geographies: North America, Western Europe and China.
Also on a currency-neutral basis, NIKE Brand futures orders grew 13%, driven by a 5% increase in average selling price and an 8% increase in units. The growth reflects continued strong demand across the NIKE Brand portfolio, led by double-digit growth in North America, Western Europe and China. On a reported basis, futures grew 2%, reflecting weaker international currencies, particularly the euro, ruble, real and yen.
Fourth quarter diluted EPS increased 26% to $0.98, and full year diluted EPS rose 25% to $3.70, driven by revenue growth, gross margin expansion and a lower tax rate, partially offset by higher SG&A investments. The effects of FX on the quarter and the year were fairly modest as the negative impact of the stronger dollar was largely offset by our FX risk management.
Gross margin expanded 60 basis points in Q4 and 120 basis points for the full year. For both the quarter and the full year, margin expansion was primarily driven by higher average selling prices and continued growth in our higher-margin DTC business, partially offset by higher cost of goods due to labor inflation and higher logistics costs.
Fourth quarter demand creation was 7% below the prior year quarter, which included significant World Cup related expenses. For the full year, demand creation increased 6%, driven by support for key events and product launches, DTC and investments in sports marketing. 
Operating overhead increased 13% for the quarter and 16% for the full year. This reflected growth on our higher gross margin, higher cost DTC business as well as investments in operational infrastructure and digital, including consumer engagement.
The effective tax rate for FY '15 was 22.2%, lower than last year's 24% rate, primarily due to favorable resolution of tax audits across multiple jurisdictions. The rate was significantly lower in Q4, primarily due to adjustments to reduce tax expense recognized in interim quarters of FY '15 on intercompany transactions. We continue to deliver strong returns on capital as FY '15 ROIC reached 28.1%, up 360 basis points from the prior year. For the year, we returned $3.4 billion in cash to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends.
As of May 31, inventories were up 10%, primarily driven by business growth and the impact of port congestion in North America. As we discussed last quarter, we anticipate the flow of product in North America to return to normal in the first half of FY '16. We expect inventory levels to be somewhat elevated for the next several quarters as we work to rebalance supply and demand in the market.
Now let's look at our performance by segment. North America delivered another remarkable year as FY '15 revenue grew 12% to $13.7 billion, the fifth consecutive year of double-digit revenue growth. Growth for the year was driven by higher revenues in nearly every key category, led by double-digit growth in Basketball, Sportswear and Women's Training. The growth also reflected strength in both sales to wholesale customers and DTC. Sustained, broad-based growth at this level in a market as developed as North America demonstrates both the tremendous strength of the NIKE Brand and the effectiveness of the category offense in expanding both the market and our market share.
North America EBIT grew 18% for the full year, driven by strong revenue growth and gross margin expansion. 
Western Europe also had a great year, as FY '15 revenue reached $5.7 billion, up 15% despite the weakness of the euro. On a currency-neutral basis, revenue grew 21% for FY '15 as every territory grew and we posted double-digit growth in every key category except Golf and Global Football, which grew at a high single-digit rate despite tough comparisons against the World Cup last year. 
Western Europe EBIT increased 49% in FY '15, driven by revenue growth, gross margin expansion and SG&A leverage.
In Central and Eastern Europe, FY '15 revenue grew 15% on a currency-neutral basis, driven by growth in every territory except Israel, and every key category except Action Sports and Global Football, which declined at a low-single digit rate, reflecting comparisons to last year's World Cup. On a reported basis, FY '15 revenue for CEE grew 2% and EBIT declined 11%, largely reflecting significantly weaker currencies, especially the ruble.
In FY '15, China returned to strong, profitable growth as revenues topped $3 billion, up 18% for the year. On a currency-neutral basis, FY '15 revenue grew 19%, driven by the ongoing strength of the brand, a more focused category assortment tailored for China and new retail formats, including NIKE.com. In addition to driving revenue growth, we've sharply reduced inventory levels in the market and significantly increased the productivity and profitability of retail for NIKE and our wholesale partners. FY '15 EBIT for China grew 22% due to strong revenue growth and expanding gross margins.
In Japan, currency-neutral revenue grew 9% for the year and 19% for the quarter, driven by strong growth in Sportswear, Basketball and Running. Reported results in Japan were significantly reduced by the weaker yen as FY '15 revenue declined 2% and EBIT fell 24%.
In our emerging markets geography, results were mixed. On a currency-neutral basis, FY '15 revenue increased 8%, but Q4 revenue fell 3%. Nearly every key category grew for the year and the quarter. Sportswear, Running and Basketball led the growth for the year, while Global Football declined for both periods as we lapped strong sales in advance of last year's World Cup. For the year and the quarter, we posted strong currency-neutral revenue growth in most territories, led by Soco, Pacific, Korea and Southeast Asia, while revenues in Mexico and Brazil declined for both periods.
As Trevor discussed, we're clearing the excess inventory in Mexico and feel confident the market is now positioned for profitable growth. In Brazil, a weakening macroeconomic environment and changes in the retail marketplace have led to a slowdown in our business. In response, we're taking strong steps to tighten the supply of products as we work to reprofile the marketplace along the lines of the category offense. We're confident we're taking the right actions now to position this market for renewed growth.
FY '15 reported growth for our emerging markets geography was affected by both the marketplace actions we've taken in Mexico and Brazil as well as significant currency headwinds across the region. On a reported basis, FY '15 revenue decreased 1% and EBIT decreased 14%, reflecting lower gross margins and SG&A deleverage.
Converse continues to deliver strong growth as FY '15 revenues reached nearly $2 billion, up 21% on a constant currency basis. The growth was driven by the conversion of several European markets to direct distribution and ongoing strength in the United States. On a reported basis, revenue grew 18% for the year, but only 6% for the quarter as we shifted customer shipments to Q3 in advance of a systems implementation.
EBIT increased 4% for the year but declined 15% for the fourth quarter as revenue growth was offset by SG&A investments in market transitions, Converse and Converse IP enforcement as well as new systems and infrastructure. 
In FY '15, NIKE, Inc. delivered strong growth and we had great momentum across the portfolio. Our FY '16 guidance reflects that momentum as well as continued investment in our growth strategies and operational capabilities. While currency markets remain volatile, our growth rate expectations for FY '16 are largely unchanged from what we shared last quarter even though we delivered stronger performance in FY '15 than we expected 90 days ago. 
Specifically, for FY '16, we expect reported revenue growth at a mid-single-digit rate, reflecting low-double digit growth on a currency-neutral basis, partially offset by the impact of the stronger dollar. For Q1, we expect low single-digit reported revenue growth, roughly in line with reported futures growth as FX comparisons are more challenging in the first half of the fiscal year.
We expect gross margin for Q1 and the full year to expand by about 50 basis points, driven by higher average selling prices and rapid growth in our DTC business, including NIKE.com. We also expect to see some benefit from lower oil prices. However, these upsides will be partially offset by ongoing labor cost inflation, higher prices for some raw materials and FX headwinds. For SG&A, including both demand creation and operating overhead, we expect full year growth at a mid-single-digit rate.
For Q1, we expect growth slightly lower than the full year rate as we anniversary World Cup investments in the first quarter of FY '15. We anticipate other income will have a more meaningful impact on our FY '16 results than we've seen historically as a portion of our expected FX hedge gains will be reported in this line item. We currently expect other income will be approximately $50 million for each quarter. For FY '16, we expect the effective tax rate will be approximately 24%.
Before I open the call to questions, I'd like to share a few reflections on my nearly 16 years with NIKE. First, I'd like to thank Mark and Trevor for their kind words today as well as their support and partnership over the years. It's been a privilege to work closely with you both, as well as the rest of the tremendously talented leadership team that has led and will continue to lead NIKE into the future. 
  
I'm incredibly proud of the results we've delivered and the value we've created for our shareholders. The company today is stronger, more diversified, more profitable and better positioned to drive growth than at any time in our history. Our brands are deeply connected with consumers around the world. We're delivering unmatched innovation and we've become highly effective at creating compelling retail experiences online and in-store across wholesale and DTC. We're better operators than we've ever been and our people are the most talented the industry. That's why I know NIKE will continue to drive profitable growth and shareholder value for years to come.
Finally, I'd like to congratulate Andy on his promotion to the CFO role. I've worked closely with him over the last 8 years and have great confidence in his ability to help lead the company toward its full potential. Andy is a strategic leader, with a clear passion for our brands, our business and, most importantly, delivering strong results for our shareholders. And he'll be supported by the finest team of financial executives I know. While it won't be easy to depart at the end of October, I know I leave the company and the finance function in good shape and in good hands. 
Thank you, and now we'd like to open it up for questions."

And what we are doing very well is we are connecting very well with runners in the marketplace, so we continue to feel very confident about the business. And at the same time, what we have seen is the strengthening in the core, as we discussed, which is really about the mid-price -- the mid-priced tier zone. And what we've done there is certainly, we've gone in and zoned in, and we've always talk about diving in deeper. That's a great example. We've gone in deeper and focused on that. At the same time, I feel very confident about the innovation that is coming and that has been delivered and continues to be in the pipeline for Running. So overall, I'm very confident about the Running business. There's always room for opportunity and more growth and obviously, for us to continue to excite our consumers.

There are some headwinds out there, of course, with labor inflation and FX, but on the flip side, we've done a pretty consistent job of raising average gross selling prices, our DTC business of course, is accretive.

We are in the middle -- Don has mentioned this briefly, but scaling our advanced manufacturing initiatives, which we've really been working on over the past 3 or 4 years. So you're going to start to see those scale. But the opportunity to get some -- translate some duty relief into investing in our advanced manufacturing supply chain efforts here in the United States is going to be significant. We hope, I mean that's our goal, so that the idea is that, that will accelerate and we'll see some real benefits from that. I think you're going to see the overall supply chain geographically shift a bit here and there, with the advancements of new manufacturing, innovation that is a major priority for NIKE. It will give us the flexibility to create more localized manufacturing over time.

Obviously, we spoke about AGS as well as in the U.K. and Ireland. And our partnerships that we're doing with our wholesale partners, with the JD Sports, Foot Locker and Intersport, are continuing to drive that. Our dot-com business in Western Europe is also growing at an accelerated pace. So what is driving the numbers in the DTC, primarily would be the dot-com growth, that's growing at certainly a faster rate than the overall business. But our ability to drive more conversion in the stores where we currently exist still is taking place. So we've been able to increase the sell-through within our own doors. As we've always talked about, that learning, we then take that to our wholesale partners, that's really helping to drive the overall growth in the marketplace. So we continue to feel very confident about the growth. Again, I won't say that it will go on forever. But certainly, we see a lot of runway for quite some time."

Now before I move into a discussion on our business, I want to take a moment to introduce our new Chief Financial Officer, Andy Campion. As you know, Don Blair retired from the CFO role as of July 31, and I'm happy to formally welcome Andy into his new role. Andy has been a key member of the NIKE leadership team for the past 8 years, and bring to his new role both a passion for the brand and a commitment to driving shareholder value. You'll hear from Any at the end the call to discuss our results in detail, but let me start with a few of my thoughts as we begin the new fiscal year.
Last year at this time, I talked about our focus on 3 key areas: The depth of our relationships with our athletes and consumers; our fast-paced culture of innovation; and the power of our portfolio. We strengthened all of these areas throughout last year and we delivered tremendous results. In Q1, we carried that momentum forward with an outstanding start to fiscal year '16.
Let's take a look at the highlights from the first quarter. NIKE, Inc. revenues grew 5% to $8.4 billion despite significant FX headwind. On a currency-neutral basis, NIKE, Inc. revenues grew 14%. Gross margin expanded 90 basis points to 47.5% and earnings per share increased 23% to $1.34.
Ultimately, NIKE continues to succeed because of the deep relationships we have with the athlete and the consumer, relationships we know we must earn every day. And we have a thoughtful long-term growth plan, which we continue to execute at the highest level. We invest in our biggest opportunities and we've built a diversified portfolio to give us the flexibility to pull the right levers at the right time to maximize growth. Our powerful portfolio of categories, geographies, brands and channels across men's, women's and young athletes is one of our greatest competitive advantages, and we continue to see new ways to unlock growth all over the world. And while we're not immune to the macroeconomic challenges that all businesses are be facing, we are best positioned and best resourced to navigate the short term and thrive for the long term. NIKE is on a relentless pace and we have no intention of slowing down.
Leveraging our portfolio is one way we sustain growth. The other, of course, is through innovation. We showed the power of our scale this quarter as we share technologies from one category to another and from one brand to another. This is how innovation can create separation, and this is something only NIKE can do. 
Just a couple of quick highlights. In footwear, we launched the Pegasus 32 in June 2015, which featured high-performance Zoom Air technology. It delivers highly responsive cushioning and lightweight support to help athletes achieve their fastest run. 
In the Jordan Brand, we introduced the Superfly 4 with LightSpeed technology, offering lightweight comfort and impact protection. 
In performance apparel, we just announced 2 new technologies that solve for temperature regulation in completely new ways, Therma-Sphere Max, a composite material designed for lightweight warmth and mobility for outdoor training. And then Aero React, an adaptive material that reacts to the heat and moisture of the body. The fibers of the fabric open up when they when they get wet and they close as they dry out again, offering both active cooling and warmth all in one layer. 
Going forward, you can expect to see further acceleration in our innovation agenda for performance apparel as we look ahead to the Summer Olympics in Rio and beyond. So stay tuned for more on that later in the year.
And in Sportswear apparel, we delivered our latest silhouettes for Tech Fleece for men and women. Over the past several seasons, NIKE Tech Pack has created great demand for premium Lifestyle available technical performance innovation. 
A great example of leveraging innovation across multiple dimensions of our business is reflected in Hurley, Jordan and Converse, utilizing NIKE technology to create exciting new concepts of their own. Hurley once again applied a footwear innovation to their industry leading Phantom Elite board shorts, this time using NIKE mad wire, a dynamic stability support system for a lockdown fit in the waistband. 
The Jordan Brand continue to bring its unique perspective the training with the flight flex trainer 2 and its Nike Free inspired NaturalMotion midsole. Looking ahead, we see tremendous opportunity for the Jordan Brand to transcend its core Basketball positioning into new areas of growth. 
And finally, the legendary Chuck Taylor All Star received a performance innovation boost them adding a NIKE Lunarlon Satlantic, a padded collar and breathable liner to the Converse classic. The Chuck Taylor All Star 2 brought new comfort details but stay true to the silhouette that Chuck fans know and love. The potential for Converse has never been greater as we continue to expand globally and further diversify this great brand. 
These are just a few examples that show how we take our best ideas and accelerate them across our categories and brands to serve our consumers and drive growth.
As you've heard me say many times, innovation at NIKE goes beyond product and digital is a great example. Digital is an accelerator throughout NIKE. It is a platform that enables new ways of working at new methods of manufacturing. It drives how we connect with consumers, how we serve them and how we engage with one another. It also fuels our growth by serving our consumers whenever they want a NIKE products for any sport all over the world.
Our digital ecosystem delivers a connected growing community, personal real time engagement and easier access to the product they love, head to toe. We stand alone because we cannot all 3 to give the most holistic, premium experience to the consumer. And when we serve the consumer better through digital, we drive growth. 
Just to look at this quarter's revenue for e-commerce business, it's up an incredible 46% on a constant currency basis, with robust growth across all of our geographies. We also saw a strong conversion and increased traffic, particularly on mobile. 
Our Q1 results clearly demonstrate our ability to continue to drive sustainable, profitable growth. And while we feel great about the last 90 days, we will remain laser focused on continuing this momentum over the balance of the fiscal year and beyond.
The rest of fiscal '16 is filled with important sports moments. The Super Bowl, the NBA All-Star weekend, Euro Champs and, of course, the lead up to the Rio Olympics. Every one of them an opportunity for NIKE. An opportunity to innovate for the athletes, to inspire the consumer and to grow the business. And just like the athletes we serve, these opportunities compel us to keep raising the bar. Because in the end, the power of NIKE not lies not only in our ability to see the future but to create it, and you can expect us to continue to do just that. Thanks. And now here's Trevor."
291981,311181795,872688,"NIKE, Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Sep 24, 2015",2015-09-24,"Earnings Calls","NIKE, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Mark.

Q1 proved yet again the sustained power of the category offense. As we've said, the category offense drives deep and meaningful relationships with consumers. This provides us with great insights to create innovative products, rich services and inspiring experiences that our consumers love. 
For the quarter, on a constant currency basis, NIKE Brand revenue grew 15%, with double-digit growth across nearly every geography and most key categories. NIKE Brand DTC revenue increased 21%, driven by new store expansion, continued strong growth in online sales, up 46% and comp store growth of 7%. And we are very pleased with global futures, up a strong 17%. Clearly, the category offense continue to drive growth of around the world and remains the foundation of our strategy as we look ahead. As always, we use the power of our vast portfolio to target the best growth opportunities for the brand and what gives us that flexibility is the breadth and depth of our category expertise.
To see these dynamics in action, let's first take a look at Running. Our obsession with speed has driven us for years, so we never settle, always looking to shave off that extra second. This relentless focus on innovation can be seen in the momentum of our Zoom Air technology. Propelling the runner forward with an ultra responsive step, Zoom Air technology drives key product styles like our Pegasus 32, the Miro 10 and the Elite 8. 
In Q1, Zoom helped ignite our global community of runners through a special event we called The Fastest Day On Earth, in which we challenge runners to run their fastest mile ever. The event concluded with NIKE celebrating each runner's fastest mile with a personalized video that included the runner's name, mile time and clips from their route using Google Street View. This storytelling saw excellent response, reaching millions of consumers across social media.
Looking at performance apparel, we continue to build on the growth momentum of NIKE Dri-FIT. We launched the Contour Running Top, which features zoned breathability for increased comfort and mobility. And to further express the runner's love of this sport, our Running inspired Sportswear styles also continue to resonate. Two decades after its introduction, we celebrated the Air Max 95 by releasing the original silhouette. And we brought it into the future with new technologies in the Air Max 95 Ultra. 
Another strong growth driver in Q1 was our women's business, with revenue growing double digits. We launched the highly anticipated training shoe, the Metcon 1 for women, which offers just a hint of what's to come in Training. We continue to lead the key apparel styles such as the Dri-FIT Knit, bras and Nike Pro Tights, all of which are important drivers for this business. And Sportswear delivered strong growth, with footwear stars like the Roshe and the entire Air Max platform, which continues to be very popular with women. In addition to delivering innovative new products to the market, we also remained focused on compelling regional executions for her, both of our own DTC and with our wholesale partners.
The rollout of premium and elevated doors throughout the globe continues to drive this important business, as highlighted by the ongoing success of Foot Locker 602 executions and the launch of the Chelsea Collective Doors with Dick's Sporting Goods. These effects we're seeing in women's is truly comprehensive as all facets of the business continue to excel, from products to services, from footwear to apparel and across sports and throughout the entire athlete's life. We are excited about the future of the women's business, with the shift towards -- the global shift towards the health and fitness as part of her lifestyle, we see tremendous opportunity for years to come.
Now let's shift on to a few of our key geographies. North America had a another great quarter, with revenues up 9% and futures up 15%. This geography continues to drive strong growth across nearly all key categories. Time and time again, even though this is our most developed market, North America proves that the right strategies can drive consistent, profitable growth. The energy of our brand in North America is clear, with continued strong demand across our executions, with wholesale partners such as Dick's Sporting Goods, Foot Locker and the Finish Line. We continue to serve this consumer through our amplified strategy, delivering both performance and Lifestyle products. At the same time, we continue to work to effectively manage the flow of inventory in North America, including the impact of the West Coast port congestion from earlier this calendar year. While the flow of product from the port has now returned to normal, we are working to efficiently clear excess inventory to keep our Inline channel healthy. 
In addition, we have recently expanded our North American distribution center and are working to bring this new capacity fully online. We expect both these efforts to be complete by the end of Q3, and inventory levels in North America to normalize at that time. Ultimately, our confidence in the category offense in North America gives us the road map to continue to unlock growth opportunities, both this year and far into the future.
Now let's turn to Western Europe. Q1 revenue grew 14%, driven by growth in all territories in nearly all key categories. This growth continues to be fueled by the transformation of the marketplace along the category offense. This work includes elevated executions at Intersport, the new Oxford Street location with JD Sports in London and the expansion of the House of Hoops of Foot Locker in Berlin. And our own DTC continues to perform very well, delivering 31% growth in Q1. 
By being both deliberate and aggressive, we lead the market as Western Europe's most desired sports brand. We're excited about what the future holds as we execute our complete offense in Western Europe.
Now onto the emerging markets, which delivered strong Q1 results with revenue up 19%, driven by strong growth in Mexico and most key categories. The improvement we've seen in Mexico contributed significantly to the overall results in the geography. As we see the benefit of investing in and elevating our distribution. For example, we launched the House for Her in Mexico City, a product showcase supported by great service, experience and community. Also, prominent marketplace executions with partners such as Liverpool, which is Mexico's largest department store, and Innovasport are also performing well. As these new doors prove by elevating the marketplace, we grow the market in key geographies and territories. Overall, we believe we are now well positioned to drive profitable, long-term growth in Mexico.
In Brazil, revenue was flat, an improvement in trend and market share, but still reflective of the continued challenges at the macroeconomic landscape. That said, we continue to focus on our strategy of -- the marketplace along the category offense by focusing on differentiating our points of distribution and creating more compelling consumer experiences at retail and online, we drive increased productivity and profitability for NIKE and our wholesale partners. Overall, we continue to see growth potential for the emerging markets long term, and are confident that we are executing the right strategies to realize that potential in this important geography.
Finally, in Greater China, revenue was up an amazing 30%. Tremendous growth that again proves, more than ever, the success of our strategies. These gains were driven by strong performance across nearly all key categories, including Sportswear, Running and Basketball. For our wholesale partners like By Lee, the doors that have been reprofiled continued to outperform the rest of the fleet, driving expanded productivity and profitability. We also saw strong growth from our DTC business, driven by comp store sales increases and an acceleration in our e-commerce business. 
It was a very active quarter for China in sports, as Beijing hosted a Track and Field World championships in which athletes wearing NIKE footwear dominated, taking home the majority of medals awarded. And throughout quarter one, athletes like LeBron James, Kobe, Anthony Davis and Paul George, all participated in NIKE Basketball events throughout China, connecting with thousands of consumers through their shared passion of the sport. And just 2 days ago, we announced that Michael Jordan will travel to Shanghai in mid-October to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the Air Jordan franchise. All told, the incredible growth we saw in China this quarter reflects our ongoing efforts to align the marketplace to the category offense, a strategy that we expect will drive growth in this critical geography for many years to come.
In the end, the NIKE Brand started the new fiscal year with energy throughout the entire portfolio of geographies and categories, and we expect to leverage this energy going forward. Because at NIKE, the opportunities offered by our complete offense are limitless across men's, women's and young athletes and across categories, geographies, product types and also marketplaces. 
Fiscal year '16 promises to be another be another year with the choices and investments we make propel us to serve the athlete with even more premium products, services and experiences. While we may be just out of the blocks in quarter one, we are already in full sprint towards a year of continued growth of this brand and this company. 
Thanks. And now on his first earnings call as NIKE's you CFO, here is Andy."
291981,311181795,872688,"NIKE, Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Sep 24, 2015",2015-09-24,"Earnings Calls","NIKE, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Mark and Trevor, and hello to our stakeholders on the call. I've had the pleasure of meeting many of you over the last several years and I very much look forward to deeper engagement over time. With this being my first earnings call, I'd like",1634,"Thank you, Mark and Trevor, and hello to our stakeholders on the call. I've had the pleasure of meeting many of you over the last several years and I very much look forward to deeper engagement over time. 
With this being my first earnings call, I'd like to take a moment to reinforce a few of our long-standing guiding principles, and also briefly touch on how we will continue to evolve and innovate.
Our primary financial objective has been, and will continue to be, delivering extraordinary value to our shareholders. Delivering value to shareholders is first and foremost a function of creating value for consumers. As consumer expectations continue to accelerate, NIKE will evolve and innovate to exceed those expectations. At NIKE, innovation is in our DNA. That applies to all dimensions of our business from the products and services that we deliver to consumers, to the operating and business models that we employ. That is what we call being on the offense always.
As we create value for consumers, we will continue to capture that value through disciplined and consistent financial management. NIKE knows how to grow. We're also deeply committed to ensuring that our growth is profitable, sustainable and capital efficient over the long term. 
We do that through robust gross margin management, continually enhancing the productivity of our resources and investing surgically and strategically in those opportunities with the highest potential for return.
Finally, as we create value for consumers, and we capture that value financially, we will also deliver that value to shareholders through capital management, risk management and consistently increasing our cash returns through both share repurchases and dividends.
Having worked very closely with Mark, Trevor and my predecessor, Don, since joining NIKE in 2007, I'm deeply invested in the strategies that have fueled our strong performance to date. And I believe we have tremendous potential to grow and create value for both consumers and shareholders over the long term. As we say at NIKE, there is no finish line.
Our Q1 financial performance and outlook for the balance of the year reflect both the value we are creating for consumers and the principles that we apply to financial management. So I'm very pleased to share our results in more detail.
Q1 reported revenue for NIKE Inc. increased 5% and grew 14% on a currency-neutral basis. The NIKE Brand grew 15% on a currency-neutral basis and Converse grew 3%. Growth in the NIKE Brand was broad-based and strong across all geographies and nearly all categories.
Also on a currency-neutral basis, NIKE Brand futures orders grew 17%, driven by an 11% increase in units and a 6% increase in average selling prices. Our futures growth reflects continued strong demand and healthy pull markets across the NIKE Brand portfolio. All geographies grew double digits, except emerging markets, which grew 6%. On a reported basis, futures grew 9%, reflecting a stronger U.S. dollar against nearly all international currencies.
Q1 diluted EPS grew 23% to $1.34 despite significant FX headwinds. Our EPS growth was driven by strong top line growth and effective financial management across all levers of the business. Gross margin expanded 90 basis points to 47.5%, primarily driven by higher average selling prices and continued strong growth in our higher-margin Direct-to-Consumer business, partially offset by higher product input cost and warehousing.
Q1 demand creation declined 7%, reflecting favorable comparisons against higher investment in the World Cup in the first quarter of fiscal 2015. Operating overhead increased 10% for the quarter, driven by variable costs associated with continued strong growth in our DTC business and targeted investments in consumer-focused digital capabilities and operational infrastructure.
Our effective tax rate was 18.4% for Q1, lower than prior year, primarily due to an increase in the proportion of earnings from operations outside of the U.S, which are generally subject to a lower tax rate, as well as certain nonrecurring items that were recognized in the first quarter.
As of August 31, inventories were up 10%, primarily to support strong demand across our business. Overall, inventories continue to be healthy around the globe. However, as Trevor discussed, we do expect inventories in North America to be somewhat elevated for the next 2 quarters. And we anticipate there will be an impact on gross margin in the near term as we work to clear excess inventory.
Now let's take a look at our performance by segment. North America delivered another strong quarter, with 9% revenue growth on a currency-neutral basis, driven by strength in nearly every key category, led by Sportswear, Basketball, Men's Training and Running. And consumer demand for NIKE remains strong in North America, with futures growth of 15% on a currency-neutral basis. On a reported basis, North America revenue grew 8% and EBIT grew 7% due to slightly lower gross margin, partially offset by SG&A leverage.
Western Europe also had a great quarter, with Q1 revenue up 14% on a currency-neutral basis, driven by growth in every territory. These results and our continued momentum in Western Europe reflect our broader and deeper execution of the category offense. Nearly all key categories delivered strong growth, fueled by Sportswear, Basketball and Running, while Global Football declined due to tough comparisons to higher World Cup revenues in the prior year. On a reported basis, Q1 revenue declined 4% due to weakness in the euro. However, EBIT increased 20%, driven by gross margin expansion and SG&A leverage.
In Central and Eastern Europe, Q1 revenue grew 26% on a currency-neutral basis, driven by double-digit growth in every territory except Greece, and double-digit growth in nearly every key category. On a reported basis, Q1 revenue grew 2%, reflecting significantly weaker currencies, in particular the ruble and the Turkish lira. However, EBIT grew 42% due primarily to strong gross margin expansion and SG&A leverage.
Now turning to China, where revenue grew an impressive 30% for the quarter on both a reported and currency-neutral basis. While we are very mindful of the macroeconomic volatility in China, our brand has never been stronger and our marketplace has never been more healthy. We have momentum across nearly all key categories as well as continued strength in our DTC business. EBIT for China grew 51% in Q1 due to very strong revenue growth, gross margin expansion and SG&A leverage.
In our emerging markets geography, Q1 revenue increased 19% on a constant currency basis, as nearly all territories delivered strong growth in the quarter, driven by Mexico, Soco and Pacific. Nearly every key category grew for the quarter led by Sportswear, Action Sports and Basketball. 
As Trevor discussed in his remarks, Mexico returned to strong growth as a result of our efforts to optimize inventory and reset that market. And while revenue was flat in Brazil, our brand is strong and we continue to gain share, while also investing to reset the marketplace along the lines of the category offense.
On a reported basis, emerging markets revenue increased 3% for the quarter and the EBIT rose 65%, reflecting gross margin expansion and SG&A leverage.
At Converse, Q1 revenue grew 3% on a constant currency basis, driven primarily by double-digit growth in the U.S., partially offset by declines in certain European countries, primarily the U.K. The Converse brand remains strong and was further enhanced by the launch of the Chuck II in the first quarter. However, quarterly year-over-year comparisons will be somewhat uneven as we transition to a more direct operating model outside of the U.S. 
On a reported basis, Converse revenue declined 3% primarily due to the weaker euro. And EBIT decreased 21% for the quarter, driven primarily by lower sales in the U.K. as well as SG&A investments in infrastructure and Converse intellectual property enforcement efforts.
NIKE Inc. delivered strong financial performance in the first quarter despite significant FX headwinds. And we have healthy momentum across our global portfolio. Our outlook for the balance of the year reflects that momentum, as well as continued investment in our growth strategies and operational capabilities. Specifically, for Q2, we expect reported revenue growth at a mid-single-digit rate, generally in line with the growth rate for Q1, reflecting low-teens growth on a currency-neutral basis, largely offset by the impact of the stronger dollar. Our expectations for Q2 revenue also reflect the fact that our futures growth is more heavily weighted towards the back half of the futures window. For the full year, our outlook has slightly improved, but we continue to expect that reported revenue growth will be squarely within the mid-single-digit range. 
We expect gross margin for Q2 to expand by about 25 basis points, reflecting our efforts to expeditiously clear excess inventory in North America and keep the in-line channel fresh. For the full year, we continue to expect gross margin to expand by about 50 basis points, including our stronger-than-expected actual performance in Q1, combined with our current expectations for Q2 and the balance of the year. For total SG&A, we expect Q2 and the full year to grow at a high single-digit rate, reflecting continued investments in DTC, consumer-facing digital capabilities and infrastructure, as well as key brand events as we lead up to the Euro Champs and the Summer Olympics in Rio.
We continue to anticipate other income will have a more meaningful impact on our fiscal year '16 results than we have seen historically, as a portion of our expected FX hedge gains are reported in this line item. Absent significant changes in FX, we continue to expect other income will be about $50 million for each of the next 3 quarters.
We now expect our effective tax rate will be approximately 22% for the full year, including the lower actual rate in Q1 and an average rate of about 24% for Q2 through Q4. 
With that, we'll now open up for questions."

So we saw growth in all -- really all key categories, from Sportswear, Running to Basketball, we saw it in our wholesale and also in DTC. In DTC, our business actually grew 46% in DTC.

Q1, the biggest driver of what you saw in Q1 was comparisons to the World Cup investment in the prior year. As we have spoken about in the past, there are some dynamics in SG&A across demand creation and operating overhead. They has changed. Those are the drivers of some of the impact in Q1. That is more along the lines of how we engage with consumers. I think we have spoken to you about that over time that how we engage with consumers now expands into things that fall into that line item, operating overhead. In terms of SG&A. As you know, we look to deliver modest SG&A leverage over the long term, but in any given period, our actual investment may be higher or lower. Our guidance for this year reflects continuing to make investments in consumer engagement that we believe drive great returns from a revenue and margin perspective. One example of that would be in NIKE.com. We're also continuing to make infrastructure investments that we believe are required to support the growth that we're delivering and we're delivering on a consistent basis. And at the same time, enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of our operations. We are also increasing the productivity of our existing resources and infrastructure. So we do see greater productivity going forward and currently from our existing resources, that does add, as you noted, potentially to profit expansion, it also gives us greater capacity to invest strategically."

The expectations storytelling I think on NIKE are extraordinarily high as they should be. I think this year people not disappoint. I feel incredibly confident and excited frankly about the innovation pipeline, what's in the works, excited about sharing some of that later in the fiscal year with everyone. But I think this Olympics will be one of the best, if not really the best ever for NIKE. I've never seen an innovation pipeline so full. And we'll be ready. I mean, first and foremost, the athletes but also the consumer and the shareholder. I think everybody's been a benefit from our performance at the Olympics."

Our approach is to enhance the price value equation for consumers with innovation, design, inspiration and increasingly, service that expands that average gross selling price. We have not seen any resistance to that from consumers overall. Certainly within our broad portfolio, there are greater opportunities than in other areas. But we've seen consumers demonstrate a willingness to trade up for the innovation design inspiration and service that we're bringing."

Now before I move into a discussion on our business, I want to take a moment to introduce our new Chief Financial Officer, Andy Campion. As you know, Don Blair retired from the CFO role as of July 31, and I'm happy to formally welcome Andy into his new role. Andy has been a key member of the NIKE leadership team for the past 8 years and bring to his new role both a passion for the brand and a commitment to driving shareholder value. You'll hear from Andy at the end the call to discuss our results in detail, but let me start with a few of my thoughts as we begin the new fiscal year.
Last year at this time, I talked about our focus on 3 key areas: the depth of our relationships with our athletes and consumers; our fast-paced culture of innovation; and the power of our portfolio. We strengthened all of these areas throughout last year and we delivered tremendous results. In Q1, we carried that momentum forward with an outstanding start to fiscal year '16.
Let's take a look at the highlights from the first quarter. NIKE, Inc. revenues grew 5% to $8.4 billion despite significant FX headwind. On a currency-neutral basis, NIKE, Inc. revenues grew 14%. Gross margin expanded 90 basis points to 47.5% and earnings per share increased 23% to $1.34.
Ultimately, NIKE continues to succeed because of the deep relationships we have with the athlete and the consumer, relationships we know we must earn every day. And we have a thoughtful long-term growth plan, which we continue to execute at the highest level. We invest in our biggest opportunities, and we've built a diversified portfolio to give us the flexibility to pull the right levers at the right time to maximize growth. Our powerful portfolio of categories, geographies, brands and channels across men's, women's and young athletes is one of our greatest competitive advantages, and we continue to see new ways to unlock growth all over the world. And while we're not immune to the macroeconomic challenges that all businesses are facing, we are best positioned and best resourced to navigate the short term and thrive for the long term. NIKE is on a relentless pace, and we have no intention of slowing down.
Leveraging our portfolio is one way we sustain growth. The other, of course, is through innovation. We showed the power of our scale this quarter as we share technologies from one category to another and from one brand to another. This is how innovation can create separation, and this is something only NIKE can do.
Just a couple of quick highlights. In footwear, we launched the Pegasus 32 in June 2015, which featured high-performance Zoom Air technology. It delivers highly responsive cushioning and lightweight support to help athletes achieve their fastest run.
In the Jordan Brand, we introduced the Super.Fly 4 with FlightSpeed technology, offering lightweight comfort and impact protection.
In performance apparel, we just announced 2 new technologies that solve for temperature regulation in completely new ways, Therma-Sphere Max, a composite material designed for lightweight warmth and mobility for outdoor training; and then AeroReact, an adaptive material that reacts to the heat and moisture of the body. The fibers of the fabric open up when they get wet and they close as they dry out again, offering both active cooling and warmth all in one layer.
Going forward, you can expect to see further acceleration in our innovation agenda for performance apparel as we look ahead to the Summer Olympics in Rio and beyond. So stay tuned for more on that later in the year.
And in Sportswear apparel, we delivered our latest silhouettes of Tech Fleece for men and women. Over the past several seasons, NIKE Tech Pack has created great demand for premium Lifestyle apparel with technical performance innovation.
A great example of leveraging innovation across multiple dimensions of our business is reflected in Hurley, Jordan and Converse, utilizing NIKE technology to create exciting new concepts of their own. Hurley once again applied a footwear innovation to their industry-leading Phantom Elite board short, this time using NIKE Madwire [ph], a dynamic stability support system for a lockdown fit in the waistband.
The Jordan Brand continued to bring its unique perspective to Training with the Flight Flex Trainer 2 and its Nike Free inspired natural motion midsole. Looking ahead, we see tremendous opportunity for the Jordan Brand to transcend its core Basketball positioning into new areas of growth.
And finally, the legendary Chuck Taylor All Star received a performance innovation boost, adding a NIKE Lunarlon sockliner, a padded collar and breathable liner to the Converse classic. The Chuck Taylor All Star II brought new comfort details but stayed true to the silhouette that Chuck fans know and love. The potential for Converse has never been greater as we continue to expand globally and further diversify this great brand.
These are just a few examples that show how we take our best ideas and accelerate them across our categories and brands to serve our consumers and drive growth.
As you've heard me say many times, innovation at NIKE goes beyond product, and digital is a great example. Digital is an accelerator throughout NIKE. It is a platform that enables new ways of working and new methods of manufacturing. It drives how we connect with consumers, how we serve them and how we engage with one another. It also fuels our growth by serving our consumers whenever they want NIKE products for any sport all over the world.
Our digital ecosystem delivers a connected growing community, personal real time engagement and easier access to the product they love, head to toe. We stand alone because we connect all 3 to give the most holistic, premium experience to the consumer. And when we serve the consumer better through digital, we drive growth.
Just to look at this quarter's revenue for e-commerce business. It's up an incredible 46% on a constant currency basis, with robust growth across all of our geographies. We also saw a strong conversion and increased traffic, particularly on mobile.
Our Q1 results clearly demonstrate our ability to continue to drive sustainable, profitable growth. And while we feel great about the last 90 days, we remain laser focused on continuing this momentum over the balance of the fiscal year and beyond.
The rest of fiscal '16 is filled with important sports moments: the Super Bowl, the NBA All-Star Weekend, Euro Champs, and of course, the lead up to the Rio Olympics. Every one of them is an opportunity for NIKE, an opportunity to innovate for the athletes, to inspire the consumer and to grow the business. And just like the athletes we serve, these opportunities compel us to keep raising the bar because in the end, the power of NIKE not lies not only in our ability to see the future but to create it. And you can expect us to continue to do just that.
So thanks. And now here's Trevor."
291981,311181795,872709,"NIKE, Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Sep 24, 2015",2015-09-24,"Earnings Calls","NIKE, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Mark.

Q1 proved yet again the sustained power of the category offense. As we've said, the category offense drives deep and meaningful relationships with consumers. This provides us with great insights to create innovative products, rich services and inspiring experiences that our consumers love.
For the quarter, on a constant currency basis, NIKE Brand revenue grew 15%, with double-digit growth across nearly every geography and most key categories. NIKE Brand DTC revenue increased 21%, driven by new store expansion, continued strong growth in online sales, up 46%, and comp store growth of 7%. And we are very pleased with global futures, up a strong 17%. Clearly, the category offense continue to drive growth around the world and remains the foundation of our strategy as we look ahead. As always, we use the power of our vast portfolio to target the best growth opportunities for the brand. And what gives us that flexibility is the breadth and depth of our category expertise.
To see these dynamics in action, let's first take a look at Running. Our obsession with speed has driven us for years, so we never settle, always looking to shave off that extra second. This relentless focus on innovation can be seen in the momentum of our Zoom Air technology. Propelling the runner forward with an ultra responsive step, Zoom Air technology drives key product styles like our Pegasus 32, Vomero 10 and the Elite 8.
In Q1, Zoom helped ignite our global community of runners through a special event we called the Fastest Day on Earth, in which we challenge runners to run their fastest mile ever. The event concluded with NIKE celebrating each runner's fastest mile with a personalized video that included the runner's name, mile time and clips from their route using Google Street View. This storytelling saw excellent response, reaching millions of consumers across social media.
Looking at performance apparel. We continue to build on the growth momentum of NIKE Dri-FIT. We launched the Contour Running Top, which features zoned breathability for increased comfort and mobility. And to further express the runner's love of this sport, our Running-inspired Sportswear styles also continue to resonate. Two decades after its introduction, we celebrated the Air Max 95 by releasing the original silhouette. And we brought it into the future with new technologies in the Air Max 95 Ultra.
Another strong growth driver in Q1 was our women's business, with revenue growing double digits. We launched the highly anticipated training shoe, the Metcon 1 for women, which offers just a hint of what's to come in Training. We continue to lead with key apparel styles such as the Dri-FIT Knit, bras and Nike Pro Tights, all of which are important drivers for this business. And Sportswear delivered strong growth with footwear styles like the Roshe and the entire Air Max platform, which continues to be very popular with women. In addition to delivering innovative new products to the market, we also remained focused on creating compelling regional executions for her, both through our own DTC and with our wholesale partners.
The rollout of premium and elevated doors throughout the globe continues to drive this important business, as highlighted by an ongoing success of Foot Locker's SIX:02 executions and the launch of the Chelsea Collective doors with Dick's Sporting Goods. These effects we're seeing in women's is truly comprehensive as all facets of the business continue to excel, from products to services, from footwear to apparel and across sports and throughout the entire athlete's life. We are excited about the future of the women's business. With the shift towards -- the global shift towards the health and fitness as part of her lifestyle, we see tremendous opportunity for years to come.
Now let's shift on to a few of our key geographies. North America had a another great quarter, with revenues up 9% and futures up 15%. This geography continues to drive strong growth across nearly all key categories. Time and time again, even though this is our most developed market, North America proves that the right strategies can drive consistent, profitable growth. The energy of our brand in North America is clear, with continued strong demand across our executions with wholesale partners such as Dick's Sporting Goods, Foot Locker and the Finish Line. We continue to serve this consumer through our amplified strategy, delivering both performance and Lifestyle products. At the same time, we continue to work to effectively manage the flow of inventory in North America, including the impact of the West Coast port congestion from earlier this calendar year. While the flow of product from the port has now returned to normal, we are working to efficiently clear excess inventory to keep our Inline channel healthy.
In addition, we have recently expanded our North American distribution center and are working to bring this new capacity fully online. We expect both these efforts to be complete by the end of Q3 and inventory levels in North America to normalize at that time. Ultimately, our confidence in the category offense in North America gives us the road map to continue to unlock growth opportunities, both this year and far into the future.
Now let's turn to Western Europe. Q1 revenue grew 14%, driven by growth in all territories and nearly all key categories. This growth continues to be fueled by the transformation of the marketplace along the category offense. This work includes elevated executions at Intersport, the new Oxford Street location with JD Sports in London and the expansion of the House of Hoops of Foot Locker in Berlin. And our own DTC continues to perform very well, delivering 31% growth in Q1.
By being both deliberate and aggressive, we lead the market as Western Europe's most desired sports brand. We're excited about what the future holds as we execute our complete offense in Western Europe.
Now on to the emerging markets, which delivered strong Q1 results with revenue up 19%, driven by strong growth in Mexico and most key categories. The improvement we've seen in Mexico contributed significantly to the overall results in the geography as we see the benefit of investing in and elevating our distribution. For example, we launched the House for Her [ph] in Mexico City, a product showcase supported by great service, experience and community. Also, prominent marketplace executions with partners such as Liverpool, which is Mexico's largest department store, and Innovasport are also performing well. As these new doors prove, by elevating the marketplace, we grow the market in key geographies and territories. Overall, we believe we are now well positioned to drive profitable, long-term growth in Mexico.
In Brazil, revenue was flat, an improvement in trend and market share, but still reflective of the continued challenges in the macroeconomic landscape. That said, we continue to focus on our strategy of resetting the marketplace along the category offense. By focusing on differentiating our points of distribution and creating more compelling consumer experiences at retail and online, we drive increased productivity and profitability for NIKE and our wholesale partners. Overall, we continue to see tremendous growth potential for the emerging markets long term and are confident that we are executing the right strategies to realize that potential in this important geography.
Finally, in Greater China, revenue was up an amazing 30%, tremendous growth that again proves, more than ever, the success of our strategies. These gains were driven by strong performance across nearly all key categories, including Sportswear, Running and Basketball. For our wholesale partners like ByLee, the doors that have been reprofiled continue to outperform the rest of the fleet, driving expanded productivity and profitability. We also saw strong growth from our DTC business, driven by comp store sales increases and an acceleration in our e-commerce business.
It was a very active quarter for China in sports as Beijing hosted a track and field world championships in which athletes wearing NIKE footwear dominated, taking home the majority of medals awarded. And throughout quarter 1, athletes like LeBron James, Kobe, Anthony Davis and Paul George all participated in NIKE Basketball events throughout China, connecting with thousands of consumers through their shared passion of the sport. And just 2 days ago, we announced that Michael Jordan will travel to Shanghai in mid-October to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the Air Jordan franchise. All told, the incredible growth we saw in China this quarter reflects our ongoing efforts to align the marketplace to the category offense, a strategy that we expect will drive growth in this critical geography for many years to come.
In the end, the NIKE Brand started the new fiscal year with energy throughout the entire portfolio of geographies and categories, and we expect to leverage this energy going forward because at NIKE, the opportunities offered by our complete offense are limitless across men's, women's and young athletes and across categories, geographies, product types and also marketplaces.
Fiscal year '16 promises to be another year where the choices and investments we make propel us to serve the athlete with even more premium products, services and experiences. While we may be just out of the blocks in quarter 1, we are already in full sprint towards a year of continued growth of this brand and this company.
Thanks. And now on his first earnings call as NIKE's new CFO, here is Andy."
291981,311181795,872709,"NIKE, Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Sep 24, 2015",2015-09-24,"Earnings Calls","NIKE, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Mark and Trevor, and hello to our stakeholders on the call. I've had the pleasure of meeting many of you over the last several years, and I very much look forward to deeper engagement over time.With this being my first earnings call, I'd like",1633,"Thank you, Mark and Trevor, and hello to our stakeholders on the call. I've had the pleasure of meeting many of you over the last several years, and I very much look forward to deeper engagement over time.
With this being my first earnings call, I'd like to take a moment to reinforce a few of our long-standing guiding principles and also briefly touch on how we will continue to evolve and innovate.
Our primary financial objective has been, and will continue to be, delivering extraordinary value to our shareholders. Delivering value to shareholders is first and foremost a function of creating value for consumers. As consumer expectations continue to accelerate, NIKE will evolve and innovate to exceed those expectations. At NIKE, innovation is in our DNA. That applies to all dimensions of our business, from the products and services that we deliver to consumers to the operating and business models that we employ. That is what we call being on the offense always.
As we create value for consumers, we will continue to capture that value through disciplined and consistent financial management. NIKE knows how to grow. We're also deeply committed to ensuring that our growth is profitable, sustainable and capital efficient over the long term. We do that through robust gross margin management, continually enhancing the productivity of our resources and investing surgically and strategically in those opportunities with the highest potential for return.
Finally, as we create value for consumers and we capture that value financially, we will also deliver that value to shareholders through capital management, risk management and consistently increasing our cash returns through both share repurchases and dividends.
Having worked very closely with Mark, Trevor and my predecessor, Don, since joining NIKE in 2007, I'm deeply invested in the strategies that have fueled our strong performance to date. And I believe we have tremendous potential to grow and create value for both consumers and shareholders over the long term. As we say at NIKE, there is no finish line.
Our Q1 financial performance and outlook for the balance of the year reflect both the value we are creating for consumers and the principles that we apply to financial management. So I'm very pleased to share our results in more detail.
Q1 reported revenue for NIKE, Inc. increased 5% and grew 14% on a currency-neutral basis. The NIKE Brand grew 15% on a currency-neutral basis and Converse grew 3%. Growth in the NIKE Brand was broad-based and strong across all geographies and nearly all categories.
Also on a currency-neutral basis, NIKE Brand futures orders grew 17%, driven by an 11% increase in units and a 6% increase in average selling prices. Our futures growth reflects continued strong demand and healthy pull markets across the NIKE Brand portfolio. All geographies grew double digits, except emerging markets, which grew 6%. On a reported basis, futures grew 9%, reflecting a stronger U.S. dollar against nearly all international currencies.
Q1 diluted EPS grew 23% to $1.34 despite significant FX headwinds. Our EPS growth was driven by strong top line growth and effective financial management across all levers of the business. Gross margin expanded 90 basis points to 47.5%, primarily driven by higher average selling prices and continued strong growth in our higher-margin Direct-to-Consumer business, partially offset by higher product input cost and warehousing.
Q1 demand creation declined 7%, reflecting favorable comparisons against higher investment in the World Cup in the first quarter of fiscal 2015. Operating overhead increased 10% for the quarter, driven by variable costs associated with continued strong growth in our DTC business and targeted investments in consumer-focused digital capabilities and operational infrastructure.
Our effective tax rate was 18.4% for Q1, lower than prior year, primarily due to an increase in the proportion of earnings from operations outside of the U.S., which are generally subject to a lower tax rate, as well as certain nonrecurring items that were recognized in the first quarter.
As of August 31, inventories were up 10%, primarily to support strong demand across our business. Overall, inventories continue to be healthy around the globe. However, as Trevor discussed, we do expect inventories in North America to be somewhat elevated for the next 2 quarters. And we anticipate there will be an impact on gross margin in the near term as we work to clear excess inventory.
Now let's take a look at our performance by segment. North America delivered another strong quarter, with 9% revenue growth on a currency-neutral basis, driven by strength in nearly every key category, led by Sportswear, Basketball, Men's Training and Running. And consumer demand for NIKE remains strong in North America, with futures growth of 15% on a currency-neutral basis. On a reported basis, North America revenue grew 8% and EBIT grew 7% due to slightly lower gross margin, partially offset by SG&A leverage.
Western Europe also had a great quarter, with Q1 revenue up 14% on a currency-neutral basis, driven by growth in every territory. These results and our continued momentum in Western Europe reflect our broader and deeper execution of the category offense. Nearly all key categories delivered strong growth, fueled by Sportswear, Basketball and Running, while Global Football declined due to tough comparisons to higher World Cup revenues in the prior year. On a reported basis, Q1 revenue declined 4% due to weakness in the euro. However, EBIT increased 20%, driven by gross margin expansion and SG&A leverage.
In Central and Eastern Europe, Q1 revenue grew 26% on a currency-neutral basis, driven by double-digit growth in every territory except Greece and double-digit growth in nearly every key category. On a reported basis, Q1 revenue grew 2%, reflecting significantly weaker currencies, in particular the ruble and the Turkish lira. However, EBIT grew 42% due primarily to strong gross margin expansion and SG&A leverage.
Now turning to China, where revenue grew an impressive 30% for the quarter on both a reported and currency-neutral basis. While we are very mindful of the macroeconomic volatility in China, our brand has never been stronger and our marketplace has never been more healthy. We have momentum across nearly all key categories as well as continued strength in our DTC business. EBIT for China grew 51% in Q1 due to very strong revenue growth, gross margin expansion and SG&A leverage.
In our emerging markets geography, Q1 revenue increased 19% on a constant currency basis, as nearly all territories delivered strong growth in the quarter, driven by Mexico, Soco and Pacific. Nearly every key category grew for the quarter led by Sportswear, Action Sports and Basketball.
As Trevor discussed in his remarks, Mexico returned to strong growth as a result of our efforts to optimize inventory and reset that market. And while revenue is flat in Brazil, our brand is strong and we continue to gain share, while also investing to reset that marketplace along the lines of the category offense.
On a reported basis, emerging markets revenue increased 3% for the quarter and EBIT rose 65%, reflecting gross margin expansion and SG&A leverage.
At Converse, Q1 revenue grew 3% on a constant currency basis driven primarily by double-digit growth in the U.S., partially offset by declines in certain European countries, primarily the U.K. The Converse brand remains strong and was further enhanced by the launch of the Chuck II in the first quarter. However, quarterly year-over-year comparisons will be somewhat uneven as we transition to a more direct operating model outside of the U.S. 
On a reported basis, Converse revenue declined 3%, primarily due to the weaker euro. And EBIT decreased 21% for the quarter driven primarily by lower sales in the U.K. as well as SG&A investments in infrastructure and Converse intellectual property enforcement efforts.
NIKE, Inc. delivered strong financial performance in the first quarter despite significant FX headwinds, and we have healthy momentum across our global portfolio. Our outlook for the balance of the year reflects that momentum as well as continued investment in our growth strategies and operational capabilities. Specifically, for Q2, we expect reported revenue growth at a mid-single-digit rate, generally in line with the growth rate for Q1, reflecting low-teens growth on a currency-neutral basis, largely offset by the impact of the stronger dollar. Our expectations for Q2 revenue also reflect the fact that our futures growth is more heavily weighted towards the back half of the futures window. For the full year, our outlook has slightly improved, but we continue to expect that reported revenue growth will be squarely within the mid-single-digit range.
We expect gross margin for Q2 to expand by about 25 basis points, reflecting our efforts to expeditiously clear excess inventory in North America and keep the in-line channel fresh. For the full year, we continue to expect gross margin to expand by about 50 basis points, including our stronger-than-expected actual performance in Q1, combined with our current expectations for Q2 and the balance of the year. For total SG&A, we expect Q2 and the full year to grow at a high single-digit rate, reflecting continued investments in DTC, consumer-facing digital capabilities and infrastructure as well as key brand events as we lead up to the Euro Champs and the Summer Olympics in Rio.
We continue to anticipate other income will have a more meaningful impact on our fiscal year '16 results than we have seen historically as a portion of our expected FX hedge gains are reported in this line item. Absent significant changes in FX, we continue to expect other income will be about $50 million for each of the next 3 quarters.
We now expect our effective tax rate will be approximately 22% for the full year, including the lower actual rate in Q1 and an average rate of about 24% for Q2 through Q4. 
With that, we'll now open up for questions."

So we saw growth in all -- really all key categories from Sportswear, Running to Basketball, we saw it in our wholesale and also in DTC. In DTC -- our business actually grew 46% in DTC. And then in our wholesale partners' accounts, the stores that have been reprofiled, those stores actually continue to outperform the actual entire fleet, increasing both productivity and profitability. So we feel very, very good about the business and we stay really focused on delivering great product into the marketplace and really driving the category offense."

At the same time, we're working to efficiently clear the excess inventory to keep the in-line channel healthy. And we also put on our own North American distribution center, and we are working to actually put that capacity in place, and that will be fully online. We expect both of those efforts to be complete by the end of Q3, and that's really where we are around it. So again, we continue to feel very confident about the business in North America.

Omar, I'll hit that question, first, in terms of demand creation. Q1, the biggest driver of what you saw in Q1 was comparisons to the World Cup investment in the prior year. As we have spoken about in the past, there are some dynamics in SG&A across demand creation and operating overhead. That has changed. Those aren't drivers of some of the impact in Q1, that is more along the lines of how we engage with consumers. I think we have spoken to you about that over time that how we engage with consumers now expands into things that fall into that line item, operating overhead. In terms of SG&A, as you know, we look to deliver modest SG&A leverage over the long term. But in any given period, our actual investment may be higher or lower. Our guidance for this year reflects continuing to make investments in consumer engagement that we believe drive great returns from a revenue and margin perspective. One example of that would be in NIKE.com. We're also continuing to make infrastructure investments that we believe are required to support the growth that we're delivering and we're delivering on a consistent basis and, at the same time, enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of our operations. We are also increasing the productivity of our existing resources and infrastructure. So we do see greater productivity going forward and currently from our existing resources.

And as you know, we don't actually report specifically the size of the Jordan business today. But what I can say is that we continue to see tremendous success in the marketplace. So this summer in Paris, for example, the team was there, really executing the anniversary of the Jordan business. Michael actually went over there. I think he's going to go over into Shanghai also. So it is a sense of a global phenomenon that we're seeing as really just driving great sell-through and just great demand for the products and the brand. At the same time, we see an opportunity around the Training business, which is -- as I think Mark spoke to, which is we are expanding the business beyond Basketball into the Training segment. And so that's another area that we continue to see opportunity and potential growth around the world."

Now before I move into a discussion on our business, I want to take a moment to introduce our new Chief Financial Officer, Andy Campion. As you know, Don Blair retired from the CFO role as of July 31, and I'm happy to formally welcome Andy into his new role. Andy has been a key member of the NIKE leadership team for the past 8 years and bring to his new role both a passion for the brand and a commitment to driving shareholder value. You'll hear from Andy at the end the call to discuss our results in detail, but let me start with a few of my thoughts as we begin the new fiscal year.
Last year at this time, I talked about our focus on 3 key areas: the depth of our relationships with our athletes and consumers, our fast-paced culture of innovation, and the power of our portfolio. We strengthened all of these areas throughout last year and we delivered tremendous results. In Q1, we carried that momentum forward with an outstanding start to fiscal year '16.
Let's take a look at the highlights from the first quarter. NIKE, Inc. revenues grew 5% to $8.4 billion despite significant FX headwinds. On a currency-neutral basis, NIKE, Inc. revenues grew 14%. Gross margin expanded 90 basis points to 47.5% and earnings per share increased 23% to $1.34.
Ultimately, NIKE continues to succeed because of the deep relationships we have with the athlete and the consumer, relationships we know we must earn every day. And we have a thoughtful long-term growth plan, which we continue to execute at the highest level. We invest in our biggest opportunities, and we've built a diversified portfolio to give us the flexibility to pull the right levers at the right time to maximize growth. Our powerful portfolio of categories, geographies, brands and channels across men's, women's and young athletes is one of our greatest competitive advantages, and we continue to see new ways to unlock growth all over the world. And while we're not immune to the macroeconomic challenges that all businesses are facing, we are best positioned and best resourced to navigate the short term and thrive for the long term. NIKE is on a relentless pace, and we have no intention of slowing down.
Leveraging our portfolio is one way we sustain growth. The other, of course, is through innovation. We showed the power of our scale this quarter as we share technologies from one category to another and from one brand to another. This is how innovation can create separation, and this is something only NIKE can do.
Just a couple of quick highlights. In footwear, we launched the Pegasus 32 in June 2015, which featured high-performance Zoom Air technology. It delivers highly responsive cushioning and lightweight support to help athletes achieve their fastest run.
In the Jordan Brand, we introduced the Super.Fly 4 with FlightSpeed technology, offering lightweight comfort and impact protection.
In performance apparel, we just announced 2 new technologies that solve for temperature regulation in completely new ways: Therma-Sphere Max, a composite material designed for lightweight warmth and mobility for outdoor training; and then AeroReact, an adaptive material that reacts to the heat and moisture of the body. The fibers of the fabric open up when they get wet and they close as they dry out again, offering both active cooling and warmth all in one layer.
Going forward, you can expect to see further acceleration in our innovation agenda for performance apparel as we look ahead to the Summer Olympics in Rio and beyond. So stay tuned for more on that later in the year.
And in Sportswear apparel, we delivered our latest silhouettes of Tech Fleece for men and women. Over the past several seasons, NIKE Tech Pack has created great demand for premium Lifestyle apparel with technical performance innovation.
A great example of leveraging innovation across multiple dimensions of our business is reflected in Hurley, Jordan and Converse, utilizing NIKE technology to create exciting new concepts of their own. Hurley once again applied a footwear innovation to their industry-leading Phantom Elite board short, this time using NIKE Madwire [ph], a dynamic stability support system for a lockdown fit in the waistband.
The Jordan Brand continued to bring its unique perspective to Training with the Flight Flex Trainer 2 and its Nike Free-inspired natural motion midsole. Looking ahead, we see tremendous opportunity for the Jordan Brand to transcend its core Basketball positioning into new areas of growth.
And finally, the legendary Chuck Taylor All Star received a performance innovation boost, adding a NIKE Lunarlon sockliner, a padded collar and breathable liner to the Converse classic. The Chuck Taylor All Star II brought new comfort details but stayed true to the silhouette that Chuck fans know and love. The potential for Converse has never been greater as we continue to expand globally and further diversify this great brand.
These are just a few examples that show how we take our best ideas and accelerate them across our categories and brands to serve our consumers and drive growth.
As you've heard me say many times, innovation at NIKE goes beyond product, and digital is a great example. Digital is an accelerator throughout NIKE. It is a platform that enables new ways of working and new methods of manufacturing. It drives how we connect with consumers, how we serve them and how we engage with one another. It helps us fuel our growth by serving our consumers whenever they want NIKE products for any sport all over the world.
Our digital ecosystem delivers a connected growing community, personal real-time engagement and easier access to the product they love, head to toe. We stand alone because we connect all 3 to give the most holistic, premium experience to the consumer. And when we serve the consumer better through digital, we drive growth.
Just to look at this quarter's revenue for e-commerce business. It's up an incredible 46% on a constant currency basis, with robust growth across all of our geographies. We also saw strong conversion and increased traffic, particularly on mobile.
Our Q1 results clearly demonstrate our ability to continue to drive sustainable, profitable growth. And while we feel great about the last 90 days, we remain laser focused on continuing this momentum over the balance of the fiscal year and beyond.
The rest of fiscal '16 is filled with important sports moments: the Super Bowl, the NBA All-Star Weekend, Euro Champs, and of course, the lead up to the Rio Olympics. Every one of them is an opportunity for NIKE, an opportunity to innovate for the athletes, to inspire the consumer and to grow the business. And just like the athletes we serve, these opportunities compel us to keep raising the bar because in the end, the power of NIKE lies not only in our ability to see the future but to create it. And you can expect us to continue to do just that.
So thanks. And now here's Trevor."
291981,311181795,872716,"NIKE, Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Sep 24, 2015",2015-09-24,"Earnings Calls","NIKE, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Mark. It's a new fiscal year but the strong results continue for the NIKE Brand. Q1 proved yet again the sustained power of the category offense. As we've said, the category offense drives deep and meaningful relationships with consumers. This",1573,"Thank you, Mark. It's a new fiscal year but the strong results continue for the NIKE Brand. Q1 proved yet again the sustained power of the category offense. As we've said, the category offense drives deep and meaningful relationships with consumers. This provides us with great insights to create innovative products, rich services and inspiring experiences that our consumers love.
For the quarter, on a constant currency basis, NIKE Brand revenue grew 15%, with double-digit growth across nearly every geography and most key categories. NIKE Brand DTC revenue increased 21%, driven by new store expansion; continued strong growth in online sales, up 46%; and comp store growth of 7%. And we are very pleased with global futures, up a strong 17%. Clearly, the category offense continues to drive growth around the world and remains the foundation of our strategy as we look ahead. As always, we use the power of our vast portfolio to target the best growth opportunities for the brand. And what gives us that flexibility is the breadth and depth of our category expertise.
To see these dynamics in action, let's first take a look at Running. Our obsession with speed has driven us for years, so we never settle, always looking to shave off that extra second. This relentless focus on innovation can be seen in the momentum of our Zoom Air technology. Propelling the runner forward with an ultra-responsive step, Zoom Air technology drives key product styles like our Pegasus 32, Vomero 10 and the Elite 8.
In Q1, Zoom helped ignite our global community of runners through a special event we called the Fastest Day On Earth, in which we challenge runners to run their fastest mile ever. The event concluded with NIKE celebrating each runner's fastest mile with a personalized video that included the runner's name, mile time and clips from their route using Google Street View. This storytelling saw excellent response, reaching millions of consumers across social media.
Looking at performance apparel. We continue to build on the growth momentum of NIKE Dri-FIT. We launched the Contour Running Top, which features zoned breathability for increased comfort and mobility. And to further express the runner's love of this sport, our Running-inspired Sportswear styles also continue to resonate. Two decades after its introduction, we celebrated the Air Max 95 by releasing the original silhouette. And we brought it into the future with new technologies in the Air Max 95 Ultra.
Another strong growth driver in Q1 was our women's business, with revenue growing double digits. We launched the highly anticipated training shoe, the MetCon 1 for women, which offers just a hint of what's to come in Training. We continue to lead with key apparel styles such as the Dri-FIT Knit bras and Nike Pro Tights, all of which are important drivers for this business. And Sportswear delivered strong growth with footwear styles like the Roshe and the entire Air Max platform, which continues to be very popular with women. In addition to delivering innovative new products to the market, we also remained focused on creating compelling regional executions for her, both through our own DTC and with our wholesale partners.
The rollout of premium and elevated doors throughout the globe continues to drive this important business, as highlighted by the ongoing success of Foot Locker's SIX:02 executions and the launch of the Chelsea Collective doors with Dick's Sporting Goods. The effects we're seeing in women's is truly comprehensive as all facets of the business continue to excel, from products to services, from footwear to apparel and across sports and throughout the entire athlete's life. We are excited about the future of the women's business. With the shift towards -- the global shift towards the health and fitness as part of her lifestyle, we see tremendous opportunity for years to come.
Now let's shift on to a few of our key geographies. North America had another great quarter, with revenues up 9% and futures up 15%. This geography continues to drive strong growth across nearly all key categories. Time and time again, even though this is our most developed market, North America proves that the right strategies can drive consistent, profitable growth. The energy of our brand in North America is clear, with continued strong demand across our executions with wholesale partners such as Dick's Sporting Goods, Foot Locker and the Finish Line. We continue to serve this consumer through our amplified strategy, delivering both performance and Lifestyle products. At the same time, we continue to work to effectively manage the flow of inventory in North America, including the impact of the West Coast port congestion from earlier this calendar year. While the flow of product from the port has now returned to normal, we are working to efficiently clear excess inventory to keep our in-line channel healthy.
In addition, we have recently expanded our North American distribution center and are working to bring this new capacity fully online. We expect both these efforts to be complete by the end of Q3 and inventory levels in North America to normalize at that time. Ultimately, our confidence in the category offense in North America gives us the road map to continue to unlock growth opportunities, both this year and far into the future.
Now let's turn to Western Europe. Q1 revenue grew 14%, driven by growth in all territories and nearly all key categories. This growth continues to be fueled by the transformation of the marketplace along the category offense. This work includes elevated executions at Intersport, the new Oxford Street location with JD Sports in London and the expansion of the House of Hoops of Foot Locker in Berlin. And our own DTC continues to perform very well, delivering 31% growth in Q1.
By being both deliberate and aggressive, we lead the market as Western Europe's most desired sports brand. We're excited about what the future holds as we execute our complete offense in Western Europe.
Now on to the emerging markets, which delivered strong Q1 results with revenue up 19%, driven by strong growth in Mexico and most key categories. The improvement we've seen in Mexico contributed significantly to the overall results in the geography as we see the benefit of investing in and elevating our distribution. For example, we launched the House for Her [ph] in Mexico City, a product showcase supported by great service, experience and community. Also, prominent marketplace executions with partners such as Liverpool, which is Mexico's largest department store, and Innovasport are also performing well. As these new doors prove, by elevating the marketplace, we grow the market in key geographies and territories. Overall, we believe we are now well positioned to drive profitable, long-term growth in Mexico.
In Brazil, revenue was flat, an improvement in trend and market share, but still reflective of the continued challenges in the macroeconomic landscape. That said, we continue to focus on our strategy of resetting the marketplace along the category offense. By focusing on differentiating our points of distribution and creating more compelling consumer experiences at retail and online, we drive increased productivity and profitability for NIKE and our wholesale partners. Overall, we continue to see tremendous growth potential for the emerging markets long term and are confident that we are executing the right strategies to realize that potential in this important geography.
Finally, in Greater China, revenue was up an amazing 30%, tremendous growth that again proves, more than ever, the success of our strategies. These gains were driven by strong performance across nearly all key categories, including Sportswear, Running and Basketball. For our wholesale partners like ByLee, the doors that have been reprofiled continue to outperform the rest of the fleet, driving expanded productivity and profitability. We also saw strong growth from our DTC business, driven by comp store sales increases and an acceleration in our e-commerce business.
It was a very active quarter for China in sports as Beijing hosted the track and field world championships in which athletes wearing NIKE footwear dominated, taking home the majority of medals awarded. And throughout quarter 1, athletes like LeBron James, Kobe, Anthony Davis and Paul George all participated in NIKE Basketball events throughout China, connecting with thousands of consumers through their shared passion of the sport. And just 2 days ago, we announced that Michael Jordan will travel to Shanghai in mid-October to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the Air Jordan franchise. All told, the incredible growth we saw in China this quarter reflects our ongoing efforts to align the marketplace to the category offense, a strategy that we expect will drive growth in this critical geography for many years to come.
In the end, the NIKE Brand started the new fiscal year with energy throughout the entire portfolio of geographies and categories, and we expect to leverage this energy going forward because at NIKE, the opportunities offered by our complete offense are limitless across men's, women's and young athletes and across categories, geographies, product types and also marketplaces.
Fiscal year '16 promises to be another year where the choices and investments we make propel us to serve the athlete with even more premium products, services and experiences. While we may be just out of the blocks in quarter 1, we are already in full sprint towards a year of continued growth of this brand and this company.
Thanks. And now on his first earnings call as NIKE's new CFO, here is Andy."
291981,311181795,872716,"NIKE, Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Sep 24, 2015",2015-09-24,"Earnings Calls","NIKE, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Mark and Trevor, and hello to our stakeholders on the call. I've had the pleasure of meeting many of you over the last several years, and I very much look forward to deeper engagement over time.With this being my first earnings call, I'd like",1634,"Thank you, Mark and Trevor, and hello to our stakeholders on the call. I've had the pleasure of meeting many of you over the last several years, and I very much look forward to deeper engagement over time.
With this being my first earnings call, I'd like to take a moment to reinforce a few of our long-standing guiding principles and also briefly touch on how we will continue to evolve and innovate.
Our primary financial objective has been, and will continue to be, delivering extraordinary value to our shareholders. Delivering value to shareholders is, first and foremost, a function of creating value for consumers. As consumer expectations continue to accelerate, NIKE will evolve and innovate to exceed those expectations. At NIKE, innovation is in our DNA. That applies to all dimensions of our business, from the products and services that we deliver to consumers to the operating and business models that we employ. That is what we call being on the offense always.
As we create value for consumers, we will continue to capture that value through disciplined and consistent financial management. NIKE knows how to grow. We're also deeply committed to ensuring that our growth is profitable, sustainable and capital efficient over the long term. We do that through robust gross margin management, continually enhancing the productivity of our resources and investing surgically and strategically in those opportunities with the highest potential for return.
Finally, as we create value for consumers and we capture that value financially, we will also deliver that value to shareholders through capital management, risk management and consistently increasing our cash returns through both share repurchases and dividends.
Having worked very closely with Mark, Trevor and my predecessor, Don, since joining NIKE in 2007, I'm deeply invested in the strategies that have fueled our strong performance to date. And I believe we have tremendous potential to grow and create value for both consumers and shareholders over the long term. As we say at NIKE, there is no finish line.
Our Q1 financial performance and outlook for the balance of the year reflect both the value we are creating for consumers and the principles that we apply to financial management. So I'm very pleased to share our results in more detail.
Q1 reported revenue for NIKE, Inc. increased 5% and grew 14% on a currency-neutral basis. The NIKE Brand grew 15% on a currency-neutral basis and Converse grew 3%. Growth in the NIKE Brand was broad based and strong across all geographies and nearly all categories.
Also on a currency-neutral basis, NIKE Brand futures orders grew 17%, driven by an 11% increase in units and a 6% increase in average selling prices. Our futures growth reflects continued strong demand and healthy pull markets across the NIKE Brand portfolio. All geographies grew double digits, except emerging markets, which grew 6%. On a reported basis, futures grew 9%, reflecting a stronger U.S. dollar against nearly all international currencies.
Q1 diluted EPS grew 23% to $1.34 despite significant FX headwinds. Our EPS growth was driven by strong top line growth and effective financial management across all levers of the business. Gross margin expanded 90 basis points to 47.5%, primarily driven by higher average selling prices and continued strong growth in our higher-margin Direct-to-Consumer business, partially offset by higher product input cost and warehousing.
Q1 demand creation declined 7%, reflecting favorable comparisons against higher investment in the World Cup in the first quarter of fiscal 2015. Operating overhead increased 10% for the quarter, driven by variable costs associated with continued strong growth in our DTC business and targeted investments in consumer-focused digital capabilities and operational infrastructure.
Our effective tax rate was 18.4% for Q1, lower than prior year, primarily due to an increase in the proportion of earnings from operations outside of the U.S., which are generally subject to a lower tax rate, as well as certain nonrecurring items that were recognized in the first quarter.
As of August 31, inventories were up 10%, primarily to support strong demand across our business. Overall, inventories continue to be healthy around the globe. However, as Trevor discussed, we do expect inventories in North America to be somewhat elevated for the next 2 quarters. And we anticipate there will be an impact on gross margin in the near term as we work to clear excess inventory.
Now let's take a look at our performance by segment. North America delivered another strong quarter, with 9% revenue growth on a currency-neutral basis, driven by strength in nearly every key category, led by Sportswear, Basketball, Men's Training and Running. And consumer demand for NIKE remains strong in North America, with futures growth of 15% on a currency-neutral basis. On a reported basis, North America revenue grew 8% and EBIT grew 7% due to slightly lower gross margin, partially offset by SG&A leverage.
Western Europe also had a great quarter, with Q1 revenue up 14% on a currency-neutral basis, driven by growth in every territory. These results and our continued momentum in Western Europe reflect our broader and deeper execution of the category offense. Nearly all key categories delivered strong growth, fueled by Sportswear, Basketball and Running, while Global Football declined due to tough comparisons to higher World Cup revenues in the prior year. On a reported basis, Q1 revenue declined 4% due to weakness in the euro. However, EBIT increased 20%, driven by gross margin expansion and SG&A leverage.
In Central and Eastern Europe, Q1 revenue grew 26% on a currency-neutral basis, driven by double-digit growth in every territory except Greece and double-digit growth in nearly every key category. On a reported basis, Q1 revenue grew 2%, reflecting significantly weaker currencies, in particular the ruble and the Turkish lira. However, EBIT grew 42%, due primarily to strong gross margin expansion and SG&A leverage.
Now turning to China, where revenue grew an impressive 30% for the quarter on both a reported and currency-neutral basis. While we are very mindful of the macroeconomic volatility in China, our brand has never been stronger and our marketplace has never been more healthy. We have momentum across nearly all key categories as well as continued strength in our DTC business. EBIT for China grew 51% in Q1 due to very strong revenue growth, gross margin expansion and SG&A leverage.
In our emerging markets geography, Q1 revenue increased 19% on a constant currency basis, as nearly all territories delivered strong growth in the quarter, driven by Mexico, Soco and Pacific. Nearly every key category grew for the quarter, led by Sportswear, Action Sports and Basketball.
As Trevor discussed in his remarks, Mexico returned to strong growth as a result of our efforts to optimize inventory and reset that market. And while revenue was flat in Brazil, our brand is strong and we continue to gain share, while also investing to reset that marketplace along the lines of the category offense.
On a reported basis, emerging markets revenue increased 3% for the quarter and EBIT rose 65%, reflecting gross margin expansion and SG&A leverage.
At Converse, Q1 revenue grew 3% on a constant currency basis, driven primarily by double-digit growth in the U.S., partially offset by declines in certain European countries, primarily the U.K. The Converse brand remains strong and was further enhanced by the launch of the Chuck II in the first quarter. However, quarterly year-over-year comparisons will be somewhat uneven as we transition to a more direct operating model outside of the U.S. 
On a reported basis, Converse revenue declined 3%, primarily due to the weaker euro. And EBIT decreased 21% for the quarter, driven primarily by lower sales in the U.K. as well as SG&A investments in infrastructure and Converse intellectual property enforcement efforts.
NIKE, Inc. delivered strong financial performance in the first quarter despite significant FX headwinds, and we have healthy momentum across our global portfolio. Our outlook for the balance of the year reflects that momentum as well as continued investment in our growth strategies and operational capabilities. Specifically, for Q2, we expect reported revenue growth at a mid-single-digit rate, generally in line with the growth rate for Q1, reflecting low-teens growth on a currency-neutral basis, largely offset by the impact of the stronger dollar. Our expectations for Q2 revenue also reflect the fact that our futures growth is more heavily weighted towards the back half of the futures window. For the full year, our outlook has slightly improved, but we continue to expect that reported revenue growth will be squarely within the mid-single-digit range.
We expect gross margin for Q2 to expand by about 25 basis points, reflecting our efforts to expeditiously clear excess inventory in North America and keep the in-line channel fresh. For the full year, we continue to expect gross margin to expand by about 50 basis points, including our stronger-than-expected actual performance in Q1, combined with our current expectations for Q2 and the balance of the year. For total SG&A, we expect Q2 and the full year to grow at a high single-digit rate, reflecting continued investments in DTC, consumer-facing digital capabilities and infrastructure as well as key brand events as we lead up to the Euro Champs and the Summer Olympics in Rio.
We continue to anticipate other income will have a more meaningful impact on our fiscal year '16 results than we have seen historically, as a portion of our expected FX hedge gains are reported in this line item. Absent significant changes in FX, we continue to expect other income will be about $50 million for each of the next 3 quarters.
We now expect our effective tax rate will be approximately 22% for the full year, including the lower actual rate in Q1 and an average rate of about 24% for Q2 through Q4. 
With that, we'll now open up for questions."

So we saw growth in all -- really all key categories, from Sportswear to Running to Basketball. We saw it in our wholesale and also in DTC. In DTC -- our business actually grew 46% in DTC. And then in our wholesale partners' accounts, the stores that have been reprofiled, those doors actually continue to outperform the actual entire fleet, increasing both productivity and profitability.

Omar, I'll hit that question, first, in terms of demand creation. Q1, the biggest driver of what you saw in Q1 was comparisons to the World Cup investment in the prior year. As we have spoken about in the past, there are some dynamics in SG&A across demand creation and operating overhead. That has changed. Those aren't drivers of some of the impact in Q1, that is more along the lines of how we engage with consumers. I think we have spoken to you about that over time that how we engage with consumers now expands into things that fall into that line item, operating overhead. In terms of SG&A, as you know, we look to deliver modest SG&A leverage over the long term. But in any given period, our actual investment may be higher or lower. Our guidance for this year reflects continuing to make investments in consumer engagement that we believe drive great returns from a revenue and margin perspective. One example of that would be in NIKE.com. We're also continuing to make infrastructure investments that we believe are required to support the growth that we're delivering and we're delivering on a consistent basis and, at the same time, enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of our operations. We are also increasing the productivity of our existing resources and infrastructure. So we do see greater productivity going forward and currently from our existing resources.

Before I turn the call over to Ms. Hall, let me remind you that participants on this call will make forward-looking statements based on current expectations, and those statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. 
These risks and uncertainties are detailed in the reports filed with the SEC including Forms 8-K, 10-K and 10-Q. Some forward-looking statements concern future orders that are not necessarily indicative of changes in total revenues for subsequent periods due to a mix of futures and at-once orders, exchange rate fluctuations, order cancellations, changes in the timing of shipments, discounts and returns which may vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter. 
In addition, it is important to remember a significant portion of NIKE Inc.'s continuing operations, excluding [ph] equipment, NIKE Golf, Converse and Hurley are not included in these futures numbers. 
Finally, participants may discuss non-GAAP financial measures, including references to wholesale equivalent sales. References to wholesale equivalent sales are only intended to provide context as to the overall current market footprint of the brands owned by NIKE Inc. and should not be relied upon as a financial measure of actual results. 
Participants may also make references to other nonpublic financial and statistical information and non-GAAP financial measures.

291981,318461548,915389,"NIKE, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Dec 22, 2015",2015-12-22,"Earnings Calls","NIKE, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Kelley, and hello, everyone, and happy holidays. Q2 was another strong quarter for NIKE. We continued to show that we have the ability to drive both profitable growth and significant shareholder value over the long term. Let's take a look at th",1320,"Thank you, Kelley, and hello, everyone, and happy holidays. Q2 was another strong quarter for NIKE. We continued to show that we have the ability to drive both profitable growth and significant shareholder value over the long term. Let's take a look at the highlights from the second quarter. NIKE Inc. revenues grew 4% to $7.7 billion despite continued FX headwinds. On a currency-neutral basis, NIKE Inc. revenues grew 12%. Gross margin expanded 50 basis points and earnings per share increased 22% to $0.90.
The success you see today and the opportunities ahead are driven by the strength of our portfolio. NIKE has many dimensions to our business, and together, they're operating powerfully and efficiently. We're connecting deeply with consumers for products and experiences and capturing value through our strategic -- strategies and investments. Our complete offense, which includes our brands, geographies and categories, makes us flexible and keeps us close to the consumer so we can see and act on new opportunities in real time.
We see it in the markets we transform like China and Western Europe and in the businesses we accelerate like women's and the Jordan brand. Our operational scale is second to none. We have the power to grow the entire marketplace and innovate through our global supply chain that shipped roughly 1.1 billion units this last year.
And as we've shown consistently, everything we do is executed with a sharp focus and a financial discipline. We have a proven track record of delivering top line growth, expanding profitability and maintaining a high return on invested capital. And because we drive consistent profitable growth, we're able to deliver strong returns to our shareholders. 
For example, we recently announced a 4-year $12 billion share repurchase program. We increased our annual cash dividend for the 14th year in a row and we announced a 2-for-1 stock split. It's clear we have the right plan in place against the backdrop of a global movement of fitness and sports. It's all adding up to incredible momentum for our business. But we're never fully satisfied. More than ever, we're focused on the areas where we can continue to get better and making the necessary changes to ensure we continue to drive strong profitable growth for the long term.
The force behind today's results and our future potential is, of course, innovation. Our obsession and relentless drive to be better is at the core of our culture and our strategy. And as you know, it starts with product. We invent breakthroughs then build a thriving business around them. We told you during our Investor Day how we've built Flyknit from a concept to a billion-dollar platform in just 4 years. This is the kind of search for scalable innovation that's going on everyday at NIKE. And just as important is our focus on bringing innovations to market in a directed and productive way through merchandising and marketplace management across all channels and multiple price points.
Innovation is also fueled by partnerships. When we partner, it can be like setting off a chain reaction, leading us to new and better ideas more quickly. It's why we value our relationships with athletes, NIKE's original and most important collaborators. Our relationships with thousands of athletes, teams and federations do more than build our brand. They give us personal access to their insights and the science behind the problems they need to solve. 
That's why we work with the best athletes like Lebron and Serena, Christiana, along with everyday athletes, frankly like the rest of us. Partnerships also play a critical role in creating and expanding the marketplace. With our long-standing wholesale partners, we give consumers broad access to NIKE, and together, we segment and differentiate our assortments to drive mutually profitable retail.
At NIKE, collaboration is also a powerful strategy for activating new ways to work. As the clear leader in our industry, we align ourselves with leaders in other industries. To that end, we announced 2 new partnerships in October. The first is DreamWorks and their technology company called Novo. With this partnership, we combine the expertise of 2 design leaders, NIKE with the human body in motion and DreamWorks with the animated body in motion. I've been talking with our design teams and they see great potential in Nova's platforms to advance our creation process in capability, precision and speed.
The second is Flex. Many of you know about the impressive work that Flex does, who are already accelerating our manufacturing revolution efforts. It's in the early stages yet but in one specific process, they've combined automated material management with automated laser cutting, which can reduce waste by up to 50%. This is just one example of many that are in development. And what we learned from Flex, we expect to scale across our broad global source base. 
For the consumer, our partnership has the potential to expand their list of choices and accelerate delivery times from weeks to months -- I'm sorry, from weeks to days, strike that. Both partnerships are at an intersection of another vital innovation driver and that's digital. At NIKE, digital does more than just add capabilities for today. It defines how consumers will experience the NIKE brand moving forward. 
It's an accelerator across our business in product through the supply chain and analytics and all the way to retail. A few weeks ago, we shared our long-term vision for e-commerce growth, $7 billion in revenue by the end of fiscal year '20. In Q2, we continued our accelerated pace, growing the NIKE.com business nearly 50% on a constant currency basis. 
We added Canada, Switzerland and Norway to our expanding list of e-commerce markets, and next quarter, we're planning to do the same for the sport-obsessed cultures of Mexico, Turkey and Chile. When we expand our NIKE.com footprint, it gives new consumers access to the best of NIKE and it drives great energy for our business.
We have focused our investments in digital and mobile over the last several years and they're paying off. Driving the connection of NIKE.com to our broader digital strategy continues to be, without a doubt, one of our greatest opportunities as a company.
Digital, of course, also allows us to deepen the relationships we already have with consumers by tailoring every interaction to their specific needs. Through Nike+, we've created an ecosystem that gives athletes access to their fitness history, training programs and their favorite gear, every time they connect with NIKE. 
We started on this journey 10 years ago with Nike+, and we've continued to evolve the digital experience for consumers through multiple sports in the world's most important markets in both men's and women's. You'll hear more from us about this later in the fiscal year, but we're continuing our never-ending quest to make the digital experience simple and personal. Simple moving toward 1 access point for the best of NIKE and personal, more and more tailored to the individual.
We're now entering one of the most exciting periods of sport. The second half of fiscal '16 is filled with some of the world's greatest sports moments. Super Bowl 50, the NBA All-Star Weekend, March Madness, Copa America, Euro '16, and of course, the run-up to the Rio Olympics. In these moments like the athletes we serve, NIKE is at the top of our game. And this year, you will see NIKE unlocking innovation for athletes like never before. 
We have a full pipeline that will help Olympic athletes change the course of their sports and experiences that will change how all athletes train and run. I'm proud of this quarter and our incredible team behind the results. They are the reason NIKE continues to drive growth and value for our shareholders. And like me, they're all focused on continuing our momentum and delivering inspiring innovation to athletes everywhere for years to come.
Thank you, everyone. And now, here's Trevor."
291981,318461548,915389,"NIKE, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Dec 22, 2015",2015-12-22,"Earnings Calls","NIKE, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Mark. Happy holidays, everyone. The NIKE Brand delivered another impressive quarter, demonstrating the tremendous momentum of the NIKE brand. Let's take a look at the numbers. On a constant currency basis, NIKE Brand revenue grew 13%, with do",1879,"Thank you, Mark. Happy holidays, everyone. The NIKE Brand delivered another impressive quarter, demonstrating the tremendous momentum of the NIKE brand. Let's take a look at the numbers. 
On a constant currency basis, NIKE Brand revenue grew 13%, with double-digit growth across every geography and most key categories. NIKE Brand DTC revenue increased 26%, driven by 13% comp store growth, continued strong growth in online sales up 49% and new store expansion. And we are very pleased with the continued strength in global futures, up 20%. 
As always, these results are due to NIKE's world-class ability to understand the consumer, what they need and what inspires them. Those connections let us see the biggest growth opportunities and then sharpen our focus to best attack them. It's these powerful relationships that drive our category offense, providing us insights to create the innovative products, meaningful services and inspiring experiences that athletes all over the world love. 
Let me highlight 3 categories that demonstrate this powerful consumer focus. Let's first take a look at running. Running is our largest performance category and continued to deliver strong results, with Q2 revenue growing at a double-digit rate. At NIKE, we know that running never stops. No matter the season, no matter the conditions, we provide solutions to help runners get out and pursue their goals. 
This quarter, with winter setting in, we released our Flash Pack collection, which offers a reflective print to keep runners visible and warm in low-light conditions. The Flash Pack includes apparel such as the Aeroloft Flast Vest and the Shield Flash Running Jacket as well as great footwear including the popular Air Zoom Pegasus and the Air Zoom Structure 19. All told, this collection offers yet another great example of how NIKE innovates to expand the market.
Other running footwear successes in Q2 include the launch of the Air Zoom Odyssey, which offers 3 densities of foam for maximum stability and support; and the Air Max 2016 with its complete cushioning and durable ride, thanks to a full-length Max Air unit. At the same time, as part of our continued Amplify strategy, we expand our performance with Pinnacle Sportswear Products to enable our consumers to express their love of sport. 
Part of their strategy is a constant focus on sports, style, innovation. In our Running and Sportswear, we are driving a steady stream of great products with strong sell-through. This include the Tech Pack and the Aeroloft apparel styles as well as the continued success of the and the new Air Max Ultra line. Finally, our Pinnacle products are always complemented by unique experiences as only NIKE can do. Every year, Q2 is a season for some of the most popular running events, including the Shanghai Marathon and the Women's Half Marathon in San Francisco. The enthusiasm we see at these races echoes throughout the entire running category year after year.
Next, Basketball. For years, we have built deep and meaningful relationships with basketball fans through 2 of the largest most powerful brands in the world, NIKE and Jordan. Together, we have the deepest roster of athletes and the most global reach with federations and leagues around the world. 
As we said in October, we will start breaking out the Jordan brand separately from Nike Basketball, so I'll give you a few highlights from both. In Nike Basketball, we saw mid-single-digit growth in Q2, fueled by key products such as the Kyrie 1. This product delivers responsive cushioning with Zoom Air and ultra support with the hyper fuse construction. And it has seen tremendous sell-through since the launch a year ago. 
And just last week, we launched -- the launch of the Kyrie 2 has already seen strong consumer response with a first-of-its-kind midsole and outsole designed to enhance the rapid cuts that players make on the court. 
Another example of basketball innovation is the recently introduced Kobe 11, a high-performance low top that utilizes the latest Flyknit technology for lightweight strength, a stronger iteration to achieve peak performance. Our athletes always serve as an amazing source of inspiration for us, from Lebron and Kobe to young players have an incredible seasons like Paul George and Anthony Davis. These athletes and more are featured in our latest basketball campaign, Bring Your Game. This campaign will launch in full on Christmas Day to inspire and motivate young players to bring the best to the court every single day. 
And speaking of great athletes featuring the campaign, Elena Delle Donne, won the WNBA's Most Valuable Player, which was awarded just before the launch of our new Women's Basketball collection. The sell-through has been beyond strong, and with women making up roughly 40% of basketball players, we are just scratching the surface on how we can serve this growing community.
As we continue to sharpen our focus on running, a complete offense in Nike Basketball, we are excited about the deep pipeline of products we will be bringing to the market in the coming seasons, all of which help us capture the significant potential that lies ahead. 
Now for the Jordan Brand. This is the start of an exciting new era for Jordan. Even as we expand this brand both globally and into other categories, Jordan's Basketball products continue to be the most coveted and premium on the market. This brand proves, time and again, its ability to combine its iconic silhouettes with fresh styles. 
For Q2, Jordan delivered strong double-digit growth with the new CP3.IX and the launch of the Air Jordan 29 Low, driving incredible consumer response. Like Nike Basketball, Jordan has a deep roster of elite players including Chris Paul and Russell Westbrook. 
What's more, in October, Michael Jordan himself visited basketball fans in Hong Kong, Shanghai and Tokyo to celebrate the brand's 30th anniversary, helping to ignite the culture of basketball around the world. His visit drove strong consumer engagement with the new Jordan House of Flight in Shanghai and the flight training camps for young players across the markets. These cultural moments prove what we already know: that the power of this brand extends well beyond the game.
All of this excitement can be seen at retail, highlighted by the Jordan executions with Dick Sporting Goods and Energy Pack opening of our new Jordan store on State Street in Chicago, a great execution with foot action. This store will operate as a pinnacle retail experience, celebrating the performance, style and soul of the brand. What's more, directly above the store is a training lab serving elite high school athletes in the local area.
Our consumers' passion for both the NIKE and Jordan Brands is driving tremendous energy and speak to the significant opportunities that remains for our Basketball business around the world.
Now let's take a look at a few of our key geographies. North America had another strong quarter, with revenues up 10% and futures up 14%. This geography continues to drive strong growth across most key categories. Whilst this is our most developed market, North America proves that the right strategies can drive consistent profitable growth. 
Our brand in North America has never been stronger with men, with women, with athletes in all sports. We are seeing continued strong demand across our executions with wholesale partners such as Foot Locker and Dick Sporting Goods. Our own DTC business also had another strong quarter, up 17%, led by ongoing strength in NIKE.com and comp store growth.
As we've discussed in prior quarters, we continue to work effectively to manage the flow of product in North America and efficiently clear excess inventory. We are also continuing to work to bring our new North American distribution center fully online. Both of these efforts are making good progress. We expect inventory levels in North America to normalize over the balance of the fiscal year as we continue to take appropriate actions to maintain a healthy market for the NIKE Brand. Looking ahead, we see nothing but long-term potential for our North American business.
Now let's turn to Western Europe, where we see broad-based demand with strong revenue growth of [ph] 12% in the quarter and futures up 25%. We fueled growth in Q2 by continuing to transform the marketplace along the category offense with elevated executions at JD Sports, Foot Locker and into Sport. In addition, our own DTC business delivered 26% growth in the quarter. 
This growth from Western Europe is what we've come to expect with key categories of sportswear and Global Football showing continued strength. This momentum has solidified NIKE as the region's most coveted sports brand with strong growth across all territories. This geography-wide market growth, coupled with market share gains, proves the clear success of our efforts in Western Europe and the vast potential this geography offers for years to come.
In the emerging markets, we are seeing improved revenue growth, with Q2 revenues up 11% and futures growth of 14%. Growth in the quarter was driven by most territories, with particular strength in Mexico as we continued to benefit from our recent efforts over the last year. We also saw strong growth in the key categories of Sportswear and Running. 
Now in Brazil, revenue was down 6%, reflective of the continued challenges in the macroeconomic landscape. Our brand remains strong in Brazil, and we're gaining share as we remain focused on our strategy of resetting of the market along the category offense. As we focus on differentiating our points of distribution and proactively managing the product into the marketplace, retail inventory levels in Brazil remain healthy.
We continue to focus on creating more compelling consumer experiences at retail and online and driving increased productivity and profitability for NIKE and our wholesale partners. Overall, we continue to see tremendous long-term growth potential for the emerging markets, and we remain focused on doing the right things in the marketplace to capture that growth. 
Lastly, Greater China had another amazing quarter, with revenue growth of 28%. The strength of the NIKE Brand is fueled in strong consumer demand with futures up 34% in a marketplace that continues to be very healthy. We saw strong growth across nearly all categories in the quarter, led by Sportswear, Running and NIKE Basketball. We also sell continued strong growth from our own DTC business, up 51% in the quarter, fueled in part by our most successful Single's Day event ever.
And NIKE.com is showing extraordinary growth in China in one of the most mobile and connected countries on the planet. The success we're seeing today in China stems from decisions we made just a few years ago to align our teams against the biggest opportunities to drive growth with our category offense. By staying focused and diligent, we continue to lead the market as the region's most coveted sports brand, and we see significantly more opportunity ahead.
2015 was the single greatest calendar year ever for the NIKE Brand. It proves yet again that we have the product, the services and the brand experiences that consumers want. And as we find new ways to surprise and delight athletes around the world, there's no telling what we can do. I can't wait for 2016 and the inspiration and innovation I know we're going to bring. And now, here's Andy. Thank you."

We delivered on our goals in terms of both top line growth and profitability. We also continued to have strong momentum across our uniquely diverse global portfolio of businesses. 
We are driving and delivering these strong financial results even in the midst of volatile macroeconomic environment. And we continue to do so by: one, staying relentlessly focused on creating value for our consumers, leading with innovation; two, effectively managing all of the operating and financial levers within our business to capture value for NIKE; and three, deploying our capital strategically to fuel long-term growth while also consistently expanding total returns to shareholders.
I'll briefly touch on how we delivered against each of those 3 dimensions within the quarter. First, by executing the category offense, we continue to more deeply serve and create value for our consumers around the world. In Q2, that translated into double-digit revenue growth in all of our geographies on a currency-neutral basis. As both Mark and Trevor highlighted, we served consumers through the launch of innovative new products in multiple categories, and we also scaled recent product innovations such as Tech Pack, Aeroloft and Flyknit more broadly across our performance categories and Sportswear. At the same time, we continue to transform where and how we serve our consumers, leading with the expansion of NIKE.com, while also scaling premium category-oriented retail experiences with our partners around the world.
In Q2, we also effectively managed all of the operating and financial levers within our business to translate our strong top line growth into expanding profitability. That included gross margin expansion through sustained strategic pricing and product cost management as well as leveraging productivity gains to ensure we deliver appropriate near-term profitability while also continuing to make the investments required to fuel our long-term growth. 
Those investments included, for example, accelerating our investment in product innovation, building critical operating infrastructure within our supply chain and from a technology perspective and investing to maintain a healthy market in North America in service of the continued strong demand for our brand.
What sets NIKE apart in terms of operating and financial management is our ability to strike the right balance between the short and the long term. Our goal is to win now and create the future. And the breadth and depth of our global portfolio of businesses affords us the flexibility to strike that balance quarter after quarter, year after year. 
Finally, as we created value for consumers and captured that value for NIKE, we also continued to deliver significant value to our shareholders. Our top priority in terms of the use of our cash will remain reinvesting in our business against opportunities to drive growth and strong returns. That's what we call the virtuous cycle that sustains NIKE's leadership position and expands the value of our enterprise. 
The strong cash flows that we generate also allow us to consistently increase our cash returns to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. As Mark touched on, in the second quarter, we announced a new $12 billion 4-year share repurchase program and a 14% increase in our cash dividend.
Over the last 15 years, we have sustained strategic investment in the business while also returning nearly $25 billion to shareholders. That is a track record that we're proud of and one that we will continue to build upon.
Now I'll turn to a more detailed review of our Q2 financial results. Q2 reported revenue for NIKE Inc. increased 4% and grew 12% on a currency-neutral basis. The NIKE Brand grew 13% on a currency-neutral basis as growth was strong across all geographies and nearly all categories. Converse revenue declined 5% on a currency-neutral basis as growth in North America and Asia Pacific was more than offset by declines in Europe, particularly the U.K.
Also on a currency-neutral basis, NIKE Brand futures orders grew 20%, reflecting continued strong demand, driven by a 12% increase in units, with an increase in average selling prices contributing 8 percentage points. Our futures growth reflects the strength of our brand and business around the globe, with all geographies growing at a double-digit pace. On a reported basis, futures grew 15%, taking into account the stronger U.S. dollar against nearly all international currencies.
Q2 diluted EPS grew 22% to $0.90 despite significant FX headwinds. EPS growth was driven by strong top line growth, gross margin expansion and effective financial management across all of the levers through to the bottom line. Gross margin expanded 50 basis points to 45.6%, primarily driven by higher average selling prices, partially offset by higher product input costs and unfavorable foreign exchange.
Q2 demand creation was flat, reflecting favorability from the quarterly timing of our investments in the current versus prior year. Operating overhead increased 7% for the quarter, driven by costs associated with strong growth in our DTC business and investments in operational infrastructure and consumer-facing digital capabilities.
Our effective tax rate was 19.1% for Q2, lower than prior year, primarily due to adjustments to tax expense on intercompany transactions in the prior year and an increase in the mix of earnings from operations outside the U.S. in the current year, which are generally subject to a lower tax rate. Those favorable factors were partially offset by benefits from the resolution of several tax audits recognized in the prior year.
As of November 30, our inventories were up 11%, primarily to support strong wholesale and owned retail demand as reflected in our futures orders. Overall, our inventories continue to be healthy around the world. As we noted last quarter, our inventory in North America will be somewhat elevated over the balance of the fiscal year as we proactively manage the marketplace. More expeditiously, clearing high-quality but excess inventory while bringing a strong pipeline of new innovative products to the market over the same horizon. These efforts will unfavorably impact gross margin in the near term, which is reflected in our guidance for the balance of this fiscal year.
Now let's review our performance by segment. North America revenue grew 10% on a currency-neutral basis, with double-digit revenue growth across many of our largest categories, including Jordan, Sportswear, Running and men's training. We continue to experience strong consumer demand for the NIKE Brand in North America as evidenced by futures growth of 14%. On a reported basis, North America grew 9% and EBIT grew 12% as revenue growth and SG&A leverage more than offset a slight decline in gross margin, resulting from the clearance of inventory.
Moving on to Western Europe. Revenue increased 12% on a currency-neutral basis, driven by double-digit growth in every territory. The implementation of our category offense across jurisdictional lines continues to drive strong and sustainable growth for NIKE in this geography. Most categories delivered strong growth, led by Sportswear and Global Football. On a reported basis, Q2 revenue declined 1% due to weakness in the euro. However, EBIT increased 18%, primarily driven by gross margin expansion.
In Central and Eastern Europe, Q2 revenue grew 15% on a currency-neutral basis, driven by double-digit growth in most territories except Greece, which declined. Most categories also grew double digits, led by Sportswear, Running and Global Football. On a reported basis, Q2 revenue declined 6%, reflecting significantly weaker currencies, in particular, the ruble and the Turkish lira. However, EBIT grew 33% due to strong gross margin expansion. 
In Greater China, we continue to deliver extraordinary revenue growth, with Q2 revenue up 28% on a currency-neutral basis. The NIKE Brand continues to lead in China, transforming the marketplace to better serve consumers. As a result, our growth is strong across nearly all key categories, led by Sportswear, Running, Nike Basketball and Jordan. On a reported basis, Q2 revenue increased 24% and EBIT grew 27% due to very strong revenue growth, coupled with gross margin expansion.
In our emerging markets geography, Q2 revenue increased 11% on a currency-neutral basis as most territories delivered strong growth in the quarter, driven by Soco, Mexico and Pacific while Brazil declined. Nearly every key category also grew in the quarter, led by Sportswear and Running. On a reported basis, emerging markets revenue declined 8% for the quarter due to foreign currency headwinds while EBIT increased 2%, reflecting strong gross margin expansion.
While we have momentum in most territories within the emerging markets, as Trevor discussed, we are continuing to reset Brazil. While we are taking share and inventory levels at retail are healthy, our focus is on fueling long-term growth through more elevated category experiences in that marketplace.
Shifting from the NIKE Brand to Converse. Converse revenue declined 5% on a currency-neutral basis in Q2, with growth in North America and other developing markets offset by declines in certain European countries, primarily the U.K. The Converse brand remains incredibly strong around the world. And to help realize the full potential of the brand going forward, we're more actively leveraging NIKE capabilities and innovation platforms to diversify the Converse product portfolio as well as elevate our operating capabilities in recently transitioned international markets. On a reported basis, Converse revenue declined 8%, primarily due to the weaker euro. And EBIT decreased 3% for the quarter, driven primarily by lower revenue and gross margin.
NIKE Inc. delivered strong financial performance over the first half of fiscal year '16, and we have significant momentum across our global portfolio. As a result, our outlook for the full year remains consistent. Specifically, for Q3, we expect reported revenue to grow at a high single- to low double-digit rate, reflecting midteens growth on a currency-neutral basis, somewhat offset by the impact of the strong dollar.
While our futures growth is higher than our Q3 revenue guidance, it is important to remember that revenue expectations in any given fiscal period can be impacted by several factors, including, for example, the weighting of futures by month, the flow of product into the market within a season, the timing of shipments to our wholesale customers as well as the timing of sell-through to our consumers in our DTC business. For the full year, we continue to expect reported revenue growth will be in a mid-single-digit range.
We expect gross margin for Q3 to be down by about 50 basis points, reflecting our efforts to more expeditiously clear inventory in North America while bringing new innovative products to market. For the full year, we continue to expect gross margin to expand by about 50 basis points, reflecting our strong performance in the first half of the fiscal year, combined with our current expectations for Q3 and Q4. 
For total SG&A, we expect Q3 to grow at a low to mid-teens rate, reflecting our continued investments in DTC, consumer-facing digital capabilities, infrastructure and key brand events such as Super Bowl 50, the NBA All-Star Weekend and the timing of brand campaigns in support of select strategic categories. For the full year, we continue to expect total SG&A will grow at a high single-digit rate.
We continue to anticipate that other income will have a more meaningful impact on our fiscal year '16 results than we have seen historically, as a portion of our expected FX hedge gains are reported in this line item. Absent further changes in FX, we expect other income will be about $30 million for each of the next 2 quarters.
We now expect our effective tax rate will be approximately 20% for the full year, reflecting a lower rate in the first half of the fiscal year and an average rate of about 22% for the second half of the fiscal year.
Q2 was another quarter of strong revenue growth and expanding profitability for NIKE. As we embark on the second half of our fiscal year, we have brand and business momentum. We are on the offense and we will remain disciplined financially, as always, to ensure that we deliver appropriate growth and profitability in the near term while also investing strategically for the long term. NIKE is on track to deliver another year of strong financial performance and returns to shareholders. 
With that, we'll now open it up for questions."

I was just -- that as it relates actually both to China and also Japan, I think first let's start with in both markets, we have incredible brand strength in both of those markets. And in China specifically, as you recall, we spent time resetting the marketplace, and we are now seeing the results of that reset really take place. They had an incredible quarter. I was actually just recently there. We're seeing just great growth across the Sportswear, the Running, the Basketball business. The dotcom business is doing exceptionally well. And so also, working with our key partners, the transformation efforts that we put in place are actually now really, really working well. So we see great sell-through in the market, and we see really good health of the inventory. So all the dimensions really would say that China is in a great place. We feel confident about the long-term potential of the market. Similarly in Japan, with the futures, what we're certainly seeing in Japan is that they went through similar efforts to really make sure we stayed focus on the brand. We have an incredible pipeline of products come in. The DTC, the dotcom business is doing exceptionally well there too. And we continue to work with our partners really well too. So a similar story in those marketplaces. Obviously, I think it all stems from great brand strength that gives us real great confidence about the long-term potential of both of those markets."

We proactively delayed some products in favor of priority products that we felt would actually work well in the marketplace. A smaller portion of the product is the stuff that didn't sell through as we would have liked in the marketplace, and we're clearing that as part of the normal course of business to really keep the in-line channel healthy and at the same time, allows us, gives us the room to bring in more new fresh products.

Before I turn the call over to Ms. Hall, let me remind you that participants on this call will make forward-looking statements based on current expectations, and those statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. 
These risks and uncertainties are detailed in the reports filed with the SEC, including Forms 8-K, 10-K and 10-Q. Some forward-looking statements concern future orders that are not necessarily indicative of changes in total revenues for subsequent periods due to a mix of futures and at-once orders, exchange rate fluctuations, order cancellations, changes in the timing of shipments, discounts and returns which may vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter. In addition, it is important to remember a significant portion of NIKE, Inc.'s continuing operations, including equipment, NIKE Golf, Converse and Hurley, are not included in these futures numbers. 
Finally, participants may discuss non-GAAP financial measures, including references to wholesale equivalent sales. References to wholesale equivalent sales are only intended to provide context as to the overall current market footprint of the brands owned by NIKE, Inc. and should not be relied upon as a financial measure of actual results. 
Participants may also make references to other nonpublic financial and statistical information and non-GAAP financial measures.

291981,318461548,915392,"NIKE, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Dec 22, 2015",2015-12-22,"Earnings Calls","NIKE, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Kelley, and hello, everyone, and happy holidays. Q2 was another strong quarter for NIKE. We continued to show that we have the ability to drive both profitable growth and significant shareholder value over the long term. Let's take a look at",1324,"Thank you, Kelley, and hello, everyone, and happy holidays. Q2 was another strong quarter for NIKE. We continued to show that we have the ability to drive both profitable growth and significant shareholder value over the long term. 
Let's take a look at the highlights from the second quarter. NIKE, Inc. revenues grew 4% to $7.7 billion despite continued FX headwinds. On a currency-neutral basis, NIKE, Inc. revenues grew 12%. Gross margin expanded 50 basis points and earnings per share increased 22% to $0.90.
The success you see today and the opportunities ahead are driven by the strength of our portfolio. NIKE has many dimensions to our business, and together, they're operating powerfully and efficiently. We're connecting deeply with consumers for products and experiences and capturing value through our strategic -- through our strategies and investments. Our complete offense, which includes our brands, geographies and categories, makes us flexible and keeps us close to the consumer so we can see and act on new opportunities in real time. We see it in the markets we transform like China and Western Europe and in the businesses we accelerate like Women's and the Jordan Brand. Our operational scale is second to none. We have the power to grow the entire marketplace and innovate through our global supply chain that shipped roughly 1.1 billion units this last year. And as we've shown consistently, everything we do is executed with a sharp focus and a financial discipline. We have a proven track record of delivering top line growth, expanding profitability and maintaining a high return on invested capital. And because we drive consistent profitable growth, we're able to deliver strong returns to our shareholders. For example, we recently announced a 4-year $12 billion share repurchase program. We increased our annual cash dividend for the 14th year in a row, and we announced a 2-for-1 stock split. It's clear we have the right plan in place against the backdrop of a global movement of fitness and sports. It's all adding up to incredible momentum for our business, but we're never fully satisfied. More than ever, we're focused on the areas where we can continue to get better and making the necessary changes to ensure we continue to drive strong profitable growth for the long term.
The force behind today's results and our future potential is, of course, innovation. Our obsession and relentless drive to be better is at the core of our culture and our strategy. And as you know, it starts with product. We invent breakthroughs then build a thriving business around them. We told you during our Investor Day how we've built Flyknit from a concept to a billion-dollar platform in just 4 years. This is the kind of search for scalable innovation that's going on every day at NIKE, and just as important is our focus on bringing innovations to market in a directed and productive way through merchandising and marketplace management across all channels and multiple price points.
Innovation is also fueled by partnerships. When we partner, it can be like setting off a chain reaction, leading us to new and better ideas more quickly. It's why we value our relationships with athletes, NIKE's original and most important collaborators. Our relationships with thousands of athletes, teams and federations do more than build our brand. They give us personal access to their insights and the science behind the problems they need to solve. That's why we work with the best athletes like Lebron and Serena, Cristiano, along with everyday athletes, frankly like the rest of us. Partnerships also play a critical role in creating and expanding the marketplace. With our long-standing wholesale partners, we give consumers broad access to NIKE, and together, we segment and differentiate our assortments to drive mutually profitable retail.
At NIKE, collaboration is also a powerful strategy for activating new ways to work. As the clear leader in our industry, we align ourselves with leaders in other industries. To that end, we announced 2 new partnerships in October. The first is DreamWorks and their technology company called NOVA. With this partnership, we've combined the expertise of 2 design leaders: NIKE with the human body in motion and DreamWorks with the animated body in motion. I've been talking with our design teams and they see great potential in NOVA's platforms to advance our creation process in capability, precision and speed.
The second is Flex. Many of you know about the impressive work that Flex does, who are already accelerating our manufacturing revolution efforts. It's in the early stages yet, but in one specific process, they've combined automated material management with automated laser cutting, which can reduce waste by up to 50%. This is just one example of many that are in development, and what we learned from Flex, we expect to scale across our broad global source base. 
For the consumer, our partnership has the potential to expand their list of choices and accelerate delivery times from weeks to months -- or I'm sorry, from weeks to days. Strike that. Both partnerships are at an intersection of another vital innovation driver and that's digital. At NIKE, digital does more than just add capabilities for today. It defines how consumers will experience the NIKE Brand moving forward. It's an accelerator across our business, in product through the supply chain, in analytics and all the way to retail. A few weeks ago, we shared our long-term vision for e-commerce growth, $7 billion in revenue by the end of fiscal year '20. In Q2, we continued our accelerated pace, growing the NIKE.com business nearly 50% on a constant-currency basis. We added Canada, Switzerland and Norway to our expanding list of e-commerce markets, and next quarter, we're planning to do the same for the sport-obsessed cultures of Mexico, Turkey and Chile. When we expand our NIKE.com footprint, it gives new consumers access to the best of NIKE and it drives great energy for our business.
We have focused our investments in digital and mobile over the last several years, and they're paying off. Driving the connection of NIKE.com to our broader digital strategy continues to be, without a doubt, one of our greatest opportunities as a company. Digital, of course, also allows us to deepen the relationships we already have with consumers by tailoring every interaction to their specific needs. Through Nike+, we've created an ecosystem that gives athletes access to their fitness history, training programs and their favorite gear every time they connect with NIKE. 
We started on this journey 10 years ago with Nike+, and we've continued to evolve the digital experience for consumers through multiple sports in the world's most important markets in both men's and women's. You'll hear more from us about this space later in the fiscal year, but we're continuing our never-ending quest to make the digital experience simple and personal: simple, moving toward one access point for the best of NIKE; and personal, more and more tailored to the individual.
We're now entering one of the most exciting periods of sport. The second half of fiscal '16 is filled with some of the world's greatest sports moments: Super Bowl 50, the NBA All-Star Weekend, March Madness, Copa America, Euro '16 and, of course, the run-up to the Rio Olympics. In these moments like the athletes we serve, NIKE is at the top of our game. And this year, you will see NIKE unlock innovation for athletes like never before. We have a full pipeline that will help Olympic athletes change the course of their sports and experiences that will change how all athletes train and run. I'm proud of this quarter and our incredible team behind the results. They are the reason NIKE continues to drive growth and value for our shareholders. And like me, they're all focused on continuing our momentum and delivering inspiring innovation to athletes everywhere for years to come.
Thank you, everyone, and now here's Trevor."
291981,318461548,915392,"NIKE, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Dec 22, 2015",2015-12-22,"Earnings Calls","NIKE, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Mark. Happy holidays, everyone. The NIKE Brand delivered another impressive quarter, demonstrating the tremendous momentum of the NIKE Brand. Let's take a look at the numbers. On a constant-currency basis, NIKE Brand revenue grew 13%, with do",1878,"Thank you, Mark. Happy holidays, everyone. The NIKE Brand delivered another impressive quarter, demonstrating the tremendous momentum of the NIKE Brand. Let's take a look at the numbers. 
On a constant-currency basis, NIKE Brand revenue grew 13%, with double-digit growth across every geography and most key categories. NIKE Brand DTC revenue increased 26%, driven by 13% comp store growth; continued strong growth in online sales, up 49%; and new store expansion. And we are very pleased with the continued strength in global futures, up 20%. 
As always, these results are due to NIKE's world-class ability to understand the consumer, what they need and what inspires them. Those connections let us see the biggest growth opportunities and then sharpen our focus to best attack them. It's these powerful relationships that drive our category offense, providing us insights to create the innovative products, meaningful services and inspiring experiences that athletes all over the world love. 
Let me highlight 3 categories that demonstrate this powerful consumer focus. Let's first take a look at Running. Running is our largest performance category and continued to deliver strong results, with Q2 revenue growing at a double-digit rate. At NIKE, we know that running never stops. No matter the season, no matter the conditions, we provide solutions to help runners get out and pursue their goals. 
This quarter, with winter setting in, we released our Flash Pack collection, which offers a reflective print to keep runners visible and warm in low-light conditions. The Flash Pack includes apparel such as the Aeroloft Flash Vest and the Shield Flash Running Jacket as well as great footwear, including the popular Air Zoom Pegasus and the Air Zoom Structure 19. All told, this collection offers yet another great example of how NIKE innovates to expand the market.
Other running footwear successes in Q2 include the launch of the Air Zoom Odyssey, which offers 3 densities of foam for maximum stability and support; and the Air Max 2016 with its complete cushioning and durable ride, thanks to a full-length Max Air unit. At the same time, as part of our continued Amplify Strategy, we expand our performance with Pinnacle sportswear products to enable our consumers to express their love of sport. Part of this strategy is a constant focus on sports style innovation. In our Running-inspired sportswear, we are driving a steady stream of great products with strong sell-through. These include the Tech Pack and the Tech Fleece Aeroloft apparel styles as well as the continued success of the Roshe and the new Air Max Ultra line. Finally, our Pinnacle products are always complemented by unique experiences as only NIKE can do. Every year, Q2 is a season for some of the most popular running events, including the Shanghai Marathon and the Women's Half Marathon in San Francisco. The enthusiasm we see at these races echoes throughout the entire Running category year-after-year.
Next, Basketball. For years, we have built deep and meaningful relationships with basketball fans through 2 of the largest most powerful brands in the world, NIKE and Jordan. Together, we have the deepest roster of athletes and the most global reach with federations and leagues around the world. As we said in October, we will start breaking out the Jordan Brand separately from Nike Basketball, so I'll give you a few highlights from both. 
In Nike Basketball, we saw a mid-single-digit growth in Q2, fueled by key products such as the Kyrie 1. This product delivers responsive cushioning with Zoom Air and ultra support with the Hyperfuse construction, and it has seen tremendous sell-through since the launch a year ago. And just last week, we launched -- the launch of the Kyrie 2 has already seen strong consumer response with a first-of-its-kind curved midsole and outsole designed to enhance the rapid cuts that players make on the court. 
Another example of Basketball innovation is the recently introduced KOBE 11, a high-performance low-top that utilizes the latest Flyknit technology for lightweight strength, a stronger iteration to achieve peak performance. Our athletes always serve as an amazing source of inspiration for us, from Lebron and KD to young players have an incredible seasons like Paul George and Anthony Davis. These athletes and more are featured in our latest Basketball campaign, Bring Your Game. This campaign will launch in full on Christmas Day to inspire and motivate young players to bring the best to the court every single day. And speaking of great athletes featuring the campaign, Elena Delle Donne won the WNBA's Most Valuable Player, which was awarded just before the launch of our new Women's Basketball collection. The sell-through has been beyond strong, and with women making up roughly 40% of basketball players, we are just scratching the surface on how we can serve this growing community.
As we continue to sharpen our focus on Running, a complete offense in Nike Basketball, we are excited about the deep pipeline of products we will be bringing to the market in the coming seasons, all of which help us capture the significant potential that lies ahead. 
Now for the Jordan Brand. This is the start of an exciting new era for Jordan. Even as we expand this brand both globally and into other categories, Jordan's Basketball products continue to be the most coveted and premium on the market. This brand proves time and again its ability to combine its iconic silhouettes with fresh styles. 
For Q2, Jordan delivered strong double-digit growth with the new CP3.IX and the launch of the Air Jordan XX9 Low driving incredible consumer response. Like Nike Basketball, Jordan has a deep roster of elite players, including Chris Paul and Russell Westbrook. What's more, in October, Michael Jordan himself visited basketball fans in Hong Kong, Shanghai and Tokyo to celebrate the brand's 30th anniversary, helping to ignite the culture of basketball around the world. His visit drove strong consumer engagement with the new Jordan House of Flight in Shanghai and the flight training camps for young players across the markets. These cultural moments prove what we already know: that the power of this brand extends well beyond the game.
All of this excitement can be seen at retail, highlighted by the Jordan executions with Dick's Sporting Goods and the energy-packed opening of our new Jordan store on State Street in Chicago, a great execution with Footaction. This store will operate as a pinnacle retail experience, celebrating the performance, style and soul of the brand. What's more, directly above the store is a training lab serving elite high school athletes in the local area. Our consumers' passion for both the NIKE and Jordan Brands is driving tremendous energy and speaks to the significant opportunity that remains for our Basketball business around the world.
Now let's take a look at a few of our key geographies. North America had another strong quarter, with revenues up 10% and futures up 14%. This geography continues to drive strong growth across most key categories. Whilst this is our most developed market, North America proves that the right strategies can drive consistent profitable growth. Our brand in North America has never been stronger with men, with women, with athletes in all sports. We are seeing continued strong demand across our executions with wholesale partners such as Foot Locker and Dick's Sporting Goods. Our own DTC business also had another strong quarter, up 17%, led by ongoing strength in NIKE.com and comp store growth.
As we've discussed in prior quarters, we continue to work effectively to manage the flow of product in North America and efficiently clear excess inventory. We are also continuing to work to bring our new North American distribution center fully online. Both of these efforts are making good progress. We expect inventory levels in North America to normalize over the balance of the fiscal year as we continue to take appropriate actions to maintain a healthy pull market for the NIKE Brand. Looking ahead, we see nothing but long-term potential for our North American business.
Now let's turn to Western Europe where we see broad-based demand with strong revenue growth of 12% in the quarter and futures up 25%. We fueled growth in Q2 by continuing to transform the marketplace along the category offense with elevated executions at JD Sports, Foot Locker and Intersport. In addition, our own DTC business delivered 26% growth in the quarter. This growth from Western Europe is what we've come to expect with key categories of Sportswear and Global Football showing continued strength. This momentum has solidified NIKE as the region's most coveted sports brand with strong growth across all territories. This geography-wide market growth, coupled with market share gains, proves the clear success of our efforts in Western Europe and the vast potential this geography offers for years to come.
In the emerging markets, we are seeing improved revenue growth, with Q2 revenues up 11% and futures growth of 14%. Growth in the quarter was driven by most territories, with particular strength in Mexico as we continued to benefit from our reset efforts over the last year. We also saw strong growth in the key categories of Sportswear and Running. 
Now in Brazil, revenue was down 6%, reflective of the continued challenges in the macroeconomic landscape. Our brand remains strong in Brazil, and we're gaining share as we remain focused on our strategy of resetting the market along the category offense. As we focus on differentiating our points of distribution and proactively managing the flow of product into the marketplace, retail inventory levels in Brazil remain healthy.
We continue to focus on creating more compelling consumer experiences at retail and online and driving increased productivity and profitability for NIKE and our wholesale partners. Overall, we continue to see tremendous long-term growth potential for the emerging markets, and we remain focused on doing the right things in the marketplace to capture that growth. 
Lastly, Greater China had another amazing quarter, with revenue growth of 28%. The strength of the NIKE Brand is fueling strong consumer demand with futures up 34% in a marketplace that continues to be very healthy. We saw strong growth across nearly all categories in the quarter, led by Sportswear, Running and NIKE Basketball. We also saw a continued strong growth from our own DTC business, up 51% in the quarter, fueled in part by our most successful Singles Day event ever. And NIKE.com is showing extraordinary growth in China in one of the most mobile and connected countries on the planet. The success we're seeing today in China stems from decisions we made of just a few years ago to align our teams against the biggest opportunities to drive growth with our category offense. By staying focused and diligent, we continue to lead the market as the region's most coveted sports brand, and we see significantly more opportunity ahead.
2015 was the single greatest calendar year ever for the NIKE Brand. It proves yet again that we have the product, the services and the brand experiences that consumers want. And as we find new ways to surprise and delight athletes around the world, there's no telling what we can do. I can't wait for 2016 and the inspiration and innovation I know we're going to bring. And now here's Andy. Thank you."

We delivered on our goals in terms of both top line growth and profitability. We also continued to have strong momentum across our uniquely diverse global portfolio of businesses. We are driving and delivering these strong financial results even amidst of volatile macroeconomic environment, and we continue to do so by: one, staying relentlessly focused on creating value for our consumers, leading with innovation; two, effectively managing all of the operating and financial levers within our business to capture value for NIKE; and three, deploying our capital strategically to fuel long-term growth while also consistently expanding total returns to shareholders.
I'll briefly touch on how we delivered against each of those 3 dimensions within the quarter. First, by executing the category offense, we continue to more deeply serve and create value for our consumers around the world. In Q2, that translated into double-digit revenue growth in all of our geographies on a currency-neutral basis. As both Mark and Trevor highlighted, we served consumers through the launch of innovative new products in multiple categories, and we also scaled recent product innovations such as Tech Pack, Aeroloft and Flyknit more broadly across our performance categories and Sportswear. At the same time, we continue to transform where and how we serve our consumers, leading with the expansion of NIKE.com while also scaling premium category-oriented retail experiences with our partners around the world.
In Q2, we also effectively managed all of the operating and financial levers within our business to translate our strong top line growth into expanding profitability. That included gross margin expansion through sustained strategic pricing and product cost management as well as leveraging productivity gains to ensure we deliver appropriate near-term profitability while also continuing to make the investments required to fuel our long-term growth. Those investments included, for example, accelerating our investment in product innovation, building critical operating infrastructure within our supply chain and from a technology perspective and investing to maintain a healthy pull market in North America in service of the continued strong demand for our brand.
What sets NIKE apart in terms of operating and financial management is our ability to strike the right balance between the short and the long term. Our goal is to win now and create the future. And the breadth and depth of our global portfolio of businesses affords us the flexibility to strike that balance quarter-after-quarter, year-after-year. 
Finally, as we created value for consumers and captured that value for NIKE, we also continued to deliver significant value to our shareholders. Our top priority in terms of the use of our cash will remain reinvesting in our business against opportunities to drive growth and strong returns. That's what we call the virtuous cycle that sustains NIKE's leadership position and expands the value of our enterprise. 
The strong cash flows that we generate also allow us to consistently increase our cash returns to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. As Mark touched on, in the second quarter, we announced a new $12 billion 4-year share repurchase program and a 14% increase in our cash dividend. Over the last 15 years, we have sustained strategic investment in the business while also returning nearly $25 billion to shareholders. That is a track record that we're proud of and one that we will continue to build upon.
Now I'll turn to a more detailed review of our Q2 financial results. Q2 reported revenue for NIKE Inc. increased 4% and grew 12% on a currency-neutral basis. The NIKE Brand grew 13% on a currency-neutral basis as growth was strong across all geographies and nearly all categories. Converse revenue declined 5% on a currency-neutral basis as growth in North America and Asia Pacific was more than offset by declines in Europe, particularly the U.K.
Also on a currency-neutral basis, NIKE Brand futures orders grew 20%, reflecting continued strong demand, driven by a 12% increase in units, with an increase in average selling prices contributing 8 percentage points. Our futures growth reflects the strength of our brand and business around the globe, with all geographies growing at a double-digit pace. On a reported basis, futures grew 15%, taking into account the stronger U.S. dollar against nearly all international currencies.
Q2 diluted EPS grew 22% to $0.90 despite significant FX headwinds. EPS growth was driven by strong top line growth, gross margin expansion and effective financial management across all of the levers through to the bottom line. Gross margin expanded 50 basis points to 45.6%, primarily driven by higher average selling prices, partially offset by higher product input costs and unfavorable foreign exchange.
Q2 demand creation was flat, reflecting favorability from the quarterly timing of our investments in the current versus prior year. Operating overhead increased 7% for the quarter, driven by costs associated with strong growth in our DTC business and investments in operational infrastructure and consumer-facing digital capabilities.
Our effective tax rate was 19.1% for Q2, lower than prior year, primarily due to adjustments to tax expense on intercompany transactions in the prior year and an increase in the mix of earnings from operations outside the U.S. in the current year which are generally subject to a lower tax rate. Those favorable factors were partially offset by benefits from the resolution of several tax audits recognized in the prior year.
As of November 30, our inventories were up 11%, primarily to support strong wholesale and owned retail demand as reflected in our futures orders. Overall, our inventories continue to be healthy around the world. As we noted last quarter, our inventory in North America will be somewhat elevated over the balance of the fiscal year as we proactively manage the marketplace. More expeditiously, clearing high-quality but excess inventory while bringing a strong pipeline of new innovative products to the market over the same horizon. These efforts will unfavorably impact gross margin in the near term which is reflected in our guidance for the balance of this fiscal year.
Now let's review our performance by segment. North America revenue grew 10% on a currency-neutral basis, with double-digit revenue growth across many of our largest categories including Jordan, Sportswear, Running and Men's Training. We continue to experience strong consumer demand for the NIKE Brand in North America as evidenced by futures growth of 14%. On a reported basis, North America grew 9% and EBIT grew 12% as revenue growth and SG&A leverage more than offset a slight decline in gross margin, resulting from the clearance of inventory.
Moving on to Western Europe. Revenue increased 12% on a currency-neutral basis, driven by double-digit growth in every territory. The implementation of our category offense across jurisdictional lines continues to drive strong and sustainable growth for NIKE in this geography. Most categories delivered strong growth, led by Sportswear and Global Football. On a reported basis, Q2 revenue declined 1% due to weakness in the euro. However, EBIT increased 18%, primarily driven by gross margin expansion.
In Central and Eastern Europe, Q2 revenue grew 15% on a currency-neutral basis, driven by double-digit growth in most territories except Greece which declined. Most categories also grew double digits, led by Sportswear, Running and Global Football. On a reported basis, Q2 revenue declined 6%, reflecting significantly weaker currencies, in particular, the ruble and the Turkish lira. However, EBIT grew 33% due to strong gross margin expansion. 
In Greater China, we continue to deliver extraordinary revenue growth, with Q2 revenue up 28% on a currency-neutral basis. The NIKE Brand continues to lead in China, transforming the marketplace to better serve consumers. As a result, our growth is strong across nearly all key categories, led by Sportswear, Running, Nike Basketball and Jordan. On a reported basis, Q2 revenue increased 24% and EBIT grew 27% due to very strong revenue growth, coupled with gross margin expansion.
In our emerging markets geography, Q2 revenue increased 11% on a currency-neutral basis as most territories delivered strong growth in the quarter, driven by Soco, Mexico and Pacific while Brazil declined. Nearly every key category also grew in the quarter, led by Sportswear and Running. On a reported basis, emerging markets revenue declined 8% for the quarter due to foreign currency headwinds while EBIT increased 2%, reflecting strong gross margin expansion.
While we have momentum in most territories within the emerging markets, as Trevor discussed, we are continuing to reset Brazil. While we are taking share and inventory levels at retail are healthy, our focus is on fueling long-term growth through more elevated category experiences in that marketplace.
Shifting from the NIKE Brand to Converse. Converse revenue declined 5% on a currency-neutral basis in Q2, with growth in North America and other developing markets offset by declines in certain European countries, primarily the U.K. The Converse brand remains incredibly strong around the world. And to help realize the full potential of the brand going forward, we're more actively leveraging NIKE capabilities and innovation platforms to diversify the Converse product portfolio as well as elevate our operating capabilities in recently transitioned international markets. On a reported basis, Converse revenue declined 8%, primarily due to the weaker euro and EBIT decreased 3% for the quarter, driven primarily by lower revenue and gross margin.
NIKE Inc. delivered strong financial performance over the first half of fiscal year '16 and we have significant momentum across our global portfolio. As a result, our outlook for the full year remains consistent. Specifically, for Q3, we expect reported revenue to grow at a high single- to low double-digit rate, reflecting midteens growth on a currency-neutral basis, somewhat offset by the impact of the strong dollar.
While our futures growth is higher than our Q3 revenue guidance, it is important to remember that revenue expectations in any given fiscal period can be impacted by several factors, including, for example, the weighting of futures by month, the flow of product into the market within a season, the timing of shipments to our wholesale customers as well as the timing of sell-through to our consumers in our DTC business. For the full year, we continue to expect reported revenue growth will be in the mid-single-digit range.
We expect gross margin for Q3 to be down by about 50 basis points, reflecting our efforts to more expeditiously clear inventory in North America while bringing new innovative products to market. For the full year, we continue to expect gross margin to expand by about 50 basis points, reflecting our strong performance in the first half of the fiscal year, combined with our current expectations for Q3 and Q4. 
For total SG&A, we expect Q3 to grow at a low to mid-teens rate, reflecting our continued investments in DTC, consumer-facing digital capabilities, infrastructure and key brand events such as Super Bowl 50, the NBA All-Star Weekend and the timing of brand campaigns in support of select strategic categories. For the full year, we continue to expect total SG&A will grow at a high single-digit rate.
We continue to anticipate that other income will have a more meaningful impact on our fiscal year '16 results than we have seen historically, as a portion of our expected FX hedge gains are reported in this line item. Absent further changes in FX, we expect other income will be about $30 million for each of the next 2 quarters.
We now expect our effective tax rate will be approximately 20% for the full year, reflecting the lower rate in the first half of the fiscal year and an average rate of about 22% for the second half of the fiscal year.
Q2 was another quarter of strong revenue growth and expanding profitability for NIKE. As we embark on the second half of our fiscal year, we have brand and business momentum. We are on the offense and we will remain disciplined financially, as always, to ensure that we deliver appropriate growth and profitability in the near term while also investing strategically for the long term. NIKE is on track to deliver another year of strong financial performance and returns to shareholders. 
With that, we'll now open it up for questions."

Similarly in Japan, with the futures, what we're certainly seeing in Japan is that they went through similar efforts to really make sure we stayed focus on the brand. We have an incredible pipeline of products come in. The DTC, the dotcom business is doing exceptionally well there too, and we continue to work with our partners really well, so a similar story in those marketplaces. Obviously, I think it all stems from great brand strength that gives us real great confidence about the long-term potential of both of those markets."

A smaller portion of the product is the stuff that didn't sell through as we would have liked in the marketplace, and we're clearing that as part of the normal course of business to really keep the in-line channel healthy and at the same time, allows us, gives us the room to bring in more new fresh products.

Is there a point where we can think about the growth rate for you in China looking more like the same-store sales rates that we hear out of the market?

In terms of the prospects going forward, one of the things we touched on in our Investor Day was how much of our retail footprint we have impacted with our new category-oriented strategies in the wholesale marketplace. And if you'll recall, the number we gave at the time was that we've touched about 20% of that market in terms of our re-profiled doors and our more consumer-focused, category-oriented experiences. Those experiences continue to have very healthy inventory, much faster turns than we experienced years ago, strong comps, margin expansion. And again, that's 20% of the market.

I'd also say the same time that I think from a geographic perspective, while North America is currently one of the larger growing ones, China has a tremendous, tremendous growth opportunity. We can see that as being one of the most connected markets out there. Europe has continued growth opportunities. So we really do see as an expansive opportunity across the board.

Before I turn the call over to Ms. Hall, let me remind you that participants on this call will make forward-looking statements based on current expectations, and those statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. 
These risks and uncertainties are detailed in the reports filed with the SEC, including Forms 8-K, 10-K and 10-Q. Some forward-looking statements concern future orders that are not necessarily indicative of changes in total revenues for subsequent periods due to a mix of futures and at-once orders, exchange rate fluctuations, order cancellations, changes in the timing of shipments, discounts and returns which may vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter. In addition, it is important to remember a significant portion of NIKE, Inc.'s continuing operations, including equipment, NIKE Golf, Converse and Hurley, are not included in these futures numbers. 
Finally, participants may discuss non-GAAP financial measures, including references to wholesale equivalent sales. References to wholesale equivalent sales are only intended to provide context as to the overall current market footprint of the brands owned by NIKE, Inc. and should not be relied upon as a financial measure of actual results. 
Participants may also make references to other nonpublic financial and statistical information and non-GAAP financial measures.

291981,318461548,915396,"NIKE, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Dec 22, 2015",2015-12-22,"Earnings Calls","NIKE, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Kelley, and hello, everyone, and happy holidays. Q2 was another strong quarter for NIKE. We continued to show that we have the ability to drive both profitable growth and significant shareholder value over the long term. Let's take a look at",1324,"Thank you, Kelley, and hello, everyone, and happy holidays. Q2 was another strong quarter for NIKE. We continued to show that we have the ability to drive both profitable growth and significant shareholder value over the long term. 
Let's take a look at the highlights from the second quarter. NIKE, Inc. revenues grew 4% to $7.7 billion despite continued FX headwinds. On a currency-neutral basis, NIKE, Inc. revenues grew 12%. Gross margin expanded 50 basis points and earnings per share increased 22% to $0.90.
The success you see today and the opportunities ahead are driven by the strength of our portfolio. NIKE has many dimensions to our business, and together, they're operating powerfully and efficiently. We're connecting deeply with consumers through products and experiences and capturing value through our strategic -- through our strategies and investments. Our complete offense, which includes our brands, geographies and categories, makes us flexible and keeps us close to the consumer so we can see and act on new opportunities in real time. We see it in the markets we transform like China and Western Europe and in the businesses we accelerate like Women's and the Jordan Brand. Our operational scale is second to none. We have the power to grow the entire marketplace and innovate through our global supply chain that shipped roughly 1.1 billion units this last year. And as we've shown consistently, everything we do is executed with a sharp focus and a financial discipline. We have a proven track record of delivering top line growth, expanding profitability and maintaining a high return on invested capital. And because we drive consistent profitable growth, we're able to deliver strong returns to our shareholders. For example, we recently announced a 4-year $12 billion share repurchase program. We increased our annual cash dividend for the 14th year in a row, and we announced a 2-for-1 stock split. It's clear we have the right plan in place against the backdrop of a global movement of fitness and sports. It's all adding up to incredible momentum for our business, but we're never fully satisfied. More than ever, we're focused on the areas where we can continue to get better and making the necessary changes to ensure we continue to drive strong profitable growth for the long term.
The force behind today's results and our future potential is, of course, innovation. Our obsession and relentless drive to be better is at the core of our culture and our strategy. And as you know, it starts with product. We invent breakthroughs then build a thriving business around them. We told you during our Investor Day how we've built Flyknit from a concept to a billion-dollar platform in just 4 years. This is the kind of search for scalable innovation that's going on every day at NIKE, and just as important is our focus on bringing innovations to market in a directed and productive way through merchandising and marketplace management across all channels and multiple price points.
Innovation is also fueled by partnerships. When we partner, it can be like setting off a chain reaction, leading us to new and better ideas more quickly. It's why we value our relationships with athletes, NIKE's original and most important collaborators. Our relationships with thousands of athletes, teams and federations do more than build our brand. They give us personal access to their insights and the science behind the problems they need to solve. That's why we work with the best athletes like Lebron and Serena, Cristiano, along with everyday athletes, frankly like the rest of us. Partnerships also play a critical role in creating and expanding the marketplace. With our long-standing wholesale partners, we give consumers broad access to NIKE, and together, we segment and differentiate our assortments to drive mutually profitable retail.
At NIKE, collaboration is also a powerful strategy for activating new ways to work. As the clear leader in our industry, we align ourselves with leaders in other industries. To that end, we announced 2 new partnerships in October. The first is DreamWorks and their technology company called NOVA. With this partnership, we've combined the expertise of 2 design leaders: NIKE with the human body in motion and DreamWorks with the animated body in motion. I've been talking with our design teams and they see great potential in NOVA's platforms to advance our creation process in capability, precision and speed.
The second is Flex. Many of you know about the impressive work that Flex does, who are already accelerating our manufacturing revolution efforts. It's in the early stages yet, but in one specific process, they've combined automated material management with automated laser cutting, which can reduce waste by up to 50%. This is just one example of many that are in development, and what we learned from Flex, we expect to scale across our broad global source base. 
For the consumer, our partnership has the potential to expand their list of choices and accelerate delivery times from weeks to months -- or I'm sorry, from weeks to days. Strike that. Both partnerships are at an intersection of another vital innovation driver and that's digital. At NIKE, digital does more than just add capabilities for today. It defines how consumers will experience the NIKE Brand moving forward. It's an accelerator across our business, in product through the supply chain, in analytics and all the way to retail. A few weeks ago, we shared our long-term vision for e-commerce growth, $7 billion in revenue by the end of fiscal year '20. In Q2, we continued our accelerated pace, growing the NIKE.com business nearly 50% on a constant-currency basis. We added Canada, Switzerland and Norway to our expanding list of e-commerce markets, and next quarter, we're planning to do the same for the sport-obsessed cultures of Mexico, Turkey and Chile. When we expand our NIKE.com footprint, it gives new consumers access to the best of NIKE and it drives great energy for our business.
We have focused our investments in digital and mobile over the last several years, and they're paying off. Driving the connection of NIKE.com to our broader digital strategy continues to be, without a doubt, one of our greatest opportunities as a company. Digital, of course, also allows us to deepen the relationships we already have with consumers by tailoring every interaction to their specific needs. Through Nike+, we've created an ecosystem that gives athletes access to their fitness history, training programs and their favorite gear every time they connect with NIKE. 
We started on this journey 10 years ago with Nike+, and we've continued to evolve the digital experience for consumers through multiple sports in the world's most important markets in both men's and women's. You'll hear more from us about this space later in the fiscal year, but we're continuing our never-ending quest to make the digital experience simple and personal: simple, moving toward one access point for the best of NIKE; and personal, more and more tailored to the individual.
We're now entering one of the most exciting periods of sport. The second half of fiscal '16 is filled with some of the world's greatest sports moments: Super Bowl 50, the NBA All-Star Weekend, March Madness, Copa America, Euro '16 and, of course, the run-up to the Rio Olympics. In these moments, like the athletes we serve, NIKE is at the top of our game. And this year, you will see NIKE unlock innovation for athletes like never before. We have a full pipeline that will help Olympic athletes change the course of their sports and experiences that will change how all athletes train and run. I'm proud of this quarter and our incredible team behind the results. They are the reason NIKE continues to drive growth and value for our shareholders. And like me, they're all focused on continuing our momentum and delivering inspiring innovation to athletes everywhere for years to come.
Thank you, everyone, and now here's Trevor."
291981,318461548,915396,"NIKE, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Dec 22, 2015",2015-12-22,"Earnings Calls","NIKE, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Mark. Happy holidays, everyone. The NIKE Brand delivered another impressive quarter, demonstrating the tremendous momentum of the NIKE Brand. Let's take a look at the numbers. On a constant-currency basis, NIKE Brand revenue grew 13%, with do",1877,"Thank you, Mark. Happy holidays, everyone. The NIKE Brand delivered another impressive quarter, demonstrating the tremendous momentum of the NIKE Brand. Let's take a look at the numbers. 
On a constant-currency basis, NIKE Brand revenue grew 13%, with double-digit growth across every geography and most key categories. NIKE Brand DTC revenue increased 26%, driven by 13% comp store growth; continued strong growth in online sales, up 49%; and new store expansion. And we are very pleased with the continued strength in global futures, up 20%. 
As always, these results are due to NIKE's world-class ability to understand the consumer, what they need and what inspires them. Those connections let us see the biggest growth opportunities and then sharpen our focus to best attack them. It's these powerful relationships that drive our category offense, providing us insights to create the innovative products, meaningful services and inspiring experiences that athletes all over the world love. 
Let me highlight 3 categories that demonstrate this powerful consumer focus. Let's first take a look at Running. Running is our largest performance category and continued to deliver strong results, with Q2 revenue growing at a double-digit rate. At NIKE, we know that running never stops. No matter the season, no matter the conditions, we provide solutions to help runners get out and pursue their goals. 
This quarter, with winter setting in, we released our Flash Pack collection, which offers a reflective print to keep runners visible and warm in low-light conditions. The Flash Pack includes apparel such as the Aeroloft Flash Vest and the Shield Flash Running Jacket as well as great footwear, including the popular Air Zoom Pegasus and the Air Zoom Structure 19. All told, this collection offers yet another great example of how NIKE innovates to expand the market.
Other running footwear successes in Q2 include the launch of the Air Zoom Odyssey, which offers 3 densities of foam for maximum stability and support; and the Air Max 2016 with its complete cushioning and durable ride, thanks to a full-length Max Air unit. At the same time, as part of our continued Amplify Strategy, we expand our performance with Pinnacle sportswear products to enable our consumers to express their love of sport. Part of this strategy is a constant focus on sports style innovation. In our Running-inspired sportswear, we are driving a steady stream of great products with strong sell-through. These include the Tech Pack and the Tech Fleece Aeroloft apparel styles as well as the continued success of the Roshe and the new Air Max Ultra line. Finally, our Pinnacle products are always complemented by unique experiences as only NIKE can do. Every year, Q2 is a season for some of the most popular running events, including the Shanghai Marathon and the Women's Half Marathon in San Francisco. The enthusiasm we see at these races echoes throughout the entire Running category year-after-year.
Next, Basketball. For years, we have built deep and meaningful relationships with basketball fans through 2 of the largest most powerful brands in the world, NIKE and Jordan. Together, we have the deepest roster of athletes and the most global reach with federations and leagues around the world. As we said in October, we will start breaking out the Jordan Brand separately from Nike Basketball, so I'll give you a few highlights from both. 
In Nike Basketball, we saw a mid-single-digit growth in Q2, fueled by key products such as the Kyrie 1. This product delivers responsive cushioning with Zoom Air and ultra-support with the Hyperfuse construction, and it has seen tremendous sell-through since the launch a year ago. And just last week, we launched -- the launch of the Kyrie 2 has already seen strong consumer response with a first-of-its-kind curved midsole and outsole designed to enhance the rapid cuts that players make on the court. 
Another example of Basketball innovation is the recently introduced KOBE 11, a high-performance low-top that utilizes the latest Flyknit technology for lightweight strength, a stronger iteration to achieve peak performance. Our athletes always serve as an amazing source of inspiration for us, from Lebron and KD to young players having incredible seasons like Paul George and Anthony Davis. These athletes and more are featured in our latest Basketball campaign, Bring Your Game. This campaign will launch in full on Christmas Day to inspire and motivate young players to bring the best to the court every single day. And speaking of great athletes featured in the campaign, Elena Delle Donne won the WNBA's Most Valuable Player, which was awarded just before the launch of our new Women's Basketball collection. The sell-through has been beyond strong, and with women making up roughly 40% of basketball players, we are just scratching the surface on how we can serve this growing community.
As we continue to sharpen our focus on Running, a complete offense in Nike Basketball, we are excited about the deep pipeline of products we will be bringing to the market in the coming seasons, all of which help us capture the significant potential that lies ahead. 
Now for the Jordan Brand. This is the start of an exciting new era for Jordan. Even as we expand this brand both globally and into other categories, Jordan's Basketball products continue to be the most coveted and premium on the market. This brand proves time and again its ability to combine its iconic silhouettes with fresh styles. 
For Q2, Jordan delivered strong double-digit growth with the new CP3.IX and the launch of the Air Jordan XX9 Low driving incredible consumer response. Like Nike Basketball, Jordan has a deep roster of elite players, including Chris Paul and Russell Westbrook. What's more, in October, Michael Jordan himself visited basketball fans in Hong Kong, Shanghai and Tokyo to celebrate the brand's 30th anniversary, helping to ignite the culture of basketball around the world. His visit drove strong consumer engagement with the new Jordan House of Flight in Shanghai and the flight training camps for young players across the markets. These cultural moments prove what we already know: that the power of this brand extends well beyond the game.
All of this excitement can be seen at retail, highlighted by the Jordan executions with Dick's Sporting Goods and the energy-packed opening of our new Jordan store on State Street in Chicago, a great execution with Footaction. This store will operate as a pinnacle retail experience, celebrating the performance, style and soul of the brand. What's more, directly above the store is a training lab serving elite high school athletes in the local area. Our consumers' passion for both the NIKE and Jordan Brands is driving tremendous energy and speaks to the significant opportunity that remains for our Basketball business around the world.
Now let's take a look at a few of our key geographies. North America had another strong quarter, with revenues up 10% and futures up 14%. This geography continues to drive strong growth across most key categories. Whilst this is our most developed market, North America proves that the right strategies can drive consistent profitable growth. Our brand in North America has never been stronger with men, with women, with athletes in all sports. We are seeing continued strong demand across our executions with wholesale partners such as Foot Locker and Dick's Sporting Goods. Our own DTC business also had another strong quarter, up 17%, led by ongoing strength in NIKE.com and comp store growth.
As we've discussed in prior quarters, we continue to work effectively to manage the flow of product in North America and efficiently clear excess inventory. We are also continuing to work to bring our new North American distribution center fully online. Both of these efforts are making good progress. We expect inventory levels in North America to normalize over the balance of the fiscal year as we continue to take appropriate actions to maintain a healthy pull market for the NIKE Brand. Looking ahead, we see nothing but long-term potential for our North American business.
Now let's turn to Western Europe where we see broad-based demand with strong revenue growth of 12% in the quarter and futures up 25%. We fueled growth in Q2 by continuing to transform the marketplace along the category offense with elevated executions at JD Sports, Foot Locker and Intersport. In addition, our own DTC business delivered 26% growth in the quarter. This growth from Western Europe is what we've come to expect with key categories of Sportswear and Global Football showing continued strength. This momentum has solidified NIKE as the region's most coveted sports brand with strong growth across all territories. This geography-wide market growth, coupled with market share gains, proves the clear success of our efforts in Western Europe and the vast potential this geography offers for years to come.
In the emerging markets, we are seeing improved revenue growth, with Q2 revenues up 11% and futures growth of 14%. Growth in the quarter was driven by most territories, with particular strength in Mexico as we continued to benefit from our reset efforts over the last year. We also saw strong growth in the key categories of Sportswear and Running. 
Now in Brazil, revenue was down 6%, reflective of the continued challenges in the macroeconomic landscape. Our brand remains strong in Brazil, and we're gaining share as we remain focused on our strategy of resetting the market along the category offense. As we focus on differentiating our points of distribution and proactively managing the flow of product into the marketplace, retail inventory levels in Brazil remain healthy.
We continue to focus on creating more compelling consumer experiences at retail and online and driving increased productivity and profitability for NIKE and our wholesale partners. Overall, we continue to see tremendous long-term growth potential for the emerging markets, and we remain focused on doing the right things in the marketplace to capture that growth. 
Lastly, Greater China had another amazing quarter, with revenue growth of 28%. The strength of the NIKE Brand is fueling strong consumer demand with futures up 34% in a marketplace that continues to be very healthy. We saw strong growth across nearly all categories in the quarter, led by Sportswear, Running and NIKE Basketball. We also saw a continued strong growth from our own DTC business, up 51% in the quarter, fueled in part by our most successful Singles Day event ever. And NIKE.com is showing extraordinary growth in China in one of the most mobile and connected countries on the planet. The success we're seeing today in China stems from decisions we made of just a few years ago to align our teams against the biggest opportunities to drive growth with our category offense. By staying focused and diligent, we continue to lead the market as the region's most coveted sports brand, and we see significantly more opportunity ahead.
2015 was the single greatest calendar year ever for the NIKE Brand. It proves yet again that we have the product, the services and the brand experiences that consumers want. And as we find new ways to surprise and delight athletes around the world, there's no telling what we can do. I can't wait for 2016 and the inspiration and innovation I know we're going to bring. And now here's Andy. Thank you."

We delivered on our goals in terms of both top line growth and profitability. We also continued to have strong momentum across our uniquely diverse global portfolio of businesses. We are driving and delivering these strong financial results even amidst a volatile macroeconomic environment, and we continue to do so by: one, staying relentlessly focused on creating value for our consumers, leading with innovation; two, effectively managing all of the operating and financial levers within our business to capture value for NIKE; and three, deploying our capital strategically to fuel long-term growth while also consistently expanding total returns to shareholders.
I'll briefly touch on how we delivered against each of those 3 dimensions within the quarter. First, by executing the category offense, we continue to more deeply serve and create value for our consumers around the world. In Q2, that translated into double-digit revenue growth in all of our geographies on a currency-neutral basis. As both Mark and Trevor highlighted, we served consumers through the launch of innovative new products in multiple categories, and we also scaled recent product innovations such as Tech Pack, Aeroloft and Flyknit more broadly across our performance categories and Sportswear. At the same time, we continue to transform where and how we serve our consumers, leading with the expansion of NIKE.com while also scaling premium category-oriented retail experiences with our partners around the world.
In Q2, we also effectively managed all of the operating and financial levers within our business to translate our strong top line growth into expanding profitability. That included gross margin expansion through sustained strategic pricing and product cost management as well as leveraging productivity gains to ensure we deliver appropriate near-term profitability while also continuing to make the investments required to fuel our long-term growth. Those investments included, for example, accelerating our investment in product innovation, building critical operating infrastructure within our supply chain and from a technology perspective and investing to maintain a healthy pull market in North America in service of the continued strong demand for our brand.
What sets NIKE apart in terms of operating and financial management is our ability to strike the right balance between the short and the long term. Our goal is to win now and create the future. And the breadth and depth of our global portfolio of businesses affords us the flexibility to strike that balance quarter-after-quarter, year-after-year. 
Finally, as we created value for consumers and captured that value for NIKE, we also continued to deliver significant value to our shareholders. Our top priority in terms of the use of our cash will remain reinvesting in our business against opportunities to drive growth and strong returns. That's what we call the virtuous cycle that sustains NIKE's leadership position and expands the value of our enterprise. 
The strong cash flows that we generate also allow us to consistently increase our cash returns to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. As Mark touched on, in the second quarter, we announced a new $12 billion 4-year share repurchase program and a 14% increase in our cash dividend. Over the last 15 years, we have sustained strategic investment in the business while also returning nearly $25 billion to shareholders. That is a track record that we're proud of and one that we will continue to build upon.
Now I'll turn to a more detailed review of our Q2 financial results. Q2
reported revenue for NIKE Inc. increased 4% and grew 12% on a currency-neutral basis. The NIKE Brand grew 13% on a currency-neutral basis as growth was strong across all geographies and nearly all categories. Converse revenue declined 5% on a currency-neutral basis as growth in North America and Asia Pacific was more than offset by declines in Europe, particularly the U.K.
Also on a currency-neutral basis, NIKE Brand futures orders grew 20%, reflecting continued strong demand, driven by a 12% increase in units, with an increase in average selling prices contributing 8 percentage points. Our futures growth reflects the strength of our brand and business around the globe, with all geographies growing at a double-digit pace. On a reported basis, futures grew 15%, taking into account the stronger U.S. dollar against nearly all international currencies.
Q2 diluted EPS grew 22% to $0.90, despite significant FX headwinds. EPS growth was driven by strong top line growth, gross margin expansion and effective financial management across all of the levers through to the bottom line. Gross margin expanded 50 basis points to 45.6%, primarily driven by higher average selling prices, partially offset by higher product input costs and unfavorable foreign exchange.
Q2 demand creation was flat, reflecting favorability from the quarterly timing of our investments in the current versus prior year. Operating overhead increased 7% for the quarter, driven by costs associated with strong growth in our DTC business and investments in operational infrastructure and consumer-facing digital capabilities.
Our effective tax rate was 19.1% for Q2, lower than prior year, primarily due to adjustments to tax expense on intercompany transactions in the prior year and an increase in the mix of earnings from operations outside the U.S. in the current year which are generally subject to a lower tax rate. Those favorable factors were partially offset by benefits from the resolution of several tax audits recognized in the prior year.
As of November 30, our inventories were up 11%, primarily to support strong wholesale and owned retail demand as reflected in our futures orders. Overall, our inventories continue to be healthy around the world. As we noted last quarter, our inventory in North America will be somewhat elevated over the balance of the fiscal year as we proactively manage the marketplace. More expeditiously, clearing high-quality but excess inventory, while bringing a strong pipeline of new innovative products to the market over the same horizon. These efforts will unfavorably impact gross margin in the near term which is reflected in our guidance for the balance of this fiscal year.
Now let's review our performance by segment. North America revenue grew 10% on a currency-neutral basis, with double-digit revenue growth across many of our largest categories including Jordan, Sportswear, Running and Men's Training. We continue to experience strong consumer demand for the NIKE Brand in North America as evidenced by futures growth of 14%. On a reported basis, North America grew 9% and EBIT grew 12% as revenue growth and SG&A leverage more than offset a slight decline in gross margin, resulting from the clearance of inventory.
Moving on to Western Europe. Revenue increased 12% on a currency-neutral basis, driven by double-digit growth in every territory. The implementation of our category offense across jurisdictional lines continues to drive strong and sustainable growth for NIKE in this geography. Most categories delivered strong growth, led by Sportswear and Global Football. On a reported basis, Q2 revenue declined 1% due to weakness in the euro. However, EBIT increased 18%, primarily driven by gross margin expansion.
In Central and Eastern Europe, Q2 revenue grew 15% on a currency-neutral basis, driven by double-digit growth in most territories, except Greece, which declined. Most categories also grew double digits, led by Sportswear, Running and Global Football. On a reported basis, Q2 revenue declined 6%, reflecting significantly weaker currencies, in particular, the ruble and the Turkish lira. However, EBIT grew 33% due to strong gross margin expansion. 
In Greater China, we continue to deliver extraordinary revenue growth, with Q2 revenue up 28% on a currency-neutral basis. The NIKE Brand continues to lead in China, transforming the marketplace to better serve consumers. As a result, our growth is strong across nearly all key categories, led by Sportswear, Running, Nike Basketball and Jordan. On a reported basis, Q2 revenue increased 24% and EBIT grew 27% due to very strong revenue growth, coupled with gross margin expansion.
In our emerging markets geography, Q2 revenue increased 11% on a currency-neutral basis as most territories delivered strong growth in the quarter, driven by Soco, Mexico and Pacific while Brazil declined. Nearly every key category also grew in the quarter, led by Sportswear and Running. On a reported basis, emerging markets revenue declined 8% for the quarter due to foreign currency headwinds while EBIT increased 2%, reflecting strong gross margin expansion.
While we have momentum in most territories within the emerging markets, as Trevor discussed, we are continuing to reset Brazil. While we are taking share and inventory levels at retail are healthy, our focus is on fueling long-term growth through more elevated category experiences in that marketplace.
Shifting from the NIKE Brand to Converse. Converse revenue declined 5% on a currency-neutral basis in Q2, with growth in North America and other developing markets offset by declines in certain European countries, primarily the U.K. The Converse brand remains incredibly strong around the world. And to help realize the full potential of the brand going forward, we're more actively leveraging NIKE capabilities and innovation platforms to diversify the Converse product portfolio as well as elevate our operating capabilities in recently transitioned international markets. On a reported basis, Converse revenue declined 8%, primarily due to the weaker euro and EBIT decreased 3% for the quarter, driven primarily by lower revenue and gross margin.
NIKE Inc. delivered strong financial performance over the first half of fiscal year '16 and we have significant momentum across our global portfolio. As a result, our outlook for the full year remains consistent. Specifically, for Q3, we expect reported revenue to grow at a high single- to low double-digit rate, reflecting mid-teens growth on a currency-neutral basis, somewhat offset by the impact of the strong dollar.
While our futures growth is higher than our Q3 revenue guidance, it is important to remember that revenue expectations in any given fiscal period can be impacted by several factors, including, for example, the weighting of futures by month, the flow of product into the market within a season, the timing of shipments to our wholesale customers as well as the timing of sell-through to our consumers in our DTC business. For the full year, we continue to expect reported revenue growth will be in the mid-single-digit range.
We expect gross margin for Q3 to be down by about 50 basis points, reflecting our efforts to more expeditiously clear inventory in North America while bringing new innovative products to market. For the full year, we continue to expect gross margin to expand by about 50 basis points, reflecting our strong performance in the first half of the fiscal year, combined with our current expectations for Q3 and Q4. 
For total SG&A, we expect Q3 to grow at a low to mid-teens rate, reflecting our continued investments in DTC, consumer-facing digital capabilities, infrastructure and key brand events such as Super Bowl 50, the NBA All-Star Weekend and the timing of brand campaigns in support of select strategic categories. For the full year, we continue to expect total SG&A will grow at a high single-digit rate.
We continue to anticipate that other income will have a more meaningful impact on our fiscal year '16 results than we have seen historically, as a portion of our expected FX hedge gains are reported in this line item. Absent further changes in FX, we expect other income will be about $30 million for each of the next 2 quarters.
We now expect our effective tax rate will be approximately 20% for the full year, reflecting the lower rate in the first half of the fiscal year and an average rate of about 22% for the second half of the fiscal year.
Q2 was another quarter of strong revenue growth and expanding profitability for NIKE. As we embark on the second half of our fiscal year, we have brand and business momentum. We are on the offense and we will remain disciplined financially, as always, to ensure that we deliver appropriate growth and profitability in the near term while also investing strategically for the long term. NIKE is on track to deliver another year of strong financial performance and returns to shareholders. 
With that, we'll now open it up for questions."

And in China specifically, as you recall, we spent time resetting the marketplace and we are now seeing the results of that reset really take place. They had an incredible quarter. I was actually just recently there. We're seeing just great growth across the Sportswear, the Running, the Basketball business, the dotcom business is doing exceptionally well. And so also working with our key partners, the transformation efforts that we put in place are actually now really, really working well. So we see great sell-through in the market and we see really good health of the inventory. So all the dimensions really would say that China is in a great place. We feel confident about the long-term potential of the market. Similarly in Japan, with the futures, what we're certainly seeing in Japan is that they went through similar efforts to really make sure we stayed focused on the brand.

A smaller portion of the product is the stuff that didn't sell through as we would have liked in the marketplace, and we're clearing that as part of the normal course of business to really keep the in-line channel healthy and at the same time, allows us, gives us the room to bring in more new fresh products.

Is there a point where we can think about the growth rate for you in China looking more like the same-store sales rates that we hear out of the market?

And if you'll recall, the number we gave at the time was that we've touched about 20% of that market in terms of our re-profiled doors and our more consumer-focused, category-oriented experiences. Those experiences continue to have very healthy inventory, much faster turns than we experienced years ago, strong comps, margin expansion. And again, that's 20% of the market.
