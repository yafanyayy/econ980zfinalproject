I am will McDowell, Vice President of Investor Relations. Joining me this morning are David Cordani, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tom McCarthy, Cigna's Chief Financial Officer. 
In our remarks today, David and Tom will cover a number of topics, including Cigna's full year 2014 financial results, as well as our financial outlook for 2015. 
As noted in our earnings release, when describing our financial results, Cigna uses certain financial measures which are not determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, otherwise known as GAAP. Specifically, we use the term labeled adjusted income from operations and earnings per share on the same basis as the principal measures of performance for Cigna and our business segments.  A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is contained in today's earnings release, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of cigna.com. 
In our remarks today, we will be making some forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our outlook for 2015 and future performance. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. A description of these risks and uncertainties is contained in the cautionary note to today's earnings release and in our most recent reports filed with the SEC. 
Before turning the call over to David, I will cover a few items pertaining to our financial results and disclosures. First, please note that when we discuss the number of covered lives for our global medical customers, we will be doing so on a basis that excludes those individuals that were previously covered under Limited Benefits plans. As a reminder, we exited the Limited Benefits business as of December 31, 2013, as required by the Affordable Care Act regulation. 
Second, please note that our definition of adjusted income from operations will change for 2015 reporting in that we will now exclude acquisition-related amortization expense from this operating measure. When we discuss our earnings outlook for 2015 today, it will be on the basis of adjusted income from operations that excludes acquisition-related amortization expense. This is a change compared to the basis on which 2014 results are reported and how we have previously provided our 2014 outlook. 
In 2015, the impact of excluding acquisition-related amortization expense is approximately $100 million after-tax or $0.40 per share. 
Third, beginning in 2015, we have simplified our guidance and disclosures for our Medicare ratios, or MCRs, by reporting them on a basis of total commercial and total government. The total commercial ratio encompasses all of our commercial risk products, including Medical, Pharmacy, Dental, Stop Loss and Behavioral Products provided through Guaranteed Cost or experience-rated funding arrangements in both the United States and internationally. The total government ratio includes our Medicare Advantage, Medicare Part D and Medicaid businesses. To lead the transition, we have provided historical Medicare ratios on these bases within our quarterly financial supplement that was posted in the Investor Relations section of cigna.com this morning. 
Lastly, consistent with past practices we make any prospective comments on earnings or EPS outlook, we will do so on a basis that excludes the impact of any future capital deployment or prior-year development of medical cost. Our outlook also exclude the impact from our recently announced acquisition of Walkure, which we do not expect will have a material impact to our financial results in 2015. 
And with that, I will turn the call over to David."

To begin, I'll review highlights of our full year 2014 financial results and our 2015 outlook. I will then discuss how we will continue to create value for our customers clients and shareholders in the future. I'll also illustrate more specifically how we are creating value in our Seniors business and leveraging our experience and success of that business to drive long-term growth.  Then Tom will address our Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2014 financial performance in more detail, as well as provide specifics for our outlook in 2015 before we take your questions. And following the Q&A session, I'll wrap up the call with a few closing remarks. We'll start with some highlights in the year. 
Cigna's strong 2014 performance represents the fifth consecutive year of competitively attractive financial results. This outstanding track record of results is driven by the disciplined execution of our growth strategy. All, while we continue to invest in capabilities, expand our offerings and our geographic footprint. Over the past several years in the face of a particularly challenging and dynamic environment, we have been focused and disciplined with targeted yet meaningful investments to drive innovation, including new clinical programs, aligned incentives for customers, expanded technologies and programs for Health Care professionals. We have done all these while delivering competitively differentiated results year in and year out. 
The full year 2014 consolidated revenues increased 8% to $35 billion, with each business segment delivering strong growth over 2013. We reported adjusted income from operations for the full year of $2 billion or $7.43 per share, which represents a per share increase of 9% over 2013. 
Our revenue and earnings performance reflect growth all of our businesses over the course of the year, the year in which we also grew to more than 85 million customer relationships worldwide and where we continue to generate strong margins and significant free cash flow for the benefit of shareholders. These results position us to once again deliver competitively attractive revenue and earnings growth in 2015. 
For 2015, our outlook of 8% to 10% revenue growth and 5% to 10% EPS growth, excluding reserve development recognized in 2014, as well as future capital deployment reflect the focused and clarity of our strategy and continued strong performance of our team around the world. Tom will walk you through more specifics regarding outlook later on the call. 
Now, I' like to talk about how our guiding framework of the global strategy and multiple avenues for growth have enabled our long track record of success and will drive ongoing future value creation. Across our business, we operate in ever-changing market landscape with diverse needs across customers, employers, health care professionals and governments. Within this market, we are meeting and exceeding the expectations of our customers and clients around the world by delivering affordable and personalized solutions. As we look to the future, we have built a growth framework to create ongoing value, leverage our differentiated capabilities for the benefit of our customers. There are 3 components to this framework. First is leveraging our well-positioned existing portfolio businesses to continue to generate attractive value for our customers and clients. We expect to double the size of our company over the next 7 to 8 years. This will result in an average annual revenue growth rate of 8% to 10%, largely driven by our existing portfolio and focused execution. This continues a track record that we have demonstrated over the last 5 years, and our 2015 outlook of 8% to 10% revenue growth is consistent with this goal. 
The second component is targeted and effective capital deployment to create ongoing shareholder value. I would note that over the past 5 years, we have effectively deployed capital through a balance of investments and a business portfolio, strategic M&A and share repurchase. A good reason example of this is our agreement to purchase QualCare Alliance networks. This acquisition is directly aligned with our Go Deep and our physician partnership strategies. Our businesses are generating high margins and our capital efficient allowed us to both find attractive organic growth and generate significant free cash flow. This free cash flow provides us with financial flexibility and the opportunity to deploy capital to create additional value for our shareholders. And given the health of our balance sheet and underlying capitalization of our subsidiaries, we expect to have $1.8 billion of capital available for deployment in 2015. 
The third component of our framework were we seek to drive additional value for our shareholders is through new and emerging opportunities. These opportunities include new distribution marketplaces, such as public and private exchanges; geographic expansion, such as new Medicare Advantage markets and international opportunities; and new buying segments and service expansion, such as medical service organization offerings for the benefit of integrated health care professionals. We are well positioned to pursue each of these potentially attractive future growth opportunities that are aligned with our strategy. As such, we have dedicated resources to fuel future expansion in these areas. 
It illustrate how we are leveraging this framework to create value, I'll highlight how this framework applies to our Seniors business. This market segment includes the population with a variety of complex needs, requiring customer engagement and incentive-based clinical resources programs to drive ongoing success. Our Seniors business pioneered successful positioning gauge and models, including Allianz incentives and collaborative relationships to drive high-quality and a more affordable health care experience for both customers, as well as physicians.
As we continue to leverage our core physician engagement capabilities across all of our health services businesses, we are focused on key investments that improve affordability, enhance personalized services and drive better clinical outcomes. For example, the strategic investments we're making to enhance our physician insight and data tools will enable our clinical data to be accessible in a real-time fashion from wherever physician partners, as well as our service team. Enabled by our physician engagement model, Seniors continue to find our Cigna HealthSpring benefit offerings increasingly compelling, and we expect to have 6% to 8% Medicare Advantage customer growth in 2015. As for positioning, we continue to be among the top 3 players in market share for all our established markets, and we are posing attractive growth in our newer markets. 
In 2014, we expanded our Seniors business in the Georgia and the Carolinas where we successfully leveraged existing CIGNA commercial networks to develop and implement engaged physician relationships for Seniors. Importantly, the quality of care delivered through engaged physician groups is reflected in our stars ratings where we increased our memberships in 4 star or higher plans from approximately 40% to nearly 60% in 2016. 
Looking to 2017, we again expect to deliver an increase in this result. These improvement in star ratings have allowed us to enhance our benefit offerings and position our Seniors business to be an earnings accelerant in 2016 and beyond. 
Relative to our expanding opportunities, we currently operate Illinois markets. Here, we are leveraging our care coordination capabilities to serve the dual eligible population within our Medicaid platform. Focusing our growth efforts on improving care for the underserved, including the dual eligible and age, blind and disabled population complements our proven experience with complex care quarters nation, differentiated clinical outcomes and affordability focus. While Illinois plan is relatively new having just begun in 2014, our Texas plan has been in operation since 2011 and is on track record of delivering affordable care and better health outcomes. In a testament of our commitment to servicing these customers, our Texas plan recently was acknowledged by the Medicare Health Plans of America for our cutting-edge behavioral health care program. We 
are well-positioned and have a capital flexibility to pursue this accelerating geographic and market segment opportunities either organically or through M&A as Seniors remains a strategic growth priority for us. As a global company, our efforts to leverage capabilities have also expanded across key markets beyond the United States. 
In Korea, for example, where the age population is seeking new solutions to meet their emerging needs, we developed an innovative and new health membership program targeting seniors known as Heyday. This organically built affinity program delivers value-added services directly to seniors in Korea. And while only a year into this expansion, we now serve more than 300,000 Korean seniors. So overall, we have a clear strategy and the capabilities to deliver value and improve the health and wellbeing of senior customers today and into the future. 
Whether it's Seniors business we discuss today or other growth businesses we have addressed in previous calls, we will continue to deliver attractive growth producing deploy capital effectively and investment position ourselves to win in emerging market segments. 
Now to summarize my comments before Tom offers more detail on our 2014 results and expectations for 2015. Cigna's strong 2014 financial performance extend a multiyear record on track with that of developing track record revenue and earnings and free cash flow. Continued execution of our growth strategy is creating value for our customers and clients, complimented by our differentiated capabilities and innovative physicians and customer engagement solutions. As a rapidly changing industry and economic environment continues to unfold and new challenges arise, we are positioned to capitalize on new growth opportunities, while we continue to leverage our core businesses for growth. And by embracing change, we continue to position our company for successful investing in the future preparing for a significant new opportunities, such as those we shared this morning for our senior segment, including in existing programs and markets; new market expansion; new offerings for health care professionals through our medical service organization solutions; new segments, such as dual eligibles and new affinity programs, such as HeyDay in Korea. We expect to meet our growth objectives of 8% to 10% on average, doubling the size of our company again over the next 7 to 8 years. And based on our focused strategy, strong market positioning and ability to leverage capital as well as further for growth, we expect to continue to deliver competitively attractive and sustained long-term EPS growth of 10% to 13% on average, all while continuing to invest back in our company. 
And with that, I'll the call over to Tom."
172899,253311656,755343,"Cigna Corp., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 05, 2015",2015-02-05,"Earnings Calls","The Cigna Group","Executives","Thanks, David. Good morning, everyone, and in my remarks today, I will review Cigna's 2014 results and provide our outlook for 2015. We had another strong year in 2014 with revenue growth of 8% and industry-leading earnings-per-share growth of 9% over 2",2053,"Thanks, David. Good morning, everyone, and in my remarks today, I will review Cigna's 2014 results and provide our outlook for 2015. 
We had another strong year in 2014 with revenue growth of 8% and industry-leading earnings-per-share growth of 9% over 2013 results. 2014 represents our fifth consecutive year of consistently strong revenue earnings and EPS growth and attractive results on an absolute and competitive basis. 
In addition, we continue to generate strong free cash flow in 2014, which resulted in approximately $1.6 billion being returned to shareholders through share repurchase. The strength of our 2014 performance provides us with a solid foundation for growth in 2015. 
Now moving to operating results. Our full year consolidated revenues grew 8% to $35 million, driven by growth in each of our business segments and in our targeted markets. Earnings grew 3% to $2 billion and earnings per share grew 9% to $7.43 in 2014. Our ability to grow revenue earnings and EPS in a challenging operating environment reflects the strength of our underlying businesses and focused execution. 
Regarding the segments, I will first comment on our Global Health Care segment. Overall, Global Health Care delivered another good year. 2014 premiums and fees grew 7% to $24.5 million, reflecting growth in all of our Global Health Care businesses, including ongoing growth in our self-funded programs and specialty products. We ended 2014 with $14.5 million Global medical customers, growing by approximately 380,000 customers or 3% for the year. 
Full year earnings were $1.65 billion, reflecting business growth, specialty contributions, operating efficiencies and effective medical cost management. 
Turning to medical costs. We continue to deliver medical cost to reflect better health outcomes and strong clinical excellence for our customers and clients as a result of our deep collaborative relationships with physicians and our focus on personalization of care. 
For our total U.S. commercial book of business, full year medical cost trend was slightly less than the low-end of our previous range of 4.5% to 5.5% for 2014. Our commercial medical trend result continues our multiyear track record of industry-leading performance, and given that over 85% of our U.S. Commercial customers are in transfer ASO funding arrangements, our clients directly benefit from these favorable medical costs. 
Regarding medical care ratios, in our U.S. commercial guaranteed cost business, our full year 2014 medical care ratio, or MCR, was 81.8% on a reported basis or 82.7%, excluding prior-year reserve development. 
Consistent with our expectations, our fourth quarter 2014 Guaranteed Cost MCR of 86.6% reflects an increase seasonal impact from the growing share of high deductible plans in our employer group and individual businesses. We also expected and saw this increased seasonal impact across multiple America Mr. Tier commercial business, including our stoploss and businesses. Overall, our employer risk businesses continued to deliver solid results in the quarter and throughout the year, reflecting strong pricing, disciplined underwriting and continued effective medical management and physician engagement. Results that are individual business, while still below long-term expectation, continue to improve in the fourth quarter. 
In our Government business, our full year 2014 MCR for Medicare advantage was 83.5% on a reported basis or 84%, excluding prior-year reserve development, reflecting the impact of medical cost improvement initiatives implemented during 2014. 
Moving to operating expenses for 2014, our total Global Health Care operating expense ratio was 22%. This includes the impact of health reform-related taxes, which added 110 basis points to the expense ratio for the year. Overall, we've had another strong year in our Global Health Care business. 
Now I'll discuss the results of our Global Supplemental Benefits business, which continues to deliver attractive growth and profitability. Premiums and fees grew 14% year-over-year in global supplemental. 2014 Global Supplemental Benefits business were $230 million, reflecting attractive operating margins, continued strategic investments to drive future growth and nonrecurring favorable tax items of $21 million after-tax recorded in the third quarter. Fourth quarter earnings of $33 million reflect claim seasonality, our funding of long-term strategic investments and the impact from the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. 
Our Group Disability and Life, total year results were result 6% over 2013. 2014 earnings in Group business were $317 million and reflects favorable claim experience in our life business, and our lower operating expense ratio. While our corporate and other operations results after-tax loss of $197 million for full year 2014. 
Overall, our 2014 results reflect revenue earnings growth for each of our business segments and a significant free cash flow as a result of the continued effective execution of our strategy. 
Turning to our investment portfolio. For 2014, we reported net realized investment gains of $106 million after-tax, coupled with a strong net investment income result. The higher quality and diversification of our investment portfolio continue to drive our overall investment results. 
Now I will discuss our outlook for 2015. In 2015, we expect to continue to deliver strong financial performance for our shareholders by leveraging our differentiated capabilities to meet and exceed expectations of our customers and clients by delivering affordable and personalized solutions effectively deploying capital and targeting new and emerging opportunities where we seek to drive additional value for our shareholders. 
For full year 2015, we expect consolidated revenues to grow in the range of 8% to 10% over 2014, with continued growth across our target market segments. We expect full year 2015 consolidated adjusted income from operations to be in the range of $2.1 billion to $2.2 billion, or $8 to $8.40 per share. As we noted earlier, our full year 2015 consolidated and business segment adjusted income from operations, as well as earnings-per-share estimates now exclude acquisition-related amortization expense. 
In 2015, the impact of excluding acquisition-related amortization expense is approximately $0.40 per share or $100 million after-tax, including $85 million on our Global Health Care business and $15 million in Global Supplemental Benefits. Lastly, consistent with prior practice, our exclude any contribution from capital employment, as well as any prior-year claim development, which in 2014 totaled $53 million after-tax. 
Putting our 2015 outlook and our 2014 actual results on a comparable basis, that is, adjusting for the development reported in our 2014 results and adjusting to a consistent basis for reporting P&L amortization, our outlook for operating earnings in 2015 reflects 3% to 8% growth over 2014, and our outlook for EPS growth is 5% to 10% before considering the impact of additional capital deployment. 
I will now discuss the components of our 2015 outlook starting with Global Health Care. We expect full year Global Health Care earnings in the range of approximately $1.73 billion to $1.79 billion. This outlook reflects continued benefits from organic revenue growth, specialty contributions, effective medical cost management and operating spend efficiencies. This also includes our updated view of the annual results for both Medicare and the public exchange business. 
I'll ow summarize some of the key assumptions reflected in our Global Health Care earnings outlook for 2015 starting with our customer base. Regarding global medical customers, we expect 2015 customer growth of 1% to 3%. This growth was driven by expected ongoing growth in our commercial employer business led by continued double-digit customer growth in our select business, as well as mid to upper single-digit growth in our Medicare advantage customers, with some expected reduction in our non-ACA compliant individual customers.
Turning to medical cost. Our 2015 outlook assumes some increase in medical utilization versus current levels and this increase had been reflected in our pricing. For our total U.S. book of business, we expect full year medical cost trend to be in the range of 5% to 6%. As well noted earlier, we are changing the basis of push to provide guidance for MCRs to total commercial and total government. We believe this basis will provide better insight into our ability to effectively manage medical cost for our Commercial and Seniors customers.
For our total commercial book of business, we expect the 2015 medical care ratio to be in the range of 78% to 79%. This compares to our full year 2014 total commercial MCR of 78.9% on an operating basis.
For our total government book of business, we expect the 2015 medical care ratio to be in the range of 84.5% to 85.5%. This compares to our full year 2014 total government MCR of 84.7% on an operating basis.
Regarding operating expenses, our 2015 Global Health Care operating expense ratio is expected to be in the range of 20.5% to 21.5%. Overall, we expect full year 2015 Global Health Care earnings to be approximately $1.73 billion to $1.79 billion. We believe this is a competitively attractive results, reflecting our focus on growing segments of the health care market and continued strong execution of our business strategy. 
Now moving to the other components of our outlook. For our Global Supplemental Benefits business, we continue to expect strong top line growth. We expect earnings in the range of $230 million to $250 million. This represents earnings growth of 3% to 12% after adjusting for $21 million of nonrecurring favorable tax items recognized in this segment in 2014. 
Regarding the Group Disability and Life business, we expect full year 2015 earnings in the range of $320 million to $340 million. Regarding our remaining operations that is other operations incorporate, we expect a loss of $180 million for 2015. 
So all in, for full year 2015, we expect consolidated adjusted income from operations of $2.1 billion to $2.2 billion or $8.00 to $8.40 per share. Our outlook continues to exclude the impact of prior plan development or earning future capital deployment. While we do not anticipate the impact of future capital deployment in our EPS outlook, we do expect the digital free cash flow that we generate will be deployed for the benefit of shareholders either through value-creating acquisitions or share repurchase. 
Overall, these results represent a competitively attractive outlook and underscore the benefit of our diverse and differentiated portfolio of businesses. I would also note that due to the timing of some strategic investments, as well as the growth of our Medicare Part D business, which traditionally reports low first quarter earnings, we expect our first quarter 2015 earnings will be lower than first quarter of 2014. 
Now moving to our 2015 capital management position and outlook. Overall, we continued to have excellent financial flexibility. Our subsidiaries remain well capitalized free in our generated free cash flow is apparent with a strong return on capital needs of our segments. Our capital employment strategy and priorities have not changed. These priorities are providing the capital necessary to support the growth of our ongoing operations, pursuing M&A activity with a focus on acquiring capabilities and scale to further grow our targeted areas of focus, and after considering these 2 items, we'll return capital to shareholders primarily through share repurchase. 
Regarding free cash flow, during 2014, we repurchased 18.5 million shares of stock for approximately $1.6 billion, and we ended the year with parent company cash of approximately $400 million. For full year 2015, we expect subsidiary dividends of approximately $1.7 billion, driven by strong performance in each of our business segments. 
After considering all sources and uses of parent company cash, including the funding of our recently announced acquisition of QualCare, this outlook implies we would have approximately $1.8 billion available for capital deployment in 2015, including approximately $115 million we deployed to repurchase 1.1 million shares from January 1 through February 4. 
Our free cash flow outlook reflects the industry-leading margins returned on capital businesses and a high level of capital efficiency, particularly from our fee-based businesses. These capital efficiency allows us to find attractive organic growth, while continuing to generate significant free cash flow to be deployed for the benefit of shareholders. 
Now to recap. Our full year 2014 consolidated results reflect the strength of our diversified portfolio of global businesses and a continued track record of effective execution of our focused strategy. The fundamentals of our business remain strong, as evidenced by strong growth in revenue earnings, industry-leading medical cost and quality outcomes and continued strong free cash flow. Based on the strength of these results, we are confident on our ability to achieve our full year 2015 earnings outlook. 
And with that, we will turn it over to the operator for the Q&A portion of the call."

Also very importantly, all the numbers I just referenced exclude the impact of the $1.8 billion of deployable capital we have for 2015. As it relates to tailwinds, if you can think about several tailwinds for us, clearly, the revenue in customer base growth number 1. two, expense leverage. We have a track record of continuing to generate efficiency gains and expense leverage, some of which were redeploy for the benefit of innovation. Third, ongoing specialty penetration. We have a good track record of driving for the specialty penetration. And fourth, some improvement in the performance of our individual portfolio of businesses. As relates to headwinds, you can think about a few. As we've discussed before, the impact of specialty pharma on the overall medical cost trend and specifically, for example, its impact on Seniors portfolio of business. Two, as you know, another step up in the industry tax. A portion of it, our assumptions are we'll not pass through fully in the Medicare arena.

It's just basically been improving from our initial expectations in year. Still a little higher than what we'd like to be. But that improvement has been driven basically by both better assessment of the early part of the year claims as they developed favorably and a bit of improvement in the run rate. And as you kind of suggested, the 3Rs. So just a couple of minutes on the 3Rs. Our year end accrual for 3Rs now totals about $200 million after-tax. The majority of the accrual continues to be related to the reinsurance element of the 3R program, which risk adjusters presenting higher amount of remaining balance and a smaller amount for this quarter of recoveries. And I'll give you some more specific color on our approach. We have accrued reinsurance at the 80% coinsurance level consistent with the design of the program. We have not accrued any risk adjuster impact for our taxes business due to the current lack of industry data. And we accrued amounts under the risk quarter because we're comfortable with the statutes and administrative guidelines that support that program. So as you know, there are some interplay among each of these program elements, but overall, we're very comfortable with our total accrual."

We all know that Part D first quarter results tend to be low. And the impacts of the drug transition requirements for new customers. So all in, on a comparable basis, we are expecting first quarter '15 to be lower than first quarter 4."

So if you stop back, what makes these programs work is not a Stop Loss program. What makes these programs work is getting the benefit alignment laid out with the right incentives, the network appropriate, the clinical programs aligned. For example, we have the ability and we do, do on-site biometrics training, on site coaching for million employer. That's a new model.

And as we have in the past and as we are willing to go-forward basis, we'll try to give you as much color as possible in terms of the underlying drivers of the overall business portfolio. But this was an attempt to be, again, responsive to the market. But also, maintaining an appropriate amount of transparency and not go to a single modest ratio, but provide 2 loss ratios for the domestic tough business."

I am Will McDowell, Vice President of Investor Relations. Joining me this morning are David Cordani, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tom McCarthy, Cigna's Chief Financial Officer. In our remarks today, David and Tom will cover a number of topics, including Cigna's full year 2014 financial results as well as our financial outlook for 2015.
As noted in our earnings release, when describing our financial results, Cigna uses certain financial measures which are not determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, otherwise known as GAAP. Specifically, we use the term labeled ""adjusted income from operations"" and ""earnings per share"" on this same basis as the principal measures of performance for Cigna and our business segments. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is contained in today's earnings release, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of cigna.com.
In our remarks today, we will be making some forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our outlook for 2015 and future performance. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. A description of these risks and uncertainties is contained in the cautionary note to today's earnings release and in our most recent reports filed with the SEC.
Before turning the call over to David, I will cover a few items pertaining to our financial results and disclosures. First, please note that, when we discuss the number of covered lives for our global medical customers, we will be doing so on a basis that excludes those individuals that were previously covered under Limited Benefits plans. As a reminder, we exited the Limited Benefits business as of December 31, 2013, as required by the Affordable Care Act regulation.
Second, please note that our definition of adjusted income from operations will change for 2015 reporting in that we will now exclude acquisition-related amortization expense from this operating measure. When we discuss our earnings outlook for 2015 today, it will be on a basis of adjusted income from operations that excludes acquisition-related amortization expense. This is a change compared to the basis on which 2014 results are reported and how we have previously provided our 2014 outlook. In 2015, the impact of excluding acquisition-related amortization expense is approximately $100 million after tax or $0.40 per share.
Third, beginning in 2015, we have simplified our guidance and disclosures for our medical care ratios or MCRs by reporting them on a basis of total Commercial and total Government. The total Commercial ratio encompasses all of our commercial risk products, including medical, pharmacy, dental, stop loss and behavioral products, provided through guaranteed cost or experience-rated funding arrangements in both the United States and internationally. The total Government ratio includes our Medicare Advantage, Medicare Part D and Medicaid businesses. To ease the transition, we have provided historical medical care ratios on these bases within our quarterly financial supplement that was posted in the Investor Relations section of cigna.com this morning.
Lastly, consistent with past practices, when we make any prospective comments on earnings or EPS outlook, we will do so on a basis that excludes the impact of any future capital deployment or prior year development of medical costs. Our outlook also excludes the impact from our recently announced acquisition of QualCare, which we do not expect will have a material impact to our financial results in 2015.
And with that, I will turn the call over to David."

To begin, I'll review highlights of our full year 2014 financial results and our 2015 outlook. I will then discuss how we will continue to create value for our customers, clients and shareholders in the future. I will also illustrate more specifically how we are creating value in our Seniors business and leveraging our experience and success of that business to drive long-term growth. Then Tom will address our fourth quarter and full year 2014 financial performance in more detail as well as provide the specifics for our outlook for 2015 before we take your questions. And following the Q&A session, I'll wrap up the call with a few closing remarks.
We'll start with some highlights from the year.
Cigna's strong 2014 performance represents the fifth consecutive year of competitively attractive financial results. This outstanding track record of results is driven by the disciplined execution of our growth strategy, all while we continue to invest in new capabilities, expand our offerings and our geographic footprint. Over the past several years, in the face of a particularly challenging and dynamic environment, we have been focused and disciplined with targeted yet meaningful investments to drive innovation, including new clinical programs, aligned incentives for customers, expanded technologies and programs for health care professionals. We have done all these while delivering competitively differentiated results year in and year out.
The full year 2014 consolidated revenues increased 8% to $35 billion, with each business segment delivering strong growth over 2013. We reported adjusted income from operations for the full year of $2 billion or $7.43 per share, which represents a per share increase of 9% over 2013.
Our revenue and earnings performance reflect growth in all of our businesses over the course of the year, the year in which we also grew to more than 85 million customer relationships worldwide and where we continue to generate strong margins and significant free cash flow for the benefit of shareholders. These results position us to once again deliver competitively attractive revenue and earnings growth in 2015.
For 2015, our outlook of 8% to 10% revenue growth and 5% to 10% EPS growth, excluding reserve development recognized in 2014 as well as future capital deployment, reflects the focus and clarity of our strategy and continued strong performance of our team around the world. Tom will walk you through more specifics regarding outlook later on the call.
Now I'd like to talk about how our guiding framework, global strategy and multiple avenues for growth have enabled our long track record of success and will drive ongoing future value creation.
Across our business, we operate in an ever-changing market landscape with diverse needs across customers, employers, health care professionals and governments. Moving in this market, we are meeting and exceeding the expectations of our customers and clients around the world by delivering affordable and personalized solutions. As we look to the future, we have built a growth framework to create ongoing value, leverage our differentiated capabilities for the benefit of our customers.
There are 3 components to this framework. First is leveraging our well-positioned existing portfolio of businesses to continue to generate attractive value for our customers and clients. We expect to double the size of our company over the next 7 to 8 years. This will result in an average annual revenue growth rate of 8% to 10% largely driven by our existing portfolio and focused execution. This continues a track record that we have demonstrated over the last 5 years, and our 2015 outlook of 8% to 10% revenue growth is consistent with this goal.
The second component is targeted and effective capital deployment to create ongoing shareholder value. I would note that, over the past 5 years, we have effectively deployed capital through a balance of investments in our business portfolio, strategic M&A and share repurchase. A good recent example of this is our agreement to purchase QualCare Alliance Networks. This acquisition is directly aligned with our Go Deep and our physician partnership strategies.
Our businesses are generating high margins and are capital efficient, allowing us to both fund attractive organic growth and generate significant free cash flow. This free cash flow provide us with financial flexibility and the opportunity to deploy capital to create additional value for our shareholders. And given the health of our balance sheet and underlying capitalization level of our subsidiaries, we expect to have $1.8 billion of capital available for deployment in 2015.
The third component of our framework where we seek to drive additional value for our shareholders is through new and emerging opportunities. These opportunities include new distribution marketplaces such as public and private exchanges, geographic expansion such as new Medicare Advantage markets and international opportunities and new buying segments and service expansion such as medical service organization offerings for the benefit of integrated health care professionals. We are well positioned to pursue each of these potentially attractive future growth opportunities that are aligned with our strategy. As such, we have dedicated resources to fuel future expansion in these areas.
To illustrate how we are leveraging this framework to create value, I'll highlight how this framework applies to our Seniors business. This market segment includes a population with a variety of complex needs, requiring customer engagement and incentive-based clinical resources and programs to drive ongoing success. Our Seniors business pioneered successful positioning gauge and models, including alliance incentives and collaborative relationships to drive high-quality and a more affordable health care experience for both customers as well as physicians. As we continue to leverage our core physician engagement capabilities across all of our health services businesses, we are focused on key investments that improve affordability, enhance personalized services and drive better clinical outcomes. For example, the strategic investments we're making to enhance our physician insight and data tools will enable our clinical data to be accessible in a real-time fashion from more of our physician partners as well as our service team. Enabled by our physician engagement model, seniors continue to find our Cigna HealthSpring benefit offerings increasingly compelling. And we expect to have 6% to 8% Medicare Advantage customer growth in 2015.
As for positioning, we continue to be amongst the top 3 players in market share for all of our established markets, and we are posing attractive growth in our newer markets. In 2014, we expanded our Seniors business into Georgia and the Carolinas, where we successfully leveraged existing Cigna commercial networks to develop and implement engaged physician relationships for seniors. Importantly, the quality of care delivered through our engaged physician groups is reflected in our stars ratings, where we increased our membership in 4-star or higher plans from approximately 40% to nearly 60% in 2016. Looking to 2017, we again expect to deliver an increase in this result. These improvements in star ratings have allowed us to enhance our benefit offerings and position our Seniors business to be an earnings accelerant in 2016 and beyond.
Relative to expanding opportunities, we currently operate Medicaid into eligible plans in Texas and in the Illinois markets. Here, we are leveraging our care coordination capabilities to serve the dual-eligible population within our Medicaid platform. Focusing our growth efforts on improving care for the underserved, including the dual-eligible and age, blind and disabled populations, complements our proven experience with complex care coordinations, differentiated clinical outcomes and affordability focus. While our Illinois plan is relatively new, having just begun in 2014, our Texas plan has been in operations since 2011 and has a track record of delivering affordable care and better health outcomes. In a testament of our commitment to servicing these customers, our Texas plan recently was acknowledged by the Medicaid Health Plans of America for our cutting-edge, intensive behavioral health programs.
We are well positioned and have the capital flexibility to pursue these accelerating geographic and market segment expansion opportunities either organically or through M&A, as Seniors remains a strategic growth priority for us. As a global company, our efforts to leverage these capabilities have also expanded across key markets beyond the United States. In Korea, for example, where the age population is seeking new solutions to meet their emerging needs, we've developed an innovative and new health membership program targeting seniors known as Heyday. This organically built affinity program delivers value-added services directly to seniors in Korea. And while only a year into this expansion, we now serve more than 300,000 Korean seniors. So overall, we have a clear strategy and the capabilities to deliver value and improve the health and well-being of senior customers today and into the future.
Whether in our Seniors business as we discussed today or other growth businesses we have addressed in previous calls, we will continue to deliver attractive growth, produce and deploy capital effectively and invest and position ourselves to win in new and emerging markets and segments.
Now to summarize my comments before Tom offers more detail on our 2014 results and expectations for 2015.
Cigna's strong 2014 financial performance extends a multiyear track record of delivering competitively attractive revenue, earnings and free cash flow. Continued execution of our growth strategy is creating value for our customers and clients, complemented by our differentiated capabilities and innovative physician and customer engagement solutions. As a rapidly changing industry and economic environment continues to unfold and new challenges arise, we are positioned to capitalize on new growth opportunities while we continue to leverage our core businesses for growth. And by embracing change, we continue to position our company for successful investing in the future, preparing for significant new opportunities such as those we shared this morning for our Seniors segment, including in existing programs and markets, new market expansion, new offerings for health care professionals through our medical service organization solutions, new segments such as dual eligibles and new affinity programs such as HeyDay in Korea.
We expect to meet our growth objectives of 8% to 10% on average, doubling the size of our company again over the next 7 to 8 years. And based on our focused strategy, strong market positioning and ability to leverage capital, as well as further opportunities we have for growth, we expect to continue to deliver competitively attractive and sustained long-term EPS growth of 10% to 13% on average, all while continuing to invest back in our company.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Tom."
172899,253311656,755685,"Cigna Corp., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 05, 2015",2015-02-05,"Earnings Calls","The Cigna Group","Executives","Thanks, David. Good morning, everyone.In my remarks today, I will review Cigna's 2014 results and provide our outlook for 2015.We had another strong year in 2014, with revenue growth of 8% and industry-leading earnings per share growth of 9% over 2013",2097,"Thanks, David. Good morning, everyone.
In my remarks today, I will review Cigna's 2014 results and provide our outlook for 2015.
We had another strong year in 2014, with revenue growth of 8% and industry-leading earnings per share growth of 9% over 2013 results. 2014 represents our fifth consecutive year of consistently strong revenue, earnings and EPS growth; and attractive result both on an absolute and competitive basis. In addition, we continued to generate strong free cash flow in 2014, which resulted in approximately $1.6 billion being returned to shareholders through share repurchase. The strength of our 2014 performance provides us with a solid foundation for growth in 2015.
Now moving to operating results.
Our full year consolidated revenues grew 8% to $35 billion, driven by growth in each of our business segments and in our targeted markets. Earnings grew 3% to $2 billion, and earnings per share grew 9% to $7.43 in 2014. Our ability to grow revenue, earnings and EPS in a challenging operating environment reflects the strength of our underlying businesses and focused execution.
Regarding the segments, I will first comment on our Global Health Care segment. Overall, Global Health Care delivered another good year. 2014 premiums and fees grew 7% to $24.5 billion, reflecting growth in all of our Global Health Care businesses, including ongoing growth in our self-funded programs and specialty products. We ended 2014 with 14.5 million global medical customers, growing by approximately 380,000 customers or 3% for the year.
Full year earnings were $1.65 billion, reflecting business growth, specialty contributions, operating expense efficiency and effective medical cost management.
Turning to medical costs. We continue to deliver medical costs that reflect better health outcomes and strong clinical excellence for our customers and clients as a result of our deep collaborative relationships with physicians and our focus on personalization of care. For our total U.S. commercial book of business, full year medical cost trend was slightly less than the low end of our previous range of 4.5% to 5.5% for 2014. Our commercial medical trend result continues our multiyear track record of industry-leading performance. And given that over 85% of our U.S. Commercial customers are in transfer and ASO funding arrangements, our clients directly benefit from these favorable medical costs.
Regarding medical care ratios. In our U.S. Commercial guaranteed cost business, our full year 2014 medical care ratio or MCR was 81.8% on a reported basis or 82.7% excluding prior year reserve development. Consistent with our expectations, our fourth quarter 2014 guaranteed cost MCR of 86.6% reflects an increased seasonal impact from the growing share of high-deductible plans in our employer group and individual businesses. We also expected and saw this increased seasonal impact across most of our Commercial business, including our stop loss and experience-rated businesses.
Overall, our employer risk businesses continued to deliver solid results in the quarter and throughout the year, reflecting strong pricing, disciplined underwriting and continued effective medical management and physician engagement. Results in our individual business, while still below long-term expectations, continued to improve in the fourth quarter.
In our Government business, our full year 2014 MCR for Medicare Advantage was 83.5% on a reported basis or 84% excluding prior year reserve development, reflecting the impact of medical cost improvement initiatives implemented during 2014.
Moving to operating expenses for 2014. Our total Global Health Care operating expense ratio was 22%. This includes the impact of health reform-related taxes, which added 110 basis points to the expense ratio for the year. Overall, we've had another strong year in our Global Health Care business.
Now I'll discuss the results of our Global Supplemental Benefits business, which continues to deliver attractive growth and profitability.
Premiums and fees grew 14% year-over-year in global supplemental. 2014 earnings in our Global Supplemental Benefits business were $230 million, reflecting attractive operating margins, continued strategic investments to drive future growth and nonrecurring favorable tax items of $21 million after tax recorded in the third quarter. Fourth quarter earnings of $33 million reflect claims seasonality, our funding of long-term strategic investments and the impact from the strengthening of the U.S. dollar.
For Group Disability and Life, full year results reflect premium and fee increase of 6% over 2013. 2014 earnings in our group business were $317 million and reflect favorable claim experience in our life business and a lower operating expense ratio.
For our Corporate and Other Operations, results totaled to an after-tax loss of $197 million for full year 2014.
Overall, our 2014 results reflect revenue earnings growth from each of our business segments and a significant free cash flow as the result of the continued effective execution of our strategy.
Turning to our investment portfolio. For 2014, we reported net realized investment gains of $106 million after tax, coupled with a strong net investment income result. The high quality and diversification of our investment portfolio continued to drive our overall investment results.
Now I will discuss our outlook for 2015. In 2015, we expect to continue to deliver strong financial performance for our shareholders by leveraging our differentiated capabilities to meet and exceed the expectations of our customers and clients by delivering affordable and personalized solutions, effectively deploying capital and targeting new and emerging opportunities where we will seek to drive additional value for our shareholders.
For full year 2015, we expect consolidated revenues to grow in a range of 8% to 10% over 2014, with continued growth across our targeted market segments. We expect full year 2015 consolidated adjusted income from operations to be in the range of $2.1 billion to $2.2 billion or $8 to $8.40 per share. As Will noted earlier, our full year 2015 consolidated and business segment adjusted income from operations, as well as earnings per share, estimates now exclude acquisition-related amortization expense.
In 2015, the impact of excluding acquisition-related amortization expense is approximately $0.40 per share or $100 million after tax, including $85 million in our Global Health Care business and $15 million in Global Supplemental Benefits. Lastly, consistent with prior practice, our outlook excludes any contribution from additional capital deployment as well as any prior-year claim development, which in 2014 totaled $53 million after tax.
Putting our 2015 outlook and our 2014 actual results on a comparable basis, that is adjusting for the reserve development reported in our 2014 results and adjusting to a consistent base with -- basis for reporting P&L amortization, our outlook for operating earnings in 2015 reflects 3% to 8% growth over 2014, and our outlook for EPS growth is 5% to 10% before considering the impact of additional capital deployment.
I will now discuss the components of our 2015 outlook, starting with Global Health Care. We expect full year Global Health Care earnings in the range of approximately $1.73 billion to $1.79 billion. This outlook reflects continued benefits from organic revenue growth, specialty contributions, effective medical cost management and operating expense efficiencies. This also includes our updated view of the annual enrollment period results for both Medicare and the public exchange business.
I'll now summarize some of the key assumptions reflected in our Global Health Care earnings outlook for 2015, starting with our customer base. Regarding global medical customers, we expect 2015 customer growth of 1% to 3%. This growth is driven by expected ongoing growth in our Commercial employer business led by continued double-digit customer growth in our Select business, as well as mid- to upper single-digit growth in our Medicare Advantage customers, with some expected reduction in our non-ACA-compliant individual customers.
Turning to medical costs. Our 2015 outlook assumes some increase in medical utilization versus current levels, and this increase has been reflected in our pricing. For our total U.S. Commercial book of business, we expect full year medical cost trend to be in the range of 5% to 6%.
As Will noted earlier, we are changing the basis on which we provide guidance for MCRs to total Commercial and total Government. We believe this basis will provide better insight into our ability to effectively manage medical costs for our Commercial and Seniors customers. For our total Commercial book of business, we expect the 2015 medical care ratio to be in the range of 78% to 79%. This compares to our full year 2014 total Commercial MCR of 78.9% on an operating basis. For our total Government book of business, we expect the 2015 medical care ratio to be in the range of 84.5% to 85.5%. This compares to our full year 2014 total Government MCR of 84.7% on an operating basis.
Regarding operating expenses, our 2015 Global Health Care operating expense ratio is expected to be in the range of 20.5% to 21.5%. Overall, we expect full year 2015 Global Health Care earnings to be approximately $1.73 billion to $1.79 billion. We believe this is a competitively attractive result reflecting our focus on growing segments of the health care market and continued strong execution of our business strategy.
Now moving to the other components of our outlook.
For our Global Supplemental Benefits business, we continue to expect strong top line growth. We expect earnings in the range of $230 million to $250 million. This represents earnings growth of 3% to 12% after adjusting for $21 million of nonrecurring favorable tax items recognized in this segment in 2014. Regarding the Group Disability and Life business, we expect full year 2015 earnings in the range of $320 million to $340 million. Regarding our remaining operations, that is Other Operations and Corporate, we expect a loss of $180 million for 2015.
So all in, for full year 2015, we expect consolidated adjusted income from operations of $2.1 billion to $2.2 billion or $8.00 to $8.40 per share. Our outlook continues to exclude the impact of prior plan development or any future capital deployment. While we do not anticipate the impact of future capital deployment in our EPS outlook, we do expect the additional free cash flow that we generate will be deployed for the benefit of shareholders either through value-creating acquisitions or share repurchase.
Overall, these results represent a competitively attractive outlook and underscore the benefit of our diverse and differentiated portfolio of businesses. I would also note that due to the timing of some strategic investments as well as the growth of our Medicare Part D business, which traditionally reports low first quarter earnings, we expect our first quarter 2015 earnings will be lower than first quarter of 2014.
Now moving to our 2015 capital management position and outlook. Overall, we continue to have excellent financial flexibility. Our subsidiaries remain well capitalized and are generating significant free cash flow to the parent, with a strong return on capital in each of our business segments. Our capital deployment strategy and priorities have not changed. These priorities are providing the capital necessary to support the growth of our ongoing operations; pursuing M&A activity with a focus on acquiring capabilities and scale to further grow in our targeted areas of focus; and after considering these first 2 items, we'll return capital to shareholders, primarily through share repurchase.
Regarding free cash flow. During 2014, we repurchased 18.5 million shares of stock for approximately $1.6 billion, and we ended the year with parent company cash of approximately $400 million. For full year 2015, we expect subsidiary dividends of approximately $1.7 billion, driven by strong performance in each of our business segments. After considering all sources and uses of parent company cash, including the funding of our recently announced acquisition of QualCare, this outlook implies we would have approximately $1.8 billion available for capital deployment in 2015, including approximately $115 million we deployed to repurchase 1.1 million shares from January 1 through February 4.
Our free cash flow outlook reflects the industry-leading margins and returns on capital in our businesses; and a high level of capital efficiency, particularly from our fee-based businesses. This capital efficiency allows us to fund attractive organic growth while continuing to generate significant free cash flow to be deployed for the benefit of shareholders.
Now to recap. Our full year 2014 consolidated results reflect the strength of our diversified portfolio of global businesses and a continued track record of effective execution of our focused strategy. The fundamentals of our business remain strong, as evidenced by strong growth in revenue and earnings, industry-leading medical costs and quality outcomes and continued strong free cash flow. Based on the strength of these results, we are confident on our ability to achieve our full year 2015 earnings outlook.
And with that, we will turn it over to the operator for the Q&A portion of the call."

And as we've done in the past, we will continue to make ongoing investments in our company while seeking to generate an attractive and a competitively differentiated outcomes for our business. Also very importantly, all the numbers I just referenced exclude the impact of the $1.8 billion of deployable capital we'll have for 2015. As it relates to tailwinds, you can think about several tailwinds for us: clearly, the revenue and customer base growth, number one; two, expense leverage. We have a track record of continuing to generate efficiency gains and expense leverage, some of which we redeploy for the benefit of innovation. Third, ongoing specialty penetration. We have a good track record of driving further specialty penetration. And fourth, some improvement in the performance of our individual portfolio of businesses. As it relates to headwinds, you can think about a few: as we've discussed before, the impact of specialty pharma on the overall medical cost trend and specifically, for example, its impact on Seniors portfolio of business; two, as you know, another step-up in the industry tax. A portion of it, well, our assumptions are, will not pass through fully in the Medicare arena. And thirdly, for us, given our global nature, some FX impact into 2015. But taken as a whole, we feel good about the 2015 impact that we're able to generate here with growth, earnings and EPS growth; capital positioning; and then finally, Justin, the positioning this gives us for 2016, as we would expect to have further earnings accelerants off of the positioning we've taken relative to our Seniors business in that portfolio.

Our outlook for 2015 earnings of $230 million to $250 million reflects continued strong operating margins; the continued funding of growth initiatives; and continued currency pressure, as you suggested, of about $10 million to $15 million after tax. So if you adjust for the $21 million onetime tax benefit reported in the '14, the deal amortization change and the impact of the currency pressure, the underlying growth for global supp is in the 8% to 18% range."

Think of it, in order of magnitude, as we've talked about before, about 3% of the overall franchise revenue in terms of 2014. And we would expect it to be in the similar range in 2015, with some puts and takes in terms of the runoff of the grant part of the [ph] business and some growth on the -- on exchange business.

So also reflecting, of course, increased seasonality in the fourth quarter. It's just basically been improving from our initial expectations in the year. It's still a little higher than where we'd like to be. That improvement has been driven basically by both a better assessment of the early part of the year claims as they developed a little favorably and a little bit of an improvement in the run rate and, as you kind of suggested, the 3Rs. 
So just a couple of minutes on the 3Rs. Our year-end accrual for 3Rs now totals about $200 million after tax. The majority of the accrual continues to be related to the reinsurance element of the 3R program with risk adjusters representing the higher amount of the remaining balance and a smaller amount for risk quarter of recoveries. 
And I'll give you some more specific color on our approach. We have accrued reinsurance at the 80% coinsurance level consistent with the design of the program. We have not accrued any risk adjuster impact for our Texas business due to the current lack of industry data. And we accrued amounts under the risk quarter because we're comfortable with the statutes and administrative guidelines that support that program. 
So as you know, there's some interplay among each of these program elements. But overall, we're very comfortable with our total accrual."

Our approach to this base is somewhat different than the marketplace. So it's to be consultative and work with employers to design the right consumer engagement and benefit designs and network structures, and then offer multiple funding alternatives, one of which is, as you referenced, an ASO proposition that gives them much more transparency and tighter alignment. 
As you know, the overall employer landscape in the U.S. is not growing, shrinking up market, a little bit of growth down market. So there's little bit of growth.

As it relates to standalone, if you'll stop loss players in this space, I don't see that as a primary competitive disruptor largely because of the impact of integration here. So if you step back, what makes these programs work is not a stop loss program. What makes these programs work is getting the benefit alignment laid out with the right incentives, the network configuration appropriate, the clinical programs aligned. For example, we have the ability, and we do, do on-site biometric screening, on-site coaching for a hundred like [ph] employer. That's a new model, to be able to do that and bring that on board for a client and identify the 1, 2 or 3 high-risk individuals who are not incurring costs today, but we need to engage clinically with.

Again, our approach focuses on the integrated benefits of actually more effectively managing medical costs. And the standalone stop loss carriers typically don't have that feature. 
In addition, we do have some built-in advantages versus them. I mean, we already have this customer in our sights, so we have one set of acquisition costs that they have to pay incremental acquisition cost to secure this customer. And we have a lot better insight into the underlying claims data, so our ability to effectively approach the program is very superior. So we don't really find ourselves in what sometimes can be a hypercompetitive standalone stop loss market, not really a market we're computing in.

But obviously, we're not seeing it in the results, so I don't -- I think you might be missing a little -- something there. 
But just a couple of things. First, the loss ratio on stop loss is lower than the average overall loss ratio, but the premium density in the other businesses is pretty high. So I'd be surprised if there was a one point impact, but we'll do that math. 
Second, on stop loss, we actually would expect some modest increase in the stop loss loss ratio as we continue to sell disproportionately in the lower end. And those customers tend to have a more premium density, so less of an expense factor in the result and a higher MCR. Again, very attractive MCR, so it's not like it's worse profitability. The bottom line margin is still very attractive for the -- that stop loss business. But the dynamics in the MLR are a little higher. So I would expect that there's marginal impact probably from this change, but I'll do a little more careful look at that."

The value prop is primarily to enable a further retail experience for individuals to get them more actively engaged in the selection of their personal benefits.

I am Will McDowell, Vice President of Investor Relations. Joining me this morning are David Cordani, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tom McCarthy, Cigna's Chief Financial Officer. In our remarks today, David and Tom will cover a number of topics, including Cigna's full year 2014 financial results as well as our financial outlook for 2015.
As noted in our earnings release, when describing our financial results, Cigna uses certain financial measures which are not determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, otherwise known as GAAP. Specifically, we use the term labeled ""adjusted income from operations"" and ""earnings per share"" on this same basis as the principal measures of performance for Cigna and our business segments. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is contained in today's earnings release, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of cigna.com.
In our remarks today, we will be making some forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our outlook for 2015 and future performance. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. A description of these risks and uncertainties is contained in the cautionary note to today's earnings release and in our most recent reports filed with the SEC.
Before turning the call over to David, I will cover a few items pertaining to our financial results and disclosures. First, please note that when we discuss the number of covered lives for our global medical customers, we will be doing so on a basis that excludes those individuals that were previously covered under Limited Benefits plans. As a reminder, we exited the Limited Benefits business as of December 31, 2013, as required by the Affordable Care Act regulation.
Second, please note that our definition of adjusted income from operations will change for 2015 reporting in that we will now exclude acquisition-related amortization expense from this operating measure. When we discuss our earnings outlook for 2015 today, it will be on a basis of adjusted income from operations that excludes acquisition-related amortization expense. This is a change compared to the basis on which 2014 results are reported and how we have previously provided our 2014 outlook. In 2015, the impact of excluding acquisition-related amortization expense is approximately $100 million after tax or $0.40 per share.
Third, beginning in 2015, we have simplified our guidance and disclosures for our medical care ratios or MCRs by reporting them on a basis of total Commercial and total Government. The total Commercial ratio encompasses all of our commercial risk products, including medical, pharmacy, dental, stop loss and behavioral products, provided through guaranteed cost or experience-rated funding arrangements in both the United States and internationally. The total Government ratio includes our Medicare Advantage, Medicare Part D and Medicaid businesses. To ease the transition, we have provided historical medical care ratios on these bases within our quarterly financial supplement that was posted in the Investor Relations section of cigna.com this morning.
Lastly, consistent with past practices, when we make any prospective comments on earnings or EPS outlook, we will do so on a basis that excludes the impact of any future capital deployment or prior year development of medical costs. Our outlook also excludes the impact from our recently announced acquisition of QualCare, which we do not expect will have a material impact to our financial results in 2015.
And with that, I will turn the call over to David."

To begin, I'll review highlights of our full year 2014 financial results and our 2015 outlook. I will then discuss how we will continue to create value for our customers, clients and shareholders in the future. I will also illustrate more specifically how we are creating value in our Seniors business and leveraging our experience and success of that business to drive long-term growth. Then Tom will address our fourth quarter and full year 2014 financial performance in more detail as well as provide the specifics for our outlook for 2015 before we take your questions. And following the Q&A session, I'll wrap up the call with a few closing remarks.
We'll start with some highlights from the year.
Cigna's strong 2014 performance represents the fifth consecutive year of competitively attractive financial results. This outstanding track record of results is driven by the disciplined execution of our growth strategy, all while we continue to invest in new capabilities, expand our offerings and our geographic footprint. Over the past several years, in the face of a particularly challenging and dynamic environment, we have been focused and disciplined with targeted yet meaningful investments to drive innovation, including new clinical programs, aligned incentives for customers, expanded technologies and programs for health care professionals. We have done all this while delivering competitively differentiated results year in and year out.
The full year 2014 consolidated revenues increased 8% to $35 billion, with each business segment delivering strong growth over 2013. We reported adjusted income from operations for the full year of $2 billion or $7.43 per share, which represents a per share increase of 9% over 2013.
Our revenue and earnings performance reflect growth in all of our businesses over the course of the year, a year in which we also grew to more than 85 million customer relationships worldwide and where we continue to generate strong margins and significant free cash flow for the benefit of shareholders. These results position us to once again deliver competitively attractive revenue and earnings growth in 2015.
For 2015, our outlook of 8% to 10% revenue growth and 5% to 10% EPS growth, excluding reserve development recognized in 2014 as well as future capital deployment, reflects the focus and clarity of our strategy and continued strong performance of our team around the world. Tom will walk you through more specifics regarding our outlook later on the call.
Now I'd like to talk about how our guiding framework, global strategy and multiple avenues for growth have enabled our long track record of success and will drive ongoing future value creation.
Across our business, we operate in an ever-changing market landscape with diverse needs across customers, employers, health care professionals and governments. Moving [ph] in this market, we are meeting and exceeding the expectations of our customers and clients around the world by delivering affordable and personalized solutions. As we look to the future, we have built a growth framework to create ongoing value, leverage our differentiated capabilities for the benefit of our customers.
There are 3 components to this framework. First is leveraging our well-positioned existing portfolio of businesses to continue to generate attractive value for our customers and clients. We expect to double the size of our company over the next 7 to 8 years. This will result in an average annual revenue growth rate of 8% to 10%, largely driven by our existing portfolio and focused execution. This continues a track record that we have demonstrated over the last 5 years, and our 2015 outlook of 8% to 10% revenue growth is consistent with this goal.
The second component is targeted and effective capital deployment to create ongoing shareholder value. I would note that, over the past 5 years, we have effectively deployed capital through a balance of investments in our business portfolio, strategic M&A and share repurchase. A good recent example of this is our agreement to purchase QualCare Alliance Networks. This acquisition is directly aligned with our Go Deep and our physician partnership strategies.
Our businesses are generating high margins and are capital efficient, allowing us to both fund attractive organic growth and generate significant free cash flow. This free cash flow provides us with financial flexibility and the opportunity to deploy capital to create additional value for our shareholders. And given the health of our balance sheet and underlying capitalization level of our subsidiaries, we expect to have $1.8 billion of capital available for deployment in 2015.
The third component of our framework where we seek to drive additional value for our shareholders is through new and emerging opportunities. These opportunities include new distribution marketplaces such as public and private exchanges, geographic expansion such as new Medicare Advantage markets and international opportunities, and new buying [ph] segments and service expansion such as medical service organization offerings for the benefit of integrated health care professionals. We are well positioned to pursue each of these potentially attractive future growth opportunities that are aligned with our strategy. As such, we have dedicated resources to fuel future expansion in these areas.
To illustrate how we are leveraging this framework to create value, I'll highlight how this framework applies to our Seniors business. This market segment includes a population with a variety of complex needs, requiring customer engagement and incentive-based clinical resources and programs to drive ongoing success. Our Seniors business pioneered successful physician engagement models, including aligned incentives and collaborative relationships to drive high-quality and a more affordable health care experience for both customers as well as physicians. As we continue to leverage our core physician engagement capabilities across all of our health services businesses, we are focused on key investments that improve affordability, enhance personalized services and drive better clinical outcomes. For example, the strategic investments we're making to enhance our physician insight and data tools will enable our clinical data to be accessible in a real-time fashion for more of our physician partners as well as our service teams. Enabled by our physician engagement model, seniors continue to find our Cigna HealthSpring benefit offerings increasingly compelling. And we expect to have 6% to 8% Medicare Advantage customer growth in 2015.
As for positioning, we continue to be amongst the top 3 players in market share for all of our established markets, and we are posting attractive growth in our newer markets. In 2014, we expanded our Seniors business into Georgia and the Carolinas, where we successfully leveraged existing Cigna commercial networks to develop and implement engaged physician relationships for seniors. Importantly, the quality of care delivered through our engaged physician groups is reflected in our stars ratings, where we increased our membership in 4-star or higher plans from approximately 40% to nearly 60% in 2016. Looking to 2017, we again expect to deliver an increase in this result. These improvements in star ratings have allowed us to enhance our benefit offerings and position our Seniors business to be an earnings accelerant in 2016 and beyond.
Relative to our expanding opportunities, we currently operate Medicaid into eligible plans in Texas and in the Illinois markets. Here, we are leveraging our care coordination capabilities to serve the dual-eligible population within our Medicaid platform. Focusing our growth efforts on improving care for the underserved, including the dual-eligible and aged, blind and disabled populations, complements our proven experience with complex care coordinations, differentiated clinical outcomes and affordability focus. While our Illinois plan is relatively new, having just begun in 2014, our Texas plan has been in operation since 2011 and has a track record of delivering affordable care and better health outcomes. In a testament of our commitment to servicing these customers, our Texas plan recently was acknowledged by the Medicaid Health Plans of America for our cutting-edge, intensive behavioral health programs.
We are well-positioned and have the capital flexibility to pursue these accelerating geographic and market segment expansion opportunities, either organically or through M&A, as Seniors remains a strategic growth priority for us. As a global company, our efforts to leverage these capabilities have also expanded across key markets beyond the United States. In Korea, for example, where the aged population is seeking new solutions to meet their emerging needs, we've developed an innovative and new health membership program targeting seniors known as Heyday. This organically built affinity program delivers value-added services directly to seniors in Korea. And while only a year into this expansion, we now serve more than 300,000 Korean seniors. So overall, we have a clear strategy and the capabilities to deliver value and improve the health and well-being of senior customers today and into the future.
Whether in our Seniors business as we discussed today or other growth businesses we have addressed in previous calls, we will continue to deliver attractive growth, produce and deploy capital effectively, and invest and position ourselves to win in new and emerging markets and segments.
Now to summarize my comments before Tom offers more detail on our 2014 results and expectations for 2015.
Cigna's strong 2014 financial performance extends a multiyear track record of delivering competitively attractive revenue, earnings and free cash flow. Continued execution of our growth strategy is creating value for our customers and clients, complemented by our differentiated capabilities and innovative physician and customer engagement solutions. As a rapidly changing industry and economic environment continues to unfold and new challenges arise, we are positioned to capitalize on new growth opportunities while we continue to leverage our core businesses for growth. And by embracing change, we continue to position our company for successful investing in the future, preparing for significant new opportunities such as those we shared this morning for our Seniors segment, including: in existing programs and markets, new market expansion, new offerings for health care professionals through our medical service organization solutions, new segments such as dual eligibles and new affinity programs such as HeyDay in Korea.
We expect to meet our growth objectives of 8% to 10% on average, doubling the size of our company again over the next 7 to 8 years. And based on our focused strategy, strong market positioning and ability to leverage capital, as well as further opportunities we have for growth, we expect to continue to deliver competitively attractive and sustained long-term EPS growth of 10% to 13% on average, all while continuing to invest back in our company.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Tom."
172899,253311656,755880,"Cigna Corp., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 05, 2015",2015-02-05,"Earnings Calls","The Cigna Group","Executives","Thanks, David. Good morning, everyone.In my remarks today, I will review Cigna's 2014 results and provide our outlook for 2015.We had another strong year in 2014, with revenue growth of 8% and industry-leading earnings per share growth of 9% over 2013",2099,"Thanks, David. Good morning, everyone.
In my remarks today, I will review Cigna's 2014 results and provide our outlook for 2015.
We had another strong year in 2014, with revenue growth of 8% and industry-leading earnings per share growth of 9% over 2013 results. 2014 represents our fifth consecutive year of consistently strong revenue, earnings and EPS growth -- an attractive result both on an absolute and competitive basis. In addition, we continued to generate strong free cash flow in 2014, which resulted in approximately $1.6 billion being returned to shareholders through share repurchase. The strength of our 2014 performance provides us with a solid foundation for growth in 2015.
Now moving to operating results.
Our full year consolidated revenues grew 8% to $35 billion, driven by growth in each of our business segments and in our targeted markets. Earnings grew 3% to $2 billion, and earnings per share grew 9% to $7.43 in 2014. Our ability to grow revenue, earnings and EPS in a challenging operating environment reflects the strength of our underlying businesses and focused execution.
Regarding the segments, I will first comment on our Global Health Care segment. Overall, Global Health Care delivered another good year. 2014 premiums and fees grew 7% to $24.5 billion, reflecting growth in all of our Global Health Care businesses, including ongoing growth in our self-funded programs and specialty products. We ended 2014 with 14.5 million global medical customers, growing by approximately 380,000 customers or 3% for the year.
Full year earnings were $1.65 billion, reflecting business growth, specialty contributions, operating expense efficiency and effective medical cost management.
Turning to medical costs. We continue to deliver medical costs that reflect better health outcomes and strong clinical excellence for our customers and clients as a result of our deep collaborative relationships with physicians and our focus on personalization of care. For our total U.S. commercial book of business, full year medical cost trend was slightly less than the low end of our previous range of 4.5% to 5.5% for 2014. Our commercial medical trend result continues our multiyear track record of industry-leading performance. And given that over 85% of our U.S. Commercial customers are in transfer and ASO funding arrangements, our clients directly benefit from these favorable medical costs.
Regarding medical care ratios. In our U.S. Commercial guaranteed cost business, our full year 2014 medical care ratio or MCR was 81.8% on a reported basis or 82.7% excluding prior year reserve development. Consistent with our expectations, our fourth quarter 2014 guaranteed cost MCR of 86.6% reflects an increased seasonal impact from the growing share of high-deductible plans in our employer group and individual businesses. We also expected and saw this increased seasonal impact across most of our Commercial business, including our stop loss and experience-rated businesses.
Overall, our employer risk businesses continued to deliver solid results in the quarter and throughout the year, reflecting strong pricing, disciplined underwriting and continued effective medical management and physician engagement. Results in our individual business, while still below long-term expectations, continued to improve in the fourth quarter.
In our Government business, our full year 2014 MCR for Medicare Advantage was 83.5% on a reported basis or 84% excluding prior year reserve development, reflecting the impact of medical cost improvement initiatives implemented during 2014.
Moving to operating expenses for 2014. Our total Global Health Care operating expense ratio was 22%. This includes the impact of health reform-related taxes, which added 110 basis points to the expense ratio for the year. Overall, we've had another strong year in our Global Health Care business.
Now I'll discuss the results of our Global Supplemental Benefits business, which continues to deliver attractive growth and profitability.
Premiums and fees grew 14% year-over-year in global supplemental. 2014 earnings in our Global Supplemental Benefits business were $230 million, reflecting attractive operating margins, continued strategic investments to drive future growth and nonrecurring favorable tax items of $21 million after tax recorded in the third quarter. Fourth quarter earnings of $33 million reflect claims seasonality, our funding of long-term strategic investments and the impact from the strengthening of the U.S. dollar.
For Group Disability and Life, full year results reflect premium and fee increase of 6% over 2013. 2014 earnings in our group business were $317 million and reflect favorable claim experience in our Life business and a lower operating expense ratio.
For our Corporate and Other Operations, results totaled to an after-tax loss of $197 million for full year 2014.
Overall, our 2014 results reflect revenue earnings growth from each of our business segments and a significant free cash flow as the result of the continued effective execution of our strategy.
Turning to our investment portfolio. For 2014, we reported net realized investment gains of $106 million after tax, coupled with a strong net investment income result. The high quality and diversification of our investment portfolio continued to drive our overall investment results.
Now I will discuss our outlook for 2015. In 2015, we expect to continue to deliver strong financial performance for our shareholders by leveraging our differentiated capabilities to meet and exceed the expectations of our customers and clients by delivering affordable and personalized solutions, effectively deploying capital and targeting new and emerging opportunities where we will seek to drive additional value for our shareholders.
For full year 2015, we expect consolidated revenues to grow in a range of 8% to 10% over 2014, with continued growth across our targeted market segments. We expect full year 2015 consolidated adjusted income from operations to be in the range of $2.1 billion to $2.2 billion or $8 to $8.40 per share. As Will noted earlier, our full year 2015 consolidated and business segment adjusted income from operations, as well as earnings per share estimates, now exclude acquisition-related amortization expense.
In 2015, the impact of excluding acquisition-related amortization expense is approximately $0.40 per share or $100 million after tax, including $85 million in our Global Health Care business and $15 million in Global Supplemental Benefits. Lastly, consistent with prior practice, our outlook excludes any contribution from additional capital deployment as well as any prior-year claim development, which in 2014 totaled $53 million after tax.
Putting our 2015 outlook and our 2014 actual results on a comparable basis, that is adjusting for the reserve development reported in our 2014 results and adjusting to a consistent base with -- basis for reporting deal amortization, our outlook for operating earnings in 2015 reflects 3% to 8% growth over 2014, and our outlook for EPS growth is 5% to 10% before considering the impact of additional capital deployment.
I will now discuss the components of our 2015 outlook, starting with Global Health Care. We expect full year Global Health Care earnings in the range of approximately $1.73 billion to $1.79 billion. This outlook reflects continued benefits from organic revenue growth, specialty contributions, effective medical cost management and operating expense efficiencies. This also includes our updated view of the annual enrollment period results for both Medicare and the public exchange business.
I'll now summarize some of the key assumptions reflected in our Global Health Care earnings outlook for 2015, starting with our customer base. Regarding global medical customers, we expect 2015 customer growth of 1% to 3%. This growth is driven by expected ongoing growth in our Commercial employer business led by continued double-digit customer growth in our Select business, as well as mid- to upper single-digit growth in our Medicare Advantage customers, with some expected reduction in our non-ACA-compliant individual customers.
Turning to medical costs. Our 2015 outlook assumes some increase in medical utilization versus current levels, and this increase has been reflected in our pricing. For our total U.S. Commercial book of business, we expect full year medical cost trends to be in the range of 5% to 6%.
As Will noted earlier, we are changing the basis on which we provide guidance for MCRs to total Commercial and total Government. We believe this basis will provide better insight into our ability to effectively manage medical costs for our Commercial and Seniors customers. For our total Commercial book of business, we expect the 2015 medical care ratio to be in the range of 78% to 79%. This compares to our full year 2014 total Commercial MCR of 78.9% on an operating basis. For our total Government book of business, we expect the 2015 medical care ratio to be in the range of 84.5% to 85.5%. This compares to our full year 2014 total Government MCR of 84.7% on an operating basis.
Regarding operating expenses, our 2015 Global Health Care operating expense ratio is expected to be in the range of 20.5% to 21.5%. Overall, we expect full year 2015 Global Health Care earnings to be approximately $1.73 billion to $1.79 billion. We believe this is a competitively attractive result reflecting our focus on growing segments of the health care market and continued strong execution of our business strategy.
Now moving to the other components of our outlook.
For our Global Supplemental Benefits business, we continue to expect strong top line growth. We expect earnings in the range of $230 million to $250 million. This represents earnings growth of 3% to 12% after adjusting for $21 million of nonrecurring favorable tax items recognized in this segment in 2014. Regarding the Group Disability and Life business, we expect full year 2015 earnings in the range of $320 million to $340 million. Regarding our remaining operations, that is Other Operations and Corporate, we expect a loss of $180 million for 2015.
So all in, for full year 2015, we expect consolidated adjusted income from operations of $2.1 billion to $2.2 billion or $8.00 to $8.40 per share. Our outlook continues to exclude the impact of prior year claim development or any future capital deployment. While we do not anticipate the impact of future capital deployment in our EPS outlook, we do expect the additional free cash flow that we generate will be deployed for the benefit of shareholders either through value-creating acquisitions or share repurchase.
Overall, these results represent a competitively attractive outlook and underscore the benefit of our diverse and differentiated portfolio of businesses. I would also note that due to the timing of some strategic investments, as well as the growth of our Medicare Part D business, which traditionally reports low first quarter earnings, we expect our first quarter 2015 earnings will be lower than first quarter of 2014.
Now moving to our 2015 capital management position and outlook. Overall, we continue to have excellent financial flexibility. Our subsidiaries remain well capitalized and are generating significant free cash flow to the parent, with a strong return on capital in each of our business segments. Our capital deployment strategy and priorities have not changed. These priorities are: providing the capital necessary to support the growth of our ongoing operations; pursuing M&A activity with a focus on acquiring capabilities and scale to further grow in our targeted areas of focus; and after considering these first 2 items, we'll return capital to shareholders, primarily through share repurchase.
Regarding free cash flow. During 2014, we repurchased 18.5 million shares of stock for approximately $1.6 billion, and we ended the year with parent company cash of approximately $400 million. For full year 2015, we expect subsidiary dividends of approximately $1.7 billion, driven by strong performance in each of our business segments. After considering all sources and uses of parent company cash, including the funding of our recently announced acquisition of QualCare, this outlook implies we would have approximately $1.8 billion available for capital deployment in 2015, including approximately $115 million we deployed to repurchase 1.1 million shares from January 1 through February 4.
Our free cash flow outlook reflects the industry-leading margins and returns on capital in our businesses, and a high level of capital efficiency, particularly from our fee-based businesses. This capital efficiency allows us to fund attractive organic growth while continuing to generate significant free cash flow to be deployed for the benefit of shareholders.
Now to recap. Our full year 2014 consolidated results reflect the strength of our diversified portfolio of global businesses and a continued track record of effective execution of our focused strategy. The fundamentals of our business remain strong, as evidenced by strong growth in revenue and earnings, industry-leading medical costs and quality outcomes, and continued strong free cash flow. Based on the strength of these results, we are confident on our ability to achieve our full year 2015 earnings outlook.
And with that, we will turn it over to the operator for the Q&A portion of the call."

And as we've done in the past, we will continue to make ongoing investments in our company while seeking to generate an attractive and competitively differentiated outcomes for our business. Also very importantly, all the numbers I just referenced exclude the impact of the $1.8 billion of deployable capital we'll have for 2015. As it relates to tailwinds, you can think about several tailwinds for us: clearly, the revenue and customer base growth, number one; two, expense leverage -- we have a track record of continuing to generate efficiency gains and expense leverage, some of which we redeploy for the benefit of innovation. Third, ongoing specialty penetration. We have a good track record of driving further specialty penetration. And fourth, some improvement in the performance of our individual portfolio of businesses. As it relates to headwinds, you can think about a few: as we've discussed before, the impact of specialty pharma on the overall medical cost trend and specifically, for example, its impact on Seniors portfolio of business; two, as you know, another step-up in the industry tax -- a portion of it, our assumptions are, will not pass through fully in the Medicare arena. And thirdly, for us, given our global nature, some FX impact into 2015. But taken as a whole, we feel good about the 2015 impact that we're able to generate here with growth, earnings and EPS growth; capital positioning; and then finally, Justin, the positioning this gives us for 2016, as we would expect to have further earnings accelerants off of the positioning we've taken relative to our Seniors business in that portfolio.

Think of it, in order of magnitude, as we've talked about before, about 3% of the overall franchise revenue in terms of 2014. And we would expect it to be in the similar range in 2015, with some puts and takes in terms of the runoff of the grandfathered business and some growth on the on exchange business. So I think the headline here that's quite important is a small percentage of the overall portfolio that we've been seeking to manage in the context of the performance of the franchise.

So also reflecting, of course, increased seasonality in the fourth quarter. It's just basically been improving from our initial expectations in the year. It's still a little higher than where we'd like to be. That improvement has been driven basically by both a better assessment of the early part of the year claims as they developed a little favorably and a little bit of an improvement in the run rate and, as you kind of suggested, the 3Rs. So just a couple of minutes on the 3Rs. Our year-end accrual for 3Rs now totals about $200 million after tax. The majority of the accrual continues to be related to the reinsurance element of the 3R program, with risk adjusters representing the higher amount of the remaining balance and a smaller amount for risk corridor recoveries. And I'll give you some more specific color on our approach. We have accrued reinsurance at the 80% coinsurance level consistent with the design of the program. We have not accrued any risk adjuster impact for our Texas business due to the current lack of industry data. And we accrued amounts under the risk corridor because we're comfortable with the statutes and administrative guidelines that support that program. So as you know, there's some interplay among each of these program elements, but overall, we're very comfortable with our total accrual."

But I'm assuming there's an assumption of the public exchanges getting a little bit better. You've got the industry tax uptick, which assuming you priced for it, is actually a little bit of a tailwind as well, and the guidance is for, let's call it 40 basis points of improvement at the midpoint. So are there -- I'm just trying to think if there's any other moving parts? My guess is you've got a little bit of a benefit on the hep C and Specialty Pharmacy from the new Gilead relationship announced yesterday. So I'm just -- is there anything underlying?

So it's to be consultative and work with employers to design the right consumer engagement and benefit designs and network structures, and then offer multiple funding alternatives, one of which is, as you referenced, an ASO proposition that gives them much more transparency and tighter alignment. As you know, the overall employer landscape in the U.S. is not growing, shrinking up market, a little bit of growth down market. So there's little bit of growth.

And so that trend continues. So hence, the competitive environment, competitors are seeing more ASO activity as well. For Cigna, that's good for us because we're extremely well-positioned in that environment from benefit design, the consultative nature, and very importantly, the employer reporting and insights that go along with that monthly, quarterly and annually to provide the guidance in terms of what's transpiring.

We believe that's a result of the increasing competitive activity, and we believe to be successful we'd have to continue to innovate. And that's what's transpiring in the marketplace. As it relates to standalone, if you'll -- stop loss players in the space, I don't see that as a primary competitive disruptor largely because of the impact of integration here. So if you step back, what makes these programs work is not a stop loss program. What makes these programs work is getting the benefit alignment laid out with the right incentives, the network configuration appropriate, the clinical programs aligned. For example, we have the ability, and we do, do on-site biometric screening, on-site coaching for a 100 lives employer. That's a new model, to be  able to do that and bring that on board for a client and identify the 1, 2 or 3 high-risk individuals who are not incurring costs today, but we need to engage clinically with. And integrating all of that with the ASO funding mechanism, stop loss when it makes sense for that employer, as well as the reporting, that's the core of our value proposition and we continue to see strong demand for that today and into the future. And we would expect, again, competitors to step into this space because there's a significant amount of demand. Key to us is the results we're delivering and ongoing innovation."

Again, our approach focuses on the integrated benefits of actually more effectively managing medical cost. And the standalone stop loss carriers, you typically don't have that feature. In addition, we do have some built-in advantages versus them. I mean, we already have this customer in our sights, so we have one set of acquisition costs that they have to pay -- incremental acquisition cost to secure this customer, and we have a lot better insight into the underlying claims data, so our ability to effectively approach the program is very superior. So we don't really find ourselves in what sometimes can be a hypercompetitive standalone stop loss market, not really a market we're computing in. We don't sell stop loss unless we write the underlying program. And when we're selling stop loss, it's part of an integrated package.

So I'd be surprised if there was a 1 point impact, but we'll do that math. Second, on stop loss, we actually would expect some modest increase in the stop loss loss ratio as we continue to sell disproportionately in the lower end. And those customers tend to have a more premium density, so less of an expense factor in the result and a higher MCR. Again, very attractive MCR, so it's not like it's worse profitability. The bottom line margin is still very attractive for the -- that stop loss business. But the dynamics in the MLR are a little higher. So I would expect that there's marginal impact probably from this change, but I'll do a little more careful look at that."

As I noted previously though, we've expected this marketplace more broadly to unfold slowly and it is. Our team has seen some success. And we have a dedicated team of resources that will continue to focus on this, but we have not banked on, nor are we banking on a significant step function in revenue, customer lives or earnings growth here. Rather, we've positioned ourselves to have smart optionality to the extent this market moves forward very positively."

I am Will McDowell, Vice President of Investor Relations. Joining me this morning are David Cordani, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tom McCarthy, Cigna's Chief Financial Officer. In our remarks today, David and Tom will cover a number of topics, including Cigna's full year 2014 financial results as well as our financial outlook for 2015.
As noted in our earnings release, when describing our financial results, Cigna uses certain financial measures which are not determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, otherwise known as GAAP. Specifically, we use the term labeled ""adjusted income from operations"" and ""earnings per share"" on this same basis as the principal measures of performance for Cigna and our business segments. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is contained in today's earnings release, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of cigna.com.
In our remarks today, we will be making some forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our outlook for 2015 and future performance. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. A description of these risks and uncertainties is contained in the cautionary note to today's earnings release and in our most recent reports filed with the SEC.
Before turning the call over to David, I will cover a few items pertaining to our financial results and disclosures. First, please note that when we discuss the number of covered lives for our global medical customers, we will be doing so on a basis that excludes those individuals that were previously covered under Limited Benefits plans. As a reminder, we exited the Limited Benefits business as of December 31, 2013, as required by the Affordable Care Act regulation.
Second, please note that our definition of adjusted income from operations will change for 2015 reporting in that we will now exclude acquisition-related amortization expense from this operating measure. When we discuss our earnings outlook for 2015 today, it will be on a basis of adjusted income from operations that excludes acquisition-related amortization expense. This is a change compared to the basis on which 2014 results are reported and how we have previously provided our 2014 outlook. In 2015, the impact of excluding acquisition-related amortization expense is approximately $100 million after tax or $0.40 per share.
Third, beginning in 2015, we have simplified our guidance and disclosures for our medical care ratios or MCRs by reporting them on a basis of total Commercial and total Government. The total Commercial ratio encompasses all of our commercial risk products, including medical, pharmacy, dental, stop loss and behavioral products, provided through guaranteed cost or experience-rated funding arrangements in both the United States and internationally. The total Government ratio includes our Medicare Advantage, Medicare Part D and Medicaid businesses. To ease the transition, we have provided historical medical care ratios on these bases within our quarterly financial supplement that was posted in the Investor Relations section of cigna.com this morning.
Lastly, consistent with past practices, when we make any prospective comments on earnings or EPS outlook, we will do so on a basis that excludes the impact of any future capital deployment or prior year development of medical costs. Our outlook also excludes the impact from our recently announced acquisition of QualCare, which we do not expect will have a material impact to our financial results in 2015.
And with that, I will turn the call over to David."

To begin, I'll review highlights of our full year 2014 financial results and our 2015 outlook. I will then discuss how we will continue to create value for our customers, clients and shareholders in the future. I will also illustrate more specifically how we are creating value in our Seniors business and leveraging our experience and success of that business to drive long-term growth. Then Tom will address our fourth quarter and full year 2014 financial performance in more detail as well as provide the specifics for our outlook for 2015 before we take your questions. And following the Q&A session, I'll wrap up the call with a few closing remarks.
We'll start with some highlights from the year.
Cigna's strong 2014 performance represents the fifth consecutive year of competitively attractive financial results. This outstanding track record of results is driven by the disciplined execution of our growth strategy, all while we continue to invest in new capabilities, expand our offerings and our geographic footprint. Over the past several years, in the face of a particularly challenging and dynamic environment, we have been focused and disciplined with targeted yet meaningful investments to drive innovation, including new clinical programs, aligned incentives for customers, expanded technologies and programs for health care professionals. We have done all this while delivering competitively differentiated results year in and year out.
The full year 2014 consolidated revenues increased 8% to $35 billion, with each business segment delivering strong growth over 2013. We reported adjusted income from operations for the full year of $2 billion or $7.43 per share, which represents a per share increase of 9% over 2013.
Our revenue and earnings performance reflect growth in all of our businesses over the course of the year, a year in which we also grew to more than 85 million customer relationships worldwide and where we continue to generate strong margins and significant free cash flow for the benefit of shareholders. These results position us to once again deliver competitively attractive revenue and earnings growth in 2015.
For 2015, our outlook of 8% to 10% revenue growth and 5% to 10% EPS growth, excluding reserve development recognized in 2014 as well as future capital deployment, reflects the focus and clarity of our strategy and continued strong performance of our team around the world. Tom will walk you through more specifics regarding our outlook later on the call.
Now I'd like to talk about how our guiding framework, global strategy and multiple avenues for growth have enabled our long track record of success and will drive ongoing future value creation.
Across our business, we operate in an ever-changing market landscape with diverse needs across customers, employers, health care professionals and governments. Moving [ph] in this market, we are meeting and exceeding the expectations of our customers and clients around the world by delivering affordable and personalized solutions. As we look to the future, we have built a growth framework to create ongoing value, leverage our differentiated capabilities for the benefit of our customers.
There are 3 components to this framework. First is leveraging our well-positioned existing portfolio of businesses to continue to generate attractive value for our customers and clients. We expect to double the size of our company over the next 7 to 8 years. This will result in an average annual revenue growth rate of 8% to 10%, largely driven by our existing portfolio and focused execution. This continues a track record that we have demonstrated over the last 5 years, and our 2015 outlook of 8% to 10% revenue growth is consistent with this goal.
The second component is targeted and effective capital deployment to create ongoing shareholder value. I would note that, over the past 5 years, we have effectively deployed capital through a balance of investments in our business portfolio, strategic M&A and share repurchase. A good recent example of this is our agreement to purchase QualCare Alliance Networks. This acquisition is directly aligned with our Go Deep and our physician partnership strategies.
Our businesses are generating high margins and are capital efficient, allowing us to both fund attractive organic growth and generate significant free cash flow. This free cash flow provides us with financial flexibility and the opportunity to deploy capital to create additional value for our shareholders. And given the health of our balance sheet and underlying capitalization level of our subsidiaries, we expect to have $1.8 billion of capital available for deployment in 2015.
The third component of our framework where we seek to drive additional value for our shareholders is through new and emerging opportunities. These opportunities include new distribution marketplaces such as public and private exchanges, geographic expansion such as new Medicare Advantage markets and international opportunities, and new buying [ph] segments and service expansion such as medical service organization offerings for the benefit of integrated health care professionals. We are well positioned to pursue each of these potentially attractive future growth opportunities that are aligned with our strategy. As such, we have dedicated resources to fuel future expansion in these areas.
To illustrate how we are leveraging this framework to create value, I'll highlight how this framework applies to our Seniors business. This market segment includes a population with a variety of complex needs, requiring customer engagement and incentive-based clinical resources and programs to drive ongoing success. Our Seniors business pioneered successful physician engagement models, including aligned incentives and collaborative relationships to drive high-quality and a more affordable health care experience for both customers as well as physicians. As we continue to leverage our core physician engagement capabilities across all of our health services businesses, we are focused on key investments that improve affordability, enhance personalized services and drive better clinical outcomes. For example, the strategic investments we're making to enhance our physician insight and data tools will enable our clinical data to be accessible in a real-time fashion for more of our physician partners as well as our service teams. Enabled by our physician engagement model, seniors continue to find our Cigna HealthSpring benefit offerings increasingly compelling. And we expect to have 6% to 8% Medicare Advantage customer growth in 2015.
As for positioning, we continue to be amongst the top 3 players in market share for all of our established markets, and we are posting attractive growth in our newer markets. In 2014, we expanded our Seniors business into Georgia and the Carolinas, where we successfully leveraged existing Cigna commercial networks to develop and implement engaged physician relationships for seniors. Importantly, the quality of care delivered through our engaged physician groups is reflected in our stars ratings, where we increased our membership in 4-star or higher plans from approximately 40% to nearly 60% in 2016. Looking to 2017, we again expect to deliver an increase in this result. These improvements in star ratings have allowed us to enhance our benefit offerings and position our Seniors business to be an earnings accelerant in 2016 and beyond.
Relative to our expanding opportunities, we currently operate Medicaid into eligible plans in Texas and in the Illinois markets. Here, we are leveraging our care coordination capabilities to serve the dual-eligible population within our Medicaid platform. Focusing our growth efforts on improving care for the underserved, including the dual-eligible and aged, blind and disabled populations, complements our proven experience with complex care coordinations, differentiated clinical outcomes and affordability focus. While our Illinois plan is relatively new, having just begun in 2014, our Texas plan has been in operation since 2011 and has a track record of delivering affordable care and better health outcomes. In a testament of our commitment to servicing these customers, our Texas plan recently was acknowledged by the Medicaid Health Plans of America for our cutting-edge, intensive behavioral health programs.
We are well-positioned and have the capital flexibility to pursue these accelerating geographic and market segment expansion opportunities, either organically or through M&A, as Seniors remains a strategic growth priority for us. As a global company, our efforts to leverage these capabilities have also expanded across key markets beyond the United States. In Korea, for example, where the aged population is seeking new solutions to meet their emerging needs, we've developed an innovative and new health membership program targeting seniors known as Heyday. This organically built affinity program delivers value-added services directly to seniors in Korea. And while only a year into this expansion, we now serve more than 300,000 Korean seniors. So overall, we have a clear strategy and the capabilities to deliver value and improve the health and well-being of senior customers today and into the future.
Whether in our Seniors business as we discussed today or other growth businesses we have addressed in previous calls, we will continue to deliver attractive growth, produce and deploy capital effectively, and invest and position ourselves to win in new and emerging markets and segments.
Now to summarize my comments before Tom offers more detail on our 2014 results and expectations for 2015.
Cigna's strong 2014 financial performance extends a multiyear track record of delivering competitively attractive revenue, earnings and free cash flow. Continued execution of our growth strategy is creating value for our customers and clients, complemented by our differentiated capabilities and innovative physician and customer engagement solutions. As a rapidly changing industry and economic environment continues to unfold and new challenges arise, we are positioned to capitalize on new growth opportunities while we continue to leverage our core businesses for growth. And by embracing change, we continue to position our company for successful investing in the future, preparing for significant new opportunities such as those we shared this morning for our Seniors segment, including: in existing programs and markets, new market expansion, new offerings for health care professionals through our medical service organization solutions, new segments such as dual eligibles and new affinity programs such as HeyDay in Korea.
We expect to meet our growth objectives of 8% to 10% on average, doubling the size of our company again over the next 7 to 8 years. And based on our focused strategy, strong market positioning and ability to leverage capital, as well as further opportunities we have for growth, we expect to continue to deliver competitively attractive and sustained long-term EPS growth of 10% to 13% on average, all while continuing to invest back in our company.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Tom."
172899,253311656,756306,"Cigna Corp., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 05, 2015",2015-02-05,"Earnings Calls","The Cigna Group","Executives","Thanks, David. Good morning, everyone.In my remarks today, I will review Cigna's 2014 results and provide our outlook for 2015.We had another strong year in 2014, with revenue growth of 8% and industry-leading earnings per share growth of 9% over 2013",2099,"Thanks, David. Good morning, everyone.
In my remarks today, I will review Cigna's 2014 results and provide our outlook for 2015.
We had another strong year in 2014, with revenue growth of 8% and industry-leading earnings per share growth of 9% over 2013 results. 2014 represents our fifth consecutive year of consistently strong revenue, earnings and EPS growth -- an attractive result both on an absolute and competitive basis. In addition, we continued to generate strong free cash flow in 2014, which resulted in approximately $1.6 billion being returned to shareholders through share repurchase. The strength of our 2014 performance provides us with a solid foundation for growth in 2015.
Now moving to operating results.
Our full year consolidated revenues grew 8% to $35 billion, driven by growth in each of our business segments and in our targeted markets. Earnings grew 3% to $2 billion, and earnings per share grew 9% to $7.43 in 2014. Our ability to grow revenue, earnings and EPS in a challenging operating environment reflects the strength of our underlying businesses and focused execution.
Regarding the segments, I will first comment on our Global Health Care segment. Overall, Global Health Care delivered another good year. 2014 premiums and fees grew 7% to $24.5 billion, reflecting growth in all of our Global Health Care businesses, including ongoing growth in our self-funded programs and specialty products. We ended 2014 with 14.5 million global medical customers, growing by approximately 380,000 customers or 3% for the year.
Full year earnings were $1.65 billion, reflecting business growth, specialty contributions, operating expense efficiency and effective medical cost management.
Turning to medical costs. We continue to deliver medical costs that reflect better health outcomes and strong clinical excellence for our customers and clients as a result of our deep collaborative relationships with physicians and our focus on personalization of care. For our total U.S. commercial book of business, full year medical cost trend was slightly less than the low end of our previous range of 4.5% to 5.5% for 2014. Our commercial medical trend result continues our multiyear track record of industry-leading performance. And given that over 85% of our U.S. Commercial customers are in transfer and ASO funding arrangements, our clients directly benefit from these favorable medical costs.
Regarding medical care ratios. In our U.S. Commercial guaranteed cost business, our full year 2014 medical care ratio or MCR was 81.8% on a reported basis or 82.7% excluding prior year reserve development. Consistent with our expectations, our fourth quarter 2014 guaranteed cost MCR of 86.6% reflects an increased seasonal impact from the growing share of high-deductible plans in our employer group and individual businesses. We also expected and saw this increased seasonal impact across most of our Commercial business, including our stop loss and experience-rated businesses.
Overall, our employer risk businesses continued to deliver solid results in the quarter and throughout the year, reflecting strong pricing, disciplined underwriting and continued effective medical management and physician engagement. Results in our individual business, while still below long-term expectations, continued to improve in the fourth quarter.
In our Government business, our full year 2014 MCR for Medicare Advantage was 83.5% on a reported basis or 84% excluding prior year reserve development, reflecting the impact of medical cost improvement initiatives implemented during 2014.
Moving to operating expenses for 2014. Our total Global Health Care operating expense ratio was 22%. This includes the impact of health reform-related taxes, which added 110 basis points to the expense ratio for the year. Overall, we've had another strong year in our Global Health Care business.
Now I'll discuss the results of our Global Supplemental Benefits business, which continues to deliver attractive growth and profitability.
Premiums and fees grew 14% year-over-year in global supplemental. 2014 earnings in our Global Supplemental Benefits business were $230 million, reflecting attractive operating margins, continued strategic investments to drive future growth and nonrecurring favorable tax items of $21 million after tax recorded in the third quarter. Fourth quarter earnings of $33 million reflect claims seasonality, our funding of long-term strategic investments and the impact from the strengthening of the U.S. dollar.
For Group Disability and Life, full year results reflect premium and fee increase of 6% over 2013. 2014 earnings in our group business were $317 million and reflect favorable claim experience in our Life business and a lower operating expense ratio.
For our Corporate and Other Operations, results totaled to an after-tax loss of $197 million for full year 2014.
Overall, our 2014 results reflect revenue earnings growth from each of our business segments and a significant free cash flow as the result of the continued effective execution of our strategy.
Turning to our investment portfolio. For 2014, we reported net realized investment gains of $106 million after tax, coupled with a strong net investment income result. The high quality and diversification of our investment portfolio continued to drive our overall investment results.
Now I will discuss our outlook for 2015. In 2015, we expect to continue to deliver strong financial performance for our shareholders by leveraging our differentiated capabilities to meet and exceed the expectations of our customers and clients by delivering affordable and personalized solutions, effectively deploying capital and targeting new and emerging opportunities where we will seek to drive additional value for our shareholders.
For full year 2015, we expect consolidated revenues to grow in a range of 8% to 10% over 2014, with continued growth across our targeted market segments. We expect full year 2015 consolidated adjusted income from operations to be in the range of $2.1 billion to $2.2 billion or $8 to $8.40 per share. As Will noted earlier, our full year 2015 consolidated and business segment adjusted income from operations, as well as earnings per share estimates, now exclude acquisition-related amortization expense.
In 2015, the impact of excluding acquisition-related amortization expense is approximately $0.40 per share or $100 million after tax, including $85 million in our Global Health Care business and $15 million in Global Supplemental Benefits. Lastly, consistent with prior practice, our outlook excludes any contribution from additional capital deployment as well as any prior-year claim development, which in 2014 totaled $53 million after tax.
Putting our 2015 outlook and our 2014 actual results on a comparable basis, that is adjusting for the reserve development reported in our 2014 results and adjusting to a consistent base with -- basis for reporting deal amortization, our outlook for operating earnings in 2015 reflects 3% to 8% growth over 2014, and our outlook for EPS growth is 5% to 10% before considering the impact of additional capital deployment.
I will now discuss the components of our 2015 outlook, starting with Global Health Care. We expect full year Global Health Care earnings in the range of approximately $1.73 billion to $1.79 billion. This outlook reflects continued benefits from organic revenue growth, specialty contributions, effective medical cost management and operating expense efficiencies. This also includes our updated view of the annual enrollment period results for both Medicare and the public exchange business.
I'll now summarize some of the key assumptions reflected in our Global Health Care earnings outlook for 2015, starting with our customer base. Regarding global medical customers, we expect 2015 customer growth of 1% to 3%. This growth is driven by expected ongoing growth in our Commercial employer business led by continued double-digit customer growth in our Select business, as well as mid- to upper single-digit growth in our Medicare Advantage customers, with some expected reduction in our non-ACA-compliant individual customers.
Turning to medical costs. Our 2015 outlook assumes some increase in medical utilization versus current levels, and this increase has been reflected in our pricing. For our total U.S. Commercial book of business, we expect full year medical cost trends to be in the range of 5% to 6%.
As Will noted earlier, we are changing the basis on which we provide guidance for MCRs to total Commercial and total Government. We believe this basis will provide better insight into our ability to effectively manage medical costs for our Commercial and Seniors customers. For our total Commercial book of business, we expect the 2015 medical care ratio to be in the range of 78% to 79%. This compares to our full year 2014 total Commercial MCR of 78.9% on an operating basis. For our total Government book of business, we expect the 2015 medical care ratio to be in the range of 84.5% to 85.5%. This compares to our full year 2014 total Government MCR of 84.7% on an operating basis.
Regarding operating expenses, our 2015 Global Health Care operating expense ratio is expected to be in the range of 20.5% to 21.5%. Overall, we expect full year 2015 Global Health Care earnings to be approximately $1.73 billion to $1.79 billion. We believe this is a competitively attractive result reflecting our focus on growing segments of the health care market and continued strong execution of our business strategy.
Now moving to the other components of our outlook.
For our Global Supplemental Benefits business, we continue to expect strong top line growth. We expect earnings in the range of $230 million to $250 million. This represents earnings growth of 3% to 12% after adjusting for $21 million of nonrecurring favorable tax items recognized in this segment in 2014. Regarding the Group Disability and Life business, we expect full year 2015 earnings in the range of $320 million to $340 million. Regarding our remaining operations, that is Other Operations and Corporate, we expect a loss of $180 million for 2015.
So all in, for full year 2015, we expect consolidated adjusted income from operations of $2.1 billion to $2.2 billion or $8.00 to $8.40 per share. Our outlook continues to exclude the impact of prior year claim development or any future capital deployment. While we do not anticipate the impact of future capital deployment in our EPS outlook, we do expect the additional free cash flow that we generate will be deployed for the benefit of shareholders either through value-creating acquisitions or share repurchase.
Overall, these results represent a competitively attractive outlook and underscore the benefit of our diverse and differentiated portfolio of businesses. I would also note that due to the timing of some strategic investments, as well as the growth of our Medicare Part D business, which traditionally reports low first quarter earnings, we expect our first quarter 2015 earnings will be lower than first quarter of 2014.
Now moving to our 2015 capital management position and outlook. Overall, we continue to have excellent financial flexibility. Our subsidiaries remain well capitalized and are generating significant free cash flow to the parent, with a strong return on capital in each of our business segments. Our capital deployment strategy and priorities have not changed. These priorities are: providing the capital necessary to support the growth of our ongoing operations; pursuing M&A activity with a focus on acquiring capabilities and scale to further grow in our targeted areas of focus; and after considering these first 2 items, we'll return capital to shareholders, primarily through share repurchase.
Regarding free cash flow. During 2014, we repurchased 18.5 million shares of stock for approximately $1.6 billion, and we ended the year with parent company cash of approximately $400 million. For full year 2015, we expect subsidiary dividends of approximately $1.7 billion, driven by strong performance in each of our business segments. After considering all sources and uses of parent company cash, including the funding of our recently announced acquisition of QualCare, this outlook implies we would have approximately $1.8 billion available for capital deployment in 2015, including approximately $115 million we deployed to repurchase 1.1 million shares from January 1 through February 4.
Our free cash flow outlook reflects the industry-leading margins and returns on capital in our businesses, and a high level of capital efficiency, particularly from our fee-based businesses. This capital efficiency allows us to fund attractive organic growth while continuing to generate significant free cash flow to be deployed for the benefit of shareholders.
Now to recap. Our full year 2014 consolidated results reflect the strength of our diversified portfolio of global businesses and a continued track record of effective execution of our focused strategy. The fundamentals of our business remain strong, as evidenced by strong growth in revenue and earnings, industry-leading medical costs and quality outcomes, and continued strong free cash flow. Based on the strength of these results, we are confident on our ability to achieve our full year 2015 earnings outlook.
And with that, we will turn it over to the operator for the Q&A portion of the call."

We're pleased with the 8% to 10% revenue outlook and continued growth of our well-positioned businesses; as Tom noted, the 3% to 8% earnings growth on a same-store basis; and the underlying 5% to 10% EPS growth on a same-store basis. And as we've done in the past, we will continue to make ongoing investments in our company while seeking to generate an attractive and competitively differentiated outcomes for our business. Also very importantly, all the numbers I just referenced exclude the impact of the $1.8 billion of deployable capital we'll have for 2015. As it relates to tailwinds, you can think about several tailwinds for us: clearly, the revenue and customer base growth, number one; two, expense leverage -- we have a track record of continuing to generate efficiency gains and expense leverage, some of which we redeploy for the benefit of innovation. Third, ongoing specialty penetration. We have a good track record of driving further specialty penetration. And fourth, some improvement in the performance of our individual portfolio of businesses. As it relates to headwinds, you can think about a few: as we've discussed before, the impact of specialty pharma on the overall medical cost trend and specifically, for example, its impact on Seniors portfolio of business; two, as you know, another step-up in the industry tax -- a portion of it, our assumptions are, will not pass through fully in the Medicare arena. And thirdly, for us, given our global nature, some FX impact into 2015. But taken as a whole, we feel good about the 2015 impact that we're able to generate here with growth, earnings and EPS growth; capital positioning; and then finally, Justin, the positioning this gives us for 2016, as we would expect to have further earnings accelerants off of the positioning we've taken relative to our Seniors business in that portfolio. So taken as a whole, we're pleased with the outlook for '15."

So also reflecting, of course, increased seasonality in the fourth quarter. It's just basically been improving from our initial expectations in the year. It's still a little higher than where we'd like to be. That improvement has been driven basically by both a better assessment of the early part of the year claims as they developed a little favorably and a little bit of an improvement in the run rate and, as you kind of suggested, the 3Rs. So just a couple of minutes on the 3Rs. Our year-end accrual for 3Rs now totals about $200 million after tax. The majority of the accrual continues to be related to the reinsurance element of the 3R program, with risk adjusters representing the higher amount of the remaining balance and a smaller amount for risk corridor recoveries. And I'll give you some more specific color on our approach. We have accrued reinsurance at the 80% coinsurance level consistent with the design of the program. We have not accrued any risk adjuster impact for our Texas business due to the current lack of industry data. And we accrued amounts under the risk corridor because we're comfortable with the statutes and administrative guidelines that support that program. So as you know, there's some interplay among each of these program elements, but overall, we're very comfortable with our total accrual."

As you know, the overall employer landscape in the U.S. is not growing, shrinking up market, a little bit of growth down market. So there's little bit of growth.

So we will see both revenue contribution going into 2016, as well as margin expansion contribution in 2016, therefore, an earnings accelerant."

We're pleased with the outcome from the CRomnibus, legislatively rectifying that for the benefit of global employers. And I would suggest to you the biggest impact here is taking away the administrative complexity that applying the ACA to the global employers expatriate benefit business would create, that was putting a burden on that business portfolio that we were managing through; that's the biggest benefit.

So if you step back, what makes these programs work is not a stop loss program. What makes these programs work is getting the benefit alignment laid out with the right incentives, the network configuration appropriate, the clinical programs aligned. For example, we have the ability, and we do, do on-site biometric screening, on-site coaching for a 100 lives employer. That's a new model, to be  able to do that and bring that on board for a client and identify the 1, 2 or 3 high-risk individuals who are not incurring costs today, but we need to engage clinically with. And integrating all of that with the ASO funding mechanism, stop loss when it makes sense for that employer, as well as the reporting, that's the core of our value proposition and we continue to see strong demand for that today and into the future.

In addition, we do have some built-in advantages versus them. I mean, we already have this customer in our sights, so we have one set of acquisition costs that they have to pay -- incremental acquisition cost to secure this customer, and we have a lot better insight into the underlying claims data, so our ability to effectively approach the program is very superior. So we don't really find ourselves in what sometimes can be a hypercompetitive standalone stop loss market, not really a market we're computing in. We don't sell stop loss unless we write the underlying program. And when we're selling stop loss, it's part of an integrated package.

Second, on stop loss, we actually would expect some modest increase in the stop loss loss ratio as we continue to sell disproportionately in the lower end. And those customers tend to have a more premium density, so less of an expense factor in the result and a higher MCR. Again, very attractive MCR, so it's not like it's worse profitability.

In our remarks, today David and Tom will cover a number of topics including Cigna's first quarter 2015 financial results as well as an update on our financial outlook for 2015. As noted in our earnings release, when describing our financial results, Cigna uses certain financial measures which are not determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States otherwise known as GAAP. Specifically, we use the term labeled adjusted income from operations and earnings per share on the same basis as our principal measures of financial performance. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is contained in today's earnings release, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of cigna.com. 
In our remarks today, we will be making some of forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our outlook for 2015 and future performance. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. A description of these risks and uncertainties is contained in the cautionary note to today's earnings release and in our most recent reports filed with the SEC. 
Before turning the call over to David, I will cover a few items pertaining to our financial result and disclosures. As a reminder, beginning in 2015, we have simplified our guidance and disclosures for our medical care ratios or MCRs by reporting them on a basis of total commercial and total government. The total commercial ratio encompasses all of our commercial risk products, including medical, pharmacy, dental, stop loss and behavioral products provided through guaranteed cost or experienced rated funding arrangements in both the United States and internationally. The total government ratio includes our Medicare Advantage, Medicare Part D and Medicaid businesses. 
Finally, consistent with past practices, when we make any prospective comments on earnings or EPS outlook, we will do so on a basis that excludes the impact of any future capital deployment or additional prior year development of medical costs. And with that, I will turn the call over to David."

To begin, I'd like to read the highlights of our financial results for the first quarter. Next, I'll discuss how we are leveraging Cigna's integrated capabilities to engage individuals to help them optimize their health and well-being and how this is translating into value for customers and clients. Then Tom will provide more detail around our first quarter financial performance and update our full year 2015 outlook. And following your questions, I'll leave you with a few closing remarks. 
Let's dive in with some highlights for the quarter. Cigna's first quarter 2015 performance represents a strong start to the year. We are pleased with our results which extends our track record of attractive financial performance. Once again, our success was driven by the effective and disciplined execution of our strategy, which continuously guide our actions in a dynamic marketplace. Our first quarter 2015 consolidated revenue increased 11% to $9.5 billion, with strong contributions across our business segments. We reported adjusted income from operations for the first quarter of $513 million or $1.96 per share. Our Global Health Care revenues increased 12% driven by strong performance in our Commercial and Government businesses. Our Global Supplemental Benefits business once again drove strong revenue growth in high single-digit after-tax margins while we continue to make targeted investments in support of future growth, and we achieved 6% revenue growth in our Group Disability and Life business. Overall, our diversified portfolio of businesses continues to produce significant free cash flow that further enables our financial flexibility with more than $500 million deployed for share repurchase on a year-to-date basis. Our continued focus and effective strategic execution are generating strong results enabling ongoing investments in our business portfolio and helping us meet the unique local market needs to the right balance of affordability and personalization of our products and services. 
As we've discussed previously, we have a clear framework to drive ongoing future value creation for Cigna. First, our diversified businesses are well positioned to create attractive value for our customers and clients and, as a result, differentiated revenue growth. Second, we are focused on targeted and effective capital deployment to create ongoing shareholder value through investments in our business, strategic M&A and share repurchase. Our businesses generate high levels of free cash flow, which give us financial flexibility and the opportunity to deploy capital to further create value for the benefit of shareholders. And finally, we continue to seek new and emerging opportunities to expand in new distribution marketplaces, new geographies and new buying segments. Guided by this framework and coupled with effective execution, we continue to expect to deliver average annual revenue growth rate of 8% to 10% over the long term. This framework also positions us to support our focus on enabling health care over financing sick care, which is well aligned with Cigna's efforts to improve the current health care system. 
The United States spends $3 trillion a year in health care. Studies consistently show approximately 25% of the total expenditures are wasted through inefficiency or breakage. At the same time, 50% of all adults have at least one chronic disease, conditions which translate to 7 out of the top 10 causes of death in the U.S. In this dynamic environment, Cigna continues to convene key stakeholders to work toward a sustainable health care system. Health care stakeholders from individuals to corporate employers and government organizations are seeking a common set of core goals. These include maintaining or improving health and productivity, affordable and predictable cost outcomes and greater personalization of solutions and services. To meet these goals, we must continue to accelerate the transition from yesterday's health insurance as a mechanism for financing the cost of illness to an orientation center around maintaining and improving the health and wellness of individuals. At Cigna, we are and we'll continue to make significant strides toward achieving a more sustainable health care system by engaging with individuals and physicians through coordinated offerings and alliance incentives. We have moved beyond the typical multi-product sales and services approach to engaging individuals and coordinate care at a very personal level as we work to improve health and wellness, all by harnessing information, incenting and support individuals and partnering with physicians, the result of which is a service experience for customers that achieves the right balance of personalization and affordability. 
I'd like to share with you a few examples of how we are leveraging the power of integration and coordination with our broad solution suite by encouraging maintenance and prevention among the healthy, providing coaching to the healthy at risk, enabling coordinated care for those with chronic conditions and facilitating access to centers of excellence for those with acute conditions. Our health care professionals engage with customers and clinicians to improve health every day, leveraging the breadth of our clinical capabilities, which spans over 4,000 professionals from doctors and nurses to behavioral professionals, health coaches and pharmacists. 
Relative to our behavioral professionals, our capabilities include engaging with a cardiology team when a health event transpires as we have seen a strong correlation between these types of illness and depression; engaging with our experts and disability programs to improve health and maximize personal productivity; and helping individuals recover from an injury by taking a more holistic view of mind and body. As a result, our customers are empowered by active coordinated care through coaching support services incentive programs. And the impact, Cigna clients with integrated offerings have 29% pure mental health and substance abuse related outpatient visits and 8% fewer inpatient events compared with those without integrated offerings. 
Another powerful example of our success with our coordinated approach is for customers who are expectant moms. In today's health care system, the cost of a premature birth is nearly 11x higher than that of a full-term birth, not to mention the impact on the family stress and, in some cases, lifelong health challenges. Cigna's healthy pregnancy healthy babies program engage with customers to optimize health during pregnancy by working with nurses who can assess risks, develop personalized care plans and continue to support outreach and coordination with OB/GYN teams and, finally, providing coaching on newborn care. Active participation by expected mothers in our integrated program is key. In fact, for those who enroll, there is nearly 50% reduction in premature births versus the U.S. average. This is a huge impact for the family, the child and society overall. 
The benefit of integrated and coordinated care is also impactful within Cigna Specialty Pharmacy programs, where our pharmacists and clinicians engage with customers and health care professionals to improve the effectiveness of drug regimes to drive better overall health outcomes. Our engaged customers have higher medication adherence and lower specialty drug costs, resulting in a 15% [ph] lower overall medical cost versus individuals who do not have these coordinated offerings. 
Our coordination also works with dental care customers, where there's a high correlation between periodontal health and improved health outcomes. In our dental programs, individuals with diabetes, heart disease or stroke who have both medical and dental coverage with Cigna has seen higher quality and lower medical costs. For example, patients with diabetes participating in our coordinated and dental programs saw lower average annual medical costs of approximately 28% when receiving coordinated care. And for patients with heart disease, costs were lowered by approximately 25%. 
As a final example across the U.S., our 4,000 plus clinical professionals continue to engage and help our customers and an increasing numbers through a rapidly growing collaborative care relationships. Today, we have more than 120 of these relationships spanning 29 states. As for impact, more than 90% of Cigna's collaborative care relationships with at least 2 years of experience are seeing success in managing improved medical costs and nearly 80% with at least 1 year of experience are seeing success in total medical cost results or clinical quality measures. Examples of medical results include an improvement in blood pressure, an improvement in BMI and an improvement in total cholesterol levels. These examples reinforce our successful efforts to improve health and quality-of-life while working to remove cost from the system. By leveraging our integrated capabilities and coordinating clinical care resources for each individual through their health journey, we are improving affordability while creating a more sustainable health care system. Over the long term, we believe our approach to health care rather than sick care will promote better health, sustainability and economic vibrancy and lower the cost burden on customers as well as employers. 
And this success translates to shareholder value as we leverage our capabilities and meet customer needs with products and services that are enhanced through our highly aligned coordinated offerings. This value is evidenced by our industry-leading medical cost trend over the last several years, high customer retention levels and strong growth in our specialty and integrated services that achieve the personalization of services outcomes that I previously referenced. 
As demonstrated by our discussion this morning, our integration and coordination of care has moved beyond the simple multiproduct solution. Today, we are engaging individuals in a very personalized way, leveraging actionable information, partnering with health care professionals and utilizing care resources that both reduce cost and produce superior health outcomes. 
Now to summarize my remarks before turning it over to Tom. Cigna's strong start to 2015 continues our long-term track record of financial performance in delivering competitively attractive revenue and earnings and gives us confidence in our increased full year 2015 outlook. The strong free cash flow from a high return on capital and high-margin portfolio of businesses provide ongoing financial flexibility in capital management and deployment. We are effectively executing our strategy and creating value for our customers and clients by leveraging integrated capabilities that promote health care rather than sick care and driving improved personalization and affordability for the benefit of the individuals we serve. We remain committed to our long-term objective, which is to double the size of our business over the next 7 to 8 years, yielding an 8% to 10% annual revenue growth rate on average. And over this time horizon, we expect to continue to deliver competitively attractive long-term EPS growth of 10% to 13% annually on average, all while we continue to invest in our company's business portfolio. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Tom."

In my remarks today, I will review Cigna's first quarter 2015 results and discuss our outlook for the full year. We've had a good start of the year with strong revenue and earnings contributions across our diversified portfolio of businesses, driven by continued effective execution of our strategy. 
Key highlights in the quarter include consolidated revenue growth of 11% to $9.5 billion; consolidated earnings of $513 million; quarterly earnings per share of $1.96; and continued strong free cash flow with approximately $515 [ph] million return to shareholders through share repurchase on a year-to-date basis. Overall, the strength of our first quarter performance provides us with solid momentum for the year. 
Regarding the segments, I will first comment on our Global Health Care segment. Global Health Care results were solid in the quarter. First quarter premiums and fees grew 12% to $6.7 billion, driven by customer growth in our Commercial and Government businesses as well as specialty contributions and rates actions. We ended first quarter of 2015 with 14.7 million global medical customers, including approximately 200,000 new customers from our QualCare Alliance Networks acquisition. First quarter earnings were $444 million, reflecting medical and specialty business growth, continued effective medical cost management, improving results in our individual business with some offset from increased spending for strategic investments as well as higher seasonal costs in our growing Medicare Part D business. 
Turning to medical costs. We continued to deliver medical cost that reflect better health outcomes and strong clinical excellence for our customers and clients as a result of our deep collaborative relationships with physicians and our focus on personalization of care. Our commercial medical trend results continues to be among the lowest in the industry. And given that over 85% of our U.S. Commercial customers are in transparent ASO funding arrangements, our clients directly benefit from these favorable medical costs. 
Regarding medical care ratios, our first quarter 2015 total commercial medical care ratio or MCR was 75.2% on a reported basis or 75.9% excluding prior year reserve development. Overall, we are pleased with the results of our commercial risk businesses in the quarter, reflecting strong pricing, disciplined underwriting and continued effective medical management and physician engagement. Results in our individual business continue to improve from the first quarter and are in-line with our expectations. 
In our government business, our first quarter 2015 total government MCR was 89.4% on a reported basis or 89.9% excluding prior year's reserve development, reflecting continued good performance in our Medicare Advantage business, partially offset by seasonal costs from our growing Medicare Part D business. Across our Commercial and Government risk book of business, our first quarter earnings included favorable prior year reserve development of $25 million after-tax compared to the $30 million after-tax in the first quarter 2014. 
Moving to operating expenses, for first quarter 2015, our total Global Health Care operating expense ratio was 21.7%, which reflects an expected increase in spending for strategic investments. Overall, we've had a strong start to 2015 in our Global Health Care business. 
Now I will discuss the results of our Global Supplemental Benefits business, which continues to deliver attractive growth and profitability. Premiums and fees grew 8% quarter-over-quarter in global supplemental or 12% on a currency-adjusted basis. First quarter earnings grew 21% or 25% on a currency-adjusted basis to $69 million, reflecting business growth and strong operating expense management as well as some favorable operating expense timing. 
For Group Disability and Life, first quarter premium and fees increased 7% over first quarter 2014, reflecting growth across the Disability Life and Accident product lines. First quarter earnings in our group business were $51 million, which include unfavorable claims experienced in our life insurance business as well as an expected increase in operating expenses. 
For our Corporate and Other operations, results totaled to an after-tax loss of $51 million in the first quarter of 2015. Overall, as a result of the continued effective execution of our strategy, our first quarter results reflect strong revenue and earnings contributions from our ongoing businesses and significant free cash flow. 
Turning to our investment portfolio. In the first quarter, we recognized net realized investment gains of $48 million after-tax, coupled with the strong investment income result. The high quality and diversification of our investment portfolio continue to drive our overall segment results. 
Now I will discuss our outlook for 2015. In 2015, we expect to continue to deliver strong financial performance for our shareholders by leveraging our differentiated capabilities to deliver affordable and personalized solutions, effectively deploying capital and targeting new and emerging opportunities where we will seek to drive additional value for shareholders. We continue to expect consolidated revenues to grow in the range of 8% to 10% over 2014. 
Our outlook for full year 2015 consolidated adjusted income from operations is now in the range of approximately $2.12 billion to $2.21 billion or $8.15 to $8.50 per share. This represents an increase of $0.10 to $0.15 per share over our previous expectations. 
I will now discuss the components of our 2015 outlook starting with Global Health Care. We now expect full year Global Health Care earnings in the range of approximately $1.75 billion  to $1.8 billion, an increase over our prior expectations. 
I'll now summarize some of the key assumptions reflected in our Global Health Care earnings outlook for 2015 starting with our customer base. Regarding global medical customers, we now expect 2015 customer growth of 2% to 4%. This increase over previous expectations primarily reflects customers added through the acquisition of QualCare Alliance Networks, which was completed in the first quarter of 2015. 
Turning to medical costs. In our 2015 -- our 2015 outlook continues to assume some increase in medical utilization versus current levels which has been reflected in our pricing. For our total U.S. Commercial book of business, we continue to expect full year medical cost trend to be in the range of 5% to 6%. 
Now turning to our medical care ratio outlook. For our total commercial book of business, we continue to expect the 2015 medical care ratio to be in the range of 78% to 79%. For our total government book of business, we continue to expect the 2015 medical care ratio to be in the range of 84.5% to 85.5%. 
Regarding operating expenses, we continue to expect our 2015 Global Health Care operating expense ratio to be in the range of 21% to 22%. Overall, we expect full year 2015 Global Health Care earnings to be approximately $1.75 billion to $1.8 billion. 
The other components of our outlook are unchanged. For our Global Supplemental Benefits business, we continue to expect strong top line growth in earnings in the range of $230 million to $250 million. Regarding our Group Disability and Life business, we continue to expect full year 2015 earnings in the range of $320 million to $340 million. Regarding our remaining operations, that is other operations and corporate, we expect a loss of $180 million for 2015. So all-in, for full year 2015, we now expect consolidated adjusted income from operations of $2.12 billion to $2.21 billion or $8.15 to $8.50 per share. This represents an increase of $0.10 to $0.15 per share. I would remind you that our outlook continues to exclude the impact of additional prior year reserve development or earning future capital deployment. While we do not anticipate impact of future capital deployment in our EPS outlook, we continue to expect the additional free cash flow that we generate to be deployed for the benefit of of our shareholders either through value-creating acquisitions or share repurchase. 
Now moving to our 2015 capital management position and outlook. Overall, we continue to have excellent financial flexibility. Our subsidiaries remain well capitalized and are generating significant free cash flow with the parent with a strong return on capital in each of our business segments. Our capital deployment strategy and priorities have not changed. These priorities are providing the capital necessary to support the growth of our ongoing operations; pursuing M&A activity with a focus on acquiring capabilities and scale to further grow in our target area of focus; and after considering these first 2 items, we'd return capital to shareholders primarily through share repurchase. 
Regarding free cash flow, we ended the quarter with parent company cash of approximately $1.3 billion, which includes approximately $900 million of proceeds from our recent issuance of long-term debt. These proceeds were subsequently used to redeem existing debt in the second quarter of 2015. During the period February 5 through April 29, we repurchased 3.2 million shares of stock for approximately $400 million, bringing our year-to-date share repurchase to 4.3 million shares for approximately $515 million. After considering all sources and uses of parent company cash, we now expect to have approximately $1.3 billion available for capital deployment during the balance of the year. Our free cash flow outlook continues to reflect the industry-leading margins and returns on capital in our businesses and the high level of capital efficiency, particularly from our fee-based businesses. This capital efficiency allows us to fund attractive organic growth while continuing to generate significant free cash flow to be deployed for the benefit of shareholders. 
Now to recap. Our first quarter 2015 consolidated results reflect the strength of our diversified portfolio of global businesses and continued effective execution of our focused strategy. The fundamentals of our business remain strong as evidenced by our first quarter results, which reflected strong revenue and earnings contributions across our diversified portfolio of businesses, industry-leading medical cost trends and high clinical quality and continued strong free cash flow. Based on the strength of these results, we are confident in our ability to achieve our increased full year 2015 earnings outlook. And with that, we will turn it over to the operator for the Q&A portion of the call."

Our outlook for the government MCR in 2015 reflects strong results in our Medicare Advantage business and some expected pressure in Part D, as you mentioned. The quarter-over-quarter increase, specifically in the government MCR, is mainly due to Part D with continuing good Medicare Advantage results. As you pointed out, we reported significant growth in Part D customers in 2015. And as a result, we've had a more pronounced seasonal impact from Part D this quarter. These new customers have a period of time to transition from their previous formulary to our formulary. So as we expected, we saw from additional first quarter cost impact. And all-in, we continue to expect our government MCR to be in the range of 84.5% to 85% for the full year, which we're happy with. As far as the outlook or the utilization outlook, we really didn't see any significant change in MA utilization in the quarter."

We define that as employers with 250 to 5,000 employees as well as large single state employers.

It continues to grow both in the regional segment. That has always been a meaningful portion but not the totality of it, but importantly downmarket into the Select Segment as well. So point one is continued high and accelerating interest in transparent funding because it aligns incentives, it provides transparency and enables better functionality of the incentive alignment programs and the engagement programs we like. The second thing we see is continued elevation and engagement in we typically call them carve-in or specialty programs. We look at them more as a coordination of care programs. Many other examples I cited in our prepared remarks. So those will be the 2 predominant trends we continue to see: elevation in transparent funding and then continued movement in what you might call carve-in, we call them coordination of care programs that are delivering superior medical cost and quality outcomes that Tom made reference to a few moments ago."

First, the dialogue with employers has been active around private exchanges as it has been around consumer-directed engagement programs et cetera. I think the broader picture here is that employers of all sizes are looking for the higher value creation benefit strategies that are going to be sustainable for them. That's the broader dialogue. And private exchanges represent a tool that many employers are trying to explore. The determinant of that is part of the overall portfolio. What we've seen, and what the market has seen is a relatively modest adoption rate of that toolset, but it's early on, as we've indicated, in the private exchange cycle. Two, what we've seen is a continued elevated performance of self-funded consumer-directed aligned incentive and coordinated integrated offerings. As it relates to our own experience within the private exchanges, to the second part of your question, the vast majority of those employers are in the self-funded space given the profile of what we operate in but we have guaranteed cost lives there as well. We have integrated and nonintegrated lives, but again it's small in the grand scheme of things in terms of what we're seeing. And a portion of the lives we're seeing there are new to Cigna. Greater than 50% of those are transitioning from existing Cigna relationships carried over to the exchanges. But the important part is that it's still a small part about the marketplace as well as our portfolio. Two, we've deployed significant resources to make sure we're in position on the various exchanges, including your own captive and proprietary exchange. And three, we see to be very consultative with our employers to make sure they understand all the choices that are available to them."

In our remarks, today, David and Tom will cover a number of topics, including Cigna's first quarter 2015 financial results as well as an update on our financial outlook for 2015.
As noted in our earnings release, when describing our financial results, Cigna uses certain financial measures which are not determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, otherwise known as GAAP. Specifically, we use the term labeled ""adjusted income from operations"" and ""earnings per share"" on the same basis as our principal measures of financial performance. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is contained in today's earnings release, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of cigna.com.
In our remarks today, we will be making some forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our outlook for 2015 and future performance. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. A description of these risks and uncertainties is contained in the cautionary note to today's earnings release and in our most recent reports filed with the SEC.
Before turning the call over to David, I will cover a few items pertaining to our financial results and disclosures. As a reminder, beginning in 2015, we have simplified our guidance and disclosures for our Medical Care Ratios or MCRs by reporting them on a basis of total Commercial and total Government. The total Commercial ratio encompasses all of our commercial risk products, including medical, pharmacy, dental, stop loss and behavioral products, provided through guaranteed cost or experience-rated funding arrangements in both the United States and internationally. The total Government ratio includes our Medicare Advantage, Medicare Part D and Medicaid businesses.
Finally, consistent with past practices, when we make any prospective comments on earnings or EPS outlook, we will do so on a basis that excludes the impact of any future capital deployment or additional prior year development of medical costs.
And with that, I will turn the call over to David."

To begin, I'd like to read the highlights of our financial results for the first quarter. Next, I'll discuss how we are leveraging Cigna's integrated capabilities to engage individuals to help them optimize their health and well-being, and how this is translating into value for customers and clients.
Then Tom will provide more detail around our first quarter financial performance and update our full year 2015 outlook. And following your questions, I'll leave you with a few closing remarks.
Let's dive in with some highlights from the quarter. Cigna's first quarter 2015 performance represents a strong start to the year. We are pleased with our results, which extends our track record of attractive financial performance. Once again, our success was driven by the effective and disciplined execution of our strategy, which continuously guide our actions in a dynamic marketplace.
Our first quarter 2015 consolidated revenue increased 11% to $9.5 billion, with strong contributions across our business segments. We reported adjusted income from operations for the first quarter of $513 million or $1.96 per share. Our Global Health Care revenues increased 12%, driven by strong performance in our Commercial and Government businesses. Our Global Supplemental Benefits business, once again drove strong revenue growth in high single-digit after-tax margins, while we continue to make targeted investments in support of future growth, and we achieved 6% revenue growth in our Group Disability and Life business.
Overall, our diversified portfolio of businesses continues to produce significant free cash flow that further enables our financial flexibility with more than $500 million deployed for share repurchase on a year-to-date basis. Our continuous focus and effective strategic execution are generating strong results, enabling ongoing investments in our business portfolio and helping us meet the unique local market needs to the right balance of affordability and personalization of our products and services.
As we've discussed previously, we have a clear framework to drive ongoing future value creation for Cigna. First, our diversified businesses are well positioned to create attractive value for our customers and clients and, as a result, differentiated revenue growth. Second, we are focused on targeted and effective capital deployment to create ongoing shareholder value through investments in our business, strategic M&A and share repurchase. Our businesses generate high levels of free cash flow, which give us financial flexibility and the opportunity to deploy capital to further create value for the benefit of shareholders. And finally, we continue to seek new and emerging opportunities to expand in new distribution marketplaces, new geographies and new buying segments.
Guided by this framework and coupled with effective execution, we continue to expect to deliver average annual revenue growth rate of 8% to 10% over the long term. This framework also positions us to support our focus on enabling health care over financing sick care, which is well aligned with Cigna's efforts to improve the current health care system.
The United States spends $3 trillion a year on health care. Studies consistently show approximately 25% of the total expenditures are wasted through inefficiency or breakage. At the same time, 50% of all adults have at least one chronic disease, conditions which translate to 7 out of the top 10 causes of death in the U.S.
In this dynamic environment, Cigna continues to convene key stakeholders to work toward a sustainable health care system. Health care stakeholders from individuals to corporate employers and government organizations are seeking a common set of core goals. These include maintaining or improving health and productivity, affordable and predictable cost outcomes and greater personalization of solutions and services. To meet these goals, we must continue to accelerate the transition from yesterday's view health insurance as a mechanism for financing the cost of illness to an orientation center around maintaining and improving the health and wellness of individuals. At Cigna, we are and we'll continue to make significant strides toward achieving a more sustainable health care system, by engaging with individuals and physicians through coordinated offerings and alliance incentives.
We have moved beyond the typical multi-product sales and services approach to engaging individuals and coordinate care at a very personal level, as we work to improve health and wellness, all by harnessing information, incenting and supporting individuals and partnering with physicians, the result of which is a service experience for customers that achieves the right balance of personalization and affordability. 
I'd like to share with you a few examples of how we are leveraging the power of integration and coordination, with our broad solution suite, by encouraging maintenance and prevention among the healthy, providing coaching to the healthy at risk, enabling coordinated care for those with chronic conditions and facilitating access to centers of excellence for those with acute conditions.
Our health care professionals engage with customers and clinicians to improve health every day, leveraging the breadth of our clinical capabilities, which spans over 4,000 professionals from doctors and nurses to behavioral professionals, health coaches and pharmacists.
Relative to our behavioral professionals, our capabilities include engaging with a cardiology team when a health event transpires, as we have seen a strong correlation between these types of illness and depression; engaging with our experts in disability programs to improve health and maximize personal productivity; and helping individuals recover from an injury by taking a more holistic view of mind and body. As for result, our customers are empowered by active coordinated care through coaching, support services and incentive programs. And the impact, Cigna clients with integrated offerings have 29% pure mental health and substance abuse related outpatient visits and 8% fewer inpatient events compared with those without integrated offerings.
Another powerful example of our success, with our coordinated approach, is for customers who are expectant moms. In today's health care system, the cost of a premature birth is nearly 11x higher than that of a full-term birth, not to mention the impact on the family stress and, in some cases, lifelong health challenges. CIGNA's Healthy Pregnancies, Healthy Babies program engaged with customers to optimize health during pregnancy, by working with nurses who can assess risks; develop personalized care plans; and continue to support outreach and coordination with OB/GYN teams; and finally, providing coaching on newborn care. Active participation by expected mothers in our integrated program is key. In fact, for those who enroll, there is nearly 50% reduction in premature births versus the U.S. average. This is a huge impact for the family, the child and society overall.
The benefit of integrated and coordinated care is also impactful within Cigna's Specialty Pharmacy programs, where our pharmacists and clinicians engage with customers and health care professionals to improve the effectiveness of drug regimes to drive better overall health outcomes. Our engaged customers have higher medication adherence and lower specialty drug costs, resulting in a 15% lower overall medical cost versus individuals who do not have these coordinated offerings.
Our coordination also works with dental care customers, where there's a high correlation between periodontal health and improved health outcomes. In our dental programs, individuals with diabetes, heart disease or stroke, who have both medical and dental coverage with Cigna has seen higher health quality and lower medical costs. For example, patients with diabetes participating in our coordinated and dental programs saw lower average annual medical costs of approximately 28%, when receiving coordinated care. And for patients with heart disease, costs were lowered by approximately 25%.
As a final example across the U.S., our 4,000 plus clinical professionals continue to engage and help our customers and an increasing numbers through a rapidly growing collaborative care relationships. Today, we have more than 120 of these relationships spanning 29 states. As for impact, more than 90% of Cigna's collaborative care relationships with at least 2 years of experience are seeing success in managing improved medical costs and nearly 80% with at least 1-year of experience are seeing success in total medical cost results or clinical quality measures. Examples of medical results include an improvement in blood pressure, an improvement in BMI and an improvement in total cholesterol levels. These examples reinforce our successful efforts to improve health and quality-of-life while working to remove cost from the system. By leveraging our integrated capabilities and coordinating clinical care resources for each individual through their health journey, we are improving affordability while creating a more sustainable health care system. Over the long term, we believe our approach to health care rather than sick care will promote better health, sustainability and economic vibrancy and lower the cost burden on customers as well as employers.
And this success translates to shareholder value as we leverage our capabilities and meet customer needs with products and services that are enhanced through our highly aligned coordinated offerings. This value is evidenced by our industry-leading medical cost trend over the last several years, high customer retention levels and strong growth in our specialty and integrated services that achieve the personalization of services outcomes that I previously referenced. 
As demonstrated by our discussion this morning, our integration and coordination of care has moved beyond the simple multi-product solution. Today, we are engaging individuals in a very personalized way, leveraging actionable information, partnering with health care professionals and utilizing care resources that both reduce costs and produce superior health outcomes.
Now to summarize my remarks before turning it over to Tom. Cigna's strong start to 2015 continues our long-term track record of financial performance in delivering competitively attractive revenue and earnings and gives us confidence in our increased full year 2015 outlook. The strong free cash flow from a high return on capital and high-margin portfolio of businesses provide ongoing financial flexibility in capital management and deployment. We are effectively executing our strategy and creating value for our customers and clients by leveraging integrated capabilities that promote health care rather than sick care and driving improved personalization and affordability for the benefit of the individuals we serve. We remain committed to our long-term objective, which is to double the size of our business over the next 7 to 8 years, yielding an 8% to 10% annual revenue growth rate on average. And over this time horizon, we expect to continue to deliver competitively attractive long-term EPS growth of 10% to 13% annually on average, all while we continue to invest in our company's business portfolio. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Tom."

Good morning, everyone. In my remarks today, I will review Cigna's first quarter 2015 results and discuss our outlook for the full year.
We've had a good start of the year with strong revenue and earnings contributions across our diversified portfolio of businesses, driven by continued effective execution of our strategy.
The highlights in the quarter include consolidated revenue growth of 11% to $9.5 billion; consolidated earnings of $513 million; quarterly earnings per share of $1.96; and continued strong free cash flow with approximately $515 million returned to shareholders through share repurchase on a year-to-date basis. Overall, the strength of our first quarter performance provides us with solid momentum for the year.
Regarding the segments, I will first comment on our Global Health Care segment. Global Health Care results were solid in the quarter. First quarter premiums and fees grew 12% to $6.7 billion, driven by customer growth in our Commercial and Government businesses as well as specialty contributions and rate actions. We ended first quarter of 2015 with 14.7 million global medical customers, including approximately 200,000 new customers from our QualCare Alliance Networks acquisition. First quarter earnings were $444 million, reflecting medical and specialty business growth, continued effective medical cost management, improving results in our individual business with some offset from increased spending for strategic investments as well as higher seasonal costs in our growing Medicare Part D business.
Turning to medical costs. We continue to deliver medical costs that reflect better health outcomes and strong clinical excellence for our customers and clients as a result of our deep collaborative relationships with physicians and our focus on personalization of care. Our commercial medical trend result continues to be among the lowest in the industry. And given that over 85% of our U.S. Commercial customers are in transparent ASO funding arrangements, our clients directly benefit from these favorable medical costs.
Regarding medical care ratios, our first quarter 2015 total Commercial Medical Care ratio or MCR was 75.2% on a reported basis or 75.9% excluding prior year reserve development.
Overall, we are pleased with the results of our commercial risk businesses in the quarter, reflecting strong pricing, disciplined underwriting and continued effective medical management and physician engagement. Results in our individual business continue to improve from the first quarter and are in-line with our expectations.
In our Government business, our first quarter 2015 total government MCR was 89.4% on a reported basis or 89.9% excluding prior year's reserve development, reflecting continued good performance in our Medicare Advantage business, partially offset by seasonal costs from our growing Medicare Part D business. Across our Commercial and Government risk book of business, our first quarter earnings included favorable prior year reserve development of $25 million after-tax compared to the $30 million after-tax in the first quarter 2014.
Moving to operating expenses, for first quarter 2015, our total Global Health Care operating expense ratio was 21.7%, which reflects an expected increase in spending for strategic investments. Overall, we've had a strong start to 2015 in our Global Health Care business.
Now I will discuss the results of our Global Supplemental Benefits business, which continues to deliver attractive growth and profitability. Premiums and fees grew 8% quarter-over-quarter in global supplemental or 12% on a currency-adjusted basis. First quarter earnings grew 21% or 25% on a currency-adjusted basis to $69 million, reflecting business growth and strong operating expense management as well as some favorable operating expense timing.
For Group Disability and Life, first quarter premium and fees increased 7% over first quarter 2014, reflecting growth across the Disability Life and Accident product lines. First quarter earnings in our group business were $51 million, which include unfavorable claims experienced in our life insurance business as well as an expected increase in operating expenses.
For our Corporate and Other operations, results totaled to an after-tax loss of $51 million in the first quarter of 2015. Overall, as a result of the continued effective execution of our strategy, our first quarter results reflect strong revenue and earnings contributions from our ongoing businesses and significant free cash flow.
Turning to our investment portfolio. In the first quarter, we recognized net realized investment gains of $48 million after-tax, coupled with a strong net investment income result. The high quality and diversification of our investment portfolio continue to drive our overall segment results.
Now I will discuss our outlook for 2015. In 2015, we expect to continue to deliver strong financial performance for our shareholders by leveraging our differentiated capabilities to deliver affordable and personalized solutions, effectively deploying capital and targeting new and emerging opportunities where we will seek to drive additional value for shareholders. We continue to expect consolidated revenues to grow in the range of 8% to 10% over 2014.
Our outlook for full year 2015 consolidated adjusted income from operations is now in the range of approximately $2.12 billion to $2.21 billion or $8.15 to $8.50 per share. This represents an increase of $0.10 to $0.15 per share over our previous expectations.
I will now discuss the components of our 2015 outlook, starting with Global Health Care. We now expect full year Global Health Care earnings in the range of approximately $1.75 billion  to $1.8 billion, an increase over our prior expectations.
I'll now summarize some of the key assumptions reflected in our Global Health Care earnings outlook for 2015, starting with our customer base. Regarding global medical customers, we now expect 2015 customer growth of 2% to 4%. This increase over previous expectations primarily reflects customers added through the acquisition of QualCare Alliance Networks, which was completed in the first quarter of 2015.
Turning to medical costs. In our 2015 -- our 2015 outlook continues to assume some increase in medical utilization versus current levels which has been reflected in our pricing. For our total U.S. Commercial book of business, we continue to expect full year medical cost trend to be in the range of 5% to 6%.
Now turning to our medical care ratio outlook. For our total commercial book of business, we continue to expect the 2015 medical care ratio to be in the range of 78% to 79%. For our total government book of business, we continue to expect the 2015 medical care ratio to be in the range of 84.5% to 85.5%.
Regarding operating expenses, we continue to expect our 2015 Global Health Care operating expense ratio to be in the range of 21% to 22%. Overall, we expect full year 2015 Global Health Care earnings to be approximately $1.75 billion to $1.8 billion.
The other components of our outlook are unchanged. For our Global Supplemental Benefits business, we continue to expect strong top line growth in earnings in the range of $230 million to $250 million. Regarding our Group Disability and Life business, we continue to expect full year 2015 earnings in the range of $320 million to $340 million. Regarding our remaining operations, that is other operations and corporate, we expect a loss of $180 million for 2015.
So all-in, for full year 2015, we now expect consolidated adjusted income from operations of $2.12 billion to $2.21 billion or $8.15 to $8.50 per share. This represents an increase of $0.10 to $0.15 per share. I would remind you that our outlook continues to exclude the impact of additional prior year reserve development or earning future capital deployment. While we do not anticipate the impact of future capital deployment in our EPS outlook, we continue to expect the additional free cash flow that we generate will be deployed for the benefit of our shareholders either through value-creating acquisitions or share repurchase.
Now moving to our 2015 capital management position and outlook. Overall, we continue to have excellent financial flexibility. Our subsidiaries remain well capitalized and are generating significant free cash flow to the parent, with a strong return on capital in each of our business segments. Our capital deployment strategy and priorities have not changed. These priorities are: providing the capital necessary to support the growth of our ongoing operations; pursuing M&A activity with a focus on acquiring capabilities and scale to further grow in our targeted areas of focus; and after considering these first 2 items, we'd return capital to shareholders, primarily through share repurchase.
Regarding free cash flow, we ended the quarter with parent company cash of approximately $1.3 billion, which includes approximately $900 million of proceeds from our recent issuance of long-term debt. These proceeds were subsequently used to redeem existing debt in the second quarter of 2015. During the period February 5 through April 29, we repurchased 3.2 million shares of stock for approximately $400 million, bringing our year-to-date share repurchase to 4.3 million shares for approximately $515 million. After considering all sources and uses of parent company cash, we now expect to have approximately $1.3 billion available for capital deployment during the balance of the year. Our free cash flow outlook continues to reflect the industry-leading margins and returns on capital in our businesses and a high level of capital efficiency, particularly from our fee-based businesses. This capital efficiency allows us to fund attractive organic growth while continuing to generate significant free cash flow to be deployed for the benefit of shareholders.
Now to recap. Our first quarter 2015 consolidated results reflect the strength of our diversified portfolio of global businesses and continued effective execution of our focused strategy. The fundamentals of our business remain strong, as evidenced by our first quarter results, which reflected strong revenue and earnings contributions across our diversified portfolio of businesses, industry-leading medical cost trends and high clinical quality and continued strong free cash flow. Based on the strength of these results, we are confident in our ability to achieve our increased full year 2015 earnings outlook.
And with that, we will turn it over to the operator for the Q&A portion of the call."

So first, we're very happy with the position of our Government business. Our outlook for the Government MCR in 2015 reflects strong results in our Medicare Advantage business and some expected pressure in Part D, as you mentioned. The quarter-over-quarter increase, specifically in the Government MCR, is mainly due to Part D with continuing good Medicare Advantage results. As you pointed out, we reported significant growth in Part D customers in 2015. And as a result, we've had a more pronounced seasonal impact from Part D this quarter. These new customers have a period of time to transition from their previous formulary to our formulary. So as we expected, we saw from additional first quarter cost impacts. And all-in, we continue to expect our government MCR to be in the range of 84.5% to 85.5% for the full year, which we're happy with. As far as the outlook or the utilization outlook, we really didn't see any significant change in MA utilization in the quarter."

We define that as employers with 250 to 5,000 employees as well as large single-state employers. The broad thing, I would tell you, is that the market's appetite and interest in transparent funding and aligned funding, which include ASO, continues to grow. It continues to grow both in the regional segment. That has always been a meaningful portion but not the totality of it, but very importantly, as you move downmarket into the Select Segment as well. So point one is continued high and accelerating interest in transparent funding because it aligns incentives, it provides transparency and enables better functionality of the incentive alignment programs and the engagement programs we like. The second thing we see is continued elevation and engagement in we typically call them carve-in or specialty programs. We look at them more as a coordination of care programs. Many of the examples I cited in our prepared remarks. So those will be the 2 predominant trends we continue to see: elevation in transparent funding and then continued movement in what you might call carve-in, we call them coordination of care programs that are delivering the superior medical costs and quality outcomes that Tom made reference to a few moments ago."

As we look at the current cycle, looking forward to 2016 relative to the pipeline of new opportunities, number of case is about the same. Average case size is somewhat elevated.

M&A continues to be a component of our value creation framework. So it's effective deployment of capital, strategic M&A is a component within there. Our priorities have been consistent in terms of where we see the ability to create step-function value, specifically smartly furthering our global footprint; two, expanding our MA and dual capabilities; three, expanding our retail capabilities; and four local tuck-ins. And we've had a successful track record of accomplishing targeted acquisitions over the last 5-plus years in line with our strategy. As it relates to your scale comment, we've chosen to redefine our engagement around scale to ensure that we have appropriate scale to have competitive cost structure from an administrative cost standpoint, which we have. We've been able to prove productivity gains year-in year-out and free capacity to further ongoing investment battle within the franchise. And then you come down to medical cost to your dialogues, and that's a very localized conversation and it's not a localized conversation at the state level. It's an MSA level, and increasingly, within our marketplaces, it's coming down to a sub-MSA level. So we're highly focused on key geographies and our ability to win and deliver value for our clients and customers. As related to appetite for future M&A, I mean, opportunities where we're very aware, engaged and highly focused. So as long as the transactions are on strategy relative to the items I talked about before. On a final note, I'm not going to speculate on how you would rehabilitate an underperforming book of business, but our organization has demonstrated the ability to deliver high performance within our targeted segments, and again, we see M&A as a forward-looking opportunity to create smart transactions and good shareholder value."

I think the broader picture here is that, employers of all sizes are looking for the higher value creation benefit strategies that are going to be sustainable for them. That's the broader dialogue. And private exchanges represent a tool that many employers are trying to explore. The determinant of that is part of the overall portfolio. What we've seen, and what the market has seen is a relatively modest adoption rate of that toolset, but it's early on, as we've indicated, in the private exchange cycle. Two, what we've seen is a continued elevated performance of self-funded consumer-directed aligned incentive and coordinated integrated offerings. As it relates to our own experience within the private exchanges, to the second part of your question, the vast majority of those employers are in the self-funded space given the profile of what we operate in, but we have guaranteed cost lives there as well. We have integrated and nonintegrated lives, but again it's small in the grand scheme of things in terms of what we're seeing. And a portion of the lives we're seeing there are new to Cigna.

I am Will McDowell, Vice President of Investor Relations. Joining me this morning are David Cordani, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tom McCarthy, Cigna's Chief Financial Officer. In our remarks, today, David and Tom will cover a number of topics, including Cigna's first quarter 2015 financial results as well as an update on our financial outlook for 2015.
As noted in our earnings release, when describing our financial results, Cigna uses certain financial measures which are not determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, otherwise known as GAAP. Specifically, we use the term labeled ""adjusted income from operations"" and ""earnings per share"" on the same basis as our principal measures of financial performance. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is contained in today's earnings release, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of cigna.com.
In our remarks today, we will be making some forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our outlook for 2015 and future performance. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. A description of these risks and uncertainties is contained in the cautionary note to today's earnings release and in our most recent reports filed with the SEC.
Before turning the call over to David, I will cover a few items pertaining to our financial results and disclosures. As a reminder, beginning in 2015, we have simplified our guidance and disclosures for our Medical Care Ratios or MCRs by reporting them on a basis of total Commercial and total Government. The total Commercial ratio encompasses all of our commercial risk products, including medical, pharmacy, dental, stop loss and behavioral products, provided through guaranteed cost or experience-rated funding arrangements in both the United States and internationally. The total Government ratio includes our Medicare Advantage, Medicare Part D and Medicaid businesses.
Finally, consistent with past practices, when we make any prospective comments on earnings or EPS outlook, we will do so on a basis that excludes the impact of any future capital deployment or additional prior year development of medical costs.
And with that, I will turn the call over to David."

To begin, I'd like to read the highlights of our financial results for the first quarter. Next, I'll discuss how we are leveraging Cigna's integrated capabilities to engage individuals to help them optimize their health and well-being, and how this is translating into value for customers and clients.
Then Tom will provide more detail around our first quarter financial performance and update our full year 2015 outlook. And following your questions, I'll leave you with a few closing remarks.
Let's dive in with some highlights from the quarter. Cigna's first quarter 2015 performance represents a strong start to the year. We are pleased with our results, which extends our track record of attractive financial performance. Once again, our success was driven by the effective and disciplined execution of our strategy, which continuously guide our actions in a dynamic marketplace.
Our first quarter 2015 consolidated revenue increased 11% to $9.5 billion, with strong contributions across our business segments. We reported adjusted income from operations for the first quarter of $513 million or $1.96 per share. Our Global Health Care revenues increased 12%, driven by strong performance in our Commercial and Government businesses. Our Global Supplemental Benefits business, once again drove strong revenue growth in high single-digit after-tax margins, while we continue to make targeted investments in support of future growth, and we achieved 6% revenue growth in our Group Disability and Life business.
Overall, our diversified portfolio of businesses continues to produce significant free cash flow that further enables our financial flexibility with more than $500 million deployed for share repurchase on a year-to-date basis. Our continued focus and effective strategic execution are generating strong results, enabling ongoing investments in our business portfolio and helping us meet the unique local market needs through the right balance of affordability and personalization of our products and services.
As we've discussed previously, we have a clear framework to drive ongoing future value creation for Cigna. First, our diversified businesses are well positioned to create attractive value for our customers and clients and, as a result, differentiated revenue growth. Second, we are focused on targeted and effective capital deployment to create ongoing shareholder value through investments in our business, strategic M&A and share repurchase. Our businesses generate high levels of free cash flow, which give us financial flexibility and the opportunity to deploy capital to further create value for the benefit of shareholders. And finally, we continue to seek new and emerging opportunities to expand in new distribution marketplaces, new geographies and new buying segments.
Guided by this framework and coupled with effective execution, we continue to expect to deliver average annual revenue growth rate of 8% to 10% over the long term. This framework also positions us to support our focus on enabling health care over financing sick care, which is well aligned with Cigna's efforts to improve the current health care system.
The United States spends $3 trillion a year on health care. Studies consistently show approximately 25% of the total expenditures are wasted through inefficiency or breakage. At the same time, 50% of all adults have at least one chronic disease, conditions which translate to 7 out of the top 10 causes of death in the U.S.
In this dynamic environment, Cigna continues to convene key stakeholders to work toward a sustainable health care system. Health care stakeholders from individuals to corporate employers and government organizations are seeking a common set of core goals. These include maintaining or improving health and productivity, affordable and predictable cost outcomes and greater personalization of solutions and services. To meet these goals, we must continue to accelerate the transition from yesterday's view health insurance as a mechanism for financing the cost of illness to an orientation center around maintaining and improving the health and wellness of individuals. At Cigna, we are and we'll continue to make significant strides toward achieving a more sustainable health care system, by engaging with individuals and physicians through coordinated offerings and alliance incentives.
We have moved beyond the typical multi-product sales and services approach to engaging individuals and coordinate care at a very personal level, as we work to improve health and wellness, all by harnessing information, incenting and supporting individuals and partnering with physicians, the result of which is a service experience for customers that achieves the right balance of personalization and affordability. 
I'd like to share with you a few examples of how we are leveraging the power of integration and coordination, with our broad solution suite, by encouraging maintenance and prevention among the healthy, providing coaching to the healthy at risk, enabling coordinated care for those with chronic conditions and facilitating access to centers of excellence for those with acute conditions.
Our health care professionals engage with customers and clinicians to improve health every day, leveraging the breadth of our clinical capabilities, which spans over 4,000 professionals from doctors and nurses to behavioral health professionals, health coaches and pharmacists.
Relative to our behavioral professionals, our capabilities include engaging with a cardiology team when a health event transpires, as we have seen a strong correlation between these types of illness and depression; engaging with our experts in disability programs to improve health and maximize personal productivity; and helping individuals recover from an injury by taking a more holistic view of mind and body. As for result, our customers are empowered by active coordinated care through coaching, support services and incentive programs. And the impact, Cigna clients with integrated offerings have 29% fewer mental health and substance abuse related outpatient visits and 8% fewer inpatient events compared with those without integrated offerings.
Another powerful example of our success, with our coordinated approach, is for customers who are expectant moms. In today's health care system, the cost of a premature birth is nearly 11x higher than that of a full-term birth, not to mention the impact on the family stress and, in some cases, lifelong health challenges. CIGNA's Healthy Pregnancies, Healthy Babies program engaged with customers to optimize health during pregnancy, by working with nurses who can assess risks; develop personalized care plans; and continue supportive outreach and coordination with OB/GYN teams; and finally, providing coaching on newborn care. Active participation by expected mothers in our integrated program is key. In fact, for those who enroll, there is nearly 50% reduction in premature births versus the U.S. average. This is a huge impact for the family, the child and society overall.
The benefit of integrated and coordinated care is also impactful within Cigna's Specialty Pharmacy programs, where our pharmacists and clinicians engage with customers and health care professionals to improve the effectiveness of drug regimes to drive better overall health outcomes. Our engaged customers have higher medication adherence and lower specialty drug costs, resulting in a 15% lower overall medical cost versus individuals who do not have these coordinated offerings.
Our coordination also works with dental care customers, where there's a high correlation between periodontal health and improved health outcomes. In our dental programs, individuals with diabetes, heart disease or stroke, who have both medical and dental coverage with Cigna have seen higher health quality and lower medical costs. For example, patients with diabetes participating in our coordinated and dental programs saw lower average annual medical costs of approximately 28%, when receiving coordinated care. And for patients with heart disease, costs were low by approximately 25%.
As a final example across the U.S., our 4,000 plus clinical professionals continue to engage and help our customers in increasing numbers through a rapidly growing collaborative care relationships. Today, we have more than 120 of these relationships spanning 29 states. As for impact, more than 90% of Cigna's collaborative care relationships with at least 2 years of experience are seeing success in managing improved medical costs and nearly 80% with at least 1-year of experience are seeing success in total medical cost results or clinical quality measures. Examples of medical results include an improvement in blood pressure, an improvement in BMI and an improvement in total cholesterol levels. These examples reinforce our successful efforts to improve health and quality-of-life while working to remove cost from the system. By leveraging our integrated capabilities and coordinating clinical care resources for each individual through their health journey, we are improving affordability while creating a more sustainable health care system. Over the long term, we believe our approach to health care rather than sick care will promote better health, sustainability and economic vibrancy and lower the cost burden on customers as well as employers.
And this success translates to shareholder value as we leverage our capabilities and meet customer needs with products and services that are enhanced through our highly aligned coordinated offerings. This value is evidenced by our industry-leading medical cost trend over the last several years, high customer retention levels and strong growth in our specialty and integrated services that achieve the personalization of services outcomes that I previously referenced. 
As demonstrated by our discussion this morning, our integration and coordination of care has moved beyond the simple multi-product solution. Today, we are engaging individuals in a very personalized way, leveraging actionable information, partnering with health care professionals and utilizing care resources that both reduce costs and produce superior health outcomes.
Now to summarize my remarks before turning it over to Tom. Cigna's strong start to 2015 continues our long-term track record of financial performance in delivering competitively attractive revenue and earnings and gives us confidence in our increased full year 2015 outlook. The strong free cash flow from a high return on capital and high-margin portfolio of businesses provide ongoing financial flexibility in capital management and deployment. We are effectively executing our strategy and creating value for our customers and clients by leveraging integrated capabilities that promote health care rather than sick care and driving improved personalization and affordability for the benefit of the individuals we serve. We remain committed to our long-term objective, which is to double the size of our business over the next 7 to 8 years, yielding an 8% to 10% annual revenue growth rate on average. And over this time horizon, we expect to continue to deliver competitively attractive long-term EPS growth of 10% to 13% annually on average, all while we continue to invest in our company's business portfolio. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Tom."

Good morning, everyone. In my remarks today, I will review Cigna's first quarter 2015 results and discuss our outlook for the full year.
We've had a good start of the year with strong revenue and earnings contributions across our diversified portfolio of businesses, driven by continued effective execution of our strategy.
The highlights in the quarter include consolidated revenue growth of 11% to $9.5 billion; consolidated earnings of $513 million; quarterly earnings per share of $1.96; and continued strong free cash flow with approximately $515 million returned to shareholders through share repurchase on a year-to-date basis. Overall, the strength of our first quarter performance provides us with solid momentum for the year.
Regarding the segments, I will first comment on our Global Health Care segment. Global Health Care results were solid in the quarter. First quarter premiums and fees grew 12% to $6.7 billion, driven by customer growth in our Commercial and Government businesses as well as specialty contributions and rate actions. We ended first quarter of 2015 with 14.7 million global medical customers, including approximately 200,000 new customers from our QualCare Alliance Networks acquisition. First quarter earnings were $444 million, reflecting medical and specialty business growth, continued effective medical cost management, improving results in our individual business with some offset from increased spending for strategic investments as well as higher seasonal costs in our growing Medicare Part D business.
Turning to medical costs. We continue to deliver medical costs that reflect better health outcomes and strong clinical excellence for our customers and clients as a result of our deep collaborative relationships with physicians and our focus on personalization of care. Our commercial medical trend result continues to be among the lowest in the industry. And given that over 85% of our U.S. Commercial customers are in transparent ASO funding arrangements, our clients directly benefit from these favorable medical costs.
Regarding medical care ratios, our first quarter 2015 total Commercial Medical Care ratio or MCR was 75.2% on a reported basis or 75.9% excluding prior year reserve development.
Overall, we are pleased with the results of our commercial risk businesses in the quarter, reflecting strong pricing, disciplined underwriting and continued effective medical management and physician engagement. Results in our individual business continue to improve in the first quarter and are in-line with our expectations.
In our Government business, our first quarter 2015 total government MCR was 89.4% on a reported basis or 89.9% excluding prior year's reserve development, reflecting continued good performance in our Medicare Advantage business, partially offset by seasonal costs from our growing Medicare Part D business. Across our Commercial and Government risk books of business, our first quarter earnings included favorable prior year reserve development of $25 million after-tax compared to the $30 million after-tax in the first quarter 2014.
Moving to operating expenses, for first quarter 2015, our total Global Health Care operating expense ratio was 21.7%, which reflects an expected increase in spending for strategic investments. Overall, we've had a strong start to 2015 in our Global Health Care business.
Now I will discuss the results of our Global Supplemental Benefits business, which continues to deliver attractive growth and profitability. Premiums and fees grew 8% quarter-over-quarter in global supplemental or 12% on a currency-adjusted basis. First quarter earnings grew 21% or 25% on a currency-adjusted basis to $69 million, reflecting business growth and strong operating expense management as well as some favorable operating expense timing.
For Group Disability and Life, first quarter premium and fees increased 7% over first quarter 2014, reflecting growth across the Disability Life and Accident product lines. First quarter earnings in our group business were $51 million, which include unfavorable claims experienced in our life insurance business as well as an expected increase in operating expenses.
For our Corporate and Other operations, results totaled to an after-tax loss of $51 million in the first quarter of 2015. Overall, as a result of the continued effective execution of our strategy, our first quarter results reflect strong revenue and earnings contributions from our ongoing businesses and significant free cash flow.
Turning to our investment portfolio. In the first quarter, we recognized net realized investment gains of $48 million after-tax, coupled with a strong net investment income result. The high quality and diversification of our investment portfolio continue to drive our overall investment results.
Now I will discuss our outlook for 2015. In 2015, we expect to continue to deliver strong financial performance for our shareholders by leveraging our differentiated capabilities to deliver affordable and personalized solutions, effectively deploying capital and targeting new and emerging opportunities where we will seek to drive additional value for shareholders. We continue to expect consolidated revenues to grow in the range of 8% to 10% over 2014.
Our outlook for full year 2015 consolidated adjusted income from operations is now in the range of approximately $2.12 billion to $2.21 billion or $8.15 to $8.50 per share. This represents an increase of $0.10 to $0.15 per share over our previous expectations.
I will now discuss the components of our 2015 outlook, starting with Global Health Care. We now expect full year Global Health Care earnings in the range of approximately $1.75 billion to $1.8 billion, an increase over our prior expectations.
I'll now summarize some of the key assumptions reflected in our Global Health Care earnings outlook for 2015, starting with our customer base. Regarding global medical customers, we now expect 2015 customer growth of 2% to 4%. This increase over previous expectations primarily reflects customers added through the acquisition of QualCare Alliance Networks, which was completed in the first quarter of 2015.
Turning to medical costs. In our 2015 -- our 2015 outlook continues to assume some increase in medical utilization versus current levels which has been reflected in our pricing. For our total U.S. Commercial book of business, we continue to expect full year medical cost trend to be in the range of 5% to 6%.
Now turning to our medical care ratio outlook. For our total commercial book of business, we continue to expect the 2015 medical care ratio to be in the range of 78% to 79%. For our total government book of business, we continue to expect the 2015 medical care ratio to be in the range of 84.5% to 85.5%.
Regarding operating expenses, we continue to expect our 2015 Global Health Care operating expense ratio to be in the range of 21% to 22%. Overall, we expect full year 2015 Global Health Care earnings to be approximately $1.75 billion to $1.8 billion.
The other components of our outlook are unchanged. For our Global Supplemental Benefits business, we continue to expect strong top line growth in earnings in the range of $230 million to $250 million. Regarding our Group Disability and Life business, we continue to expect full year 2015 earnings in the range of $320 million to $340 million. Regarding our remaining operations, that is other operations and corporate, we expect a loss of $180 million for 2015.
So all-in, for full year 2015, we now expect consolidated adjusted income from operations of $2.12 billion to $2.21 billion or $8.15 to $8.50 per share. This represents an increase of $0.10 to $0.15 per share. I would remind you that our outlook continues to exclude the impact of additional prior year reserve development or any future capital deployment. While we do not anticipate the impact of future capital deployment in our EPS outlook, we continue to expect the additional free cash flow that we generate will be deployed for the benefit of our shareholders either through value-creating acquisitions or share repurchase.
Now moving to our 2015 capital management position and outlook. Overall, we continue to have excellent financial flexibility. Our subsidiaries remain well capitalized and are generating significant free cash flow to the parent, with a strong return on capital in each of our business segments. Our capital deployment strategy and priorities have not changed. These priorities are: providing the capital necessary to support the growth of our ongoing operations; pursuing M&A activity with a focus on acquiring capabilities and scale to further grow in our target areas of focus; and after considering these first 2 items, we'd return capital to shareholders, primarily through share repurchase.
Regarding free cash flow, we ended the quarter with parent company cash of approximately $1.3 billion, which includes approximately $900 million of proceeds from our recent issuance of long-term debt. These proceeds were subsequently used to redeem existing debt in the second quarter of 2015. During the period February 5 through April 29, we repurchased 3.2 million shares of stock for approximately $400 million, bringing our year-to-date share repurchase to 4.3 million shares for approximately $515 million. After considering all sources and uses of parent company cash, we now expect to have approximately $1.3 billion available for capital deployment during the balance of the year. Our free cash flow outlook continues to reflect the industry-leading margins and returns on capital in our businesses and a high level of capital efficiency, particularly from our fee-based businesses. This capital efficiency allows us to fund attractive organic growth while continuing to generate significant free cash flow to be deployed for the benefit of shareholders.
Now to recap. Our first quarter 2015 consolidated results reflect the strength of our diversified portfolio of global businesses and continued effective execution of our focused strategy. The fundamentals of our business remain strong, as evidenced by our first quarter results, which reflected strong revenue and earnings contributions across our diversified portfolio of businesses, industry-leading medical cost trends and high clinical quality and continued strong free cash flow. Based on the strength of these results, we are confident in our ability to achieve our increased full year 2015 earnings outlook.
And with that, we will turn it over to the operator for the Q&A portion of the call."

Our outlook for the Government MCR in 2015 reflects strong results in our Medicare Advantage business and some expected pressure in Part D, as you mentioned. The quarter-over-quarter increase, specifically in the Government MCR, is mainly due to Part D with continuing good Medicare Advantage results. As you pointed out, we reported significant growth in Part D customers in 2015. And as a result, we've had a more pronounced seasonal impact from Part D this quarter. These new customers have a period of time to transition from their previous formulary to our formulary. So as we expected, we saw some additional first quarter cost impacts. And all-in, we continue to expect our government MCR to be in the range of 84.5% to 85.5% for the full year, which we're happy with. As far as the outlook or the utilization outlook, we really didn't see any significant change in MA utilization in the quarter."

It continues to grow both in the regional segment. That has always been a meaningful portion but not the totality of it, but very importantly, as you move downmarket into the Select Segment as well. So point one is continued high and accelerating interest in transparent funding because it aligns incentives, it provides transparency and enables better functionality of the incentive alignment programs and the engagement programs we like. The second theme we see is continued elevation and engagement in we typically call them carve-in or specialty programs. We look at them more as a coordination of care programs. Many of the examples I cited in our prepared remarks. So those will be the 2 predominant trends we continue to see: elevation in transparent funding and then continued movement in what you might call carve-in, we call them coordination of care programs that are delivering the superior medical costs and quality outcomes that Tom made reference to a few moments ago."

As you know, we further strengthened those capabilities about 2 years ago, with our expanded relationship with Catamaran seeking several features to strengthen, and we're seeing the benefit of those. As we've talked about that in the past, while we continue to own and operate our PBM, we maintain significant optionality and flexibility in that structure. And then, while we don't typically comment on details of transactions, we view that the PBM marketplace is and will continue to be very dynamic.

Within the individual book of business, as you very well know relative to us, it's small in the grand scheme of things in terms of covered lives. As it relates to the grandfathered and some of the transitional block, one of the states where we had a large grandfather block of businesses, a state where we don't operate on the exchange, specifically California. So we saw attrition relative to the grandfathered block stepping into 2015, which was in line with our expectations. We still maintain a mix of on-exchange and off-exchange business and that, taken as a whole, the loss ratio of our business, and therefore, the underlying performance of the individual business steps forward and improved in line with our expectations going from '14 to '15."

M&A continues to be a component of our value creation framework. So it's effective deployment of capital, strategic M&A is a component within there. Our priorities have been consistent in terms of where we see the ability to create step-function value, specifically smartly furthering our global footprint; two, expanding our MA and dual capabilities; three, expanding our retail capabilities; and four local tuck-ins. And we've had a successful track record of accomplishing targeted acquisitions over the last 5-plus years in line with our strategy. As it relates to your scale comment, we've chosen to redefine our orientation around scale to ensure that we have appropriate scale to have competitive cost structure from an administrative cost standpoint, which we have. We've been able to prove productivity gains year-in year-out and free capacity to further ongoing investment back to within the franchise. And then you come down to medical cost to your dialogues, and that's a very localized conversation and it's not a localized conversation at the state level. It's an MSA level, and increasingly, within our marketplaces, it's coming down to a sub-MSA level. So we're highly focused on key geographies and our ability to win and deliver value for our clients and customers. As related to appetite for future M&A, I mean, opportunities where we're very aware, engaged and highly focused. So as long as the transactions are on strategy relative to the items I talked about before. On a final note, I'm not going to speculate on how you would rehabilitate an underperforming book of business, but our organization has demonstrated the ability to deliver high performance within our targeted segments, and again, we see M&A as a forward-looking opportunity to create smart transactions and good shareholder value."

First, the dialogue with employers has been active around private exchanges, as it has been around consumer-directed engagement programs, et cetera. I think the broader picture here is that, employers of all sizes are looking for the higher value creation benefit strategies that are going to be sustainable for them. That's the broader dialogue. And private exchanges represent a tool that many employers are trying to explore to determine whether or not it is part of the overall portfolio. What we've seen, and what the market has seen is a relatively modest adoption rate of that toolset, but it's early on, as we've indicated, in the private exchange cycle. Two, what we've seen is a continued elevated performance of self-funded consumer-directed aligned incentive and coordinated integrated offerings. As it relates to our own experience within the private exchanges, to the second part of your question, the vast majority of those employers are in the self-funded space given the profile of what we operate in, but we have guaranteed cost lives there as well. We have integrated and nonintegrated lives, but again it's small in the grand scheme of things in terms of what we're seeing. And a portion of the lives we're seeing there are new to Cigna. Greater than 50% of those are transitioning from existing Cigna relationships carried over to the exchanges. But the important part is that it's still a small part of both the marketplace as well as our portfolio.

And then over the last couple of years, an emerging trend too, as I referenced before, carving in or even more adoption of integrated care programs that are coordinated to delivering the value back.
