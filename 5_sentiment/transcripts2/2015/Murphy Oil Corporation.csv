For the fourth quarter 2014, we had income from continuing operations of $442 million or $2.48 per diluted share. This compares to income from continuing operations of fourth quarter of '13 of $180.5 million or $0.96 per diluted share. For",492,"Thanks, Barry. For the fourth quarter 2014, we had income from continuing operations of $442 million or $2.48 per diluted share. This compares to income from continuing operations of fourth quarter of '13 of $180.5 million or $0.96 per diluted share. For the entire year of 2014, income from continuing ops was $1,025,000,000 or $5.69 per diluted share compared to $88.1 million or $4.69 per diluted share for 2013. 
The fourth quarter results from continuing operations for 2014 included a gain of $321.4 million on the sale of 20% interest in Malaysian business, and this made up of 2 pieces. We have $144.8 million of pretax profit, which is included in the Malaysia operating revenues and $176.6 million of tax benefits included in income taxes. We also had income tax benefit of $120.6 million related to foreign oil and gas investments, $46.3 million of impairments related to the Tahoe field in the Gulf of Mexico and Canadian goodwill assets, and $59.6 million related to the write-off of previously suspended exploration wells. These, and other items affecting comparability of earnings between periods, are listed in the schedule of adjusted earnings included as part of our earnings release. Unless stated otherwise, all of these figures are on an after-tax basis. 
Earnings in the 2014 quarter were negatively impacted by significantly lower realized sales prices for crude oil and natural gas liquids, the effects of which were partially offset by higher production levels. Crude oil and gas liquids production averaged approximately 173,000 barrels per day in the 2014 quarter compared to just under 140,000 barrels a day in 2013. The increase is primarily a result of ongoing drilling in Eagle Ford Shale and the current U.S. start up in the Dalmatian field in the Gulf of Mexico. Natural gas files of 540 million cubic feet a day in the 2014 quarter compared to 399 million cubic feet a day in '13 with the increase primarily due to higher production from Dalmatian, Eagle Ford Shale and Tupper area Western Canada and the Kikeh in Malaysia. 
In our corporate segment, we had net charges of $25 million for the fourth quarter of 2014 compared to net charges of $62 million in the fourth quarter of last year. Decreased cost in 2014 primarily relates to favorable results from transactions to and foreign currencies and lower administrative cost partially offset by higher net interest cost. 
Capital expenditures for continuing operations for 2014 totaled $3.76 billion. For 2015, our CapEx is expected to total $2.3 billion. Of that, approximately 1.9 is for development projects and approximately $380 million is to be spent on exploration activities. This assumes WTI pricing of $52.50 per barrels and Henry Hub pricing of $3 per Mcf. The year end 2014 Murphy's long-term debt amounted to approximately $2.54 billion, and this included about $290 million related to the Kakap SPS lease for 22.7% of total capital employed. And with that, I'll turn it over to Roger."

We closed the sale of 30% [ph] of our the Malaysian business for $2 billion in 2 phases: One announced on December 18 at 20%; and the just completed Phase 2 for 10% which was announced publicly this morning. The completed the sale of the U.K. retail gasoline business, we initiated decommissioning of the Milford Haven refinery processing units with divestment of the terminal assets on word. We divested our small non-operated interest in South Louisiana and Alaska for cash proceeds of approximately $6 million. We built a balance sheet at the end of 2014 with a net debt to total cap ratio of 13.5%, which includes $1.6 billion -- $1.65 billion of cash and invested cash located across our business. We set a quarterly production record of 258,868 barrels of oil equivalent per day. We set an annual production record of 225,973 barrels equivalent per day, up 10% from 2013. We recorded total proved reserve replacement of 180%. We achieved First Oil at 3 new deepwater fields at Siakap North-Petai and Kakap-Gumusut in Malaysia and Dalmatian in the Gulf of Mexico. We sanctioned the Block H Malaysia floating LNG project and increased production in Eagle Ford Shale to a level near 57,000 barrel equivalent per day for the year, with over 500 operating wells. We repurchased 375 million of company common stock. We authorized an additional $500 million share repurchase and increased the regular dividend by 12% to $1.40 per share. 
When we look at prices, the drop in benchmark prices from third quarter to fourth quarter was near $25 a barrel. We sell fourth quarter realized oil prices in our Malaysian business near $67 per barrel, in great contrast to the third quarter prices in this year and fourth of last year. Our oil index SK Gas averaged near $5.50 per Mcf in the quarter. 
Moving to United States. The Eagle Ford Shale oil prices were over $78 from quarter, including the impact of our WTI hedging program, which finished up at year end. I realized oil prices in Gulf of Mexico averaged near $73 per barrel. In Canada, Syncrude was close to $71 per barrel in Seal, including a hedge and a narrowing heavy differential was near $46.50 per barrel. 
Our global lease operating expense for 2014, excluding Syncrude, is just over $11 per BOE showing an improvement of 24% over 2013. We went into the current price decline within an advantage to our peers on cash flow metrics. We expect to maintain this advantage but at lower level due to the continued decline in commodity prices. 
Looking at production in the fourth quarter. We set a new quarterly record, averaging just over 259,000-barrel equivalent per day, 4% above our guidance of guidance of 250,000 per day for the quarter.  The increase to guidance is primarily attributed to higher gas production in the Montney and Sarawak areas and house and oil production from the Gulf of Mexico and offshore Canada. 
Reduction for the full year averaged just short of 226,000, 10% higher than 2013 and ended up above our 220,000 to 225,000 barrel equivalent range given on July 30. 
The year-on-year growth came from continued ramp up at Eagle Ford Shale and new offshore projects coming online in the Gulf of Mexico and Malaysia. 
In reserves, in 2014, we expect to have reserves at a replacement rate of over 180%. Year-end 2014 reserve volumes represented at reserve life index of R over P of just over 9 years. This is consistent with our 5-year reserve replacement rate of 108% [ph] and is our 9th consecutive year at over 100%, and during this time, we increased production since 2006 by 125%. 
As we look at our price advantages here, our oil-weighted diverse portfolio has proven to have some benefits as we adjust to the lower price environment. Our Gulf of Mexico, Eagle Ford Shale and Malaysia oil prices compared well to many of the onshore shale regions in United States. 
In Eagle Ford Shale, we're oil-weighted with very little condensate and a proximity to the Gulf of Mexico's beneficial compared to some of the Mid-Continent crudes. 
Looking at our global offshore operations in Malaysia. Following customary reclosing and adjustments we have realized cash proceeds of  approximately  $1.87 billion on the 30% sale of our Malaysian assets. Production offshore Sabah near 46,500-barrel equivalent per day for the fourth quarter with 85% liquids. The Kakap-Gumusut main project declared first oil in October 14. The project has demonstrated excellent performance with production ramping up over the fourth quarter into this year with rates reaching 120,000 barrels per day gross. 
In shallow water offshore Sarawak, gas production in the fourth quarter was 177 million cubic feet per day with higher-than-expected nominations into the LNG facility. Sarawak liquids production was just over 23,000 barrels per day for the quarter. Drilling continues at the South Acis field where we've delivered 2 oil wells and drilled 4 water injectors during the fourth quarter. 
In the Gulf of Mexico, production for the quarter was near 32,400-barrel equivalent per day with 65% liquids. We continue to progress our subsea 2 well expansion project at Medusa and Mississippi Canyon where we have a 60% working interest. The first subsea well has been drilled to plan, and we are continuing with drilling the second well and subsea back to Medusa facility. First production from the new wells is expected by mid-year. 
At the nonoperated Kodiak development, where we held a 29% working interest, drilling continues on the initial development well with First Oil targeted in the first half of 2016. We're pleased with the paid results seen on the well so far. 
In North American onshore business at the Montney, Tupper gas fields in Western Canada, our fourth quarter production was 186 million cubic feet per day, up from 146 million per day in the third quarter as we added 8 new wells. We currently have 3 rigs and 1 completion spread in operation but reduced the rig count to 0 b the middle of February as a reduced capital spending across the company and across lower rate of return projects. 
We brought 8 new wells online in quarter 4, expected to deliver 9 wells in 2015. We have seen excellent results utilizing our new completion in short management strategy, which may lead to improved EUR on future wells. We have approximately 65 million cubic feet per day of gas hedged and near CAD 4.10 Aco [ph] for 2015. 
In the Eagle Ford Shale, the fourth quarter production averaged near 64,300-barrel equivalent per day net at 90% liquids, up from 60,500-barrel equivalent per day in the third quarter as we brought on 54 wells. The full year average of production at Eagle Ford Shale was just under 57,000 barrel equivalent per day, up from near 39,000-barrel equivalent per day in 2013. We have reduced our rig count in Eagle Ford Shale from a high of 8 in September to 5 today, and we plan to be at 4 rigs by early March as we release rigs due to capital constraints and falling commodity prices. 
We're now using 2 completion spreads down from 3 in December and expect to average 1.6 spreads this year. Production in the fourth quarter of 2015 is estimated to average 62,000 [ph]barrel equivalent per day, with 45 new wells coming online. We're now estimating full year production near 57,000-barrel equivalent per day, flat to the prior year, based on bringing on 118 new wells, down approximately 100 wells from 2014. We continue to see positive results from our downspacing in staggered well testing across the play, our current focus is on managing capital spending and operating expenses. The long-term value of our Eagle Ford position is bolstered by our early entry into the play at an average lease cost of approximately $2,000 per acre. 
We continue to execute well in Eagle Ford Shale. We built a strong team in execution to build an onshore business and growing production to current levels from our entry into the play in 2009 by lowering our drilling and completion and lease operating expenses each year. 
As we look at guidance. First quarter guidance for 2015 is detailed in our earnings release and on the Slide #14 today. We expect production to be near 221,000 barrels equivalent per day, with sales targeted 230,000-barrel equivalent per day with the over lift coming primarily from Malaysia. 
Exploration expense for the quarter is estimated at $108 million, includes $50 million potential dry hole cost for and the Gulf of Mexico and 3 Perth Basin wells in Australia and 24 million for J&J expenses globally. The full year production guidance range is 195,000 to 207,000 barrel equivalent per day, and I will provide more detail on this shortly.
Looking at CapEx in 2015. Our current budget for capital spending and production guidance is based an average oil prices for the year of $52 WTI; $57 Brent; and $3 Henry Hub. Further declines in price may result in changes to our guidance. We're forecasting our capital expenditures -- expenditures to be $2.3 billion, down approximately 33% in the 2014 pro forma of $3.5 billion when calculating up to the Malaysian sales. 
The bulk of our spending will be in development drilling and field projects with 17% of our capital allocated to exploration program, of which 266 million or near 75% is allocated to exploration drilling. The projected development spend were approximately $1.9 billion is split between our global offshore business at 45% and North American onshore at 55%. 
Most significantly, we're cutting our Eagle Ford Shale CapEx by 46% compared to 2014 spending with the reduction in rigs from 8 in September to hopefully 4 mid-March. 
In our exploration program in the Gulf of Mexico, we're currently drilling the operated Urca prospect in Mississippi Canyon 697 where we formed down from 50% to 35% working interest. We expect to reach by mid-February. This middle massing target is pre-geo gross meaning resource size of 130 million barrels. 
In Australia, we spread the first of 3 wells in our Perth Basin in January 22 where we operate with 40% working interest. We're testing a total of 280 million barrels of gross mean resource across 3 wells.  The 3D seismic program in our Australian Block in the Ceduna basin is now over 50% complete and we expect to finish that in the near term. 
Looking at the rest of our 2015 program. We plan to drill up to 4 wells in the Gulf, testing 620 million barrels equivalent gross mean resource. We will drill 5 wells in Southeast Asia, in Malaysia and Brunei to test 350 million gross mean resource. 
Overall, the 2015 program will test a net mean resource of near 190 million-barrel equivalent for $266 million in exploration drilling capital. 
As you look at production in 2015. We're guiding to a 2015 production range of 195,000 to 207,000 barrel equivalent per day in that year. The mid point of this range are 201,000 would place us with a slight growth over the 2014 pro forma with the 33% budget reduction in 2014 to '15, including a 46% reduction in Eagle Ford Shale capital year-on-year. 
As we look in 2015 post the sale down, we have both near quarter autumns and entire year autumns further impacting production. As a starting point, our fourth quarter average of near 259,000 equivalent will be lower to 231,000, and the 2014 annual production of near 226,000-barrel equivalent per day is adjusted to just under 200,000, both on a pro forma basis as sold down in Malaysia. 
Looking at the first quarter, we see Sabah being higher with the ramp up in the Kakap-Gumusut main project and new wells coming on to Kikeh. In the Gulf of Mexico, planned outages of nonoperated have narrowed in our Medusa field impact quarterly production rates. The rest of the decrease is attributed to assumed lower gas nominations in Sarawak and rig cuts for capital reduction starting to impact our North American onshore business. 
Typically, the fourth quarter is a high production period with no planned turnaround or outages schedule. Over the course of the full year, we have planned outages for maintenance for typically scheduled during better weather in the middle of the year. In addition, we continue risk production and nomination levels of both operated and the nonoperated facilities that we do not control. 
Moving to the full year, both Kakap-Gumusut and Siakap North-Petai will contribute to the entire year when compared to 2014. Full year contribution from Dalmatian and the mid-year start-up of Medusa expansion add to this year, but is offset with the expected shut in of the field, along with planned outages in field declines. Year-on-year, we see a slight increase in Montney production despite the fall off from the quarter high in 2014 in fourth quarters. We're seeing production decline in the heavy oilfields. We shut in uneconomic wells at this lower price levels. 
As to liquidity, we're starting off 2015 in very good financial shape, with our balance sheet and cash positions  bolstered by recent the sell down of our Malaysian business. We are well positioned with flexibility and optionality to carry out our 2015 plan of intention to operate in capital cost reduction, maintain the current dividend, manage our U.S. cash position, take advantage of opportunities that may arise during this downturn and increase our activity level when prices recover. 
As to take away -- as we look back in 2014, we impact our shareholders positively with share buybacks as well as increasing our dividend. And again, increase and replace production now for 9 years in a row. Our reserve replacement history continues at over 180%. I feel the current downturn in prices and associated capital reductions gives us the recalibration point to production, and we plan to take advantage of this change, with recent results showing improvement and meeting production guidance. 
Our onshore North American business has become very significant, representing near 45% [ph] of our 2014 production levels. Our early entry at low cost in the Eagle Ford Shale will now show the value of the play going forward. Our plan is to maintain our Eagle Ford Shale 2014 production level flat in 2015 with a 46% reduction in capital spending year-on-year. We've made many changes in senior personnel in process and our explanation business. We are confident our plans to test near 190 million barrels equivalent this year's program as well as evaluate new opportunities that will come available in this downturn. 
We went into the current price collapse of the cash flow per barrel advantage to our peers, which will continue. Late 2013, we set out to mark the value of our Malaysian business and removed some concentration risk as well as hopefully do further portfolio optimization work. That timely closing positions us very well to maintain flexibility from a balance sheet perspective. Our company has survived prior price drops with a conservative balance sheet, diverse producing assets and exploration base growth strategy as stood the test the time. I will not be glad to take your questions. Thank you."

So I have one of the higher and one of the lower in my business. And that's the way it goes if you're in the business for a long time. I think there's still a lot of high rate contracted rigs out there in the 5 50 range. There's many of them. Almost all of the newbuilds have contracts at high rates. They are stacked. Thus say, one backed technology rigs that can do the job, that you can get for 300. I don't think, with the big pullback in CapEx this year, I think those will be one-off opportunities for the drillers, in my view. I don't see it as to be a big impact. I think it will be a big impact on development. I think you'll see people that hit on exploration wells unable to sanction will have lower drilling cost maybe 150,000 a day per rig. So it will be very significant.  I don't see it being that significant for me over the next couple of years, but it will be very significant for development. I think it's my personal opinion on this, but it costs going down issue is more onshore focused at present, massive numbers of rigs. I think that will be the first shoe to drop as to big lowering of expenses. The offshore is controlled by, in my view, larger service providers, more high-tech Christmas trees, completions, gravel packs. I believe it's controlled by less people too. Those people have recently merged, as we know. I don't see the big pullback in that if we don't have the mom-and-pop competition that you would have to, the super majors service onshore. But a lot of these boats, along with the rigs, it may take a couple of years for that to work. But that -- it's just not as significant as I think it may be think -- thinking, Brian, in my opinion."

Sea Eagle is currently a 50-50 opportunity, Dalmatian South is 70-30, Murphy, that is a pretty expensive well. We're 50-50 in Desperado and 50-50 on Opal. I'm not the against taking a couple of wells to 35, and I would, by the time sell that today, not everyone has the balance sheet I have, Roger. And so that would be the goal I have there. The Perth Basin, we're already properly partnered there at 40%, it's pretty an inexpensive well testing a pretty big program for 27 million barrels net. We now have a new partner, of course, on the wells in Malaysia as I read on Slide 16. We're partnered appropriately at deepwater Sarawak which is a place where we drill many, many wells and have a good idea on the call Block H partnered with our new partner, Pertamina, as well as Brunei. So my Gulf of Mexico wells would be an opportunity to take those $100 million type wells down by 15% would be the type of CapEx segment there, Roger."

For the fourth quarter 2014, we had income from continuing operations of $442 million or $2.48 per diluted share. This compares to income from continuing ops in the fourth quarter of '13 of $180.5 million or $0.96 per diluted share. For the",501,"Thanks, Barry. For the fourth quarter 2014, we had income from continuing operations of $442 million or $2.48 per diluted share. This compares to income from continuing ops in the fourth quarter of '13 of $180.5 million or $0.96 per diluted share. For the entire year of 2014, income from continuing ops was $1,025,000,000 or $5.69 per diluted share compared to $88.1 million (sic) [ $888.1 million ] or $4.69 per diluted share for 2013.
The fourth quarter results from continuing operations for 2014 included a gain of $321.4 million on the sale of 20% interest in our Malaysian business, and this is made up of 2 pieces. We have $144.8 million of pretax profit, which is included in the Malaysia operating revenues and $176.6 million of tax benefits included in income taxes. We also had income tax benefits of $120.6 million related to foreign oil and gas investments, $46.3 million of impairments related to the Tahoe field in the Gulf of Mexico and Canadian goodwill assets, and $59.6 million related to the writeoff of previously suspended exploration wells. These, and other items affecting comparability of earnings between periods, are listed in the schedule of adjusted earnings included as part of our earnings release. Unless stated otherwise, all of these figures are on an aftertax basis.
Earnings in the 2014 quarter were negatively impacted by significantly lower realized sales prices for crude oil and natural gas liquids, the effects of which were partially offset by higher production levels. Crude oil and gas liquids production averaged approximately 173,000 barrels per day in the 2014 quarter compared to just under 140,000 barrels a day in 2013. The increase is primarily a result of ongoing drilling in the Eagle Ford Shale and the current U.S. startup of the Dalmatian field in the Gulf of Mexico. Natural gas finds were 514 million cubic feet a day in the 2014 quarter compared to 399 million cubic feet a day in '13, with the increase primarily due to higher production from Dalmatian, Eagle Ford Shale, the Tupper area in Western Canada and at Kikeh in Malaysia.
In our corporate segment, we had net charges of $25 million for the fourth quarter of 2014 compared to net charges of $62 million in the fourth quarter of last year. Decreased costs in 2014 primarily relate to favorable results from transactions denominated in foreign currencies and lower administrative costs partially offset by higher net interest costs.
Capital expenditures from continuing operations for 2014 totaled $3.76 billion. For 2015, our CapEx is expected to total $2.3 billion. Of that, approximately $1.9 billion is for development projects and approximately $380 million is to be spent on exploration activities. This assumes WTI pricing of $52.50 per barrels and Henry Hub pricing of $3 per Mcf. At year-end 2014, Murphy's long-term debt amounted to approximately $2.54 billion, and this included about $290 million related to the Kakap FPSO lease for 22.7% of total capital employed. And with that, I'll turn it over to Roger."

We closed the sale of 30% of our the Malaysia business for $2 billion in 2 phases: one announced from December 18 at 20%; and we just completed Phase 2 for 10% which was announced publicly this morning. We completed the sale of the U.K. retail gasoline business. We initiated decommissioning of the Milford Haven Refinery process units with divestment of the terminal assets ongoing. We divested our small non-operated interest in South Louisiana and Alaska for cash proceeds of approximately $6 million. We built a balance sheet at the end of 2014 with a net debt to total cap ratio of 13.5%, which includes $1.6 billion -- $1.65 billion of cash and invested cash located across our business. We set a quarterly production record of 258,868 barrels of oil equivalent per day. We set an annual production record of 225,973 barrel equivalents per day, up 10% from 2013. We recorded total proved reserve replacement of 180%. We achieved First Oil at 3 new deepwater fields at Siakap North-Petai and Kakap-Gumusut in Malaysia and Dalmatian in the Gulf of Mexico. We sanctioned the Block H Malaysia floating LNG project and increased production in the Eagle Ford Shale to a level near 57,000 barrel equivalent per day for the year with over 500 operating wells. We repurchased 375 million of company common stock. We authorized an additional $500 million share repurchase and increased the regular dividend by 12% to $1.40 per share.
When we look at prices, a drop in benchmark prices from third quarter to fourth quarter was near $25 a barrel. We saw our fourth quarter realized oil prices in our Malaysia business near $67 per barrel, in great contrast to the third quarter prices of this year and fourth of last year. Our oil-indexed SK Gas averaged near $5.50 per Mcf at the quarter.
Moving to United States. The Eagle Ford Shale oil prices were over $78 for the quarter, including the impact of our WTI hedging program, which finished up at year-end. Our realized oil prices in the Gulf of Mexico averaged near $73 per barrel. In Canada, Syncrude was close to $71 per barrel in Seal, including a hedge and a narrowing heavy differential, was near $46.50 per barrel.
Our global lease operating expense for 2014, excluding Syncrude, is just over $11 per BOE showing an improvement of 24% over 2013. We went into the current price decline with an advantage to our peers on cash flow metrics. We expect to maintain this advantage but at a lower level due to continued decline in commodity prices.
Looking at production in the fourth quarter. We set a new quarterly record, averaging just over 259,000 barrel equivalent per day, 4% above our guidance of 250,000 per day for the quarter.  The increase to guidance is primarily attributed to higher than planned gas production in the Montney and Sarawak areas and higher than planned oil production from the Gulf of Mexico and offshore Canada.
Production for the full year averaged just short of 226,000, 10% higher than 2013 and ended up above our 220,000 to 225,000 barrel equivalent range given on July 30.
The year-on-year growth came from continued ramp-up at Eagle Ford Shale and new offshore projects coming online in the Gulf of Mexico and Malaysia.
In reserves. In 2014, we expect to have reserves at a replacement rate of over 180%. Year-end 2014 reserve volumes represented a Reserve Life Index, or R over P, of just over 9 years. This is consistent with our 5-year reserve replacement rate of 180% and is our 9th consecutive year at over 100%. And during this time, we increased production since 2006 by 125%.
As we look at our price advantages here. Our oil-weighted diverse portfolio has proven to have some benefits as we adjust to the lower price environment. Our Gulf of Mexico, Eagle Ford Shale and Malaysia oil prices compared well to many of the onshore shale regions in United States.
In Eagle Ford Shale, we're oil-weighted with very little condensate and our proximity to the Gulf of Mexico is beneficial compared to some of the Mid-Continent crudes.
Looking at our global offshore operation in Malaysia. Following customary closing and adjustments, we have realized cash proceeds of approximately $1.87 billion on the 30% sale of our Malaysia assets. Production offshore Sabah, near 46,500-barrel equivalent per day for the fourth quarter with 85% liquids. The Kakap-Gumusut main project declared first oil in October 14. The project has demonstrated excellent performance with production ramping up over the fourth quarter into this year, with rates reaching 120,000 barrels per day gross.
In shallow water offshore Sarawak, gas production in the fourth quarter was 177 million cubic feet per day, with higher-than-expected nominations into the LNG facility. Sarawak liquids production was just over 23,000 barrels per day for the quarter. Drilling continues at the South Acis field where we've delivered 2 oil wells and drilled 4 water injectors during the fourth quarter.
In the Gulf of Mexico, production for the quarter was near 32,400-barrel equivalent per day with 65% liquids. We continue to progress our subsea 2-well expansion project at Medusa and Mississippi Canyon where we have a 60% working interest. The first subsea well has been drilled to plan, and we are continuing with drilling the second well and subsea tieback to the Medusa facility. First production from the new wells is expected by mid-year.
At the non-operated Kodiak development, where we hold a 29% working interest, drilling continues on the initial development well with first oil targeted in the first half of 2016. We're pleased with the pay results seen on the well so far.
In North American onshore business at the Montney, at Tupper gas fields in Western Canada, our fourth quarter production was 186 million cubic feet per day, up from 146 million per day in the third quarter as we added 8 new wells. We currently have 3 rigs and 1 completion spread in operation but we reduced the rig count to 0 at the middle of February as we reduced capital spending across the company and across lower rate of return projects.
We brought 8 new wells online in quarter 4 and expect to deliver 9 wells in 2015. We have seen excellent results utilizing our new completion and choke management strategies, which should lead to improved EUR on future wells. We have approximately 65 million cubic feet per day of gas hedged at near CAD 4.10 AECO for 2015. 
In the Eagle Ford Shale. The fourth quarter production averaged near 64,300 barrel equivalents per day, net, at 90% liquids, up from 60,500 barrel equivalent per day in the third quarter as we brought on 54 wells. The full year average of production at Eagle Ford Shale was just under 57,000 barrel equivalent per day, up from near 39,000 barrel equivalent per day in 2013. We have reduced our rig count in the Eagle Ford Shale from a high of 8 in September to 5 today, and we plan to be at 4 rigs by early March as we release rigs due to capital constraints and falling commodity prices.
We're now using 2 completion spreads down from 3 in December and expect to average 1.6 spreads this year. Production in the fourth quarter of 2015 is estimated to average 62,000 barrel equivalent per day, with 45 new wells coming online. We're now estimating full year production near 57,000 barrel equivalent per day, flat to the prior year, based on bringing on 118 new wells, down approximately 100 wells from 2014. We continue to see positive results from our downspacing in staggered well testing across the play, our current focus is on managing capital spending and operating expenses. The long-term value of our Eagle Ford position is bolstered by our early entry into the play at an average lease cost of approximately $2,000 per acre.
We continue to execute well in Eagle Ford Shale. We built a strong team in execution of building an onshore business at a growing production to the current levels from our entry in the play in 2009 by lowering our drilling and completion and lease operating expenses each year.
As we look at guidance. First quarter guidance for 2015 is detailed in our earnings release and on the Slide #14 today. We expect production to be near 221,000 barrels equivalents per day, with sales targeted 230,000 barrel equivalents per day, with the overlift coming primarily from Malaysia.
Exploration expense for the quarter is estimated at $108 million, and includes $50 million of potential dry hole cost for Urca in the Gulf of Mexico and 3 Perth Basin wells in Australia and $24 million for G&G expenses globally. The full year production guidance range is 195,000 to 207,000 barrel equivalents per day, and I will provide more detail on this shortly.
Looking at CapEx in 2015. Our current budget for capital spending and production guidance is based an average oil prices for the year of $52 WTI, $57 Brent and $3 Henry Hub. Further declines in price may result in changes to our guidance. We're forecasting our capital expenditures to be $2.3 billion, down approximately 33% in the 2014 pro forma of $3.5 billion when calculating out to the Malaysian sale.
The bulk of our spending will be in development drilling and field projects with 17% of our capital allocated to exploration program, of which $266 million or near 75% is allocated to exploration drilling. The projected development spend of approximately $1.9 billion is split between our global offshore business at 45% and North American onshore at 55%.
Most significantly, we're cutting our Eagle Ford Shale CapEx by 46% compared to 2014 spending, with the reduction in rigs from 8 in September to hopefully 4 mid-March.
In our exploration program in the Gulf of Mexico, we're currently drilling the operated Urca prospect in Mississippi Canyon 697 where we farmed down from 50% to 35% working interest. We expect to reach 2D by mid-February. This middle Miocene target is pre-geo gross mean resource size of 130 million barrels.
In Australia, we spread the first of 3 wells in our Perth Basin program on January 22, where we operate with 40% working interest. We are testing a total of 280 million barrels of gross mean resource across 3 wells. The 3D seismic program in our Australian Block in the Ceduna basin is now over 50% complete and we expect to finish up in the near term.
Looking at the rest of our 2015 program. We plan to drill up to 4 wells in the Gulf, testing 620 million barrels equivalent of gross mean resource. We will drill 5 wells in Southeast Asia, in Malaysia and Brunei, to test 350 million gross mean resource.
Overall, the 2015 program will test a net risk mean resource of near 190 million-barrel equivalent for $266 million in exploration drilling capital.
As we look at production in 2015. We're guiding to a 2015 production range of 195,000 to 207,000 barrel equivalent per day in that year. The midpoint of this range, or 201,000, would place us with a slight growth over the 2014 pro forma, with a 33% budget reduction in 2014 to '15, including a 46% reduction in Eagle Ford Shale capital year-on-year.
As we look in 2015 post of sell-down, we have both near-quarter autumns and entire year autumns further impacting production. As a starting point, our fourth quarter average of near 259,000 equivalent would be lowered to 231,000. And the 2014 annual production of near 226,000 barrel equivalent per day is adjusted to just under 200,000, both on a pro forma basis as sell-down in Malaysia.
Looking at the first quarter, we see Sabah being higher, with the ramp-up in the Kakap-Gumusut main project and new wells coming on at Kikeh. In the Gulf of Mexico, planned outages at non-operated Habanero and our Medusa field impact quarterly production rates. The rest of the decrease is attributed to assumed lower gas nominations in Sarawak and rig cuts for capital reduction starting to impact our North American onshore business.
Typically, the fourth quarter is a high production period with no planned turnarounds or outages scheduled. Over the course of the full year, we have planned outages for maintenance, more typically scheduled during better weather in the middle of the year. In addition, we contained the risk reduction and nomination levels of both operated and the non-operated facilities that we do not control.
Moving to the full year. Both Kakap-Gumusut and Siakap North-Petai will contribute for the entire year when compared to 2014. Full year contribution from Dalmatian and the mid-year startup of Medusa expansion add to this year, but is offset with the expected shut-in of the Mondo field, along with planned outages and field declines. Year-on-year, we see a slight increase in Montney production despite a falloff from the quarter high in 2014 in fourth quarters. We're seeing production decline and are heavy oil at Seal as we've shut in uneconomic wells at this lower price level.
As to liquidity. We're starting off 2015 in very good financial shape, with our balance sheet and cash positions bolstered by the recent the sell-down of our Malaysia business. We are well positioned with flexibility and optionality to carry out our 2015 plans of intention to operate in capital cost reductions, maintain the current dividend, manage our U.S. cash position, take advantage of opportunities that may arise during this downturn and increase our activity level when prices recover.
As to takeaways. As we look back in 2014, we impacted our shareholders positively with share buybacks as well as increasing our dividend. We again increased and replaced production now for 9 years in a row. Our reserve replacement history continues at over 180%. I feel the current downturn in prices and associated capital reductions gives us a recalibration point to production. And we plan to take advantage of this change, with recent results showing improvement in meeting production guidance.
Our onshore North American business has become very significant, representing near 45% of our 2014 production levels. Our early entry at low cost in the Eagle Ford Shale will now show the value of the play going forward. Our plan is to maintain our Eagle Ford Shale 2014 production level flat in 2015, with a 46% reduction in capital spending year-on-year. We've made many changes in senior personnel and process in our exploration business. We are confident in our plans to test near 190 million barrels equivalent of this year's program as well as evaluate new opportunities that will come available in this downturn.
We went into the current price collapse with a cash flow per barrel advantage to our peers, which should continue. Late 2013, we set out to mark the value of our Malaysia business and removed some concentration risk as well as hopefully do further portfolio optimization work. The timely closing positions us very well to maintain flexibility from a balance sheet perspective. Our company has survived prior price drops with a conservative balance sheet, diverse producing assets, an exploration base growth strategy that stood the test of time. I will now be glad to take your questions. Thank you."

But if we choose to make it worse, I mean, obviously, the Eagle Ford Shale is a very valuable barrel. The barrels are on the ground there. We can stop spending them there, and it is a U.S. spend where the U.S. debt would be increased. It is a place, too, that can be rapidly increased, add rigs very quickly. I look for cost calibration to go very quickly there. We are seeing progress and got to 10% on cost reductions quite quickly than anticipated, heading toward 15% to 20% now. On top of the efficiencies that we have, it allows us to keep some of the better rigs and make deals on the rigs that we had in the release. So I feel real good about the ability to cut there some and quickly add there, and -- but I think we can handle what we have pretty good here, even if things go down, Leo."

We kind of got a mix of it today, with a couple of pretty high rates in our business today as to commitments, but today, this Kodiak project in the Gulf of Mexico, I think, is one of the cheaper rigs in the world, a little over 300,000 a day. So I have one of the higher and one of the lower in my business. And that's the way it goes if you're in the business for a long time. I think there are still a lot of high rate contracted rigs out there in the 550,000 range. There's many of them. Almost all of the newbuilds have contracts at high rates. They are stacked. Let's say, one back technology rigs that can do the job, that you can get for 300,000. I don't think -- with the big pullback in CapEx this year, I think those would be one-off opportunities for the drillers in my view, I don't see it as to be a big impact. I think it will be a big impact on development. I think you'll see people that hit on exploration wells, unable to sanction. We'll have lower drilling cost, maybe $150,000 a day per rig. So it will be very significant. I don't see it being that significant for me over the next couple of years, but it will be very significant for development. I think that -- it's my personal opinion on this, but this cost going down issue is more onshore-focused at present, massive numbers of rigs. I think that will be the first shoe to drop as to big lowering of expenses. The offshore is controlled by, in my view, larger service providers, more high-tech Christmas trees, completions, gravel packs. I believe it's controlled by less people, too. Those people have recently merged, as we know. I don't see the big pullback in that because they don't have the mom-and-pop competition that you would have to the super major service onshore. But a lot of these boats, along with the rigs, it may take a couple of years for that to work. But that's -- it's just not as significant as I think you may be thinking, Brian, in my opinion."

I don't see ever getting to a price we wouldn't probably frac some wells because we're out drilling that. So the onshore is big, and I have some very large commitment in the deepwater, Paul.

We could drill -- we could absolutely afford to add 13,000 equivalent production if we wanted to, I just chose not to. So that's the first step. We have probably 4,000 barrels of shut-ins around the world, turnarounds of various kinds across 10 different places: Kikeh, twice this year; Sarawak gas onshore shutting down for some regulatory things; and all those things. So if I give you a breakdown here further, I mean, at 12,500 of CapEx, 7,500 of Malaysia assumed. Another thing, we had a very good quarter in the assumption of these gas nominations. We are probably close to 280 million gross, we have 240 million in our budget with some shutdowns coming. So 12,500 CapEx, 7,500 on nominations and downtime, including the risking I've spoken to many times, and have North America offshore, we have Medusa coming on and offset by outages at Habanero, Medusa. Mondo is a place that makes about 2,000 barrel equivalent for a very long time. Now the field is supposed to go off-line from the sub-service perspective and it just never dies. We have no DD&A there. It's been one of the greatest gas fields of all time, but it's going to die this year at some point, I don't know exactly when. So that's 8,000, and we'll have 1,000 on Syncrude risking because they have maintenance, a thing they didn't have in the fourth quarter.

For the fourth quarter 2014, we had income from continuing operations of $442 million or $2.48 per diluted share. This compares to income from continuing ops in the fourth quarter of '13 of $180.5 million or $0.96 per diluted share. For the",498,"Thanks, Barry. For the fourth quarter 2014, we had income from continuing operations of $442 million or $2.48 per diluted share. This compares to income from continuing ops in the fourth quarter of '13 of $180.5 million or $0.96 per diluted share. For the entire year of 2014, income from continuing ops was $1,025,000,000 or $5.69 per diluted share compared to $88.1 million (sic) [ $888.1 million ] or $4.69 per diluted share for 2013.
The fourth quarter results from continuing operations for 2014 included a gain of $321.4 million on the sale of 20% interest in our Malaysian business, and this is made up of 2 pieces. We have $144.8 million of pretax profit, which is included in the Malaysia operating revenues and $176.6 million of tax benefits included in income taxes. We also had income tax benefits of $120.6 million related to foreign oil and gas investments, $46.3 million of impairments related to the Tahoe field and Gulf of Mexico and Canadian goodwill assets, and $59.6 million related to the writeoff of previously suspended exploration wells. These, and other items affecting comparability of earnings between periods, are listed in the schedule of adjusted earnings included as part of our earnings release. Unless stated otherwise, all of these figures are on an after-tax basis.
Earnings in the 2014 quarter were negatively impacted by significantly lower realized sales prices for crude oil and natural gas liquids, the effects of which were partially offset by higher production levels. Crude oil and gas liquids production averaged approximately 173,000 barrels per day in the 2014 quarter compared to just under 140,000 barrels a day in 2013. The increase is primarily a result of ongoing drilling in Eagle Ford Shale and the current U.S. startup of the Dalmatian field in the Gulf of Mexico. Natural gas finds were 514 million cubic feet a day in the 2014 quarter compared to 399 million cubic feet a day in '13, with the increase primarily due to higher production from Dalmatian, Eagle Ford Shale, the Tupper area in Western Canada and at Kikeh in Malaysia.
In our corporate segment, we had net charges of $25 million for the fourth quarter of 2014 compared to net charges of $62 million in the fourth quarter of last year. Decreased costs in 2014 primarily relate to favorable results from transactions denominated in foreign currencies and lower administrative costs partially offset by higher net interest costs.
Capital expenditures from continuing operations for 2014 totaled $3.76 billion. For 2015, our CapEx expected to total $2.3 billion. Of that, approximately $1.9 billion is for development projects and approximately $380 million is to be spent on exploration activities. This assumes WTI pricing of $52.50 per barrel and Henry Hub pricing of $3 per Mcf. At year-end 2014, Murphy's long-term debt amounted to approximately $2.54 billion, and this included about $290 million related to the Kakap FPSO lease for 22.7% of total capital employed. And with that, I'll turn it over to Roger."

We closed the sale of 30% of our the Malaysia business for $2 billion in 2 phases: one announced from December 18 at 20%; and we just completed Phase 2 for 10% which was announced publicly this morning. We completed the sale of the U.K. retail gasoline business. We initiated decommissioning of the Milford Haven Refinery process units with divestment of the terminal assets ongoing. We divested our small non-operated interest in South Louisiana and Alaska for cash proceeds of approximately $6 million. We built a balance sheet at the end of 2014 with a net debt to total cap ratio of 13.5%, which includes $1.6 billion -- $1.65 billion of cash and invested cash located across our business. We set a quarterly production record of 258,868 barrels of oil equivalent per day. We set an annual production record of 225,973 barrel equivalents per day, up 10% from 2013. We recorded total proved reserve replacement of 180%. We achieved First Oil at 3 new deepwater fields at Siakap North-Petai and Kakap-Gumusut in Malaysia and Dalmatian in the Gulf of Mexico. We sanctioned the Block H Malaysia floating LNG project and increased production in the Eagle Ford Shale to a level near 57,000 barrel equivalent per day for the year with over 500 operating wells. We repurchased 375 million of company common stock. We authorized an additional $500 million share repurchase and increased the regular dividend by 12% to $1.40 per share.
When we look at prices, a drop in benchmark prices from third quarter to fourth quarter was near $25 a barrel. We saw our fourth quarter realized oil prices in our Malaysia business near $67 per barrel, in great contrast to the third quarter prices of this year and fourth of last year. Our oil-indexed SK Gas averaged near $5.50 per Mcf at the quarter.
Moving to United States. The Eagle Ford Shale oil prices were over $78 for the quarter, including the impact of our WTI hedging program, which finished up at year-end. Our realized oil prices in the Gulf of Mexico averaged near $73 per barrel. In Canada, Syncrude was close to $71 per barrel in Seal, including a hedge and a narrowing heavy differential, was near $46.50 per barrel.
Our global lease operating expense for 2014, excluding Syncrude, is just over $11 per BOE showing an improvement of 24% over 2013. We went into the current price decline with an advantage to our peers on cash flow metrics. We expect to maintain this advantage but at a lower level due to continued decline in commodity prices.
Looking at production in the fourth quarter. We set a new quarterly record, averaging just over 259,000 barrel equivalent per day, 4% above our guidance of 250,000 per day for the quarter.  The increase to guidance is primarily attributed to higher than planned gas production in the Montney and Sarawak areas and higher than planned oil production from the Gulf of Mexico and offshore Canada.
Production for the full year averaged just short of 226,000, 10% higher than 2013 and ended up above our 220,000 to 225,000 barrel equivalent range given on July 30.
The year-on-year growth came from continued ramp-up at Eagle Ford Shale and new offshore projects coming online in the Gulf of Mexico and Malaysia.
In reserves in 2014, we expect to have reserves at a replacement rate of over 180%. Year-end 2014 reserve volumes represented a Reserve Life Index, or R over P, of just over 9 years. This is consistent with our 5-year reserve replacement rate of 180% and is our 9th consecutive year at over 100%. And during this time, we increased production since 2006 by 125%.
As we look at our price advantages here. Our oil-weighted diverse portfolio has proven to have some benefits as we adjust to the lower price environment. Our Gulf of Mexico, Eagle Ford Shale and Malaysia oil prices compared well to many of the onshore shale regions in the United States.
In Eagle Ford Shale, we're oil-weighted with very little condensate and our proximity to the Gulf of Mexico is beneficial compared to some of  Mid-Continent crudes.
Looking at our global offshore operation in Malaysia following customary closing and adjustments, we have realized cash proceeds of approximately $1.87 billion on the 30% sale of our Malaysia assets. Production offshore Sabah, near 46,500-barrel equivalent per day for the fourth quarter with 85% liquids. The Kakap-Gumusut main project declared first oil in October 14. The project has demonstrated excellent performance with production ramping up over the fourth quarter into this year, with rates reaching 120,000 barrels per day gross.
In shallow water offshore Sarawak, gas production in the fourth quarter was 177 million cubic feet per day, with higher-than-expected nominations into the LNG facility. Sarawak liquids production was just over 23,000 barrels per day for the quarter. Drilling continues at the South Acis field where we've delivered 2 oil wells and drilled 4 water injectors during the fourth quarter.
In the Gulf of Mexico, production for the quarter was near 32,400-barrel equivalent per day with 65% liquids. We continue to progress our subsea 2-well expansion project at Medusa and Mississippi Canyon where we have a 60% working interest. The first subsea well has been drilled to plan, and we are continuing with drilling the second well and subsea tieback to the Medusa facility. First production from the new wells is expected by mid-year.
At the non-operated Kodiak development, where we hold a 29% working interest, drilling continues on the initial development well with first oil targeted in the first half of 2016. We're pleased with the pay results seen on the well so far.
In North American onshore business at the Montney, at Tupper gas fields in Western Canada, our fourth quarter production was 186 million cubic feet per day, up from 146 million per day in the third quarter as we added 8 new wells. We currently have 3 rigs and 1 completion spread in operation but we reduced the rig count to 0 by the middle of February as we reduced capital spending across the company and across lower rate of return projects.
We brought 8 new wells online in quarter 4 and expect to deliver 9 wells in 2015. We have seen excellent results utilizing our new completion and choke management strategies, which should lead to improved EUR on future wells. We have approximately 65 million cubic feet per day of gas hedged at near CAD 4.10 AECO for 2015. 
In the Eagle Ford Shale. The fourth quarter production averaged near 64,300 barrel equivalents per day, net, at 90% liquids, up from 60,500 barrel equivalent per day in the third quarter as we brought on 54 wells. The full year average of production at Eagle Ford Shale was just under 57,000 barrel equivalent per day, up from near 39,000 barrel equivalent per day in 2013. We have reduced our rig count in the Eagle Ford Shale from a high of 8 in September to 5 today, and we plan to be at 4 rigs by early March as we release rigs due to capital constraints and falling commodity prices.
We're now using 2 completion spreads down from 3 in December and expect to average 1.6 spreads this year. Production in the fourth quarter of 2015 is estimated to average 62,000 barrel equivalents per day, with 45 new wells coming online. We're now estimating full year production near 57,000 barrel equivalent per day, flat to the prior year, based on bringing on 118 new wells, down approximately 100 wells from 2014. We continue to see positive results from our downspacing in staggered well testing across the play, our current focus is on managing capital spending and operating expenses. The long-term value of our Eagle Ford position is bolstered by our early entry into the play at an average lease cost of approximately $2,000 per acre.
We continue to execute well in Eagle Ford Shale. We built a strong team in execution of building an onshore business at a growing production to the current levels from our entry in the play in 2009 by lowering our drilling and completion and lease operating expenses each year.
As we look at guidance. First quarter guidance for 2015 is detailed in our earnings release and on the Slide #14 today. We expect production to be near 221,000 barrels equivalents per day, with sales targeted 230,000 barrel equivalents per day, with the overlift coming primarily from Malaysia.
Exploration expense for the quarter is estimated at $108 million, and includes $50 million of potential dry hole cost for Urca in the Gulf of Mexico and 3 Perth Basin wells in Australia and $24 million for G&G expenses globally. The full year production guidance range is 195,000 to 207,000 barrel equivalents per day, and I will provide more detail on this shortly.
Looking at CapEx in 2015. Our current budget for capital spending and production guidance is based on average oil prices for the year of $52 WTI, $57 Brent and $3 Henry Hub. Further declines in price may result in changes to our guidance. We're forecasting our capital expenditures to be $2.3 billion, down approximately 33% in the 2014 pro forma of $3.5 billion when calculating out to Malaysian sale.
The bulk of our spending will be in development drilling and field projects with 17% of our capital allocated to exploration program, of which $266 million or near 75% is allocated to exploration drilling. The projected development spend of approximately $1.9 billion is split between our global offshore business at 45% and North American onshore at 55%.
Most significantly, we're cutting our Eagle Ford Shale CapEx by 46% compared to 2014 spending, with the reduction in rigs from 8 in September to hopefully 4 mid-March.
In our exploration program in the Gulf of Mexico, we're currently drilling the operated Urca prospect in Mississippi Canyon 697 where we farmed down from 50% to 35% working interest. We expect to reach 2D by mid-February. This middle Miocene target is pre-geo gross mean resource size of 130 million barrels.
In Australia, we spread the first of 3 wells in our Perth Basin program on January 22, where we operate with 40% working interest. We are testing a total of 280 million barrels of gross mean resource across 3 wells. The 3D seismic program in our Australian Block in the Ceduna basin is now over 50% complete and we expect to finish up in the near term.
Looking at the rest of our 2015 program. We plan to drill up to 4 wells in the Gulf, testing 620 million barrels equivalent of gross mean resource. We will drill 5 wells in Southeast Asia, in Malaysia and Brunei, to test 350 million gross mean resource.
Overall, the 2015 program will test a net risk mean resource of near 190 million-barrel equivalent for $266 million in exploration drilling capital.
As we look at production in 2015. We're guiding to a 2015 production range of 195,000 to 207,000 barrel equivalent per day in that year. The midpoint of this range, or 201,000, would place us with a slight growth over the 2014 pro forma, with a 33% budget reduction in 2014 to '15, including a 46% reduction in Eagle Ford Shale capital year-on-year.
As we look in 2015 post of sell-down, we have both near-quarter items and entire year items further impacting production. As a starting point, our fourth quarter average of near 259,000 equivalent would be lowered to 231,000. And the 2014 annual production of near 226,000 barrel equivalent per day is adjusted to just under 200,000, both on a pro forma basis as sell-down in Malaysia.
Looking at the first quarter, we see Sabah being higher, with the ramp-up in the Kakap-Gumusut main project and new wells coming on at Kikeh. In the Gulf of Mexico, planned outages at non-operated Habanero and our Medusa field impact quarterly production rates. The rest of decrease is attributed to assumed lower gas nominations in Sarawak and rig cuts for capital reduction starting to impact our North American onshore business.
Typically, the fourth quarter is a high production period with no planned turnarounds or outages scheduled. Over the course of the full year, we have planned outages for maintenance, were typically scheduled during better weather in the middle of the year. In addition, we contained a risk reduction and nomination levels of both operated and the non-operated facilities that we do not control.
Moving to the full year. Both Kakap-Gumusut and Siakap North-Petai will contribute for the entire year when compared to 2014. Full year contribution from Dalmatian and the mid-year startup of Medusa expansion add to this year, but is offset with the expected shut-in of the Mondo field, along with planned outages and field declines. Year-on-year, we see a slight increase in Montney production despite a falloff from the quarter high in 2014 in fourth quarter. We're seeing production decline and a heavy oil at sea from shutting uneconomic wells at this lower price level.
As to liquidity we're starting off 2015 in very good financial shape, with our balance sheet and cash positions bolstered by the recent  sell-down of our Malaysia business. We are well positioned with flexibility and optionality to carry out our 2015 plans of intention to operate in capital cost reductions, maintain the current dividend, manage our U.S. cash position, take advantage of opportunities that may arise during this downturn and increased our activity level when prices recover.
As to takeaway as we look back on 2014, we impacted our shareholders positively with share buybacks as well as increasing our dividend. We again increased and replaced production now for 9 years in a row. Our reserve replacement history continues at over 180%. I feel the current downturn in prices and associated capital reductions gives us a recalibration point to production. And we plan to take advantage of this change, with recent results showing improvement in meeting production guidance.
Our onshore North American business has become very significant, representing near 45% of our 2014 production levels. Our early entry at low cost in Eagle Ford Shale will now show the value of the play going forward. Our plan is to maintain our Eagle Ford Shale 2014 production level flat in 2015, with a 46% reduction in capital spending year-on-year. We've made many changes in senior personnel and process in our exploration business. We are confident in our plans to test near 190 million barrels equivalent of this year's program as well as evaluate new opportunities that will come available in this downturn.
We went into the current price collapse with a cash flow per barrel advantage to our peers, which should continue. Late 2013, we set out to mark the value of our Malaysia business and removed some concentration risk as well as hopefully do further portfolio optimization work. The timely closing positions us very well to maintain flexibility from a balance sheet perspective. Our company has survived prior price drops with a conservative balance sheet, diverse producing assets, an exploration base growth strategy that stood the test of time. I will now be glad to take your questions. Thank you."

I look for cost calibration to go very quickly there. We are seeing progress and got to 10% on cost reductions probably quicker than anticipated, heading toward 15% to 20% now.

So I have one of the higher and one of the lower in my business. And that's the way it goes if you're in the business for a long time. I think there are still a lot of high rate contracted rigs out there in the 550 range. There's many of them. Almost all of the new builds have contracts at high rates. They are stacked. Let's say, one bad technology rig that can do the job, that you can get for 300's[ph]. I don't think -- with the big pullback in CapEx this year, I think those would be one-off opportunities for the drillers in my view, I don't see it as to be a big impact. I think it will be a big impact on development. I think you'll see people that hit on exploration wells, unable to sanction. We'll have lower drilling cost, maybe $150,000 a day per rig. So it will be very significant. I don't see it being that significant for me over the next couple of years, but it will be very significant for development. I think that -- it's my personal opinion on this, but this cost going down issue is more onshore-focused at present, massive numbers of rigs. I think that will be the first shoe to drop as to big lowering of expenses. The offshore is controlled by, in my view, larger service providers, more high-tech Christmas trees, completions, gravel packs. I believe it's controlled by less people, too. Two of those people have recently merged, as we know. I don't see the big pullback in that because they won't have the mom-and-pop competition that you would have to the super major service onshore.

It gets very challenging to do it, but you can do it. So the cash taxes right now would be very minimal. But there are other implications that we have to consider.

We're in East Coast, Canada, Syncrude, Gulf of Mexico, Malaysia, we're not an onshore player. And in the fourth quarter, the weather is pretty bad all over the world. It's monsoon season in Malaysia, it's very cold in Canada, it's very bad weather in the Gulf usually. We don't work on or shut down or do things.

We could drill -- we could absolutely afford to add 13,000 equivalent production if we wanted to, I just chose not to. So that's the first step. We have probably 4,000 barrels of shut-ins around the world, turnarounds of various kinds across 10 different places: Kikeh, twice this year; Sarawak gas onshore shutting down for some regulatory things; and all those things. So if I give you a breakdown here further, I mean, at 12,500 of CapEx, 7,500 of Malaysia assumed. Another thing is, we had a very good quarter in the assumption of these gas nominations are probably close to 280 million gross, we have 240 million in our budget with some shutdowns coming. So 12,500 CapEx, 7,500 on nominations and downtime, including the risking I've spoken to many times, and have North America offshore, we have Medusa coming on and offset by outages at Habanero, Medusa. Mondo is a place that makes about 2,000 barrel equivalent for a very long time. Now the field is supposed to go off-line from the sub-service perspective and it just never dies. We have no DD&A there. It's been one of the greatest gas fields of all times, but it's going to die this year at some point, I don't know exactly when. So that's 8,000, and have a 1,000 on Syncrude risking because they have maintenance, and things they didn't have in the fourth quarter. So just not a fourth quarter to a year company, this is not the way we roll here. If you look back at the history of Murphy, I would bet you that the fourth quarter is high every single time because the weather is too bad to work on anything."

For the fourth quarter 2014, we had income from continuing operations of $442 million or $2.48 per diluted share. This compares to income from continuing ops in the fourth quarter of '13 of $180.5 million or $0.96 per diluted share. For the",499,"Thanks, Barry. For the fourth quarter 2014, we had income from continuing operations of $442 million or $2.48 per diluted share. This compares to income from continuing ops in the fourth quarter of '13 of $180.5 million or $0.96 per diluted share. For the entire year of 2014, income from continuing ops was $1,025,000,000 or $5.69 per diluted share compared to $88.1 million (sic) [ $888.1 million ] or $4.69 per diluted share for 2013.
The fourth quarter results from continuing operations for 2014 included a gain of $321.4 million on the sale of 20% interest in our Malaysian business, and this is made up of 2 pieces. We have $144.8 million of pretax profit, which is included in the Malaysia operating revenues and $176.6 million of tax benefits included in income taxes. We also had income tax benefits of $120.6 million related to foreign oil and gas investments, $46.3 million of impairments related to the Tahoe field in the Gulf of Mexico and Canadian goodwill assets, and $59.6 million related to the write-off of previously suspended exploration wells. These, and other items affecting comparability of earnings between periods, are listed in the schedule of adjusted earnings included as part of our earnings release. Unless stated otherwise, all of these figures are on an after-tax basis.
Earnings in the 2014 quarter were negatively impacted by significantly lower realized sales prices for crude oil and natural gas liquids, the effects of which were partially offset by higher production levels. Crude oil and gas liquids production averaged approximately 173,000 barrels per day in the 2014 quarter compared to just under 140,000 barrels a day in 2013. The increase is primarily a result of ongoing drilling in Eagle Ford Shale and the current year startup of the Dalmatian field in the Gulf of Mexico. 
Natural gas volumes were 514 million cubic feet a day in the 2014 quarter compared to 399 million cubic feet a day in '13, with the increase primarily due to higher production from Dalmatian, Eagle Ford Shale, the Tupper area in Western Canada and at Kikeh in Malaysia.
In our corporate segment, we had net charges of $25 million for the fourth quarter of 2014 compared to net charges of $62 million in the fourth quarter of last year. Decreased costs in 2014 primarily relate to favorable results from transactions denominated in foreign currencies and lower administrative costs partially offset by higher net interest costs.
Capital expenditures from continuing operations for 2014 totaled $3.76 billion. For 2015, our CapEx expected to total $2.3 billion. Of that, approximately $1.9 billion is for development projects and approximately $380 million is to be spent on exploration activities. This assumes WTI pricing of $52.50 per barrel and Henry Hub pricing of $3 per Mcf. At year-end 2014, Murphy's long-term debt amounted to approximately $2.54 billion, and this included about $290 million related to the Kakap FPSO lease or 22.7% of total capital employed. And with that, I'll turn it over to Roger."

Our realized oil prices in the Gulf of Mexico averaged near $73 per barrel. In Canada, Syncrude was close to $71 per barrel, and Seal, including a hedge and a narrowing heavy differential, was near $46.50 per barrel.
Our global lease operating expense for 2014, excluding Syncrude, is just over $11 per BOE showing an improvement of 24% over 2013. We went into the current price decline with an advantage to our peers on cash flow metrics. We expect to maintain this advantage but at a lower level due to continued decline in commodity prices.
Looking at production in the fourth quarter. We set a new quarterly record, averaging just over 259,000 barrel equivalent per day, 4% above our guidance of 250,000 per day for the quarter.  The increase to guidance is primarily attributed to higher than planned gas production in the Montney and Sarawak areas and higher than planned oil production from the Gulf of Mexico and offshore Canada.
Production for the full year averaged just short of 226,000, 10% higher than 2013 and ended up above our 220,000 to 225,000 barrel equivalent range given on July 30.
The year-on-year growth came from continued ramp-up at Eagle Ford Shale and new offshore projects coming online in the Gulf of Mexico and Malaysia.
In reserves in 2014, we expect to add reserves at a replacement rate of over 180%. Year-end 2014 reserve volumes represented a Reserve Life Index, or R over P, of just over 9 years. This is consistent with our 5-year reserve replacement rate of 180% and is our 9th consecutive year at over 100%. And during this time, we increased production since 2006 by 125%.
As we look at our price advantages here. Our oil-weighted diverse portfolio has proven to have some benefits as we adjust to the lower price environment. Our Gulf of Mexico, Eagle Ford Shale and Malaysia oil prices compared well to many of the onshore shale regions in the United States.
In Eagle Ford Shale, we're oil-weighted with very little condensate and our proximity to the Gulf of Mexico is beneficial compared to some of  Mid-Continent crudes.
Looking at our global offshore operation in Malaysia following customary closing and adjustments, we have realized cash proceeds of approximately $1.87 billion on the 30% sale of our Malaysia assets. Production offshore Sabah, near 46,500-barrel equivalent per day for the fourth quarter with 85% liquids. The Kakap-Gumusut main project declared first oil in October 14. The project has demonstrated excellent performance with production ramping up over the fourth quarter into this year, with rates reaching 120,000 barrels per day gross.
In shallow water offshore Sarawak, gas production in the fourth quarter was 177 million cubic feet per day, with higher-than-expected nominations into the LNG facility. Sarawak liquids production was just over 23,000 barrels per day for the quarter. Drilling continues at the South Acis field where we've delivered 2 oil wells and drilled 4 water injectors during the fourth quarter.
In the Gulf of Mexico, production for the quarter was near 32,400-barrel equivalent per day with 65% liquids. We continue to progress our subsea 2-well expansion project at Medusa and Mississippi Canyon where we have a 60% working interest. The first subsea well has been drilled to plan, and we are continuing with drilling the second well and subsea tieback to the Medusa facility. First production from the new wells is expected by mid-year.
At the non-operated Kodiak development, where we hold a 29% working interest, drilling continues on the initial development well with first oil targeted in the first half of 2016. We're pleased with the pay results seen on the well so far.
In North American onshore business at the Montney, at Tupper gas fields in Western Canada, our fourth quarter production was 186 million cubic feet per day, up from 146 million per day in the third quarter as we added 8 new wells. We currently have 3 rigs and 1 completion spread in operation but we reduced the rig count to 0 by the middle of February as we reduced capital spending across the company and across lower rate of return projects.
We brought 8 new wells online in quarter 4 and expect to deliver 9 wells in 2015. We have seen excellent results utilizing our new completion and choke management strategies, which should lead to improved EUR on future wells. We have approximately 65 million cubic feet per day of gas hedged at near CAD 4.10 AECO for 2015. 
In the Eagle Ford Shale. The fourth quarter production averaged near 64,300 barrel equivalents per day, net, at 90% liquids, up from 60,500 barrel equivalent per day in the third quarter as we brought on 54 wells. The full year average of production at Eagle Ford Shale was just under 57,000 barrel equivalent per day, up from near 39,000 barrel equivalent per day in 2013. We have reduced our rig count in the Eagle Ford Shale from a high of 8 in September to 5 today, and we plan to be at 4 rigs by early March as we release rigs due to capital constraints and falling commodity prices.
We're now using 2 completion spreads down from 3 in December and expect to average 1.6 spreads this year. Production in the fourth quarter of 2015 is estimated to average 62,000 barrel equivalents per day, with 45 new wells coming online. We're now estimating full year production near 57,000 barrel equivalent per day, flat to the prior year, based on bringing on 118 new wells, down approximately 100 wells from 2014. We continue to see positive results from our downspacing and staggered well testing across the play, our current focus is on managing capital spending and operating expenses. The long-term value of our Eagle Ford position is bolstered by our early entry into the play at an average lease cost of approximately $2,000 per acre.
We continue to execute well in Eagle Ford Shale. We built a strong team in execution of building an onshore business at a growing production to the current levels from our entry in the play in 2009 by lowering our drilling and completion and lease operating expenses each year.
As we look at guidance. First quarter guidance for 2015 is detailed in our earnings release and on the Slide #14 today. We expect production to be near 221,000 barrels equivalents per day, with sales targeted 230,000 barrel equivalents per day, with the overlift coming primarily from Malaysia.
Exploration expense for the quarter is estimated at $108 million, and includes $50 million of potential dry hole cost for Urca in the Gulf of Mexico and 3 Perth Basin wells in Australia and $24 million for G&G expenses globally. The full year production guidance range is 195,000 to 207,000 barrel equivalents per day, and I will provide more detail on this shortly.
Looking at CapEx in 2015. Our current budget for capital spending and production guidance is based on average oil prices for the year of $52 WTI, $57 Brent and $3 Henry Hub. Further declines in price may result in changes to our guidance. We're forecasting our capital expenditures to be $2.3 billion, down approximately 33% in the 2014 pro forma of $3.5 billion when calculating out the Malaysian sale.
The bulk of our spending will be in development drilling and field projects with 17% of our capital allocated to exploration program, of which $266 million or near 75% is allocated to exploration drilling. The projected development spend of approximately $1.9 billion is split between our global offshore business at 45% and North American onshore at 55%.
Most significantly, we're cutting our Eagle Ford Shale CapEx by 46% compared to 2014 spending, with the reduction in rigs from 8 in September to hopefully 4 mid-March.
In our exploration program in the Gulf of Mexico, we're currently drilling the operated Urca prospect in Mississippi Canyon 697 where we farmed down from 50% to 35% working interest. We expect to reach TD by mid-February. This middle Miocene target is pre-drill gross mean resource size of 130 million barrels.
In Australia, we spud the first of 3 wells in our Perth Basin program on January 22, where we operate with 40% working interest. We are testing a total of 280 million barrels of gross mean resource across 3 wells. The 3D seismic program in our Australian Block in the Ceduna basin is now over 50% complete and we expect to finish up in the near term.
Looking at the rest of our 2015 program. We plan to drill up to 4 wells in the Gulf, testing 620 million barrels equivalent of gross mean resource. We will drill 5 wells in Southeast Asia, in Malaysia and Brunei, and test 350 million gross mean resource.
Overall, the 2015 program will test a net risk mean resource of near 190 million-barrel equivalent worth $266 million in exploration drilling capital.
As we look at production in 2015. We're guiding to a 2015 production range of 195,000 to 207,000 barrel equivalent per day in that year. The midpoint of this range, or 201,000, would place us with a slight growth over the 2014 pro forma, with a 33% budget reduction in 2014 to '15, including a 46% reduction in Eagle Ford Shale capital year-on-year.
As we look in 2015 post of sell-down, we have both near-quarter items and entire year items further impacting production. As a starting point, our fourth quarter average of near 259,000 equivalent would be lowered to 231,000. And the 2014 annual production of near 226,000 barrel equivalent per day is adjusted to just under 200,000, both on a pro forma basis as sell-down in Malaysia.
Looking at the first quarter, we see Sabah being higher, with the ramp-up in the Kakap-Gumusut main project and new wells coming on at Kikeh. In the Gulf of Mexico, planned outages at non-operated Habanero and our Medusa field impact quarterly production rates. The rest of the decrease is attributed to assumed lower gas nominations in Sarawak and rig cuts for capital reduction starting to impact our North American onshore business.
Typically, the fourth quarter is a high production period with no planned turnarounds or outages scheduled. Over the course of the full year, we have planned outages for maintenance work typically scheduled during better weather in the middle of the year. In addition, we contained a risk reduction and nomination levels of both operated and the non-operated facilities that we do not control.
Moving to the full year. Both Kakap-Gumusut and Siakap North-Petai will contribute for the entire year when compared to 2014. Full year contribution from Dalmatian and the mid-year startup of Medusa expansion add to this year, but is offset with the expected shut-in of the Mondo field, along with planned outages and field declines. Year-on-year, we see a slight increase in Montney production despite a falloff from the quarter high in 2014 in fourth quarter. We're seeing production decline in our heavy oil at Seal as we shut in uneconomic wells at this lower price level.
As to liquidity we're starting off 2015 in very good financial shape, with our balance sheet and cash positions bolstered by the recent  sell-down of our Malaysia business. We are well positioned with flexibility and optionality to carry out our 2015 plans of intention to operate in capital cost reductions, maintain the current dividend, manage our U.S. cash position, take advantage of opportunities that may arise during this downturn and increased our activity level when prices recover.
As to takeaway as we look back on 2014, we impacted our shareholders positively with share buybacks as well as increasing our dividend. We again increased and replaced production now for 9 years in a row. Our reserve replacement history continues at over 180%. I feel the current downturn in prices and associated capital reductions gives us a recalibration point to production. And we plan to take advantage of this change, with recent results showing improvement in meeting production guidance.
Our onshore North American business has become very significant, representing near 45% of our 2014 production levels. Our early entry at low cost in Eagle Ford Shale will now show the value of the play going forward. Our plan is to maintain our Eagle Ford Shale 2014 production level flat in 2015, with a 46% reduction in capital spending year-on-year. We've made many changes in senior personnel and process in our exploration business. We are confident in our plans to test near 190 million barrels equivalent of this year's program as well as evaluate new opportunities that will become available in this downturn.
We went into the current price collapse with a cash flow per barrel advantage to our peers, which should continue. Late 2013, we set out to mark the value of our Malaysia business and removed some concentration risk as well as hopefully do further portfolio optimization work. The timely closing positions us very well to maintain flexibility from a balance sheet perspective. Our company has survived prior price drops with a conservative balance sheet, diverse producing assets, an exploration base growth strategy that stood the test of time. I will now be glad to take your questions. Thank you."

I look for cost calibration to go very quickly there. We are seeing progress and got to 10% on cost reductions probably quicker than anticipated, heading toward 15% to 20% now.

I think there are still a lot of high rate contracted rigs out there in the 550 range. There's many of them. Almost all of the new builds have contracts at high rates. They are stacked. Let's say, one bad technology rig that can do the job, that you can get for 300s. I don't think -- with the big pullback in CapEx this year, I think those would be one-off opportunities for the drillers in my view, I don't see it as to be a big impact. I think it will be a big impact on development. I think you'll see people that hit on exploration wells, unable to sanction. We'll have lower drilling cost, maybe $150,000 a day per rig. So it will be very significant. I don't see it being that significant for me over the next couple of years, but it will be very significant for development. I think that -- it's my personal opinion on this, but this cost going down issue is more onshore-focused at present, massive numbers of rigs. I think that will be the first shoe to drop as to big lowering of expenses. The offshore is controlled by, in my view, larger service providers, more high-tech Christmas trees, completions, gravel packs. I believe it's controlled by less people, too. Two of those people have recently merged, as we know. I don't see the big pullback in that because they won't have the mom-and-pop competition that you would have to the super major service onshore. But a lot of these boats, along with the rigs, it may take a couple years for that to work. But that's -- it's just not as significant as I think you may be thinking, Brian, in my opinion."

We could drill -- we could absolutely afford to add 13,000 equivalent production if we wanted to, I just chose not to. So that's the first step. We have probably 4,000 barrels of shut-ins around the world, turnarounds of various kinds across 10 different places: Kikeh, twice this year; Sarawak gas onshore shutting down for some regulatory things; and all those things. So if I give you a breakdown here further, I mean, at 12,500 of CapEx, 7,500 of Malaysia assumed. Another thing is, we had a very good quarter in the assumption of these gas nominations are probably close to 280 million gross, we have 240 million in our budget with some shutdowns coming. So 12,500 CapEx, 7,500 on nominations and downtime, including the risking I've spoken to many times, and have North America offshore, we have Medusa coming on and offset by outages at Habanero, Medusa. Mondo is a place that makes about 2,000 barrel equivalent for a very long time. Now the field is supposed to go off-line from the sub-service perspective and it just never dies. We have no DD&A there. It's been one of the greatest gas fields of all times, but it's going to die this year at some point, I don't know exactly when. So that's 8,000, and have a 1,000 on Syncrude risking because they have maintenance, and things they didn't have in the fourth quarter. So just not a fourth quarter to a year company, this is not the way we roll here. If you look back at the history of Murphy, I would bet you that the fourth quarter is high every single time because the weather is too bad to work on anything."

Excluding discontinued operations in the U.K., our income from continuing operations amounted to $3.5 million in the first quarter of 2015, $0.02 per diluted share, again compared to the first quarter of 2014 of $169.3 million profit or $0.93 per diluted share.
The first quarter results from continuing operations for 2015 included a gain of $199.5 million on the sale of an additional interest in our Malaysian business. It also include a $32.5 million of estimated after-tax cost to remediate a condensate pipeline leak or leaks in Alberta, Canada. These and other items affecting comparability of earnings between periods are listed in the schedule of adjusted earnings included as part of our earnings release. All of these figures in this schedule or on an after-tax basis.
Earnings in the 2015 first quarter were negatively impacted by significantly lower realized sales prices for crude oil, natural gas liquids in North American natural gas, the effects of which were partially offset by higher production and sales levels. The company's average realized crude oil sales price fell more than $49 per barrel, which equates to 51% reduction, while U.S. natural gas liquid prices were almost $22 per barrel lower, which was 63% reduction. Natural gas prices also softened in the first quarter of '15 compared to the prior year's quarter, it dropped by $1.69 per Mcf in North America for a decline of 41%.
Crude oil and gas liquids production in the 2015 quarter was 9%, above 2014 levels, primarily due to drilling activities in the Eagle Ford Shale and despite the combined 30% sale of interest in Malaysia between late 2014 and 2015.
Crude oil and gas liquids production averaged approximately 150,800 barrels per day in the '15 quarter compared to approximately 137,800 barrels per day in the prior year first quarter.
Natural gas volumes for the company were 424 million cubic feet per day in the '15 quarter compared to 400 million cubic feet per day in '15, with the 6% increase primarily due to higher production from the Dalmatian Field in the Gulf of Mexico, the Eagle Ford Shale area in Texas and the Tupper West -- in the Tupper area in Western Canada. 
Natural gas production in Malaysia fell in 2015 primarily due to a lower net entitlement following the sale of our 30% interest. The lower postsale net entitlement percentage reduced 2015 quarter 1 production by approximately 25,500 BOEs per day.
Our corporate segment reflected a loss of $15.2 million in the first quarter of '15, as compared to net cost of $41.3 million in the fourth quarter of -- in the first quarter of '14. Decreased net corporate costs in '15 primarily relate to favorable results from transactions denominated in foreign currencies, particularly associated with the weaker Malaysian ringgit.
Capital expenditures for continuing operations for 2015 in the first quarter totaled $613 million, a 31% decline from the same period in '14. For 2015, we continue to project our capital expenditure spend at $2.3 billion. And as of March 31, 2015, Murphy's long-term debt amounted to approximately $2.6 billion or 24% of capital employed.
Moving into the operating comments. This is the first reporting period under the recent severely reduced oil price environment. We are of course seeing major impacts on our business. Murphy is able to withstand this price pullback better than many in our industry due to a low net debt, our solid balance sheet, a diverse oil portfolio and previously announced capital reductions. We paid our normal quarterly dividend in March, and we have maintained our dividend with board approval for the next dividend payment on the 1st of June. Based on current prices, our dividend is approaching a 3% yield. We were also pleased to complete the timely sale down in Malaysia with a January close on sale of a 10% interest as the second phase of our overall sell down of 30%.
With our balance sheet flexibility, we're focused on opportunities, both onshore and offshore, that may be available following the collapse of crude oil prices. In the U.K., it appears that we are finally coming to an end with an agreement in place to sell the remaining portion of our downstream assets. We continue to add our offshore -- to our offshore exploration portfolio in an effort to build more optionality into our program. We added a new block in the Vulcan Sub-Basin offshore Australia, plus another new Block in deepwater offshore Sarawak Malaysia. In addition, we participated in the March Gulf of Mexico Central lease sale and submitted a high bid on 5 new blocks. We have no well commitments on the Australia and Gulf of Mexico acreage. We are progressing our low risk Deepwater Gulf of Mexico projects at Medusa and Kodiak. Our Eagle Ford Shale business was able to maintain production in the first quarter even as we pulled back rigs under our capital reduction plan. We delivered 45 producing wells in the Eagle Ford in the first quarter and are down to 4 rigs operating at this time.
Our oil-weighted diverse portfolio of assets is a benefit to our company and is highlighted by the recent widening spread between Brent and WTI as nearly 60% of our first quarter production was related to Brent LLS. While that widening differential is helpful, our realized first quarter 2015 oil prices were 50% below prices a year earlier. First quarter realized oil prices in our Malaysia business averaged near $55 per barrel for Block K and $49 per barrel for Sarawak with oil indexed SK Gas averaging $4.50 per Mcf.
Moving to the U.S. Eagle Ford Shale oil prices were near $44 a barrel in Q1, some $34 per barrel below the fourth quarter of '14. Our realized oil prices in the Gulf of Mexico averaged near $46 per barrel, keeping pace with the drop in LLS.
In Canada, Syncrude was close to $45 per barrel and sale was just under $20 per barrel and this heavy oil was particularly impacted by the oil price pullback in the first quarter.
Our global lease operating expenses for Q1 2015, excluding Syncrude, is near $9.70 per barrel of oil equivalent, showing an improvement of 18% from the first quarter of 2014 and 5% below the fourth quarter of 2014.
We are pleased with the overall effort the company's making on cost reduction, but this effort has just started to take hold. We expect to start seeing the results of our cost reductions in the remaining quarters.
The Eagle Ford Shale carried some delayed cost from 2014 in the first quarter, but based on both bender price concessions and improved operating efficiencies, we are working hard to reduce these costs going forward and we expect to see lease operating expenses driven down toward the $10 per barrel range in Eagle Ford as the year progresses.
Cash flow per barrel metrics have been greatly reduced with the collapse in oil prices. However, we went into the collapse with an above average cash flow per barrel metric versus our peer group, and we perceive this as a continuing advantage for us going forward.
We are approaching our cost reduction efforts in 2 phases. The first phase was direct negotiation with our vendors and suppliers to reduce their cost to supply goods and services. We have seen good initial results with overall operating costs in the Eagle Ford Shale coming down in the 20% range. In terms of capital cost, we are seeing approximately 15% cost reductions to drilling complete in Eagle Ford well. That we feel there's more room to improve here with efficiencies and further cost reductions. The pace of cost reductions for drilling and completions is certainly faster in the onshore business, such as Eagle Ford, compared to the onshore -- offshore.
We are entering the second phase of our efforts with plans to rebid vendor contracts and key spending sectors to further reduce costs. This effort will be ongoing through the second and third quarter of this year.
First quarter production averaged 221,550 barrels of oil equivalent per day, slightly exceeding our guidance of 221,000 even barrels of oil equivalent per day, despite unplanned downtimes related to an advancement of a turnaround in Syncrude as well as downtime associated with our lower valued Block K associated gas. We also saw some unplanned downtime in the Gulf of Mexico. We had higher-than-planned production levels in the Eagle Ford Shale in Montney as well as in our new Sarawak projects, which are performing very nicely today.
Looking ahead to the second quarter, production guidance remains on target at 197,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. The decrease from the first quarter is attributed to various planned shut-ins for maintenance work across our offshore operations and Syncrude. Major shut-ins for planned maintenance are common for us in the middle part of the year. The second quarter planned outages account for approximately 14,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the quarter and some of these outages are expected to carry in the quarter 3. In addition, Eagle Ford Shale production is expected to start to decline in response to the 46% capital spending reduction this year.
We have derisked some of the downtime in the second quarter as our Sarawak operations were recently down for 11 days and the work has been completed on time in April. We have also completed some planned annual downtime at the nonoperated Field in the Gulf of Mexico. Our full year guidance remains unchanged at a range of 195,000 to 207,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.
In Malaysia, the timely phase sell down of an overall 30% of our oil and gas assets was completed in the first quarter. We had previously sold 20% of our interest in the fourth quarter of 2014. The second phase was completed in January by selling an additional 10% of our interest, and we booked an after-tax gain of $199.5 million from the sale in the first quarter of 2015.
Production offshore Sabah averaged near 34,400 barrels of oil equivalent per day for the first quarter with 88% of that liquids.
The Kakap-Gumusut main project where we held an 8.6% working interest in First Oil was achieved in October 2014 has demonstrated excellent performance, with production ramping up into the first quarter. Gross production have reached near 150,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in March, with peak gross rates near 160,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.
In shallow waters offshore Sarawak, gas production for the first quarter was 112 million cubic feet per day and liquids production was near 18,500 barrels of oil per day.
We completed the first phase of development drilling in the South Acis field comprised of 14 producing wells. The post drill results are showing volumes 70% higher than the sanction volume. We just completed the 5 well drilling program targeting gas in balloon. Well costs were approximately 30% below estimate and the initial well costs there look positive with net pay 35% higher than prognosis. These new Sarawak development are robust in this low price environment as we benefit from our existing infrastructure in the region.
Moving to the global offshore business. Gulf of Mexico productions for the quarter was over 24,400 barrels of oil equivalent per day, with 61% liquids. We continue to progress our 2 well subsea expansion project at the Medusa field where we operate at a 60% working interest. Both wells have been drilled to plan and subsea flow lines side facilities and installation of the final jumpers are complete. One well is scheduled to flow first oil in early may, one month ahead of our original expectation.
The nonoperating Kodiak development where we held a 29% working interest is a 2-well tieback to the third-party operated Devil's Tower. First well has been drilled to plan and completion work is ongoing. Topsides facility work is scheduled to begin in May with subsea installation work to begin in the third quarter. We anticipate first oil in the first quarter of 2016.
Both projects are solid investments in this low price environment with an anticipated point forward rate of return of 10% at process near $30 per barrel.
In Western Canada, our natural gas production from the Montney in the first quarter of 2015 was 187 million cubic feet per day, relatively flat with the fourth quarter of 2014. We completed 8 new wells in the recent quarter and, as planned, released all of our rigs in February. We see strong well performance from our new completion techniques. Results to date indicate higher cumulative production and wellhead pressures, pointing to higher estimated ultimate recovery from the wells.
At the Seal field, as previously mentioned, the company reported an after-tax expense of $32.5 million in the first quarter related to estimated costs associated with the condensate distribution line failure or failures in a remote area of Northern Alberta. The source of the leak or leaks is isolated, the area of impact is contained and remediation activities are ongoing. The company is cooperating with the regulator on remediation and incident investigations.
In the Eagle Ford Shale. First quarter 2015 net production, which was comprised of 90% liquids, averaged 64,200 barrels of oil equivalent per day, relatively flat to the fourth quarter of 2014. Production levels held up in the first quarter as we brought 45 new wells online. As planned, we reduced our rig count to 4 in the quarter and expect to remain at that level for the remainder of the year. We are currently using 2 completion spreads with plans to drop to 1 spread in the second quarter. We are on target to bring on approximately 118 wells this year as the pace of wells coming on online decreases over the remainder of the year as planned.
Production in the second quarter of 2015 is estimated to average 59,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, with the '15 production outlook flat year-on-year to 2014 even with a 40% reduction in capital spending this year. We are currently focused on allocating capital within our field development plans as well as reducing operating expenses.
The long-term value of our Eagle Ford Shale position is bolstered by our early entry into the play at an average lease cost of approximately $2,000 per acre, as well as our high oil percentage located near the Gulf of Mexico. We have over 2,000 potential well locations remaining and now estimate the total recoverable resource at near 750 million BOEs, up from 690 million BOE at the end of 2013. In the last 5 years, we have placed over 550 wells online in the Eagle Ford Shale. We continue to see positive results with our well completion and management strategies.
The slide represented here is an example in our largest acreage area of and our other operated areas of Karnes and Catarina look very similar. We are among the leaders in both management of decline rates and productivity per completed laterals foot. We see positive results with our downspacing in staggered well spacing pilots across all the play. We currently have been 254 wells producing at 40-acre spacing and 23 wells in the Upper Eagle Ford. We are incorporating staggered well pad design in the future development areas.
Move onto our exploration. Murphy is an exploration company with a strong ability to execute projects in both the offshore and onshore. While our exploration results have been disappointing, we are very focused on riding this shift. We have made significant changes to the team and organization to improve our skill sets and processes. Building a high-grade exploration portfolio is a key goal. We have sharpened our global focus regions to strengthen our expertise in key basis of interest.
In the Gulf of Mexico, we added 5 blocks at the March Central lease sale and are now evaluating opportunities in the Wilcox play in Mexico bid rounds.
In Southeast Asia and Australia, we recently added a block in the Vulcan Sub-Basin offshore Northern and Australia and the new deepwater Block at Sarawak. We believe we're on the right path forward here to deliver success in our exploration program.
As to our remaining exploration drilling program for 2015, in the Gulf of Mexico, we have 45 wells scheduled for the rest of this year. Our next exploration well is an amplitude supported prospect at Sea Eagle, with an estimated gross mean resource of 100 million BOE. The well is expected to spud in mid-May.
This will be followed by 2 lower risk wells at Dalmatian and Thunderbird. Both wells are near infrastructure, with Dalmatian being a subsea tieback to our existing Dalmatian operation and Thunderbird a tieback to Thunder Hawk.
In Malaysia, we have 4 exploration wells on the schedule for the second half of the year. 2 of these wells are aimed to provide additional resources to our very successful shallow water Sarawak development activities. We have 1 well in Block H Malaysia where we are participating in a Floating LNG project. And the fourth well is an exploration well to be drilled on our recently acquired SK 2C Block. We are excited about this area as Malaysia explorations back in view for Murphy. The new focus here between Malaysia and Vietnam is prone for high-yield gas and Murphy's advantaged with our robust gas infrastructure system. We then plan to finish off our year with nonoperated appraisal well to our gas discoveries in Brunei.
At the end of February, we entered Block 2C in deep water Sarawak as operator with a 50% working interest, where we plan to spud the East well in the third quarter. This 300 million barrel of oil equivalent estimated gross mean resource opportunity is targeting oil condensate and gas and offsets the existing discovery. We have identified Merapuh P10 and new Central as the first 2 wells to be drilled in Block SK 314A, testing Miocene stack sands targeting oil downdip from our existing fields. If successful, these near field low-risk prospects carry high-value by feeding into our existing infrastructure in the shallow water Sarawak area. That from my prospect, with an estimated gross mean resource of 170 Bcf, is targeting additional gas resources for our Block H Floating LNG development. This prospect is similar to the previous 9 discoveries in the play.
As the guidance, our second quarter production is set at 197,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Our full year production and capital guidance is unchanged at 195,000 to 207,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day per production and $2.3 billion capital spend.
In wrapping up, I'll comment on a few takeaways. In exploration, we're making progress with significant changes in the team in adding our technical expertise. We are sharpening our focus down in the fewer areas. We're moving to lower risk opportunities that are value added while we build our prospect portfolio with our new team. Our solid financial position bolstered by the timely sell down in Malaysia has Murphy well-positioned to carry out our exploration and development plans and provides optionality to explore business development opportunities. Our low risk Deepwater Gulf of Mexico subsea development projects are on time and budget from an execution standpoint, and their returns can withstand the current price level. Our value added Sarawak oil and gas projects continue to deliver for us, with recent drilling successes at both South Acis and Belum.
Similar to our peers, we are focused on cost reductions and we'll see the results of our efforts over the course of the year.
Thank you for your attention, and we will now take your questions."

And we have to start delivering on results and we understand that. As you mentioned, we have made significant changes to the organization, the staff, the leadership and really, there's 3 key areas of interest, broken down into people, processes and portfolio. People, it's almost a complete change out of the exploration team, with over 1/2 of our technical geoscientists, which is in the number greater than 50, with a company less than 2 years. So we've made -- it's not just the people, it's the certain skill sets that these the technical staff that we brought on board have, some specific basin modelers. We've got regional, a lot of key gaps that we fill with the technical staff. So moving on to your question of the processes, it's a technical rigor and risking process that we're using and it's a global process, where we're using the same yardstick across the entire globe of all the prospects. We also have a separate technical assurance section within our exploration group now that looks critically at risking and as I mentioned, we have the additional technical staff. On the portfolio, as you saw on the slides and as John's comments, we've taken our focus significantly. So we have more people without technical expertise looking at a smaller number of basins.

In fact, it's first of a kind to check the risking of our which is the highest risk on this Miocene Amplitude. We have a group in our KL office that's worked globally on our new Block. It's Sarawak SK 2C where we think we've derisked this and we're pretty excited about both of those prospects, which are kind of needle moving size. The other part of our strategy is moving to some lower risk opportunities beyond those 2 wells in the Gulf of Mexico that includes Thunderbird, where we're sidetracking in existing discovery up bit, low-risk prospect which can deliver production in 2016. And we also have the Dalmatian area, which are low-risk Upper Miocene amplitudes. So while we're doing those and those are drill and complete operations gives us time to further work our portfolio, further high-grade and make decisions on where we go forward there. Hopefully, that helps."

We see additional opportunity to I guess to start out to reduce the capital cost further on the drilling and completion side with nearing 25% towards the end of the year, and doing that through both working on the service and material side and retendering those services along with continued improvement and efficiencies, operational efficiencies in the field. So we continue to improve reducing the days required to drill the wells. We are down now to our pacesetter wells in, for example, the Catarina area are 7 days. So those savings are going to continue on in the future. And we expect through technology to continue to drive cost down through efficiency. For the service and material side, that's a hard question to answer. Depends on what level of activity returns. We are however renegotiating contracts on our rigs and our frac services for extended periods of time, so taking the savings now and adding additional time to our contracts. And for some of our units, we're going to wait until the contract expire and then renegotiate. So we expect the cost will not approach what they did in the previous development stages of the Eagle Ford unless we see oil go back to 100 plus dollars."

Murphy's consolidated results in the first quarter of 2015 were a loss of $14.4 million, $0.08 per diluted share, compared to a profit of $155.3 million or $0.85 per share a year ago. Excluding discontinued operations in the U.K. our income from continuing operations amounted to $3.5 million in the first quarter of 2015, $0.02 per diluted share, again compared to the first quarter of 2014 of $169.3 million profit or $0.93 per diluted share.
The first quarter results from continuing operations for 2015 included a gain of $199.5 million on the sale of an additional interest in our Malaysian business. It also included a $32.5 million of estimated after-tax cost to remediate a condensate pipeline leak or leaks in Alberta, Canada. These and other items affecting comparability of earnings between periods are listed in the schedule of adjusted earnings, included as part of our earnings release. All of these figures in this schedule are on an after-tax basis.
Earnings in the 2015 first quarter were negatively impacted by significantly lower realized sales prices for crude oil, natural gas liquids and North American natural gas, the effects of which were partially offset by higher production and sales levels. The company's average realized crude oil sales price fell more than $49 per barrel, which equates to 51% reduction, while U.S. natural gas liquid prices were almost $22 per barrel lower, which was 63% reduction. Natural gas prices also softened in the first quarter of '15, compared to the prior year's quarter. It dropped by $1.69 per Mcf in North America for a decline of 41%.
Crude oil and gas liquids production in the 2015 quarter was 9%, above 2014 levels, primarily due to drilling activities in the Eagle Ford Shale and despite the combined 30% sale of interest in Malaysia between late 2014 and 2015.
Crude oil and gas liquids production averaged approximately 150,800 barrels per day in the '15 quarter, compared to approximately 137,800 barrels per day in the prior year first quarter.
Natural gas volumes for the company were 424 million cubic feet per day in the '15 quarter compared to 400 million cubic feet per day in '15, with the 6% increase primarily due to higher production from the Dalmatian Field in the Gulf of Mexico, the Eagle Ford Shale area in Texas and the Tupper West --I'm sorry, in the Tupper area in Western Canada. 
Natural gas production in Malaysia fell in 2015 primarily due to a lower net entitlement following the sale of our 30% interest. The lower postsale net entitlement percentage reduced 2015 quarter 1 production by approximately 25,500 BOEs per day.
Our corporate segment reflected a loss of $15.2 million in the first quarter of '15, as compared to net cost of $41.3 million in the fourth quarter of -- in the first quarter of '14. Decreased net corporate costs in '15 primarily relate to favorable results from transactions denominated in foreign currencies, particularly associated with the weaker Malaysian ringgit.
Capital expenditures for continuing operations for 2015 in the first quarter totaled $613 million, a 31% decline from the same period in '14. For 2015, we continue to project our capital expenditure spend at $2.3 billion. And as of March 31, 2015, Murphy's long-term debt amounted to approximately $2.6 billion or 24% of capital employed.
Moving into the operating comments. This is the first reporting period under the recent severely reduced oil price environment. We are, of course, seeing major impacts on our business. Murphy is able to withstand this price pullback better than many in our industry due to our low net debt, our solid balance sheet, a diverse oil portfolio and previously announced capital reductions. We paid our normal quarterly dividend in March, and we have maintained our dividend with board approval for the next dividend payment on the 1st of June. Based on current prices, our dividend is approaching a 3% yield. We were also pleased to complete the timely sale down in Malaysia with a January close on sale of a 10% interest, as the second phase of our overall sell down of 30%.
With our balance sheet flexibility, we're focused on opportunities, both onshore and offshore, that may be available following the collapse of crude oil prices. In the U.K., it appears that we are finally coming to an end with an agreement in place to sell the remaining portion of our downstream assets. We continue to add our offshore -- to our offshore exploration portfolio in an effort to build more optionality into our program. We added a new block in the Vulcan Sub-Basin offshore Australia, plus another new Block in deepwater offshore Sarawak Malaysia. In addition, we participated in the March Gulf of Mexico Central lease sale and submitted the high bid on 5 new blocks. We have no well commitments on the Australia and Gulf of Mexico acreage. We are progressing our low risk deepwater Gulf of Mexico projects at Medusa and Kodiak. Our Eagle Ford Shale business was able to maintain production in the first quarter even as we pulled back rigs under our capital reduction plan. We delivered 45 producing wells in the Eagle Ford in the first quarter and are down to 4 rigs operating at this time.
Our oil-weighted diverse portfolio of assets is a benefit to our company and is highlighted by the recent widening spread between Brent and WTI, as nearly 60% of our first quarter production was weighted to Brent and LLS. While that widening differential is helpful, our realized first quarter 2015 oil prices were 50% below prices a year earlier. First quarter realized oil prices in our Malaysia business averaged near $55 per barrel for Block K and $49 per barrel for Sarawak, with oil indexed SK Gas averaging $4.50 per Mcf.
Moving to the U.S. Eagle Ford Shale oil prices were near $44 a barrel in Q1, some $34 per barrel below the fourth quarter of '14. Our realized oil prices in the Gulf of Mexico averaged near $46 per barrel, keeping pace with the drop in LLS.
In Canada, Syncrude was close to $45 per barrel and Seal was just under $20 per barrel, as heavy oil was particularly impacted by the oil price pullback in the first quarter.
Our global lease operating expenses for Q1 2015, excluding Syncrude, is near $9.70 per barrel of oil equivalent, showing an improvement of 18% from the first quarter of 2014 and 5% below the fourth quarter of 2014.
We are pleased with the overall effort the company is making on cost reduction, but this effort has just started to take hold. We expect to start seeing the results of our cost reductions in the remaining quarters.
The Eagle Ford Shale carried some delayed cost from 2014 in the first quarter, but based on both vendor price concessions and improved operating efficiencies, we are working hard to reduce these costs going forward. And we expect to see lease operating expenses driven down toward the $10 per barrel range in Eagle Ford as the year progresses.
Cash flow per barrel metrics have been greatly reduced with the collapse in oil prices. However, we went into the collapse with an above average cash flow per barrel metric versus our peer group, and we perceive this as a continuing advantage for us going forward.
We are approaching our cost reduction efforts in 2 phases. The first phase was direct negotiation with our vendors and suppliers to reduce their cost to supply goods and services. We have seen good initial results with overall operating costs in the Eagle Ford Shale coming down in the 20% range. In terms of capital cost, we are seeing approximately 15% cost reductions to drill and complete an Eagle Ford well. But we feel there's more room to improve here with efficiencies and further cost reductions. The pace of cost reductions for drilling and completions is certainly faster in the onshore business, such as Eagle Ford, compared to the onshore -- offshore.
We are entering the second phase of our efforts with plans to rebid vendor contracts in key spending sectors to further reduce costs. This effort will be ongoing through the second and third quarter of this year.
First quarter production averaged 221,550 barrels of oil equivalent per day, slightly exceeding our guidance of 221,000 even barrels of oil equivalent per day, despite unplanned downtimes relating to an advancement of a turnaround of Syncrude as well as downtime associated with our lower valued Block K associated gas. We also saw some unplanned downtime in the Gulf of Mexico. We had higher-than-planned production levels in the Eagle Ford Shale in Montney as well as in our new Sarawak projects, which are performing very nicely to date.
Looking ahead to the second quarter, production guidance remains on target at 197,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. The decrease in the first quarter is attributed to various planned shut-ins for maintenance work across our offshore operations and Syncrude. Major shut-ins for planned maintenance are common for us in the middle part of the year. These second quarter planned outages account for approximately 14,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the quarter, and some of these outages are expected to carry into quarter 3. In addition, Eagle Ford Shale production is expected to start to decline in response to the 46% capital spending reduction this year.
We have derisked some of the downtime in the second quarter as our Sarawak operations were recently down for 11 days, and the work has been completed on time in April. We have also completed some planned annual downtime at the nonoperated Habanero Field in the Gulf of Mexico. Our full year guidance remains unchanged at a range of 195,000 to 207,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.
In Malaysia, the timely phase sell-down of an overall 30% of our oil and gas assets was completed in the first quarter. We had previously sold 20% of our interest in the fourth quarter of 2014. The second phase was completed in January by selling an additional 10% of our interest, and we booked an after-tax gain of $199.5 million from the sale in the first quarter of 2015.
Production offshore Sabah averaged near 34,400 barrels of oil equivalent per day for the first quarter with 88% of that liquids.
The Kakap-Gumusut main project, where we hold an 8.6% working interest in First Oil was achieved in October 2014, has demonstrated excellent performance, with production ramping up into the first quarter. Gross production averaged near 150,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in March, with peak gross rates near 160,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.
In shallow waters offshore Sarawak, gas production for the first quarter was 112 million cubic feet per day and liquids production was near 18,500 barrels of oil per day.
We completed the first phase of development drilling in the South Acis field comprised of 14 producing wells. The post-drill results are showing volumes 70% higher than the sanctioned volume. We just completed a 5-well drilling program targeting gas at Belum. Well costs were approximately 30% below estimate, and the initial well costs there look positive with net pay 35% higher than prognosis. These new Sarawak developments are robust in this low-priced environment, as we benefit from our existing infrastructure in the region.
Moving to the global offshore business. Gulf of Mexico productions for the quarter was over 24,400 barrels of oil equivalent per day, with 61% liquids. We continue to progress our 2-well subsea expansion project at the Medusa field, where we operate at a 60% working interest. Both wells have been drilled to plan and subsea flow lines, topsides facilities and installation of the final jumpers are complete. One well is scheduled to flow first oil in early may, one month ahead of our original expectation.
The nonoperated Kodiak development, where we hold a 29% working interest, is a 2-well tieback to the third-party operated Devil's Tower. First well has been drilled to plan, and completion work is ongoing. Topsides facility work is scheduled to begin in May, with subsea installation work to begin in the third quarter. We anticipate first oil in the first quarter of 2016.
Both projects are solid investments in this low price environment, with an anticipated point forward rate of return of 10% at process near $30 per barrel.
In Western Canada, our natural gas production from the Montney in the first quarter of 2015 was 187 million cubic feet per day, relatively flat with the fourth quarter of 2014. We completed 8 new wells in the recent quarter and, as planned, released all of our rigs in February. We see strong well performance from our new completion techniques. Results to date indicate higher cumulative production and wellhead pressures, pointing to higher estimated ultimate recovery from the wells.
At the Seal field, as previously mentioned, the company reported an after-tax expense of $32.5 million in the first quarter related to estimated costs associated with the condensate distribution line failure or failures in a remote area of Northern Alberta. The source of the leak or leaks is isolated, the area of impact is contained and remediation activities are ongoing. The company is cooperating with the regulator on remediation and incident investigations.
In the Eagle Ford Shale. First quarter 2015 net production, which was comprised of 90% liquids, averaged 64,200 barrels of oil equivalent per day, relatively flat to the fourth quarter of 2014. Production levels held up in the first quarter, as we brought 45 new wells online. As planned, we reduced our rig count to 4 in the quarter and expect to remain at that level for the remainder of the year. We are currently using 2 completion spreads with plans to drop to 1 spread in the second quarter. We are on target to bring on approximately 118 wells this year, as the pace of wells coming online decreases over the remainder of the year as planned.
Production in the second quarter of 2015 is estimated to average 59,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, with the '15 production outlook flat year-on-year to 2014 even with a 40% reduction in capital spending this year. We are currently focused on allocating capital within our field development plans as well as reducing operating expenses.
The long-term value of our Eagle Ford Shale position is bolstered by our early entry into the play at an average lease cost of approximately $2,000 per acre, as well as our high oil percentage located near the Gulf of Mexico. We have over 2,000 potential well locations remaining and now estimate the total recoverable resource at near 750 million BOEs, up from 690 million BOE at the end of 2013. In the last 5 years, we have placed over 550 wells online in the Eagle Ford Shale. We continue to see positive results with our well completion and choke management strategies.
The slide represented here is an example in our largest acreage area of Tilden, and our other operated areas of Karnes and Catarina look very similar. We are among the leaders in both management of decline rates and productivity per completed laterals foot. We see positive results with our downspacing in staggered well spacing pilots across all the play. We currently have 254 wells producing at 40-acre spacing and 23 wells in the Upper Eagle Ford. We are incorporating staggered well pad design in the future development areas.
Move onto our exploration. Murphy is an exploration company with a strong ability to execute projects in both the offshore and onshore. While our exploration results have been disappointing, we are very focused on riding this shift. We have made significant changes to the team and organization to improve our skill sets and processes. Building a high-grade exploration portfolio is a key goal. We have sharpened our global focus regions to strengthen our expertise in key basins of interest.
In the Gulf of Mexico, we added 5 blocks at the March Central lease sale and are now evaluating opportunities in the Wilcox play in Mexico bid rounds.
In Southeast Asia and Australia, we recently added a new block in the Vulcan Sub-Basin offshore Northern Australia and a new deepwater block at Sarawak. We believe we're on the right path forward here to deliver success in our exploration program.
As to our remaining exploration drilling program for 2015, in the Gulf of Mexico, we have 45 wells scheduled for the rest of this year. Our next exploration well is an amplitude supported prospect at Sea Eagle, with an estimated gross mean resource of 100 million BOE. The well is expected to spud in mid-May.
This will be followed by 2 lower risk wells at Dalmatian and Thunderbird. Both wells are near infrastructure, with Dalmatian being a subsea tieback to our existing Dalmatian operation and Thunderbird a tieback to Thunder Hawk.
In Malaysia, we have 4 exploration wells on the schedule for the second half of the year. 2 of these wells are aimed to provide additional resources to our very successful shallow water Sarawak development activities. We have 1 well in Block H Malaysia where we are participating in a Floating LNG project. And the fourth well is an exploration well to be drilled on our recently acquired SK 2C Block. We are excited about this area as Malaysia exploration is back in view for Murphy. The new focus area between Malaysia and Vietnam is prone for high-yield gas and Murphy's advantaged with our robust gas infrastructure system. We then plan to finish off our year with nonoperated appraisal well to our gas discoveries in Brunei.
At the end of February, we entered Block 2C in deep water Sarawak as operator with a 50% working interest, where we plan to spud the Paus East well in the third quarter. This 300 million barrel of oil equivalent estimated gross mean resource opportunity is targeting oil condensate and gas and offsets the existing Paus discovery. We have identified Merapuh P10 and Yu Central as the first 2 wells to be drilled in Block SK 314A, testing Miocene stack sands targeting oil downdip from our existing fields. If successful, these near field low-risk prospects carry high value by feeding into our existing infrastructure in the shallow water Sarawak area. The Permai prospect with an estimated gross mean resource of 170 Bcf, is targeting additional gas resources for our Block H Floating LNG development. This prospect is similar to the previous 9 discoveries in the play.
As to guidance, our second quarter production is set at 197,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Our full year production and capital guidance is unchanged at 195,000 to 207,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day per production and $2.3 billion capital spend.
In wrapping up, I'll comment on a few takeaways. In exploration, we're making progress with significant changes in the team and adding our technical expertise. We are sharpening our focus down into fewer areas, and we're moving to lower risk opportunities that are value-added while we build our prospect portfolio with our new team. Our solid financial position bolstered by the timely sell-down in Malaysia has Murphy well-positioned to carry out our exploration and development plans and provides optionality to explore business development opportunities. Our low risk deepwater Gulf of Mexico subsea development projects are on time and budget from an execution standpoint, and their returns can withstand the current price level. Our value-added Sarawak oil and gas projects continue to deliver for us, with recent drilling successes at both South Acis and Belum.
Similar to our peers, we are focused on cost reductions, and we'll see the results of our efforts over the course of the year.
Thank you for your attention, and we will now take your questions."

We are not -- we also say though that we're not going to do any deal just to do a deal. I mean, what we are interested in is opportunities that advance our position in various ways. So in North American onshore, our most likely interest would be in some bolt-on opportunity around the Eagle Ford or, of course, good acreage in nearby areas such as the Permian would also be attractive. We're seeing, Leo, a lot of ground floor opportunities available in the offshore business as well. Capital constraints among industry members are causing though many people to look for partners where they can't fully fund their operations.

And we have to start delivering results, and we understand that. As you mentioned, we have made significant changes to the organization, the staff, the leadership and really, there's 3 key areas and it's broken out into people, processes and portfolio. People, it's almost a complete change of the exploration team, with over 1/2 of our technical geoscientists, which is in the number greater than 50, with a company less than 2 years. So we've made -- it's not just the people, it's certain skill sets that these -- the technical staff that we brought on board have, some specific basin modelers. We've got regional stratigraphers, a lot of key gaps that we fill with the technical staff. So moving on to your question of the processes, it's the technical rigor and risking process that we're using. And it's a global process, where we're using the same yardstick across the entire globe of all the prospects. We also have a separate technical assurance section within our exploration group now that looks critically at risking. And as I mentioned, we have the additional technical staff. On the portfolio, as you saw on the slides and in John's comments, we've tightened our focus significantly. So we're -- we have more people with the technical expertise looking at a smaller number of basins. So we are providing better scrutiny over a smaller area. And we think those 3 things really tighten that up. On Sea Eagle, mentioning technology, there's a lot of new technology. In fact, it's first of a kind to check the risking of our Seal which is the highest risk on this Miocene Amplitude. We have a group in our KL office that has worked globally on our new block. It's Sarawak SK 2C where we think we've derisked this, and we're pretty excited about both of those prospects, which are kind of needle-moving size. The other part of our strategy is moving to some lower risk opportunities beyond those 2 wells in the Gulf of Mexico that includes Thunderbird, where we're sidetracking existing discovery of [indiscernible], low-risk prospect which can deliver production in 2016. And we also have the Dalmatian area, which are low-risk Upper Miocene amplitudes. So while we're doing those and those are drill and complete operations, gives us time to further work our portfolio, further high grade and make decisions on where we go forward there. Hopefully, that helps."

We see additional opportunity to, I guess, to start out to reduce the capital costs further on the drilling and completion side with nearing 25% towards the end of the year, and doing that through both working on the service and material side and retendering those services along with continued improvement in efficiencies -- operational efficiencies in the field. So we continue to improve reducing the days required to drill the wells. We're down now to our pacesetter wells in, for example, the Catarina area for 7 days. So those savings are going to continue on in the future. And we expect through technology to continue to drive cost down through efficiency. For the service and material side, that's a hard question to answer. Depends on what level of activity returns, we -- how are we negotiating contracts on our rigs and our frac services for extended periods of time, so taking the savings now and adding additional time to our contracts. And for some of our units, we're going to wait till the contracts expire and then renegotiate. So we expect that the cost will not approach what they did in the previous development stages of the Eagle Ford unless we see oil go back to 100 plus dollars."

Murphy's consolidated results in the first quarter of 2015 were a loss of $14.4 million, $0.08 per diluted share, compared to a profit of $155.3 million or $0.85 per share a year ago. Excluding discontinued operations in the U.K. our income from continuing operations amounted to $3.5 million in the first quarter of 2015, $0.02 per diluted share, again compared to the first quarter of 2014 of $169.3 million profit or $0.93 per diluted share.
The first quarter results from continuing operations for 2015 included a gain of $199.5 million on the sale of an additional interest in our Malaysian business. It also included a $32.5 million of estimated after-tax cost to remediate a condensate pipeline leak or leaks in Alberta, Canada. These and other items affecting comparability of earnings between periods are listed in the schedule of adjusted earnings included as part of our earnings release. All of these figures in this schedule are on an after-tax basis.
Earnings in the 2015 first quarter were negatively impacted by significantly lower realized sales prices for crude oil, natural gas liquids and North American natural gas, the effects of which were partially offset by higher production and sales levels. The company's average realized crude oil sales price fell more than $49 per barrel, which equates to 51% reduction, while U.S. natural gas liquid prices were almost $22 per barrel lower, which was 63% reduction. Natural gas prices also softened in the first quarter of '15 compared to the prior year's quarter. It dropped by $1.69 per Mcf in North America for a decline of 41%.
Crude oil and gas liquids production in the 2015 quarter was 9% above 2014 levels, primarily due to drilling activities in the Eagle Ford Shale and despite the combined 30% sale of interest in Malaysia between late 2014 and 2015.
Crude oil and gas liquids production averaged approximately 150,800 barrels per day in the '15 quarter, compared to approximately 137,800 barrels per day in the prior year first quarter.
Natural gas volumes for the company were 424 million cubic feet per day in the '15 quarter compared to 400 million cubic feet per day in '15 (sic) ['14] with the 6% increase primarily due to higher production from the Dalmatian Field in the Gulf of Mexico, the Eagle Ford Shale area in Texas and the Tupper West --I'm sorry, and the Tupper area in Western Canada. 
Natural gas production in Malaysia fell in 2015 primarily due to a lower net entitlement following the sale of our 30% interest. The lower post-sale net entitlement percentage reduced 2015 quarter 1 production by approximately 25,500 BOEs per day.
Our corporate segment reflected a loss of $15.2 million in the first quarter of '15, as compared to a net cost of $41.3 million in the fourth quarter of -- in the first quarter of '14. Decreased net corporate costs in '15 primarily relate to favorable results from transactions denominated in foreign currencies, particularly associated with a weaker Malaysian ringgit.
Capital expenditures for continuing operations for 2015 in the first quarter totaled $613 million, a 31% decline from the same period in '14. For 2015, we continue to project our capital expenditure spend at $2.3 billion. And as of March 31, 2015, Murphy's long-term debt amounted to approximately $2.6 billion or 24% of capital employed.
Moving into the operating comments. This is the first reporting period under the recent severely reduced oil price environment. We are, of course, seeing major impacts on our business. Murphy is able to withstand this price pullback better than many in our industry due to our low net debt, our solid balance sheet, a diverse oil portfolio and previously announced capital reductions. 
We paid our normal quarterly dividend in March, and we have maintained our dividend with board approval for the next dividend payment on the 1st of June. Based on current prices, our dividend is approaching a 3% yield. We were also pleased to complete the timely sell-down in Malaysia with a January close on sale of a 10% interest as the second phase of our overall sell-down of 30%.
With our balance sheet flexibility, we're focused on opportunities, both onshore and offshore, that may be available following the collapse of crude oil prices. In the U.K., it appears that we are finally coming to an end with an agreement in place to sell the remaining portion of our downstream assets. We continue to add our offshore -- to our offshore exploration portfolio in an effort to build more optionality into our program. We added a new block in the Vulcan Sub-Basin offshore Australia, plus another new block in deepwater offshore Sarawak, Malaysia. 
In addition, we participated in the March Gulf of Mexico Central lease sale and submitted the high bid on 5 new blocks. We have no well commitments on the Australia and Gulf of Mexico acreage. We are progressing our low risk deepwater Gulf of Mexico projects at Medusa and Kodiak. Our Eagle Ford Shale business was able to maintain production in the first quarter even as we pulled back rigs under our capital reduction plan. We delivered 45 producing wells in the Eagle Ford in the first quarter and are down to 4 rigs operating at this time.
Our oil-weighted diverse portfolio of assets is a benefit to our company and is highlighted by the recent widening spread between Brent and WTI, as nearly 60% of our first quarter production was weighted to Brent and LLS. While that widening differential is helpful, our realized first quarter 2015 oil prices were 50% below prices a year earlier. First quarter realized oil prices in our Malaysia business averaged near $55 per barrel for Block K and $49 per barrel for Sarawak, with oil indexed SK Gas averaging $4.50 per Mcf.
Moving to the U.S, Eagle Ford Shale oil prices were near $44 a barrel in Q1, some $34 per barrel below the fourth quarter of '14. Our realized oil prices in the Gulf of Mexico averaged near $46 per barrel, keeping pace with the drop in LLS.
In Canada, Syncrude was close to $45 per barrel and Seal was just under $20 per barrel, as heavy oil was particularly impacted by the oil price pullback in the first quarter.
Our global lease operating expenses for Q1 2015, excluding Syncrude, is near $9.70 per barrel of oil equivalent, showing an improvement of 18% from the first quarter of 2014 and 5% below the fourth quarter of 2014.
We are pleased with the overall effort the company is making on cost reduction, but this effort has just started to take hold. We expect to start seeing the results of our cost reductions in the remaining quarters.
The Eagle Ford Shale carried some delayed cost from 2014 in the first quarter, but based on both vendor price concessions and improved operating efficiencies, we are working hard to reduce these costs going forward. And we expect to see lease operating expenses driven down toward the $10 per barrel range in Eagle Ford as the year progresses.
Cash flow per barrel metrics have been greatly reduced with the collapse in oil prices. However, we went into the collapse with an above average cash flow per barrel metric versus our peer group, and we perceive this as a continuing advantage for us going forward.
We are approaching our cost reduction efforts in 2 phases. The first phase was direct negotiation with our vendors and suppliers to reduce their cost to supply goods and services. We have seen good initial results with overall operating costs in the Eagle Ford Shale coming down in the 20% range. In terms of capital cost, we are seeing approximately 15% cost reductions to drill and complete an Eagle Ford well. But we feel there's more room to improve here with efficiencies and further cost reductions. The pace of cost reductions for drilling and completions is certainly faster in the onshore business, such as Eagle Ford, compared to the onshore -- offshore.
We are entering the second phase of our efforts with plans to rebid vendor contracts in key spending sectors to further reduce costs. This effort will be ongoing through the second and third quarter of this year.
First quarter production averaged 221,550 barrels of oil equivalent per day, slightly exceeding our guidance of 221,000 even barrels of oil equivalent per day, despite unplanned downtimes relating to an advancement of a turnaround at Syncrude as well as downtime associated with our lower value Block K associated gas. We also saw some unplanned downtime in the Gulf of Mexico. We had higher-than-planned production levels in the Eagle Ford Shale in Montney as well as in our new Sarawak projects, which are performing very nicely to date.
Looking ahead to the second quarter, production guidance remains on target at 197,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. The decrease in the first quarter is attributed to various planned shut-ins for maintenance work across our offshore operations and Syncrude. Major shut-ins for planned maintenance are common for us in the middle part of the year. These second quarter planned outages account for approximately 14,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the quarter, and some of these outages are expected to carry into quarter 3. In addition, Eagle Ford Shale production is expected to start to decline in response to the 46% capital spending reduction this year.
We have de-risked some of the downtime in the second quarter as our Sarawak operations were recently down for 11 days, and the work has been completed on time in April. We have also completed some planned annual downtime at the non-operated Habanero Field in the Gulf of Mexico. Our full year guidance remains unchanged at a range of 195,000 to 207,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.
In Malaysia, the timely phase sell-down of an overall 30% of our oil and gas assets was completed in the first quarter. We had previously sold 20% of our interest in the fourth quarter of 2014. The second phase was completed in January by selling an additional 10% of our interest, and we booked an after-tax gain of $199.5 million from the sale in the first quarter of 2015.
Production offshore Sabah averaged near 34,400 barrels of oil equivalent per day for the first quarter with 88% of that liquids.
The Kakap-Gumusut main project, where we hold an 8.6% working interest in First Oil was achieved in October 2014, has demonstrated excellent performance, with production ramping up into the first quarter. Gross production averaged near 150,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in March, with peak gross rates near 160,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.
In shallow waters offshore Sarawak, gas production for the first quarter was 112 million cubic feet per day and liquids production was near 18,500 barrels of oil per day.
We completed the first phase of development drilling in the South Acis field comprised of 14 producing wells. The post-drill results are showing volumes 70% higher than the sanctioned volume. We just completed a 5-well drilling program targeting gas at Belum. Well costs were approximately 30% below estimate, and the initial well costs there look positive with net pay 35% higher than prognosis. These new Sarawak developments are robust in this low-priced environment, as we benefit from our existing infrastructure in the region.
Moving to the global offshore business. Gulf of Mexico productions for the quarter was over 24,400 barrels of oil equivalent per day, with 61% liquids. We continue to progress our 2-well subsea expansion project at the Medusa field, where we operate at a 60% working interest. Both wells have been drilled to plan and subsea flow lines, topsides facilities and installation of final jumpers are complete. One well is scheduled to flow first oil in early May, one month ahead of our original expectation.
The non-operated Kodiak development, where we hold a 29% working interest, is a 2-well tieback to the third-party operated Devil's Tower. First well has been drilled to plan, and completion work is ongoing. Topsides facility work is scheduled to begin in May, with subsea installation work to begin in the third quarter. We anticipate first oil in the first quarter of 2016.
Both projects are solid investments in this low price environment, with an anticipated point forward rate of return of 10% at prices near $30 per barrel.
In Western Canada, our natural gas production from the Montney in the first quarter of 2015 was 187 million cubic feet per day, relatively flat with the fourth quarter of 2014. We completed 8 new wells in the recent quarter and, as planned, released all of our rigs in February. We see strong well performance from our new completion techniques. Results to date indicate higher cumulative production in wellhead pressures, pointing to higher estimated ultimate recovery from the wells.
At the Seal field, as previously mentioned, the company reported an after-tax expense of $32.5 million in the first quarter related to estimated costs associated with a condensate distribution line failure or failures in a remote area of Northern Alberta. The source of the leak or leaks is isolated, the area of impact is contained and remediation activities are ongoing. The company is cooperating with the regulator on remediation and incident investigations.
In the Eagle Ford Shale, first quarter 2015 net production, which was comprised of 90% liquids, averaged 64,200 barrels of oil equivalent per day, relatively flat to the fourth quarter of 2014. Production levels held up in the first quarter, as we brought 45 new wells online. As planned, we reduced our rig count to 4 in the quarter and expect to remain at that level for the remainder of the year. We are currently using 2 completion spreads with plans to drop to 1 spread in the second quarter. We are on target to bring on approximately 118 wells this year, as the pace of wells coming online decreases over the remainder of the year as planned.
Production in the second quarter of 2015 is estimated to average 59,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, with the '15 production outlook flat year-on-year to 2014, even with a 40% reduction in capital spending this year. We are currently focused on allocating capital within our field development plans as well as reducing operating expenses.
The long-term value of our Eagle Ford Shale position is bolstered by our early entry into the play at an average lease cost of approximately $2,000 per acre, as well as our high oil percentage located near the Gulf of Mexico. We have over 2,000 potential well locations remaining and now estimate the total recoverable resource at near 750 million BOEs, up from 690 million BOE at the end of 2013. In the last 5 years, we have placed over 550 wells online in the Eagle Ford Shale. We continue to see positive results with our well completion and choke management strategies.
The slide represented here is an example in our largest acreage area of Tilden, and our other operated areas of Karnes and Catarina look very similar. We are among the leaders in both management of decline rates and productivity per completed lateral foot. We see positive results with our downspacing and staggered well spacing pilots across all the play. We currently have 254 wells producing at 40-acre spacing and 23 wells in the Upper Eagle Ford. We are incorporating staggered well pad design into future development areas.
Move on to our exploration. Murphy is an exploration company with a strong ability to execute projects in both the offshore and onshore. While our exploration results have been disappointing, we are very focused on righting this ship. We have made significant changes to the team and organization to improve our skill sets and processes. Building a high-grade exploration portfolio is a key goal. We have sharpened our global focus regions to strengthen our expertise in key basins of interest.
In the Gulf of Mexico, we added 5 blocks at the March Central Lease Sale and are now evaluating opportunities in the Wilcox play in Mexico bid rounds.
In Southeast Asia and Australia, we recently added a new block in the Vulcan Sub-Basin offshore Northern Australia and a new deepwater block at Sarawak. We believe we're on the right path forward here to deliver success in our exploration program.
As to our remaining exploration drilling program for 2015, in the Gulf of Mexico we have 4 to 5 wells scheduled for the rest of this year. Our next exploration well is an amplitude supported prospect at Sea Eagle, with an estimated gross mean resource of 100 million BOE. The well is expected to spud in mid-May.
This will be followed by 2 lower risk wells at Dalmatian and Thunderbird. Both wells are near infrastructure, with Dalmatian being a subsea tieback to our existing Dalmatian operation and Thunderbird a tieback to Thunder Hawk.
In Malaysia, we have 4 exploration wells on the schedule for the second half of the year. 2 of these wells aim to provide additional resources to our very successful shallow water Sarawak development activities. We have 1 well in Block H Malaysia where we are participating in a Floating LNG project. And the fourth well is an exploration well to be drilled on our recently acquired SK 2C Block. We are excited about this area as Malaysia exploration is back in view for Murphy. The new focus area between Malaysia and Vietnam is prone for high-yield gas and Murphy's advantaged with our robust gas infrastructure system. We then plan to finish off our year with a non-operated appraisal well to our gas discoveries in Brunei.
At the end of February, we entered Block 2C in deep water Sarawak as operator with a 50% working interest, where we plan to spud the Paus East well in the third quarter. This 300 million barrel of oil equivalent estimated gross mean resource opportunity is targeting oil condensate and gas and offsets the existing Paus discovery. 
We have identified Merapuh P10 and Yu Central as the first 2 wells to be drilled in Block SK 314A, testing Miocene stack sands targeting oil downdip from our existing fields. If successful, these near field low-risk prospects carry high value by feeding into our existing infrastructure in the shallow water Sarawak area. The Permai prospect, with an estimated gross mean resource of 170 Bcf, is targeting additional gas resources for our Block H Floating LNG development. This prospect is similar to the previous 9 discoveries in the play.
As to guidance, our second quarter production is set at 197,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Our full year production and capital guidance is unchanged at 195,000 to 207,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day per production and $2.3 billion capital spend.
In wrapping up, I'll comment on a few takeaways. In exploration, we're making progress with significant changes in the team and adding our technical expertise. We are sharpening our focus down into fewer areas, and we're moving to lower risk opportunities that are value-added while we build our prospect portfolio with our new team. 
Our solid financial position bolstered by the timely sell-down in Malaysia has Murphy well-positioned to carry out our exploration and development plans and provides optionality to explore business development opportunities. Our low risk deepwater Gulf of Mexico subsea development projects are on time and budget from an execution standpoint, and their returns can withstand the current price level. Our value-added Sarawak oil and gas projects continue to deliver for us, with recent drilling successes at both South Acis and Belum.
Similar to our peers, we are focused on cost reductions, and we'll see the results of our efforts over the course of the year.
Thank you for your attention, and we will now take your questions."

Some of this turnaround work still continues on into the third quarter. We've got some deepwater shut-in activity at Kikeh going into the third quarter as well.

So in North American onshore, our most likely interest would be in some bolt-on opportunity around the Eagle Ford or, of course, good acreage in nearby areas such as the Permian would also be attractive. 
We're seeing, Leo, a lot of ground floor opportunities available in the offshore business as well. Capital constraints among industry members are causing, though, many people to look for partners where they can't fully fund their operations.

As you mentioned, we have made significant changes to the organization, the staff, the leadership. And really, there's 3 key areas and it's broken out into people, processes and portfolio. People, it's almost a complete changeout of the exploration team, with over 1/2 of our technical geoscientists, which is in the number greater than 50, with the company less than 2 years. So we've made -- it's not just the people. It's certain skill sets that these -- the technical staff that we brought on board have, some specific basin modelers. We've got regional stratigraphers. A lot of key gaps that we filled with the technical staff. 
But moving on to your question of the processes, it's the technical rigor and risking process that we're using. And it's a global process, where we're using the same yardstick across the entire globe of all the prospects. We also have a separate technical assurance section within our exploration group now that looks critically at risking. And as I mentioned, we have the additional technical staff. 
On the portfolio, as you saw on the slides and in John's comments, we've tightened our focus significantly. So we're -- we have more people with the technical expertise looking at a smaller number of basins. So we are providing better scrutiny over a smaller area. And we think those 3 things really tighten that up. 
On Sea Eagle, mentioning technology, there's a lot of new technology. In fact, it's first of a kind to check the risking of our Seal, which is the highest risk on this Miocene amplitude. We have a group in our KL office that has worked globally on our new block, it's Sarawak SK 2C, where we think we've de-risked this. And we're pretty excited about both of those prospects, which are kind of needle-moving size. 
The other part of our strategy is moving to some lower risk opportunities beyond those 2 wells in the Gulf of Mexico. That includes Thunderbird, where we're sidetracking existing discovery up-dip, a low-risk prospect which can deliver production in 2016. And we also have the Dalmatian area, which are low-risk Upper Miocene amplitudes. 
So while we're doing those, and those are drill and complete operations, gives us time to further work our portfolio, further high-grade and make decisions on where we go forward there. Hopefully, that helps."

We saw a lot of running room and it was potentially impactful. The results of these 3 wells clearly increase our risk, and we're going to take some time to look at any remaining potential. 
But I would say the upside there has been greatly reduced by the results of these 3 wells. Our focus now on Australia is really on the Sub Vulcan Basin where we just picked up a new block in Northern Australia as well as the Ceduna Basin down to the south of Australia, which we see as frontier with a tremendous potential."

So to date, the board has chosen not to pull the trigger on a buyback, but the board will continue to evaluate this process as we move forward, and again, depending on what prices do, could impact the decision.

The consolidated results of Murphy Oil Corporation in the second quarter of 2015 were a loss of $73.8 million, which equates to $0.42 per diluted share, and that compares to a profit of $129.4 million or a p",682,"Thank you, Barry, and good afternoon, everyone. The consolidated results of Murphy Oil Corporation in the second quarter of 2015 were a loss of $73.8 million, which equates to $0.42 per diluted share, and that compares to a profit of $129.4 million or a profit of $0.72 per diluted share a year ago. Excluding discontinued operations in the United Kingdom, continuing operations had a loss of $89 million or $0.51 per diluted share in the second quarter of '15, again, compared to the second quarter of 2014 of a profit of $142.7 million or $0.79 per diluted share. The second quarter current year results from continuing operations included a $23.8 million charge or at least a 2% tax rate increase in Alberta. This change will increase future tax rates for operations in the net Canadian province to a total of 12% tax beginning in 2016. Additionally, we had after-tax severance and other changes of $7.5 million in the quarter. 
Since the beginning of 2015, we have had overall staffing reductions of about 7% associated with the company reorganization plan. The savings from these staffing reductions will benefit us going forward. The quarter also included a benefit of $19.3 million from post-closing settlements associated with our earlier combined sale of 30% of our interest in Malaysia, and that sale occurred in late 2014 and early 2015. These and other items affecting comparability of earnings between periods are listed in our schedule of adjusted earnings, which is included as a part of our earnings release. Amounts and the schedule are reported on an after-tax basis. 
Earnings in the 2015 second quarter were negatively impacted by a significantly lower realized sales process per crude oil and natural gas liquids and natural gas compared to the same quarter in 2014. The company's average realized price for all of its crude oil production fell more than $37 per barrel, amounting to a 40% drop. Natural gas prices also were weaker in the second quarter of 2015 compared to the prior year's quarter with average North American gas price realizations dropping $1.61 per Mcf or a decline of 41%. Net natural gas profit offshore at Sarawak fell similarly. Our oil-weighted in the first portfolio of assets benefits our company as 52% of our second quarter production was sold off of Brent and LLS benchmarks which continued to bring stronger prices compared to the West Texas intermediate base volumes. Sales priced have further softened in July and, therefore, revenues continue to be under pressure as 2015 prices remain significantly below prices from a year ago. 
Crude oil and gas liquids production in the 2015 second quarter was lower than 2014 levels primarily due to the 30% sale of interest in Malaysia. Taking the Malaysia sale into account, our liquids production in the 2015 second quarter actually increased 6% compared to a pro forma total for the prior year.  Total oil and gas liquids production in the second quarter of 2015 was just over 131,000 barrels per day. Natural gas volumes were 425 million cubic feet per day in the 2015 quarter, flat to '14. However, again, factoring in the pro forma effects of the 30% sale in Malaysia, gas production actually increased 17% in the second quarter 2015, primarily due to higher production from the Montney area in Western Canada. 
Capital expenditures for continuing operations for the first 6 months of 2015 totaled $1.15 billion, which was a 34% decline from the comparable 2014 period. We continue to project our total 2015 capital expenditures at $2.3 billion [ph]. At June 30, 2015, into the second quarter, Murphy's long-term debt amounted to approximately $3.3 billion, 29% of total capital employed, while net debt amounted to just over 20% at the end of the second quarter. In July, we moved $150 million of funds from the U.K. following the sale of the U.K. downstream assets back to the United States. And these funds have been used to repay a portion of our outstanding debt early in the third quarter. 
That concludes my comments, and I'll turn it now over to Roger."

Before we get started on our operational review today, I want to welcome Kelly to Murphy and her new role overseeing IR and Communications. Kelly brings many years of experience in this position.

Barry has done a great job for us over the past 5 years in Investor Relations. He will move into a new role and lead 3 combined corporate functions as Vice President of Insurance, Security and Risk. The combination of these 3 corporate functions was word. Post the recent organizational study that John just mentioned. 
As far as reorganization, we split exploration to 2 regional groups, each reporting to Gene Coleman, the current EVP of Offshore Business. We restructured exploration to reduce focus areas, improve capital allocation and lower costs. 
Looking back at a pretty solid quarter for us, we have the following highlights. Our company remains in favor financial position with balance sheet flexibility, took advantage of opportunities and carryout capital and corporate programs. We initiated $250 million stock repurchase in May and completed it in July, this past quarter, with just under 6 million shares retired or 3% of the company. This represents buying our own proved reserves at near $12 per BOE in this tranche. 
Since 2012, we repurchased a total of $1.375 billion of company stock or 12.4%. We continue to make progress on the portfolio completing the sale of U.K. downstream business. The Malaysia sale down was timely hedged, the falling oil prices, and we still have many levers remaining to reposition the company going forward. We're currently reviewing the value of our midstream assets in Canada, Montney, Eagle Ford Shale and the Gulf of Mexico. 
Operationally, we made a nice gas discovery in Permai well and Block H Malaysia. This 200-plus Bcf resource will fit nicely with our Floating LNG development plans going forward. 
In the Gulf of Mexico, we achieved first production from the two-well Medusa subsea expansion ahead of schedule and on budget. And at Kodiak, we completed the first of 2 subsea wells ahead of schedule with drilling results to plan significantly in derisking the project returns. 
In shallow water Sarawak Malaysia, we continued a 5-well drilling campaign at the Belum gas field plant and are now drilling at the Permas oilfield. 
In our onshore business. Liquid shale continue to perform well, we have delivered 36 new wells online in the second quarter, and have recently completed wells in the Montney continue to deliver above planned results. 
As we look at our operating metrics, our global lease operating expense for Q2 2015, excluding Syncrude, is $10.90 per BOE, showing an improvement of 9% from quarter 2 '14 and 30% down from 2013. We are pleased with the overall effort and the company is making in cost reductions and this effort will continue throughout the year. 
The eagle Ford Shale had a second quarter operating expense near [ph] $10 per BOE and we expect to see further improvements in the second half of the year. 
We entered a price collapse last year and are currently in a good position relative to cash flow per barrel metrics. While the price drop this metric, we have not had any significant impairments which is impacting many of the peer group. 
We recently finished drilling our first well with the sixth generation rig Ocean Black Rhino in the Gulf of Mexico which strong operational execution of this well at 20% below budget. The punchline for me here is improved returns ahead in deepwater, especially in the drilling completion delineation wells, we have planned and a major deepwater developments in the future. 
In Eagle Ford Shale, we continue to lower cost and drop over efficiency gains. Our average well cost is now down by 21% from last year, and we're focused on getting that down to 25% overall by year end. 
Second quarter production averaged 201,952 barrel equivalents per day, exceeding our guidance of 197,000. The near 5,000 barrel equivalents per day variance was primarily attributed to new well performance in Eagle Ford Shale, rich start-up of the Medusa subsea expansion project and higher-than-forecasted heavy oil production from Seal. 
Looking ahead to the third quarter. Production guidance is estimated 200,000 barrel equivalents per day. The decrease from second quarter is primarily attributed to lower Malaysia production with the planned maintenance of the Kakap-Gumusut facility, risking of Sarawak and Kikeh gas volumes, and lower Canadian onshore production due to normal well decline, partially offset by higher Syncrude and Medusa subsea volumes for the quarter. 
We've increased our full year production guidance to a range of 200,000 to 208,000 barrel equivalents per day. 
As we reach the midpoint of the year, we remain on track with our capital spend budgets, some 34% below last year's level. That significant reduction capital we're targeting production growth this year of around 2%. The year-on-year growth is led by new well performance in Eagle Ford Shale and Montney. 
In Western Canada, our natural gas production from the Montney in the second quarter was 192 million cubic feet per day, our new completion is continue to deliver strong well performance with EURs now in the 8 to 10 Bcf range, well ahead of the regional Montney sanctions that call for 4 Bcf per well. We have a refracked pilot underway on some of the older wells at Tupper and have inventory of 9 previously drilled wells and currently completing 5 of them to maintain production rates and keep unit operating expenses low. 
At word, we continue to progress our long-term commercial steam project regulatory applications for essential thermo project were submitted in quarter 1 this year and we recently sanctioned feed work for the project. We're seeing some positive results from primary production from multilateral horizontal wells and have line in that area. 
In Eagle Ford Shale, second quarter 2015 production was comprised of 9% liquids averaging near 60,800 barrels equivalent per day. As planned, we continue to operate 4 rigs and 2 completion spreads and current plan is to stay at that level activity for the rest of the year. With about 36 wells, new wells online in the second quarter and we brought on near 60% of our total estimated wells for the year in the first half. We're planning on delivering 36 wells in quarter 3 and 25 wells in quarter 4 with the program being front-end loaded as per guidance and plans. 
Production in the third quarter of 2015 is estimated to be near 60,000 equivalents per day with the 2015 full year outlook not expected to exceed 59,000, some 2,000 barrel equivalents a day ahead of our annual production for 2014. 
We continue to optimize our frac designs and are seeing strong results from recent super slick completions and occurrence until areas. We have now begun a new trial of high intensity completions for volumes in spacing. Our major oil field were always searching for additional production zones. We're assessing the potential Shockley in our Eagle Ford Shale acreage. We have begun a three-well appraisal plan in the play with the first well coming online in October. 
Our current assessment shows a minimum of 70 Austin Chalk locations in the Carnes area with potential for additional locations of depending on the results of this appraisal. 
Murphy's well positioned in Eagle Ford Shale with their production mix compared to many peers, our limited exposure to lower NGL and natural gas prices gives us leverage in an oil price recovery. Murphy's well ramped up strategy focuses on maximizing value by balancing early production rates with ultimate recovery. The strategy has led Murphy to have one of the highest levels of 2-year recovery per well across the play. 
Eagle Ford Shale's a viable asset within our portfolio. The value of Eagle Ford Shale to Murphy is enhanced by early ground entry in the play of over 2,000 potential well locations remaining, now estimate the total resource at near 750 million barrels equivalent, which is very similar to the entire reserve base of Murphy today. We used to say that fields is going very, very well for us. 
The Malaysian second quarter, we completed a five-well drilling program for natrual gas at Belum field in shallow water offshore Sarawak. The Belum field has low nitrogen content that will blend into our current gas production, allow us to derisk our 250 million per day contractual volume on demand going forward. We're currently drilling oil wells in the Permas shallow water development, and this operation is going well with cost trending 20% under budget. 
Sarawak gas production for the second quarter was 111 [indiscernible] per day net, supported by strong guest nominations and liquid production at near 14,700 barrels of oil per day. 
We successfully completed the planned outage in early second quarter at our Sarawak facilities to complete required inspections in major maintenance. 
Production offshore Sabah, averaging a 30,900-barrel equivalent per day from second quarter with 85% liquids, planned maintenance activity of Kakap-Gumusut main facility to install gas handling and injection system commenced on June 9 and recently been completed. 
Earlier this month, we had a gas discovery of Permai exploration well in Block H, where we operate the well with 42% working metrics, our eighth consecutive success in area around that deal. 
This 200-plus Bcf discovery will allow optimization of Floating LNG project to lower our development cost. 
In the Gulf of Mexico, production for the quarter was over 22,900 barrel equivalents per day with 61% liquids. The Medusa 2-well expansion achieved first oil in the second quarter with the well starting up late April and mid-June, respectively.  We've exceeded our projected daily volumes and beat our scheduled targets. Word at the nonoperating Kodiak project continued to the first 2 wells have been drilled and completed plant and modification top subsea executions underway. 
The steel prospect of Mississippi Canyon Block 692 failed to encounter commercial quantities of hydrocarbon and will be word of dry hole. The well which we operate, it was a 35% working interest, was not included in our second quarter guidance. It was able to expected to reached total depth in the third quarter. Our drilling operations team completed the well 30 days ahead of schedule and $25 million gross under budget. 
We have expanded into a new area in the Gulf of Mexico where we're entering to the Wilcox play. There were 22% working interest ground foreman into the nonoperated Solomon prospect and word Ridge by 2 25. The well has a gross pre- estimate of over 300 million barrels. 
Looking at our drilling program for the rest of 2015 in the Gulf of Mexico, the Solomon well, which is currently projected to reach total depth sometime in near the end of third quarter, early fourth quarter, has been included in our dry hole exposure for the third quarter. 
[indiscernible] was moving to drilling low-risk prospect the Dalmatian South No. 2. The Transocean Discoverer Deep Seas expected to complete required inspection of the middle of August, and the word sidetrack the Thunderbird discovery, which shall be a subsea tieback to a nearby Thunder Hawk facility. 
Recognizing our lack of exploration success, we plan to focus recommitments on our lower risk appraisal wells and blocks where we have had prior exploration success. We'll allocate capital to higher return opportunities there existing infrastructure, not invest further in higher risk, high-cost wells at this time. 
In Malaysia, we will focus on our gas discovery at Permai and deepwater Block H with 2 shallow water oil prospects, Maracas 5 and Maracas and SK 314A, adjacent to our very successful Sarawak oil and gas developments. 
Late in the quarter, we'll drilled the word in Block SK 2C out of Sarawak. This well is near prior discovery on the block and is located in our new focus areas. We plan to finish off the year with a nonoperated appraisal of our gas discoveries in Brunei. Our form well commitments through 2016 are primarily in Malaysia, Brunei and Vietnam, which is one of our focus areas with lower-cost exploration. Post 2016, we have only one required well commitment in the entire company, and an estimated net cost of only $4 million. We'll have capital allocation options for exploration in 2016 and beyond as we have worked off commitments made in the prior years. We, like all deepwater operators, have deepwater rig commitments. The end of our rig commitments with the Black Rhino and Discoverer Deep Seas are expiring in February and November 2016, respectively. 
Production for the third quarter is estimated to be 200,000 equivalents per day. We have increased our full year production guidance with the range of 200,000 to 208,000 barrel equivalents per day. Capital expenditures remain unchanged from our previous guidance, and accounting for custody to be $2.3 billion in 2015. 
Murphy Oil has returned significant value to its shareholders over the last 6 years through regular dividends, a special dividend, a spin-off of Murphy U.S. and share repurchases. Our strong balance sheet supports the current regular dividend and allows the company to carry out its capital programs and review opportunities. 
At current prices, our dividend yield is near 4% above industry peer average. Share repurchases since 2012 have acquired our own proved reserves below our FND cost and competitive to other acquisitions. While many companies are issuing equity or taking major impairments from their assets, Murphy, through its conservative nature, has been able to avoid significant write-downs in the business. 
Let's take aways today. Our strong operational performance this year has allowed us to increase our production guidance for the year while staying within our capital spending budget. Our oil-weighted price advantage portfolio provides us with the cash flow per BOE benefit over many of our peers. We're driving cost lower in our business through cost reductions and efficiency improvements in both our offshore and onshore segments. Our conservative balance sheet is a positive for us, and the second price collapse in 9 months, it allows Murphy to maintain a continued focus on our shareholders' carryout capital programs and look for opportunities to improve our company going forward. 
We'll now take your questions. Thank you."

We were, at that time, forecasting CapEx to be lower than we have a this year, slightly lower. We're now looking at $50 case, a lower case, if you will, I think it's a misnomer that our CapEx will be very high in that case. And as I look at it today, I don't have the break out around the world and looking at the total cash flow CapEx perspective in a way I look at this in the reductions of that type of $50 case would cost is that our debt levels as to our revolver, would have 2.25 billion of the bonds, and we have $2 billion revolver. We would stay inside our revolver levels without repatriation of cash abroad, which we have cash, of course, in Canada, Malaysia, complex and timely oriented to repatriate that money which gives us optionality.

So I would say that split's about the same. We're at 50-50 onshore, offshore player. We do have continued development work and shallow water our Eagle for this doing really well.

The consolidated results of Murphy Oil Corporation in the second quarter of 2015 were a loss of $73.8 million, which equates to $0.42 per diluted share, and that compares to a profit of $129.4 million or a p",677,"Thank you, Barry, and good afternoon, everyone. The consolidated results of Murphy Oil Corporation in the second quarter of 2015 were a loss of $73.8 million, which equates to $0.42 per diluted share, and that compares to a profit of $129.4 million or a profit of $0.72 per diluted share a year ago. Excluding discontinued operations in the United Kingdom, continuing operations had a loss of $89 million or $0.51 per diluted share in the second quarter of '15, again, compared to the second quarter of 2014 of a profit of $142.7 million or $0.79 per diluted share. The second quarter current year results from continuing operations included a $23.8 million charge or at least a 2% tax rate increase in Alberta. This change will increase future tax rates for operations in net Canadian province to a total of 12% tax beginning in 2016. Additionally, we had after-tax severance and other changes of $7.5 million in the quarter.
Since the beginning of 2015, we have had overall staffing reductions of about 7% associated with the company reorganization plan. The savings from these staffing reductions will benefit us going forward. The quarter also included a benefit of $19.3 million from post-closing settlements associated with our earlier combined sale of 30% of our interest in Malaysia, and that sale occurred in late 2014 and early 2015. These and other items affecting comparability of earnings between periods are listed in our schedule of adjusted earnings, which is included as a part of our earnings release. Amounts in this schedule are reported on an after-tax basis. 
Earnings in the 2015 second quarter were negatively impacted by a significantly lower realized sales process per crude oil and natural gas liquids and natural gas compared to the same quarter in 2014. The company's average realized price for all of its crude oil production fell more than $37 per barrel, amounting to a 40% drop. Natural gas prices also were weaker in the second quarter of 2015 compared to the prior year's quarter with average North American gas price realizations dropping $1.61 per Mcf or a decline of 40%. Net natural gas prices offshore Sarawak fell similarly. Our oil-weighted diverse portfolio of assets benefits our company as 52% of our second quarter production was sold off of Brent and LLS benchmarks which continue to bring stronger prices compared to the West Texas Intermediate base volumes. Sales prices have further softened in July and therefore, revenues continue to be under pressure as 2015 prices remain significantly below prices from a year ago.
Crude oil and gas liquids production in the 2015 second quarter was lower than 2014 levels primarily due to the 30% sale of interest in Malaysia. Taking the Malaysia sale into account, our liquids production in the 2015 second quarter actually increased 6% compared to a pro forma total for the prior year.  Total oil and gas liquids production in the second quarter of 2015 was just over 131,000 barrels per day. Natural gas volumes were 425 million cubic feet per day in the 2015 quarter, flat to '14. However, again, factoring in the pro forma effects of the 30% sale in Malaysia, gas production actually increased 17% in the second quarter 2015, primarily due to higher production from the Montney area in Western Canada.
Capital expenditures for continuing operations for the first 6 months of 2015 totaled $1.15 billion, which was a 34% decline from the comparable 2014 period. We continue to project our total 2015 capital expenditures at $2.3 billion. At June 30, 2015, into the second quarter, Murphy's long-term debt amounted to approximately $3.3 billion, 29% of total capital employed, while net debt amounted to just over 20% at the end of the second quarter. In July, we moved $150 million of funds from the U.K. following the sale of the U.K. downstream assets back to the United States. And these funds have been used to repay a portion of our outstanding debt early in the third quarter.
That concludes my comments, and I'll turn it now over to Roger."

Barry has done a great job for us over the past 5 years in Investor Relations. He'll be moving into a new role and will lead 3 combined corporate functions as Vice President of Insurance, Security and Risk. The combination of these 3 corporate functions was developed post the recent organizational efficiency study that John just mentioned. 
As far as reorganization, we have split exploration to 2 regional groups, each reporting to Gene Coleman, the current EVP of Offshore Business. We've restructured exploration to reduce focus areas, improve capital allocation and lower costs.
Looking back at a pretty solid quarter for us, we have the following highlights. Our company remains in favorable financial position with balance sheet flexibility, take advantage of opportunities and carryout capital and corporate programs. We initiated $250 million stock repurchase in May and completed it in July, this past quarter, with just under 6 million shares retired or 3% of the company. This represents buying our own proved reserves at near $12 per BOE in this tranche.
Since 2012, we repurchased a total of $1.375 billion of company stock or 12.4%. We continue to make progress on the portfolio completing the sale of the U.K. downstream business. The Malaysia sale down was timely hedged to falling oil prices, and we still have many levers remaining to reposition the company going forward. We're currently reviewing the value of our midstream assets in Canada, Montney, Eagle Ford Shale and in the Gulf of Mexico.
Operationally, we made a nice gas discovery in Permai well in Block H Malaysia. This 200-plus Bcf resource will fit nicely with our Floating LNG development plans going forward.
In the Gulf of Mexico, we achieved first production from the 2-well Medusa subsea expansion ahead of schedule and on budget. And at Kodiak, we completed the first of 2 subsea wells ahead of schedule with drilling results to plan significantly derisking the project returns.
In shallow water Sarawak Malaysia, we completed a 5-well drilling campaign at the Belum gas field plant and are now drilling at the Permas oilfield.
In our onshore business. Liquid shale continue to perform well, we have delivered 36 new wells online in the second quarter, and have recently completed wells in the Montney continue to deliver above planned results. 
As we look at our operating metrics, our global lease operating expense for Q2 2015, excluding Syncrude, is $10.90 per BOE, showing an improvement of 9% from quarter 2 '14 and 30% down from 2013. We are pleased with the overall effort that the company is making in cost reductions and this effort will continue throughout the year.
The Eagle Ford Shale had a second quarter operating expense near $10 per BOE, and we expect to see further improvements in the second half of the year.
We entered the price collapse last year and are currently in a good position relative to cash flow per barrel metrics. While the price drop has served this metric, we have not had any significant impairments which is impacting many of the peer group.
We recently finished drilling our first well with the sixth generation rig Ocean BlackRhino in the Gulf of Mexico with strong operational execution on this well at 20% below budget. The punchline for me here is improved returns are ahead in deepwater, especially in the drilling and completion of delineation wells we have planned and major deepwater developments in the future.
In Eagle Ford Shale, we continue to lower cost to drop forward efficiency gains. Our average well cost is now down by 21% from last year, and we're focused on getting that down to 25% overall by year end.
Second quarter production averaged 201,952 barrel equivalents per day, exceeding our guidance of 197,000. The near 5,000 barrel equivalents per day variance which primarily attributed to new well performance in Eagle Ford Shale, rich start-up of the Medusa subsea expansion project and higher-than-forecasted heavy oil production from Seal.
Looking ahead to the third quarter. Production guidance is estimated 200,000 barrel equivalents per day. The decrease from second quarter is primarily attributed to lower Malaysia production with the planned maintenance of the Kakap-Gumusut main facility, risking of Sarawak and Kikeh gas volumes and lower Canadian onshore production due to normal well decline, partially offset by higher Syncrude and Medusa subsea volumes for the quarter.
We've increased our full year production guidance to a range of 200,000 to 208,000 barrel equivalents per day.
As we reach the midpoint of the year, we remain on track with our capital spend budgets, some 34% below last year's level. But that significant reduction in capital we're targeting production growth this year of around 2%. The year-on-year growth is led by new well performance in Eagle Ford Shale and Montney.
In Western Canada, our natural gas production from the Montney in second quarter was 192 million cubic feet per day. Our new completion designs continue to deliver strong well performance with EURs now in the 8 to 10 Bcf range, well ahead of the regional Montney sanctions that call for 4 Bcf per well. We have a refracked pilot underway on some of the older wells at Tupper and have an inventory of 9 previously drilled wells and are currently completing 5 of them to maintain production rates and keep unit operating expenses low.
At Seal, we continue to progress our long-term commercial steam project regulatory applications for essential thermal project that were submitted in quarter 1 this year, and we recently sanctioned feed work for the project. We're seeing some positive results from primary production from multilateral horizontal wells and have a running room in that area.
In Eagle Ford Shale, second quarter 2015 production was comprised of 9% liquids, averaging near 60,800 barrels equivalent per day. As planned, we continue to operate 4 rigs and 2 completion spreads, and the current plan is to stay at that level activity for the rest of the year. We brought 36 wells, new wells online in the second quarter and it brought on near 60% of our total estimated wells for the year in the first half. We're planning on delivering 36 wells in quarter 3 and 25 wells in quarter 4 with the program being front-end loaded as per guidance and plans.
Production in the third quarter of 2015 is estimated to be near 60,000 equivalents per day with the 2015 full year outlook not expected to exceed 59,000, some 2,000 barrel equivalents a day ahead of our annual production for 2014.
We continue to optimize our frac designs and are seeing strong results from recent super slick completions and in the Karnes and Tilden areas. We have now begun a new trial of high intensity completions with larger sand volumes and tighter stage spacing. Like any major oil field, we're always searching for additional production zones. We're assessing the potential of the Austin Chalk play in our Eagle Ford Shale acreage. We have begun a three-well appraisal plan in the play with the first well coming online in October.
Our current assessment shows a minimum of 70 Austin Chalk locations in the Carnes area with potential for additional locations depending on the results of this appraisal.
Murphy's well-positioned Eagle Ford Shale, with our oil-weighted production mix compared to many peers, our limited exposure to lower NGL and natural gas prices gives us leverage in an oil price recovery. Murphy's well-ramped up strategy focuses on maximizing the value by balancing early production rates with ultimate recovery. This strategy has led Murphy to have one of the highest levels of 2-year recovery per well across the play.
The eagle Ford Shale's a valuable asset within our portfolio. The value of Eagle Ford to Murphy is enhanced by early ground for entry in the play of over 2,000 potential well locations remaining, now estimate the total resource at near 750 million barrels equivalent, which is very similar to the entire reserve base of Murphy today. We used to say that field's going very, very well for us.
The Malaysian second quarter, we completed a five-well drilling program for natural gas at the Belum field in shallow water offshore Sarawak. The Belum field has low nitrogen content that will blend into our current gas production, allow us to derisk our 250 million per day contractual volume on demand going forward. We're currently drilling oil wells in the Permas shallow water development, and this operation's going well with cost trending 20% under budget.
Sarawak gas production for the second quarter was 111 million cubic feet per day net, supported by strong gas nominations and liquid production at near 14,700 barrels of oil per day.
We successfully completed the planned outage in early second quarter at our Sarawak facilities to complete required inspections and major maintenance. 
Production offshore Sabah, averaging a 30,900-barrel equivalent per day for the second quarter with 85% liquids, planned maintenance activities with Kakap-Gumusut main facility to install gas handling and injection system commenced on June 9 and have recently been completed.
Earlier this month, we had a gas discovery of Permai exploration well in Block H, where we operate the well with 42% working interest, our eighth consecutive success in the area around that field.
This 200-plus Bcf discovery will allow optimization of the Floating LNG project and lower our development cost.
In the Gulf of Mexico, production for the quarter was over 22,900 barrel equivalents per day with 61% liquids. The Medusa two-well expansion achieved first oil in the second quarter with the well starting up late April and mid-June, respectively. We've exceeded our projected daily volumes and beat our scheduled targets. Field development work at the nonoperating Kodiak project continued towards the first of 2 wells and have been drilled and completed the plan and modification of top subfacilites and subsea executions underway.
The Sea Eagle prospect in Mississippi Canyon Block 692 failed to encounter commercial quantities of hydrocarbon and will be expensed as a dry hole. The well, which we operated with a 35% working interest, was not included in our second quarter guidance as it was expected to reach total depth in the third quarter. Our drilling operations team completed the well 30 days ahead of schedule and $25 million gross under budget.
We have expanded into a new area in the Gulf of Mexico with our entry to the Wilcox play through a 20% working interest ground floor farm-in foreman into the nonoperated Solomon prospect and Walker Ridge by 225. The well has a gross pre-drill of over 300 million barrels.
Looking at our drilling program for the rest of 2015 in the Gulf of Mexico, the Solomon well, which is currently projected to reach total depth sometime near the end of third quarter or early fourth quarter, has been included in our dry hole exposure for the third quarter.
BlackRhino has moved into a drill at lower risk prospect at Dalmatian South 2#. The Transocean Discoverer Deep Sea is expected to complete required inspections by the middle of August, and the slated to sidetrack the Thunder Bird discovery, which shall be a subsea tieback to a nearby Thunder Hawk facility.
Recognizing our lack of exploration success, we plan to focus rig commitments on our lower risk appraisal wells and blocks where we have had prior exploration success. We'll allocate capital to higher return opportunities near existing infrastructure, not invest further in higher risk, higher cost wells at this time.
In Malaysia, we will focus on our gas discovery at Permai and deepwater Block H with 2 shallow water oil prospects, Merapuh 5 and Marakas and Block SK 314A adjacent to our very successful Sarawak oil and gas developments.
Later in the quarter, we will drill the Paus East in Block SK 2C offshore Sarawak. This well is near prior discovery from the block and is located in our new focus areas. We plan to finish off the year with a nonoperated appraisal of our gas discoveries in Brunei. Our former well commitments through 2016 are primarily in Malaysia, Brunei and Vietnam, which is one of our focus areas with lower cost exploration. Post 2016, we have only one required well commitment in the entire company, and an estimated net cost of only $4 million. We'll have capital allocation options for exploration in 2016 and beyond as we have worked off commitments made in prior years. 
We, like all deepwater operators, have deepwater rig commitments. The end of our rig commitments with the BlackRhino and Discoverer Deep Seas are expiring in February and November 2016, respectively.
Production for the third quarter is estimated to be 200,000 equivalents per day. We've increased our full year production guidance with the range of 200,000 to 208,000 barrel equivalents per day. Capital expenditures remain unchanged from our previous guidance and are currently forecasted to be $2.3 billion in 2015.
Murphy Oil has returned significant value to its shareholders over the last 6 years through regular dividends, a special dividend, a spin-off of Murphy U.S.A. and share repurchases. Our strong balance sheet supports the current regular dividend and allows the company to carry out its capital programs and review opportunities.
At current prices, our dividend yield is near 4% above industry peer average. Share repurchases since 2012 have acquired our own proved reserves below our F&D cost and competitive to other acquisitions. While many companies are issuing equity or taking major impairments from their assets, Murphy, through its conservative nature, has been named to avoid significant write-downs in the business.
As takeaways today, our strong operational performance this year has allowed us to increase our production guidance for the year while staying within our capital spending budget. Our oil-weighted price advantage portfolio provides us with the cash flow per BOE benefit over many of our peers. We're driving cost lower in our business through cost reductions and efficiency improvements in both our offshore and onshore segments.

First, on your first question, our CapEx is pretty firm where we are. It could be down slightly, but I can tell you they're doing everything not to increase it at all, especially with the latest price. The Eagle Ford Shale is doing very, very well for us. We are probably going to end the year with a little bigger inventory than we normally carry at Murphy, and we'll probably looking at the typical front-end loading again next year. And we would have optionality there if the Eagle Ford continues to be efficient as it has been, then we'd want to use some of that to maintain our CapEx. That will be harder to do with prices low like this, but we feel comfortable with our guidance and our CapEx, and I would say it's slightly downward but I'm not anticipating that to be that big. From a 2016 perspective, of course, that's very difficult to answer today. We were dealing a couple of months ago with $65, $66 WTI in our business. We were, at that time, forecasting CapEx to be lower than we have a this year, slightly lower. We're now looking at $50 case, a lower case, if you will, I think it's a misnomer that our CapEx will be very high in that case. And as I look at it today, I don't have the break out around the world. I'm looking at the total cash flow CapEx perspective, and the way I look at this in the reductions of that type of $50 case would cost is that our debt levels, as to our revolver, we have 2.25 billion of the bonds, and we have $2 billion revolver. We would stay inside our revolver levels without repatriation of cash abroad, which we have cash, of course, in Canada, Malaysia, complex and timely oriented to repatriate that money which gives us optionality. And we're allowed to maintain our dividend, lower CapEx, below this year and survived at a $50 world without changing really almost the debt levels that Murphy has today.

We were looking at shallow water Mexico and thought of it like a shallow water Malaysia play. it's very underexplored, a nice place to work. We're trying to focus back into Houston with lower G&A and less -- West Africa, less international farm that, of course, is international being run out of Houston. We participated, it was a situation there where you did various work programs and economic parts of the bid. As part of that, the government then released their minimum government take after the bids were submitted, and we were slightly below what they requested. So therefore, our bid didn't work out, and it didn't workout. And there are many bid rounds ahead there, there's deepwater coming. I think it's a very underexplored, nice place to work if you're concentrating people and cost into the Gulf of Mexico, it will be something out in time for well commitments for us, where we have virtually 0. So it wouldn't be a big issue to capital if oil prices were to stay down lower longer. So I like the timing of it, I like the underexplored nature of it. It didn't work out that time.

And if we can't get that strip price rate of return we like, then we're going to be unsuccessful, and I think that early on, just a timing issue. We had a very nice hedging of oil for our shareholders at Murphy with the sell down in Malaysia. Then we come in to a collapse in prices accumulating last Thanksgiving. And then we never saw the bid-ask spread organized for us to participate at that time, and here we are again with another collapse again or a lot of volatility, a lot of noise around the mid-40s and things of that nature.

It's probably looking to increase in certain areas if we just get data on these new completions. Higher sand concentration completion is basically what they are, no matter what the fancy name is. The more sand, the concentrate is allowing us to open a well little more aggressive in having to pass. We have a methodology around doing that with our folks there in Houston. And to maintain the same type of reservoir performance with the larger sand concentration, that's allowing us to have, for the first time, some really namebrand type of rate without having the oil in a massive decline. As you would see from some from our peers, they're supported by this 2-year production data advantage that Murphy carries forward. So we're pleased with that, I think that's something that -- our new data and our new fracs are just coming in. We are obviously doing very well in the upper Eagle Ford situation there. We like all players in that field. That massive field have data that shows upper wells going along with lower wells. We have all those slides, and we have that too. It's going well for us.

The consolidated results of Murphy Oil Corporation in the second quarter of 2015 were a loss of $73.8 million, which equates to $0.42 per diluted share, and that compares to a profit of $129.4 million or a p",674,"Thank you, Barry, and good afternoon, everyone. The consolidated results of Murphy Oil Corporation in the second quarter of 2015 were a loss of $73.8 million, which equates to $0.42 per diluted share, and that compares to a profit of $129.4 million or a profit of $0.72 per diluted share a year ago. Excluding discontinued operations in the United Kingdom, continuing operations had a loss of $89 million or $0.51 per diluted share in the second quarter of '15, again, compared to the second quarter of 2014 of a profit of $142.7 million or $0.79 per diluted share. The second quarter current year results from continuing operations included a $23.8 million charge for a recent 2% tax rate increase in Alberta. This change will increase future tax rates for operations in that Canadian province to a total of 12% tax beginning in 2016. Additionally, we had after-tax severance and other changes of $7.5 million in the quarter.
Since the beginning of 2015, we have had overall staffing reductions of about 7% associated with the company reorganization plan. The savings from these staffing reductions will benefit us going forward. The quarter also included a benefit of $19.3 million from post-closing settlements associated with our earlier combined sale of 30% of our interest in Malaysia, and that sale occurred in late 2014 and early 2015. These and other items affecting comparability of earnings between periods are listed in our schedule of adjusted earnings, which is included as a part of our earnings release. Amounts in this schedule are reported on an after-tax basis. 
Earnings in the 2015 second quarter were negatively impacted by significantly lower realized sales prices for crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas compared to the same quarter in 2014. The company's average realized price for all of its crude oil production fell more than $37 per barrel, amounting to a 40% drop. Natural gas prices also were weaker in the second quarter of 2015 compared to the prior year's quarter, with average North American gas price realizations dropping $1.61 per Mcf or a decline of 40%. Net natural gas prices offshore Sarawak fell similarly. Our oil-weighted diverse portfolio of assets benefits our company, as 52% of our second quarter production was sold off of Brent and LLS benchmarks, which continue to bring stronger prices compared to the West Texas Intermediate base volumes. Sales prices have further softened in July and therefore, revenues continue to be under pressure as 2015 prices remain significantly below prices from a year ago.
Crude oil and gas liquids production in the 2015 second quarter was lower than 2014 levels, primarily due to the 30% sale of interest in Malaysia. Taking the Malaysia sale into account, our liquids production in the 2015 second quarter actually increased 6% compared to a pro forma total for the prior year.  Total oil and gas liquids production in the second quarter of 2015 was just over 131,000 barrels per day. Natural gas volumes were 425 million cubic feet per day in the 2015 quarter, flat to '14. However, again, factoring in the pro forma effects of the 30% sale in Malaysia, gas production actually increased 17% in the second quarter 2015, primarily due to higher production from the Montney area in Western Canada.
Capital expenditures for continuing operations for the first 6 months of 2015 totaled $1.15 billion, which was a 34% decline from the comparable 2014 period. We continue to project our total 2015 capital expenditures at $2.3 billion. At June 30, 2015, into the second quarter, Murphy's long-term debt amounted to approximately $3.3 billion, 29% of total capital employed, while net debt amounted to just over 20% at the end of the second quarter. In July, we moved $150 million of funds from the U.K. following the sale of the U.K. downstream assets back to the United States. And these funds have been used to repay a portion of our outstanding debt early in the third quarter.
That concludes my comments, and I'll turn it now over to Roger."

Barry has done a great job for us over the past 5 years in Investor Relations. He'll be moving to a new role and will lead 3 combined corporate functions as Vice President of Insurance, Security and Risk. The combination of these 3 corporate functions was developed post the recent organizational efficiency study that John just mentioned. 
As part of our reorganization, we have split exploration into 2 regional groups, each reporting to Gene Coleman, the current EVP of our offshore business. We've restructured exploration to reduce focus areas, improve capital allocation and lower costs.
Looking back at a pretty solid quarter for us, we have the following highlights. Our company remains in favorable financial position with balance sheet flexibility to take advantage of opportunities and carry out capital and corporate programs. We initiated $250 million stock repurchase in May and completed it in July, this past quarter, with just under 6 million shares retired or 3% of the company. This represents buying our own proved reserves at near $12 per BOE in this tranche.
Since 2012, we repurchased a total of $1.375 billion of company stock or 12.4%. We continue to make progress on the portfolio, completing the sale of the U.K. downstream business. The Malaysia sell down was timely hedged to falling oil prices, and we still have many levers remaining to reposition the company going forward. We're currently reviewing the value of our midstream assets in Canada, Montney, Eagle Ford Shale and in the Gulf of Mexico.
Operationally, we made a nice gas discovery in Permai well in Block H Malaysia. This 200-plus Bcf resource will fit nicely with our Floating LNG development plans going forward.
In the Gulf of Mexico, we achieved first production from the 2-well Medusa subsea expansion ahead of schedule and on budget. And at Kodiak, we completed the first of 2 subsea wells ahead of schedule, with drilling results to plan significantly derisking the project returns.
In shallow water Sarawak Malaysia, we completed a 5-well drilling campaign at the Belum gas field to plan and are now drilling at the Permas oilfield.
In our onshore business, Eagle Ford Shale continued to perform well. We have delivered 36 new wells online in the second quarter, and our recently completed wells in the Montney continue to deliver above plan results. 
As we look at our operating metrics, our global lease operating expense for Q2 2015, excluding Syncrude, is $10.90 per BOE, showing an improvement of 9% from quarter 2 '14 and 30% down from 2013. We are pleased with the overall effort that the company is making in cost reductions and this effort will continue throughout the year.
The Eagle Ford Shale had a second quarter operating expense near $10 per BOE, and we expect to see further improvements in the second half of the year.
We entered the price collapse last year and are currently in a good position relative to cash flow per barrel metrics. While the price drop has hurt this metric,  we have not had any significant impairments which is impacting many in the peer group.
We recently finished drilling our first well with the sixth-generation rig Ocean BlackRhino in the Gulf of Mexico. We had strong operational execution on this well at 20% below budget. The punchline for me here is improved returns are ahead in deepwater, especially in the drilling and completion of delineation wells we have planned in major deepwater developments in the future.
In Eagle Ford Shale, we continue to lower cost to drive forward efficiency gains. Our average well cost is now down by 21% from last year, and we're focused on getting that down to 25% overall by year end.
Second quarter production averaged 201,952 barrel equivalents per day, exceeding our guidance of 197,000. The near 5,000 barrel equivalents per day variance, which primarily attributed to new well performance in Eagle Ford Shale, rich start-up of the Medusa subsea expansion project and higher-than-forecasted heavy oil production from Seal.
Looking ahead to the third quarter. Production guidance is estimated at 200,000 barrel equivalents per day. The decrease from second quarter is primarily attributed to lower Malaysia production with the planned maintenance of the Kakap-Gumusut main facility, risking of Sarawak and Kikeh gas volumes and lower Canadian onshore production due to normal well decline, partially offset by higher Syncrude and Medusa subsea volumes for the quarter.
We've increased our full year production guidance to a range of 200,000 to 208,000 barrel equivalents per day.
As we reach the midpoint of the year, we remain on track with our capital spend budget, some 34% below last year's level. With that significant reduction in capital, we're targeting production growth this year of around 2%. The year-on-year growth is led by new well performance in Eagle Ford Shale and Montney.
In Western Canada, our natural gas production from the Montney in second quarter was 192 million cubic feet per day. Our new completion designs continue to deliver strong well performance, with EURs now in the 8 to 10 Bcf range, well ahead of the original Montney sanctions that call for 4 Bcf per well. We have a refracked pilot underway on some of the older wells at Tupper and have an inventory of 9 previously drilled wells and are currently completing 5 of them to maintain production rates and keep unit operating expenses low.
At Seal, we continue to progress our long-term commercial steam project. Regulatory applications for Central Thermal Project were submitted in quarter 1 this year, and we recently sanctioned feed work for the project. We're seeing some positive results from primary production from multilateral horizontal wells and have running room in that area.
In Eagle Ford Shale, second quarter 2015 production was comprised of 9% liquids, averaging near 60,800 barrels equivalent per day. As planned, we continue to operate 4 rigs and 2 completion spreads, and the current plan is to stay at that level of activity for the rest of the year. We brought 36 wells, new wells online in the second quarter and have brought on near 60% of our total estimated wells for the year in the first half. We're planning on delivering 36 wells in quarter 3 and 25 wells in quarter 4, with the program being front-end loaded as per guidance and plans.
Production in the third quarter of 2015 is estimated to be near 60,000 equivalents per day, with the 2015 full year outlook not expected to exceed 59,000, some 2,000 barrel equivalents a day ahead of our annual production for 2014.
We continue to optimize our frac designs and are seeing strong results from recent super slick completions in the Karnes and Tilden areas. We have now begun a new trial of high intensity completions with larger sand volumes and tighter stage spacing. Like any major oil field, we're always searching for additional productive zones. We're assessing the potential of the Austin Chalk play in our Eagle Ford Shale acreage. We have begun a three-well appraisal plan in the play, with the first well coming online in October.
Our current assessment shows a minimum of 70 Austin Chalk locations in the Karnes area, with potential for additional locations depending on the results of this appraisal.
Murphy is well-positioned in the Eagle Ford Shale, with our oil-weighted production mix compared to many peers. Our limited exposure to lower NGL and natural gas prices gives us leverage in an oil price recovery. Murphy's well ramp-up strategy focuses on maximizing value by balancing early production rates with ultimate recovery. This strategy has led Murphy to have one of the highest levels of 2-year recovery per well across the play.
The Eagle Ford Shale is a valuable asset within our portfolio. The value of Eagle Ford to Murphy is enhanced by our early ground floor entry in the play. We have over 2,000 potential well locations remaining. We now estimate the total resource at near 750 million barrels equivalent, which is very similar to the entire reserve base of Murphy today. Needless to say, the field's going very, very well for us.
In Malaysia in the second quarter, we completed a five-well drilling program for natural gas at the Belum field and shallow water offshore Sarawak. The Belum field has low nitrogen content that will blend into our current gas production, allow us to derisk our 250 million per day contractual volume on demand going forward. We're currently drilling oil wells in the Permas shallow water development, and this operation's going well, with costs trending 20% under budget.
Sarawak gas production for the second quarter was 111 million cubic feet per day net, supported by strong gas nominations and liquid production at near 14,700 barrels of oil per day.
We successfully completed the planned outage in early second quarter at our Sarawak facilities to complete required inspections and major maintenance. 
Production offshore Sabah, averaging 30,900-barrel equivalents per day for the second quarter with 85% liquids. Planned maintenance activities at Kakap-Gumusut main facility to install gas handling and injection system commenced on June 9 and have recently been completed.
Earlier this month, we had a gas discovery at Permai exploration well in Block H, where we operate the well with 42% working interest, our eighth consecutive success in the area around that field.
This 200-plus Bcf discovery will allow optimization of the Floating LNG project and lower our development costs.
In the Gulf of Mexico, production for the quarter was over 22,900 barrel equivalents per day with 61% liquids. The Medusa two-well expansion achieved first oil in the second quarter, with the wells starting up late April and mid-June, respectively. We've exceeded our projected daily volumes and beat our scheduled targets. Field development work at the nonoperating Kodiak project continues, where the first of 2 wells have been drilled and completed to plan and modification of top-sub [ph] facilities and subsea executions underway.
The Sea Eagle prospect in Mississippi Canyon Block 692 failed to encounter commercial quantities of hydrocarbon and will be expensed as a dry hole. The well, which we operated with a 35% working interest, was not included in our second quarter guidance, as it was expected to reach total depth in the third quarter. Our drilling operations team completed the well 30 days ahead of schedule and $25 million gross under budget.
We have expanded into a new area in the Gulf of Mexico with our entry to the Wilcox play through a 20% working interest ground floor farm-in into the nonoperated Solomon prospect and Walker Ridge Block 225. The well has a gross pre-drill estimate of over 300 million barrels.
Looking at our drilling program for the rest of 2015 in the Gulf of Mexico, the Solomon well, which is currently projected to reach total depth sometime near the end of third quarter or early fourth quarter, has been included in our dry hole exposure for the third quarter.
BlackRhino has moved into a drill at lower risk prospect at Dalmatian South #2. The Transocean Discoverer Deep Seas is expected to complete required inspections by the middle of August, and is slated to sidetrack the Thunder Bird discovery, which will be a subsea tieback to our nearby Thunder Hawk facility.
Recognizing our lack of exploration success, we plan to focus rig commitments on our lower-risk appraisal wells and blocks where we have had prior exploration success. We'll allocate capital to higher return opportunities near existing infrastructure and not invest further in higher risk, higher cost wells at this time.
In Malaysia, we will focus on our gas discovery at Permai and deepwater Block H, with 2 shallow water oil prospects, Merapuh 5 and Marakas in Block SK 314A, adjacent to our very successful Sarawak oil and gas developments.
Later in the quarter, we will drill the Paus East in Block SK 2C offshore Sarawak. This well is near our prior discovery on the block and is located in our new focus areas. We plan to finish off the year with a nonoperated appraisal of our gas discoveries in Brunei. Our firm well commitments through 2016 are primarily in Malaysia, Brunei and Vietnam, which is one of our focus areas with lower cost exploration. Post 2016, we have only one required well commitment in the entire company, and an estimated net cost of only $4 million. We'll have capital allocation options for exploration in 2016 and beyond as we have worked off commitments made in prior years. 
We, like all deepwater operators, have deepwater rig commitments. The end of our rig commitments with the BlackRhino and Discoverer Deep Seas are expiring in February and November 2016, respectively.
Production for the third quarter is estimated to be 200,000 equivalents per day. We've increased our full year production guidance with the range of 200,000 to 208,000 barrel equivalents per day. Capital expenditures remain unchanged from our previous guidance and are currently forecast to be $2.3 billion in 2015.
Murphy Oil has returned significant value to its shareholders over the last 6 years through regular dividends, a special dividend, the spin-off of Murphy U.S.A. and share repurchases. Our strong balance sheet supports the current regular dividend and allows the company to carry out its capital programs and review opportunities.
At current prices, our dividend yield is near 4% above industry peer average. Share repurchases since 2012 have acquired our own proved reserves below our F&D cost and competitive to other acquisitions. While many companies are issuing equity or taking major impairments on their assets, Murphy, through its conservative nature, has been able to avoid significant write-downs in the business.
As takeaways today, our strong operational performance this year has allowed us to increase our production guidance for the year while staying within our capital spending budget. Our oil-weighted price advantage portfolio provides us with cash flow per BOE benefit over many of our peers. We're driving cost lower in our business through cost reductions and efficiency improvements in both our offshore and onshore segments. Our conservative balance sheet is a positive for us in the second price collapse in 9 months, and allows Murphy to maintain a continued focus on our shareholders, carry out capital programs and look for opportunities to improve our company going forward.
We'll now take your questions. Thank you."

I'm a deepwater person. I've been in deepwater my whole career, I understand the business fairly well. It's really a days business, more than a vendor cost-reduction business, where the onshore is a lot about vendor time and efficiency. But offshore is a day business. And I was a big believer in these big sixth-generation rigs, I thought they were too complex, too big, too much going on. I visited the one we had. It's one of the best wells I've ever seen in my career. And if we get that kind of performance to reduce these days, with all the subsea handling and the off-line work that these rigs can do, and you put that with lower day rates for these rigs, I'm absolutely certain that's going to lead to better returns, that's going to fit in better with our pause in exploration, the kind of wells we can get into out in the '17, '18 time frame, after we have the appropriate recalibration of our work in that effort."

First, on your first question, our CapEx is pretty firm where we are. It could be down slightly, but I can tell you they're doing everything not to increase it at all, especially with the latest price. The Eagle Ford Shale is doing very, very well for us. We are probably going to end the year with a little bigger inventory than we normally carry at Murphy, and we'll probably be looking at the typical front-end loading again next year. And we would have optionality there if the Eagle Ford continues to be efficient as it has been, did we want to use some of that to maintain our CapEx. That would be harder to do with prices low like this, but we feel comfortable with our guidance and our CapEx, and I would say it's slightly downward, but I'm not anticipating that to be that big. From a 2016 perspective, of course, that's very difficult to answer today. We were dealing a couple of months ago with a $65, $66 WTI in our business. We were, at that time, forecasting CapEx to be lower than we have this year, slightly lower. We're now looking at a $50 case, a lower case, if you will. I think it's a misnomer that our CapEx will be very high in that case. And as I look at it today, I don't have the breakout around the world in looking at a total cash flow CapEx perspective. And the way I look at this, and the reductions of that type of $50 case would cause, is that our debt levels as to our revolver -- we have $2.25 billion of bonds and we have a $2 billion revolver -- we would stay inside our revolver levels without repatriation of cash abroad, which we have cash, of course, in Canada, Malaysia, complex and timely oriented to repatriate that money that gives us optionality. And we're allowed to maintain our dividend, lower CapEx below this year and survive at a $50 world without changing, really, almost the debt levels that Murphy has today. So happy about that, and really not offering a lot more color than that at this time."

We, at Murphy, do have a very diverse portfolio and business. We have some very low-cost wells. This discovery in Block H Malaysia probably costs $15 million gross or something like that.

But when you have another price collapse and 2 in a few months, it's difficult, the bid-ask spread for selling is as difficult as the bid-ask spread for buying.

We're very pleased with our EUR per wells is probably looking to increase in certain areas if we just get data on these new completions. Higher sand concentration completions are basically what they are, no matter what the fancy name is. With more sand, the concentrate is allowing us to open the well a little more aggressively than we have in the past, and we have a methodology around doing that with our folks there in Houston. And to maintain the same type of reservoir performance with the larger sand concentration is allowing us to have, for the first time, some really name-brand type of rate without having the well in massive decline, as you would see from some of our peers. That's supported by this 2-year production data advantage that Murphy carries forward. So we're pleased with that, I think that's something that our new data and our new fracs are just coming in. We are obviously doing very well in the Upper Eagle Ford situation there. We, like all players in that field, that massive field, have data that shows upper wells going along with lower wells. We have all those slides, and we have that too. It's going well for us. Our Catarina areas are flatter, longer than we originally thought. Very cheap drilling out in that part. Very -- from a capital allocation, just up there with Karnes. A totally different type of EUR shape, but very economic.

That's compared to a profit of $246 million or $1.37 per diluted share a year ago. The third quarter 2015 results included non-cash property impairments of $2.3 billion, which after tax, has amounted to $1.54 million charge. These impairments were attributable to significant declines in future periods oil profits, which failed by as much as $15 per barrel at quarter end compared to 3 months earlier. The impairments were not related to reductions in the company's reported reserves. 
Adjusted earnings, which adjust our GAAP numbers for various items that affect comparability of earnings between periods, was a loss of $124 million in the third quarter of 2015, down from our profit of $205 million a year ago. This decline in adjusted earnings was primarily attributable to lower oil and natural gas sales prices in the current year. Our schedule of adjusted earnings is included as part of our earnings release, and the amounts in this schedule are reported on an after-tax basis. 
Company's average realized price for its crude oil production fell more than $43 per barrel in the third quarter compared to the prior year. This amounted to a 48% drop between periods in oil prices. Natural gas prices also were weaker in the third quarter 2015 compared to the prior year with average North American gas price realizations dropping $1.21 per Mcf or a decline of 33%. Realized natural gas prices offshore Sarawak also fell by 27%. 
Sales process continues to be soft in October, and therefore, revenues continue to be under pressure as quarter 4 2015 prices remain significantly below prices a year ago. 
The company continues to address its cost structure by aggressively reducing both operating and administrative cost. By year end 2015, we anticipate a 23% reduction in staffing levels compared to a year earlier. At December 30, 2015, Murphy's long-term debt amounted to approximately $3.3 billion, 35.6% of total capital employed, while net debt amounted to just over 25% at the end of the third quarter. 
At this time, I'll turn the call over to Roger for his comments."

Looking back at a solid operational third quarter, the following highlights standout. Our company remains in a favorable financial position with the healthy balance sheet that's flexible, take advantage of opportunities that arise both in onshore and offshore. With major pullback in oil prices, we've been able to maintain our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio at less than 1.5. Subsequent to the third quarter, we hedge for 2016, we currently have 20,000 barrels per day WTI contracts at an average price of $52 per barrel. 
On the cost side, we continued continue to make significant improvements in reducing both operating and G&A expenses on a year-to-year basis. We continue to review our portfolio as we still have many levers remaining to reposition the company going forward. We're currently reviewing the value of various midstream assets in North America. We're enthusiastic about the new area that we've recently formed into offshore Vietnam, which expanded our Vietnam footprint with a new block in a highly perspective oil-prone Cuu Long Basin. Our partnership group was successful in testing our first well and we're working to increase acreage in this carrier. 
In the Gulf of Mexico, we drilled the Dalmatian South #2. We like what we see here as it commercial hydrocarbons in 2 separate zones. Currently the well is being completed with first production expected early next year. In Malaysia, we achieved record average daily gross production for Sarawak gas at 291 million per day. In addition, we drilled the Marakas V and Marakas wells of positive results and process of evaluating both. In our onshore business, the Eagle Ford shale continues to outperform expectations where we delivered 33 new wells online in the third quarter, plus Montney production continues to be above plan. 
Our third quarter production is just over 207 500 barrel equivalents per day, and we're decreasing our 2015 annual production guidance to a range of 205,000 to 209,000 barrel equivalents per day. Over the course of the year, we've increased the midpoint of our production guidance from 201,000 barrels equivalents per day to 207,000, almost 3% increase. 
In operations, we're pleased with the ongoing efforts we're making on cost reductions. Our lease operating expenses for the third quarter 2015, excluding Syncrude, is $8.09 per BOE, showing a reduction of 23% from the third quarter of 2014. More importantly, we're posting a 45% reduction from full year 2013 on LOE. In Eagle Ford Shale, our third quarter operating expenses of just over $8 per BOE. This represents over $2 reduction from the second quarter of this year. 
On a cash margin basis, we're just over $19 per barrel equivalent in the third quarter, and our $20.28 per BOE for 9 months ended. This compares very favorably to our peers, and has been stable for Murphy for a long time due to our oil diverse portfolio. 
In production. Deposit production branch is 7,500-barrel equivalents a day for the quarter is attributable to Sarawak oil and natural gas deal is performing better, above plan performance on base decline. The eagle Ford Shale, new volume -- new well volume exceeding plan due to increased and completion performance and higher natural gas production from Montney. 
Looking ahead to the fourth quarter. Production guidance is estimated to be 199,000-barrel equivalents per day. Our third quarter actual production's higher than fourth quarter guidance due to higher risk SK natural gas nominations and planned downtime, natural well decline in the Gulf of Mexico and significant reduction in a number of completed wells in the Eagle Ford Shale. 
More importantly, we are maintaining our 2015 CapEx of $2.3 billion, some 32% below last year's level when taking to account the sale down in Malaysia. 
In Western Canada. Our natural gas production in Montney in the third quarter of 2015 was over 194 million per day. We've been successful in implementing fractured techniques from our Eagle Ford Shale work to the Montney. Our new completion zone with increased same concentrations continue to confirm our 8 to 11 Bcf EURs. Also, we continue to have positive result on our refrac pilot that is underway in some older, tougher wells. 
In Eagle Ford Shale, we're especially pleased with our results for the third quarter for production average over 63,000 barrels equivalent per day with about 33 new wells online in the third quarter, and we're planning to deliver 20 wells in the fourth for a total of 136 wells this year.  Our programs has been front-loaded as prior disclosed. Production for 2015 full year outlook is now expected to exceed 61,000 barrels equivalent per day, which is 8% above 2014 production. 
We continue adding to our total remaining resource in the play by downspacing wells, drilling longer laterals and optimizing completions, to name a few. We now estimate that our total remaining resource has grown to over 800 million barrels. And this growth even takes into account a total review of our resources from a price perspective. 
We successfully drilled our first Austin Chalk well in Collins County. Hopefully, we'll be moving this play concept westwards to our Catarina area. This will add 1/3 to word into our operand lower Eagle Ford Shale locations. We drilled the first of 3 well appraisal pilot and are currently analyzing corn logs to better understand the reservoir properties. Our current Austin Chalk appraisal well has a very successful flow rate of 1,500 barrel oil equivalent per day. We look forward to continuing to test Austin Chalk play in 2016. 
In Malaysia, we achieved record average daily gas production in Sarawak of 291 million a day. We successfully drilled 2 shallow water Sarawak oil prospects, the Merapuh 5 and Marakas wells had positive results where we're evaluating development options. These wells are in the Block SK314A area, adjacent to our successful Sarawak oil and gas developments. 
The Murphy operated Kakap-Gumusut well failed when counter commercial quantities of hydrocarbon was expensed into dry hole in the quarter. 
Offshore Vietnam, we signed a formal agreement in the shallow water 15-105 block in the prolific oil-prone Vietnam Cuu Long Basin. 2 discoveries have been made on the block. 
Murphy participated in the drilling and testing of LDP 4S well, which successfully tested 2 perspective zones. We're also working with PetroVietnam to advance our footprint into Cuu Long. This new block entry was made possible by our long-term relationship with our partner and our significant position as a successful operator in both deepwater and the shallow water in Malaysia. 
In the Gulf of Mexico, production for the quarter was over 27,200 barrel equivalents per day at 71% liquids. We spud the Dalmatian South #2-well during the quarter. We're now completing the wells we found commercial hydrocarbons with over 98 P2P in 2 zones, and we expect first production early next year. 
2 development work in the nonoperating Kodiak project continues with the first of 2 wells have been drilled and completed plant and modifications tops up facilities and subsea execution is underway. We're currently progressing the sub track of our Thunder Bird well to plan and all of our current Gulf of Mexico projects can withstand lower-for-longer prices. 
Looking at the drilling program for the fourth quarter 2015 in the Gulf, the nonoperating-ed Solomon well, which is currently projected to reach total depth sometime in the fourth quarter has been included in our dry hole exposure for the fourth quarter. We plan to finish up the year with an oil exploration well word located in Block H Malaysia with some non-operated well to appraise our oil-linked gas discoveries in Brunei. 
This time, we have 2 deepwater rigs under contract at Murphy. These contracts expire in 2016, 1 in February and the other in November. The continued low commodity prices we're experiencing an expected reduction in our 2016 CapEx program and an uncertainty about whether working interest partners will agree to participate in drilling programs, we're considering all options. Our current contractual commitments to the end of term for both rigs equals $277 million. 
In financials, Murphy has been able to maintain our investment grade BBB bond rating. We maintained our dividend policy through the year with current yield of 5%. We have $1 billion available under our current revolver. We have over $1.2 billion of cash abroad with marketable securities, and we achieved a net debt-to-EBITDA of less than 1.5. 
Production for the fourth quarter is estimated being 109,000 [ph] barrels equivalents a day. Again, we've increased our full year production guidance at the range of 205,000 to 209,000 equivalent per day. Capital expenditures remain unchanged from previous guidance, and are currently forecast to be $2.3 billion. 
To close in my comments today, I would like to leave with a few points. Murphy continues to have financial flexibility and strengths. The greatly lowered operating G&A expenses over the course of the year and cost reductions remains a priority. Our entry to the Eagle Ford Shale has been extremely successful addition to Murphy over the past few years. We've built an excellent high-performing team, now producing around 30% of our total volumes in just over 40 years. We, like most peers, continues the efficiency and cost-reduction in drilling and completion activity across all of our operating area. Our Gulf of Mexico projects generate sound economics at current prices. And over the quarter, we have participated in many positive well results from the Gulf of Mexico to shallow water Malaysia and to Vietnam and a very high rate oil test in the Austin Chalk area of Eagle Ford Shale. We continue to execute on all cylinders in a tough commodity environment. I'd like to now open it up the phone for your questions. And thank you."

When I say that, it's primarily related to the big $100 million-plus big wells in the Gulf of Mexico, they're very expensive, they have very high day rates. But we're not opposed to entering into lower risk opportunities. That was clear to us that the block did have prior discoveries. I mean, we entered into the block and participated in the delineation of both our discoveries. The delineation is going very, very well. We're very excited about it. We're talking about -- when we had -- you have 2 types of wells in the world, the big Gulf of Mexico, West Africa new entry type wells, and you have lower risk opportunities in a place like Vietnam where you can drill wells for $15 million and have a 50 million to 100 million barrel type prospects. So in that space, just from an F&D perspective, that's a very positive thing. And this is about our strategy, this is about our company. We do work internationally. We are a big major player in Malaysia. We have a strong relationship and a very strong reputation in Southeast Asia, and we're able to -- our expertise in shallow water development there and across other acreage in Vietnam, it's the reason we were able to get into this block. And it's a very favorable, but I do not consider it to be entry in a wild up place somewhere. It's very similar geology to what we're used to, very similar areas of operation, very similar cost, very similar well design, and a place where we work nearby. And it's something we're focused on in that area. I consider it not a new big wild entry into a far-off place, Leo."

So if you're in the game for a long time, both sides of the rig equation, I've been at that business a long time. And we have an opportunity to drill well cheaper due to that, and it's a very nice well to drill, it's probably a 60 million-barrel mean type project near the Conoco operated Kimbu Bagen area of Block H. It will be different from the Block H wells we drilled in the past from an exploration basis and totally different from our shallow flat spot gas amplitudes in which we've had enormous success. So we're going to drill that well. It's probably going to be $18 million to $20 million net to Murphy. It's disclosed in our cost here. Be [indiscernible] where we've been a nonoperated smaller partner of Brunei. We've had several successes there in a row. This is a continuation towards that commerciality of flowing LNG into Brunei.

I don't have it, like I said earlier, I don't have that finalized, and I'm probably not going to be the leader in that pack with the year we've had here. We have some really good wells to drill in Eagle Ford shale. $45-based pricing, we have a lot of wells at a 30% rate of return, and I think that's pretty decent and the oil price are $50, we have many wells to drill at 45% rate of return. Incremental going forward, I don't like to do work that way, but this does help when you're allocating capital. So we're going to be allocating capital on the best areas that deliver the best return on that incrementally. We're also do not need a lot of rigs to protect our acreage. That's different than it was from times past, and we'll have to do some big capital allocations, middle of doing so about protecting acreage versus protecting efficiency. The reason we have such efficient operations, we've been running same number of rigs for a while now with the same teams. So if you go 4 to 0 to 2 to 3 to 4 to 0, it's hard to do that. Almost a situation of allocating capital to remain some level of efficiency, and we're really trying to get to preparing for lower prices here from a cash flow CapEx parity over other things because we cannot continue to outspend our CapEx, and wake up one day and be with the credit of other people. We have very good credit situation today, debt-to-cap, and we don't want to wake up with it like the norm and not have done something or looked to attempt to do something to add value to our shares, to our shareholders. So we're in the middle of all that, and obviously, at the Eagle Ford Shale, will be a key part of capital allocation. I think today, $2.3 billion CapEx for '14, our CapEx in Eagle Ford shale is 855, and we're going to be at that percent or more as we cut CapEx because of very valuable asset for us, it's going extremely well on everything you can imagine that's known and shale business. We, at Murphy, have that ability as well, and we are proud about it, and it too has incredible flexibility because if things were to get worse, we can reduce it and add to it.

We used to think that an 80-acre spacing well have about a 660,000 EUR, and now we've pulled at 660,000 to 600,000, but we're at 48 per spacing.

Today, from back to '12, 2012, we're talking about the same situation where EURs continue to improve there, probably not so much as Karnes. But the big improvement for us is Catarina, which most Western area, which is a very organized -- we went ground for there, so we don't have the perfect word, sections of land that, but Catarina is very, very organized from that perspective. And we have improved EURs there. We have 3 big ranches there. One area from 210,000 a day, 210,000 equivalent EUR to over 400,000 with less spacing. And then another area from 210,000 to over 550,000. Again, with less spacing. And another area from 210,000 to 600,000. This is enormous change in an area where we drilled wells for only 4-point-something million dollars. This is a big deal. And we may not have it all modeled in yet, but our trajectory and where we're headed there, it's very, very positive, in my view."

And I guess as you think about that and you think about the resource you have in your portfolio, what would you see -- the Eagle Ford is certainly going to be one, but what do you see is kind of the resource that will drive -- that will be kind of a driver that the next leg of growth for the company, and I guess in that context, and how does the M&A fit in terms of other complementing or competing with that resource for kind of the next cycle of Murphy?"

But from an oil-weighted perspective, were probably fifth-place out of 16 peers, if you take the all reputed truly, truly with very limited NGL RDP player and very, very low on natural gas, that's quite frustrating to me, view that we don't have locations. This year, in Eagle Ford Shale, we're going to drill and operate about 136 wells, bring online 136 wells, and we probably have 3,000 locations to go. So it's obvious that Eagle Ford shale is not material for a company that has 756 million barrels approved and now resource size remaining of 800 million barrels, it's mind-boggling to me, and it's very well-known how this project models. But outside of that, I mean prices like Vietnam, we -- we have focused, very tight ramp where we want to bring that focused tighter. Projects like Kodiak, Kodiak, Vietnam, and things in coffer available to us, not large and many change here capital structure that deals that's very helpful. On that adding barrels. We do have Floating LNG coming online, which is going very well. As I mentioned we took a core there and do well this quarter to continue to confirm our outstanding resource available and we're further within BD LNG player in the world, Petronas, which some big deal. So small things alive Kodiak, big ones like Vietnam, M&A on top of all that, but we do not have collapsing RFP in this company. If you take a look at the long-range plan of the company, we do not have significantly drop ever our RFP. We just don't have the 12 because we don't have a lot of the gas to make it 12. So no, that's -- I think it's a misnomer a bit about the resources we have, and we probably need to do a better job of outlining those resources. But it's hard to do that in 2 years and oil price collapsed twice. That's not the time to go out, set expectations when you lower CapEx, have their own expectations work that way. So it's hard to get that into that vision that you are asking in this incredible, total oil price time. If you want to maintain balance sheet to do transformational things for the company, you can initially outspend and grow production and in that not having a transformational changes is very easy. I can just pick up the phone and do that. So I decided not to do it that way at this time."

So we have some additional locations there. It'll be a matter an oil price recovery. However, tiebacks like Dalmatian South #2 and various other things, tiebacks in the Gulf of Mexico are right up there with returns you have in the Eagle Ford, if you take full cycle into account, meaning the drilling of the well, the pipeline, et cetera, these things are very economic. We did higher -- we need a higher -- in EBITDA higher oil price want to get into the facility building be desperation successful things, or we can enter into a well or enter into thanks, unique pullback as we have the balance sheet to be able to do so. Those need oil to be a lower or higher, higher you can participate into the Gulf and many, many favorable projects today.

So we have great Eagle Ford Shale business going, we can executing incredibly well on keep the team for years and we hired been able to look at those opportunity, have a long-standing deepwater opportunity where we're not exploring today, but the factor is how do you get comfortable in changing staffing to do that again, another day when oil prices recover if they choose to do so. But there's a lot of opportunity in both and we're very, very advantaged to look at both word, and I don't know if many people have that."

Murphy Oil's consolidated results in the third quarter of 2015 were a loss of $1.6 billion, which equates to $9.26 per diluted share. That's compared to a profit of $246 million or $1.37 per diluted share a year ago. The third quarter 2015 results included noncash property impairments of $2.3 billion, which, after tax, has amounted to $1.54 billion charge. These impairments were attributable to significant declines in future periods oil prices, which failed by as much as $15 per barrel at quarter end compared to 3 months earlier. The impairments were not related to reductions in the company's reported reserves.
Adjusted earnings, which adjust our GAAP numbers for various items that affect comparability of earnings between periods was a loss of $124 million in the third quarter of 2015, down from our profit of $205 million a year ago. This decline in adjusted earnings was primarily attributable to lower oil and natural gas sales prices in the current year. Our schedule of adjusted earnings is included as part of our earnings release, and the amounts in this schedule are reported on an after-tax basis.
Company's average realized price for its crude oil production fell more than $43 per barrel in the third quarter compared to the prior year. This amounted to a 48% drop between periods in oil prices. Natural gas prices also were weaker in the third quarter 2015 compared to the prior year with average North American gas price realizations dropping $1.21 per Mcf or a decline of 33%. Realized natural gas prices offshore Sarawak also fell by 27%.
Sales process continued to be soft in October, and therefore, revenues continue to be under pressure as quarter 4 2015 prices remain significantly below prices a year ago.
The company continues to address its cost structure by aggressively reducing both operating and administrative cost. By year-end 2015, we anticipate a 23% reduction in staffing levels compared to a year earlier. At September 30, 2015, Murphy's long-term debt amounted to approximately $3.3 billion, 35.6% of total capital employed, while net debt amounted to just over 25% at the end of the third quarter.

Looking back a solid operational third quarter, the following highlights standout. Our company remains in a favorable financial position with a healthy balance sheet that's flexible, take advantage of opportunities that arise both in onshore and offshore. With a major pullback in oil prices, we've been able to maintain our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio at less than 1.5. Subsequent to the third quarter we hedge for 2016, we currently have 20,000 barrels per day WTI contracts at an average price of $52 per barrel.
On the costs side, we continue to make significant improvements in reducing both operating and G&A expenses on a year-to-year basis. We continue to review our portfolio. As we still have many levers remaining to reposition the company going forward, we're currently reviewing the value of various midstream assets in North America. We're enthusiastic about the new area that we've recently formed into Offshore Vietnam, which expanded our Vietnam footprint with a new block in a highly perspective, oil-prone Cuu Long Basin. Our partnership group was successful in testing our first well, and we're working to increase acreage in this prolific area.
In the Gulf of Mexico, we drilled the Dalmatian South #2. We like what we see here as it has commercial hydrocarbons in 2 separate zones. Currently, the well is being completed with first production expected early next year.
In Malaysia, we achieved record average daily gross production for Sarawak Gas at 291 million per day. In addition, we drilled the Merapuh 5 and Marakas wells with positive results and process of evaluating both.
In our onshore business, the Eagle Ford Shale continues to outperform expectations where we delivered 33 new wells online in the third quarter, plus Montney production continues to be above plan.
Our third quarter production is just over 207,500 barrel equivalents per day, and we're increasing our 2015 annual production guidance to a range of 205,000 to 209,000 barrel equivalents per day. Over the course of the year, we've increased the midpoint of our production guidance from 201,000 barrels equivalents per day to 207,000, almost 3% increase.
In operations, we're pleased with the ongoing efforts we're making on cost reductions. Our lease operating expenses for the third quarter 2015, excluding Syncrude, is $8.09 per BOE, showing a reduction of 23% from the third quarter of 2014. More importantly, we're posting a 45% reduction from full year 2013 on LOE.
In Eagle Ford Shale, our third quarter operating expenses are just over $8 per BOE. This represents over $2 reduction from the second quarter of this year.
On a cash margin basis, we are just over $19 per barrel equivalent in third quarter, and our $20.28 per BOE for 9 months ended. This compares very favorably to our peers and has been stable for Murphy for a long time due to our already-diverse portfolio.
In production, deposit production branch of 7,500 barrel equivalents per day for the quarter is attributable to Sarawak oil, and natural gas deal is performing better, above plan performance on base decline. The Eagle Ford Shale, new volume well -- new well volume's exceeding plan due to EUR increases and completion performance and higher natural gas production from Montney.
Looking ahead to the fourth quarter. Production guidance is estimated to be 199,000 barrel equivalents per day. Our third quarter actual production's higher than our fourth quarter guidance due to higher risk SK natural gas nominations and planned downtime, natural well decline in the Gulf of Mexico and significant reduction in a number of completed wells in the Eagle Ford Shale.
More importantly, we are maintaining our 2015 CapEx of $2.3 billion, some 32% below last year's level when taking to account the sell-down in Malaysia.
In Western Canada. Our natural gas production in Montney in the third quarter of 2015 was over 194 million per day. We've been successful in implementing fractured techniques from our Eagle Ford Shale work to the Montney. Our new completion design with increased same concentrations continued to confirm our 8 to 11 Bcf EURs. Also, we continue to have positive results on our refrac pilot that is underway in some older, tougher wells.
In the Eagle Ford Shale, we're especially pleased with our results for the third quarter, for production average over 63,000 barrels equivalent per day. We brought about 33 new wells online in the third quarter, and we're planning to deliver 20 wells in the fourth, for a total of 136 wells this year.
Our program has been front-loaded as prior disclosed. Production for 2015 full year outlook is now expected to exceed 61,000 barrels equivalent per day, which is 8% above 2014 production.
We continue adding to our total remaining resource in the play by downspacing wells, drilling longer laterals and optimizing completions, to name a few. We now estimate that our total remaining resource has grown to over 800 million barrels. And this growth even takes into account a total review of our resources from a price perspective.
We successfully drilled our first Austin Chalk well in Karnes County, and we're hopeful -- hopefully, we'll be moving this play concept westward to our Catarina area. This will add 1/3 horizon to our Upper and Lower Eagle Ford Shale locations. We drilled the first of 3 well appraisal pilot and are currently analyzing corn logs to better understand the reservoir properties. Our current Austin Chalk appraisal well has a very successful flow rate of 1,500 barrel oil equivalent per day. We look forward to continuing to test Austin Chalk play in 2016.
In Malaysia, we achieved record average daily gas production in Sarawak of 291 million a day. We successfully drilled 2 shallow-water Sarawak oil prospects. The Merapuh 5 and Marakas wells had positive results where we're evaluating development options. These wells are in the Block SK314A area, adjacent to our successful Sarawak oil and gas developments.
The Murphy-operated Paus-Kelasa well failed to encounter commercial quantities of hydrocarbon and was expensed as a dry hole in the quarter.
Offshore Vietnam, we signed a farm-in agreement in the shallow water 15-1/05 block in the prolific, oil-prone Vietnam Cuu Long Basin. 2 discoveries have been made on the block. Murphy participated in the drilling and testing of the LDV-4X well, which successfully tested 2 prospective zones. We're also working with PetroVietnam to advance our footprint in the Cuu Long. This new block entry was made possible by our long-term relationship with our partner and our significant position as a successful operator in both deepwater and shallow water in Malaysia.
In the Gulf of Mexico, production for the quarter was over 27,200 barrel equivalents per day at 71% liquids. We spud the Dalmatian South #2 well during the quarter. We're now completing the wells we found commercial hydrocarbons with over 98 free-to-pay in 2 zones, and we expect first production early next year.
Field development work on the nonoperating Kodiak project continues where the first of 2 wells had been drilled and completed the plan, and modification of topside facilities and subsea execution is underway. We're currently progressing the sidetrack of our Thunder Bird well to plan, and all of our current Gulf of Mexico projects can withstand lower-for-longer prices.
Looking at the drilling program for the fourth quarter 2015 in the Gulf, the nonoperated Solomon well, which is currently projected to reach total depth some time in the fourth quarter, has been included in our dry hole exposure for the fourth quarter. We plan to finish up the year with an oil exploration well, Senyum, located in Block H Malaysia with some nonoperated well to appraise our oil-linked gas discoveries in Brunei.
This time, we have 2 deepwater rigs under contract at Murphy. These contracts expire in 2016, 1 in February; and the other in November. With the continued low commodity prices we're experiencing, an expected reduction in our 2016 CapEx program and an uncertainty about whether working interest partners will agree to participate in drilling programs, we're considering all options. Our current contractual commitments to the end of term for both rigs equals $277 million.
In financials, Murphy has been able to maintain our investment-grade BBB bond rating. We maintained our dividend policy through the year with current yield of 5%. We have $1 billion available under our current revolver. We have over $1.2 billion of cash abroad with marketable securities, and we achieved a net debt-to-EBITDA of less than 1.5.
Production for the fourth quarter is estimated to be 199,000 barrel equivalents per day. Again, we have increased our full year production guidance with a range of 205,000 to 209,000 equivalent per day. Capital expenditures remain unchanged from previous guidance and are currently forecasted to be $2.3 billion.
To close in my comments today, I would like to leave with a few points. Murphy continues to have financial flexibility and strength. We have greatly lowered operating and G&A expenses over the course of the year, and cost reductions remain a priority. Our entry to the Eagle Ford Shale has been an extremely successful addition to Murphy over the past few years. We've built an excellent high-performing team, now producing around 30% of our total volumes in just over 40 years. We, like most peers, continues the efficiencies in cost reductions in drilling and completion activity across all of our operating areas. Our Gulf of Mexico projects generate sound economics at current prices. And over the quarter, we have participated in many positive well results, from the Gulf of Mexico to shallow water Malaysia and to Vietnam and a very high-rate oil test in the Austin Chalk area of Eagle Ford Shale. We continue to execute on all cylinders in a tough commodity environment.
I'd like to now open up the phone for your questions, and thank you."

But we're not opposed to entering into lower-risk opportunities.

The delineation is going very, very well. We're very excited about it. We're talking about -- when we had -- you have 2 types of wells in the world, the big Gulf of Mexico, West Africa, new entry-type wells, and you have lower-risk opportunities in a place like Vietnam where you can drill a well for $15 million and have a 50 million to 100 million barrel-type prospect. So in that space system and F&D perspective, that's a very positive thing. And this is about our strategy, just as about our company. We do work internationally. We are a big major player in Malaysia. We have a strong relationship and a very strong reputation in Southeast Asia, and we were able to -- our expertise in shallow water development there and across other acreage in Vietnam, is the reason we were able to get into this block. And it's very favorable. But I do not consider it to be entry in a wild-up place somewhere. It's very similar geology, what we're used to, very similar areas of operation, very similar cost, very similar well design and a place where we work nearby.

So if you're in the game for a long time, you know on both sides of the rig equation. I've been in -- at that business a long time. And that we have an opportunity to drill well cheaper due to that. And it's a very nice well to drill. It's probably a 60 million barrel, mean-type project near the Conoco-operated Kimbu Bagen [ph] area of Block H. It would be different from the Block H wells we drilled in the past from an exploration basis and totally different from our shallow flat spot gas amplitudes in which we've had enormous success. So we're going to drill that well. It's probably $18 million to $20 million net to Murphy. It's disclosed in our costs here. In Keratau where we've been a nonoperated smaller partner of Brunei, we've had several successes there in a row. This is a continuation towards that commerciality of flowing LNG into Brunei. We do have the right type of partners there, meaning, people that are across the value chain of LNG. And I consider it also to be a lower-risk, lower-cost opportunity, which is what we're looking for, not the big-rank, expensive wells at this particular time."

This would be out in '17, '18 time and would depend on capital allocation next year as we go through -- as you -- what you can imagine a difficult budget cycle. The Merapuh well found extensions of some prior gas that we produce today in Merapuh and another structure, so improved down-dip gas there and some up-dip oil opportunities.

Like I said earlier, I don't have that finalized, and I'm probably not going to be the leader in that pack with the year we've had here. We have some really good wells to drill in Eagle Ford Shale. A $45 base pricing, we have a lot of wells at a 30% rate of return, and that -- and I think that's pretty decent. And the oil prices are $50. We have many wells to drill at 45% rate of return. Incremental going forward, I don't like to do work that way, but this does help when you're allocating capital. So we're going to be allocating capital on the best areas that deliver the best return on that incrementally. We also do not need a lot of rigs to protect our acreage. That's different than it was for -- in times past, and we'll have to do some big capital allocations, study them in the middle of doing so about protecting acreage versus protecting efficiency. The reason we have such efficient operations, we've been running same numbers of rigs for a while now with the same teams. So if you go 4 to 0 to 2 to 3 to 4 to 0, it's hard to do that. So it's almost a situation of allocating capital to remain some level of efficiency, and we're really trying to get to preparing for lower prices here from a cash flow CapEx parity over other things because we cannot continue to outspend our CapEx and wake up one day and be with the credit of other people. We have very good credit situation today, debt-to-cap, and we don't want to wake up with it like the norm and not have done something or looked or attempted to do something to add value to our shares -- to our shareholders. So we're in the middle of all that, and obviously, the Eagle Ford Shale, will be a key part of capital allocation. I think, today, $2.3 billion CapEx for '14, our CapEx in Eagle Ford shale is $855 million, and we're going to be at that percent or more as we cut CapEx because it's a very valuable asset for us. It's going extremely well on everything you can imagine that's known in shale business. We at Murphy have that ability as well, and we are proud about it. And it, too, has incredible flexibility because if things were to get worse, you can reduce it and add to it. You won't have the efficiency when you jump and add, but it's a very nice thing to have, our company of our size and I think very, very material."

We used to think that an 80-acre spacing well would have about a 660,000 EUR. And now we've pulled at 660,000 to 600,000, but we're at 40-acre spacing, so it's an enormous change in resource, both in Upper and Lower Eagle Ford Shale. Tilden would be the same way. We're doing a lot of work with longer laterals there, bigger sand. Today, from back to '12, 2012, we're talking about the same situation where EURs continue to improve there, probably not so much as Karnes. But the big improvement for us is Catarina, which is our most western area, which is a very organized -- we went ground floor there, so we don't have the perfect, giant sections of land that. But Catarina is very, very organized from that perspective. And we have improved the EURs there. We have 3 big ranches there. One area from 210,000 a day -- 210,000 equivalent EUR to over 400,000 with less spacing; and then another area from 210,000 to over 550,000, again, with less spacing; and another area from 210,000 to 600,000. This is enormous change in an area that we drill wells for only $4-point-something million. This is a big deal.

But outside of that, I mean, places like Vietnam, we may -- we have focus there is a very tight around where we want to work. We want to bring that focus tighter. Projects like Kodiak, Kodiak, Vietnam and things in the Gulf are available to us that are not large M&A change your entire capital structure type deals, but they're very helpful on adding barrels. And we do have a Floating LNG coming online. [indiscernible] is going very well. But I mentioned when we took a core there and a well this quarter to continue to confirm our outstanding resource available, and we're partnered with the leading LNG player in the world, Petronas, which is a big deal. So small things like Kodiak, big ones like Vietnam, M&A on top of all that, but we do not have a collapsing R/P in this company. If you take a look at the long-range plan of the company, we do not significantly drop ever our R/P. We just don't have the 12 because we don't have a lot of the gas to make it 12. So that's -- I think it's a misnomer a bit about the resources we have, and we probably need to do a better job of outlining those resources. But it's hard to do that in 2 years when oil prices collapse twice. That's not the time to go out and set expectations. I mean, when you lower CapEx, you have the wrong expectations. It doesn't work well that way. So it's hard to get into that vision that you're asking in these incredible file [ph] of total oil price times. If you want to maintain balance sheet to do transformational things for the company, you can easily outspend and grow production, and in that, not having a transformational change is very easy. I can just pick up the phone and do that. So I decided not to do it that way at this time."

And as you think over the next couple of years that the play that I think it's probably a little bit harder for us to model out, how do you think about production in the Gulf of Mexico over the next couple of years?  Are these -- as you tie in these wells, will these effectively hold production flat or drive moderate growth or moderate declines? Or how should we think about that?"

And that's hard to deal with at this particular time. We have some really nice low-risk opportunity there, like Medusa, replaced 2 wells on Montney and doing very, very well. So we have some additional locations there. It'll be a matter of an oil price recovery. However, tiebacks like Dalmatian South #2 and various other things, tiebacks in the Gulf of Mexico are right up there with returns you have in the Eagle Ford, if you take full cycle into account, meaning, the drilling of the well, the pipeline, et cetera, these things are very economic. We did a higher -- we need a higher oil price run to get into the facility building big exploration successful things, or where we can enter into a well or enter into [indiscernible] during this unique pullback as we have the balance sheet to be able to do so. Those who need oil to be a able to go higher, so if you have a higher vision of oil [ph], you can participate into the Gulf in many, many available projects today. So our ability to operate there, work there and long history of being there and have our business set up that way is very advantageous for us right now. So we have great Eagle Ford Shale business going, and we're executing incredibly well on it. You got to keep in mind, we've built the team 40 years. It's incredible. And then we had been able to look at those opportunities, that long-standing deepwater opportunity where we're not exploring today. But the factor is how do you get comfortable in changing staffing and do that -- to do that again another day when oil prices recover if we choose to do so. But there's a lot of opportunities in, both, and we're very advantaged to be able to look at both of them. And I don't know if many people have that."

Murphy Oil's consolidated results in the third quarter of 2015 were a loss of $1.6 billion, which equates to $9.26 per diluted share. That's compared to a profit of $246 million or $1.37 per diluted share a year ago. The third quarter 2015 results included noncash property impairments of $2.3 billion, which after taxes, amounted to $1.54 billion charge. These impairments were attributable to significant declines in future periods oil prices, which fell by as much as $15 per barrel at quarter end compared to 3 months earlier. The impairments were not related to reductions in the company's reported reserves.
Adjusted earnings, which adjust our GAAP numbers for various items that affect comparability of earnings between periods was a loss of $124 million in the third quarter of 2015, down from our profit of $205 million a year ago. This decline in adjusted earnings was primarily attributable to lower oil and natural gas sales prices in the current year. Our schedule of adjusted earnings is included as part of our earnings release, and the amounts in this schedule are reported on an after-tax basis.
The company's average realized price for its crude oil production fell more than $43 per barrel in the third quarter compared to the prior year. This amounted to a 48% drop between periods in oil prices. Natural gas prices also were weaker in the third quarter 2015 compared to the prior year with average North American gas price realizations dropping $1.21 per Mcf or a decline of 33%. Realized natural gas prices offshore Sarawak also fell by 27%.
Sales prices continued to be soft in October, and therefore, revenues continue to be under pressure as quarter 4 2015 prices remain significantly below prices a year ago.
The company continues to address its cost structure by aggressively reducing both operating and administrative cost. By year-end 2015, we anticipate a 23% reduction in staffing levels compared to a year earlier. At September 30, 2015, Murphy's long-term debt amounted to approximately $3.3 billion, 35.6% of total capital employed, while net debt amounted to just over 25% at the end of the third quarter.
At this time, I'll turn the call over to Roger for his comments."

Looking back at a solid operational third quarter, the following highlights stand out.

Looking back at a solid operational third quarter, the following highlights stand out. Our company remains in a favorable financial position with a healthy balance sheet that's flexible to take advantage of opportunities that arise both in onshore and offshore. With a major pullback in oil prices, we've been able to maintain our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio at less than 1.5. Subsequent to the third quarter, we hedged for 2016 and currently have 20,000 barrels per day in WTI contracts at an average price of $52 per barrel.
On the cost side, we continue to make significant improvements in reducing both operating and G&A expenses on a year-to-year basis. We continue to review our portfolio, as we still have many levers remaining to reposition the company going forward. We're currently reviewing the value of various midstream assets in North America. We're enthusiastic about a new area that we've recently formed into Offshore Vietnam, which expanded our Vietnam footprint with a new block in the highly prospective, oil-prone Cuu Long Basin. Our partnership group was successful in testing our first well, and we're working to increase acreage in this prolific area.
In the Gulf of Mexico, we drilled the Dalmatian South #2. We like what we see here as it has commercial hydrocarbons in 2 separate zones. Currently, the well is being completed with first production expected early next year.
In Malaysia, we achieved record average daily gross production for Sarawak Gas at 291 million per day. In addition, we drilled the Merapuh 5 and Marakas wells with positive results and in the process of evaluating both.
In our onshore business, the Eagle Ford Shale continues to outperform expectations, where we delivered 33 new wells online in the third quarter, plus Montney production continues to be above plan.
Our third quarter production is just over 207,500 barrel equivalents per day, and we're increasing our 2015 annual production guidance to a range of 205,000 to 209,000 barrel equivalents per day. Over the course of the year, we've increased the midpoint of our production guidance from 201,000 barrels equivalents per day to 207,000, almost a 3% increase.
In operations, we're pleased with the ongoing efforts we're making on cost reductions. Our lease operating expenses for the third quarter 2015, excluding Syncrude, is $8.09 per BOE, showing a reduction of 23% from the third quarter of 2014. More importantly, we're posting a 45% reduction from full year 2013 on LOE.
In Eagle Ford Shale, our third quarter operating expenses are just over $8 per BOE. This represents over a $2 reduction from the second quarter of this year.
On a cash margin basis, we are just over $19 per barrel equivalent in third quarter, and our $20.28 per BOE for 9 months ended. This compares very favorably to our peers and has been stable for Murphy for a long time due to our oil-weighted diverse portfolio.
In production, the positive production variance of 7,500 barrel equivalents a day for the quarter is attributable to Sarawak oil and natural gas fields performing better, above-plan performance on base decline, the Eagle Ford Shale new volume well -- new well volumes exceeding plan due to EUR increases and completion performance and higher natural gas production from Montney.
Looking ahead to the fourth quarter. Production guidance is estimated to be 199,000 barrel equivalents per day. Our third quarter actual production's higher than our fourth quarter guidance due to higher-risk SK natural gas nominations and planned downtime, natural well decline in the Gulf of Mexico and significant reduction in the number of completed wells in the Eagle Ford Shale.
More importantly, we are maintaining our 2015 CapEx of $2.3 billion, some 32% below last year's level, when taking into account the sell-down in Malaysia.
In Western Canada, our natural gas production in the Montney in the third quarter of 2015 was over 194 million per day. We've been successful in implementing fracture techniques from our Eagle Ford Shale work to the Montney and our new completion design with increased sand concentrations continued to confirm our 8 to 11 Bcf EURs. Also, we continue to have positive results on our refrac pilot that is underway in some older, tougher wells.
In the Eagle Ford Shale, we're especially pleased with our results for the third quarter, where production averaged over 63,000 barrels equivalent per day. We brought 33 new wells online in the third quarter, and we're planning to deliver 20 wells in the fourth, for a total of 136 wells this year.
Our program has been front-loaded as prior disclosed. Production for 2015 full year outlook is now expected to exceed 61,000 barrels equivalent per day, which is 8% above 2014 production.
We continue adding to our total remaining resource in the play by downspacing wells, drilling longer laterals and optimizing completions, to name a few. We now estimate that our total remaining resource has grown to over 800 million barrels. And this growth even takes into account a total review of our resources from a price perspective.
We successfully drilled our first Austin Chalk well in Karnes County, and we're hopeful -- hopefully, we'll be moving this play concept westward to our Catarina area. This would add a third horizon to our Upper and Lower Eagle Ford Shale locations. We drilled the first of 3 well appraisal pilot and are currently analyzing core logs to better understand the reservoir properties. Our Karnes Austin Chalk appraisal well has a very successful flow rate of 1,500 barrel oil equivalent per day. We look forward to continuing to test the Austin Chalk play in 2016.
In Malaysia, we achieved record average daily gas production in Sarawak of 291 million a day. We successfully drilled 2 shallow-water Sarawak oil prospects. The Merapuh 5 and Marakas wells had positive results, where we are evaluating development options. These wells are in the Block SK 314A area, adjacent to our successful Sarawak oil and gas developments.
The Murphy-operated Paus-Kelasa well failed to encounter commercial quantities of hydrocarbon and was expensed as a dry hole in the quarter.
Offshore Vietnam, we signed a farm-in agreement in the shallow water 15-1/05 block in the prolific, oil-prone Vietnam Cuu Long Basin. Two discoveries have been made in the block. Murphy participated in the drilling and testing of the LDV-4X well, which successfully tested 2 prospective zones. We're also working with PetroVietnam to advance our footprint in the Cuu Long. This new block entry was made possible by our long-term relationship with our partner and our significant position as a successful operator in both deepwater and shallow water in Malaysia.
In the Gulf of Mexico, production for the quarter was over 27,200 barrel equivalents per day at 71% liquids. We spud the Dalmatian South #2 well during the quarter. We're now completing the wells we found commercial hydrocarbons with over 98 feet of pay in 2 zones, and we expect first production early next year.
Field development work on the nonoperated Kodiak project continues, where the first of 2 wells have been drilled and completed to plan, and modification of topside facilities and subsea execution is underway. We're currently progressing the sidetrack of our Thunder Bird well to plan, and all of our current Gulf of Mexico projects can withstand lower-for-longer prices.
Looking at the drilling program for the fourth quarter 2015 in the Gulf, the nonoperated Solomon well, which is currently projected to reach total depth some time in the fourth quarter, has been included in our dry hole exposure for the fourth quarter. We plan to finish off the year with an oil exploration well, Senyum, located in Block H Malaysia, plus an nonoperated well to appraise our oil-linked gas discoveries in Brunei.
At this time, we have 2 deepwater rigs under contract at Murphy. These contracts expire in 2016, one in February and the other in November. With the continued low commodity prices we're experiencing, an expected reduction in our 2016 CapEx program and uncertainty about whether working interest partners will agree to participate in drilling programs, we're considering all options. Our current contractual commitments to the end of term for both rigs equals $277 million.
In financials, Murphy has been able to maintain our investment-grade BBB bond rating. We maintained our dividend policy through the year with current yields of 5%. We have $1 billion available under our current revolver. We have over $1.2 billion of cash abroad with marketable securities, and we achieved a net debt-to-EBITDA of less than 1.5.
Production for the fourth quarter is estimated to be 199,000 barrel equivalents a day. Again, we have increased our full year production guidance at the range of 205,000 to 209,000 equivalent per day. Capital expenditures remain unchanged from previous guidance and are currently forecasted to be $2.3 billion.
To close on my comments today, I would like to leave with a few points. Murphy continues to have financial flexibility and strength. We have greatly lowered operating and G&A expenses over the course of the year, and cost reductions remain a priority. Our entry into the Eagle Ford Shale has been an extremely successful addition to Murphy over the past few years. We've built an excellent high-performing team, now producing around 30% of our total volumes in just over 4 years. We, like most peers, continue to see efficiencies and cost reductions in drilling and completion activity across all of our operating areas. Our Gulf of Mexico projects generate sound economics at current prices. And over the quarter, we have participated in many positive well results, from the Gulf of Mexico to shallow water Malaysia and to Vietnam and a very high-rate well test in the Austin Chalk area of Eagle Ford Shale. We continue to execute on all cylinders in a tough commodity environment.
I'd like to now open up the phone for your questions, and thank you."

But we're not opposed to entering into lower-risk opportunities. It was clear to us that the block did have prior discoveries on them, and we entered into the block and participated in the delineation of both those discoveries. That delineation has gone very, very well. We're very excited about it. We're talking about -- when we had -- you have 2 types of wells in the world, the big Gulf of Mexico, West Africa, new entry-type wells, and you have lower-risk opportunities in a place like Vietnam where you can drill a well for $15 million and have a 50 million to 100 million barrel-type prospect. So on that basis, on an F&D perspective, that's a very positive thing. And this is about our strategy, it's about our company. We do work internationally. We are a big major player in Malaysia. We have a strong relationship and a very strong reputation in Southeast Asia, and we were able to -- our expertise in shallow water development there and across other acreage in Vietnam, is the reason we were able to get into this block. And it's very favorable. But I do not consider it to be entry in a wild off place somewhere. It's a very similar geology, what we're used to, very similar areas of operation, very similar cost, very similar well design and a place where we work nearby.

So if you're in the game for a long time, you're on both sides of the rig equation. I've been in -- at that business a long time. And we have an opportunity to drill the well cheaper due to that. And it's a very nice well to drill. It's probably a 60 million barrel, mean-type project near the Conoco-operated Kebabangan area of Block H. It would be different from the Block H wells we drilled in the past from an exploration basis and totally different from our shallow flat spot gas amplitudes in which we've had enormous success. So we're going to drill that well. It's probably be $18 million to $20 million net to Murphy. It's disclosed in our costs here. In Keratau where we've been a nonoperated smaller partner off Brunei, we've had several successes there in a row. This is a continuation towards that commerciality of flowing LNG into Brunei. We do have the right type of partners there, meaning people that are across the value chain of LNG. And I consider it also to be a lower-risk, lower-cost opportunity, which is what we're looking for, not the big-rank, expensive wells at this particular time."

Like I said earlier, I don't have that finalized, and I'm probably not going to be the leader in that pack with the year we've had here. We have some really good wells to drill in Eagle Ford Shale. At $45 base pricing, we have a lot of wells that are 30% rate of return, and that -- and I think that's pretty decent. And if oil prices are $50, we have many wells to drill at 45% rate of return. Incremental going forward, I don't like to do work that way, but this does help when you're allocating capital. So we're going to be allocating capital on the best areas that deliver the best return on that incrementally. We also do not need a lot of rigs to protect our acreage. That's different than it was for -- in times past, and we'll have to do some big capital allocations, study them. We're in the middle of doing so, about protecting acreage versus protecting efficiency. The reason we have such efficient operations, we've been running same numbers of rigs for a while now with the same teams. So if you go 4 to 0 to 2 to 3 to 4 to 0, it's hard to do that. So it's almost a situation of allocating capital to remain some level of efficiency, and we're really trying to get to preparing for lower prices here from a cash flow CapEx parity over other things because we cannot continue to outspend our CapEx and wake up one day and be with the credit of other people. We have very good credit situation today, debt-to-cap, and we don't want to wake up with it like the norm and not have done something or looked or attempted to do something to add value to our shares -- to our shareholders. So we're in the middle of all that, and obviously, the Eagle Ford Shale will be a key part of capital allocation. I think today, $2.3 billion CapEx for '14, our CapEx in Eagle Ford shale is $855 million, and we're going to be at that percent or more as we cut CapEx, because it's a very valuable asset for us. It's going extremely well on everything you can imagine that's known in the shale business. We at Murphy have that ability as well, and real proud about it. And it, too, has incredible flexibility because if things were to get worse, you can reduce it and add to it. You won't have the efficiency when you jump and add, but it's a very nice thing to have, for a company of our size and I think very, very material."

I think that as I walk through a couple of the fields, I think it's significant. Karnes, where -- is a very prolific area there, as you know, Ryan. We used to think that an 80-acre spacing well would have about a 660,000 EUR. And now we've pulled that 660,000 to 600,000, but we're at 40-acre spacing, so it's an enormous change in resource, both in Upper and Lower Eagle Ford Shale. Tilden would be the same way. We're doing a lot of work with longer laterals there, bigger sand. Today, from back to '12, 2012, we're talking about the same situation where EURs continue to improve there, probably not so much as Karnes. But the big improvement for us is Catarina, which is our most western area, which is a very organized -- we went ground floor there, so we don't have the perfect, giant sections of land. But Catarina is very, very organized from that perspective. And we have improved the EURs there. We have 3 big ranches there. One area from 210,000 a day -- 210,000 equivalent EUR to over 400,000 with less spacing; and then another area from 210,000 to over 550,000, again with less spacing; and another area from 210,000 to 600,000. This is enormous change in an area that we drill wells for only 4-point-something million dollars. This is a big deal. And that we may not have it all modeled in yet, but our trajectory and where we're headed there, it's a -- it's very, very positive, in my view."

I think when you speak in a nice way about the R/P, you know that's very frustrating to me. The R/P has been 8 for a long time. It's going to be 8 for a long time. But from an oil-weighted perspective, we're probably fifth place out of 16 peers. If you take the R/P that's really truly oil. We're very limited. We'd probably be the lowest NGL R/P player and very, very low on natural gas. That's quite frustrating to me because it's a view that we don't have any locations. If this year, in the Eagle Ford Shale, we're going to drill and operate about 136 wells down there, or bring online 136 wells, and we probably have 3,000 locations to go. So this idea that Eagle Ford Shale is not material for a company that has 756 million barrels of proven and now a resource size remaining of 800 million barrels is mind-boggling to me, and it's very well-known how this project models.

Projects like Kodiak, Kodiak, Vietnam and things in the Gulf are available to us that are not large M&A, change your entire capital structure type deals, but they're very helpful on adding barrels. And we do have the Floating LNG coming online. Malaysia is going very well. I didn't mention it, but we took a core there in a well there this quarter to continue to confirm our outstanding resource available, and we're partnered with the leading LNG player in the world, Petronas, which is a big deal. So small things like Kodiak, big ones like Vietnam, M&A on top of all that, but we do not have a collapsing R/P in this company. If you take a look at the long-range plan of the company, we do not significantly drop ever our R/P. We just don't have the 12 because we don't have a lot of gas to make it 12. So that's -- I think it's a misnomer a bit about the resources we have, and we probably need to do a better job of outlining those resources. But it's hard to do that in 2 years when oil prices collapse twice. That's not the time to go out and set expectations. And then when you lower CapEx, you have the wrong expectations. It doesn't work well that way. So it's hard to get into that vision that you're asking in these incredible volatile oil price times. If you want to maintain balance sheet to do transformational things in the company, you can easily outspend and grow production, and end up not having a transformational change. It's very easy. I can just pick up the phone and do that. So decided not to do it that way at this time."

And as you think over the next couple of years, as it's the play that I think is probably a little bit harder for us to model out, how do you think about production in the Gulf of Mexico over the next couple of years?  Are these -- as you tie in these wells, will these effectively hold production flat, will it drive moderate growth or moderate declines? Or how should we think about that?"

And that's hard to deal with at this particular time. We have some really nice low-risk opportunities there, like Medusa, where we placed 2 wells online and doing very, very well. So we have some additional locations there. It'll be a matter of an oil price recovery. However, tiebacks like Dalmatian South #2 and various other things, tiebacks in the Gulf of Mexico are right up there with returns you have in Eagle Ford, if you take full cycle into account, meaning the drilling of the well, the pipeline, et cetera, these things are very economic. We'd need a higher -- we need a higher oil price, Ryan, to get into facility building big exploration successful things, or where we can enter into a well or enter into a [indiscernible] ground floor during this unique pullback because we have the balance sheet to be able to do so. Those need oil to be a little higher, so if you have a higher vision of oil, you can participate into the Gulf in many, many available projects today. So our ability to operate there, work there and long history of being there and have our business set up that way is very advantageous for us right now. So we have great Eagle Ford Shale business going, and we're executing incredibly well on it. You got to keep in mind, we've built this team in 4 years. It's incredible. And then we have been able to look at those opportunities.  We have a longstanding deepwater team, where we're not exploring today. But the factor is how do we get comfortable in changing staffing and doing that -- to do that again another day when oil prices recover if we choose to do so. But there's a lot of opportunities in both, and we're very advantaged to be able to look at both of them. And I don't know if many people have that."

Not with taxes and all that. You know there's different aspects of this, as you know. Last year, around $11, this year in Eagle Ford Shale, looking at $10, $10.20 or so for the year, all year-end, because we had some higher costs pull over into the first quarter. And next year, we're probably looking at $8 and change. That's really good. I think in Canada, we made incredible OpEx improvements at both Montney and Seal. Seal, of course, is very challenged from a pricing perspective. And so onshore areas I think are good -- the ups and downs are in an offshore business. You have to model it, Brian, a little bit to get that value. And so we had a good year in offshore, especially in the Gulf, and then it will come. You have subsea inspections, peak, intelligent peaking of pipelines and it makes the quarter a little bit jumpy in that regard. But overall, as a company, I think that we're, like I said earlier in the call, we're looking at $9.65, which is probably a record here of LOE and then looking at right around $9 for all of the year, all of our business. So that's -- we've probably done a lot of that heavy lifting. That would account for, if there are levels of production, dropping of whatever due to capital, which will be the rage of the next few months. That can handle that, in my opinion."
