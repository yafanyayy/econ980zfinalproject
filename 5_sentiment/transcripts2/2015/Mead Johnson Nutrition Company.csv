At the end of our prepared remarks, I will then provide a few summary remarks before I give you the opportunity to ask questions or request clarification. 
Let me now turn to our discussion of 2014. As you likely read in our press release issued this morning, we ended the year on a strong note. Despite accelerating headwinds from foreign exchange, we delivered earnings per share slightly above prior guidance and we closed another year of strong revenue growth. Revenue growth in the fourth quarter of 2014 was 8% in constant dollars and 3% in reported U.S. dollars over prior year's quarter. On a non-GAAP basis, earnings per share for the quarter came in at $0.92, up from $0.82 in the same quarter of 2013. Throughout the year, we saw the value of our geographic diversification. Despite challenges an individual market including China, we delivered constant dollar revenue growth of 9% for the full year 2014. Volume contributed 4 percentage points to our growth rate while higher pricing added 5 points. 200 basis points of growth came from pricing in the high-inflation environments of Argentina and Venezuela. We saw volume growth in each of our regions. After several years of weakness, our persistent investments in North America are paying off, and our North America/Europe segment grew volume faster than any other region last year. Latin America continued to show steady volume growth despite challenges in several markets within South America. And in Asia, we saw revenue growth decelerate as performance in mainland China adversely affected results for the broader region. I'll address this in more detail in a moment. 
We faced significant headwinds from foreign exchange throughout the year. This reduced our revenue growth by 4 percentage points when translated into U.S. dollars. As a result, reported U.S. dollar revenue growth was 5% for the full year 2014. The unfavorable trend in the currency markets accelerated in the fourth quarter, impacting all 3 reporting segments. 
Turning now to earnings. Non-GAAP earnings per share of $3.74 for the year was up 7% versus 2013. Our rate of earnings growth was well above the 5% increase we saw in reported U.S. dollar revenue. In light of gross margin headwinds from adverse foreign exchange movements, higher dairy costs and start-up costs associated with our new Singapore facility were satisfied with improvement in earnings. Our ability to leverage growth in revenue for even faster growth in earnings is the result of our commitment to prudent cost management and the effectiveness of our ongoing productivity programs. As an example, we continue to invest aggressively behind our brands and key innovation projects but found efficiencies through procurement efforts and optimized media strategies that allow us to meet our revenue goals with marketing spend as a lower percentage of sales. Before I comment on the outlook for 2015, let me briefly comment on the performance within each of our reporting segments. 
Firstly, turning to our Asia segment. In the fourth quarter, our business in Asia grew 3% on a constant dollar basis. As mentioned previously, revenue growth for the region was adversely affected by our China business. As I mentioned in our last call, we reduced trade inventory in China during the third quarter and early fourth quarter in advance of an Enfa relaunch in late October. We are monitoring consumer uptake following the launch closely, and we continue to see retailers reduce inventory across categories as they adopt a more cautious stand in light of a moderating growth in GDP. 
I should also note that our 2013 base for comparison was particularly tough due to an impact of a recall by several competitors in the second half of that year. On a full year basis, constant dollar sales in Asia were up 7%. Our China/Hong Kong business grew 5%. As I've stated in the past, we are currently under index in the higher growth channels in China particularly the e-commerce and premium segment that focus mostly on imported products. As we have discussed in China, just a brief note on the status of our China-related investigation. Our internal investigation has progressed, and we've shared the results of our work today with both the SEC and the Department of Justice, and we are responding to their request for additional information. At this time, we can't predict how or when the matter will be resolved. I'm sure you'll appreciate that I can't provide further details at this point. 
Let me now comment on results in the balance of Asia where we saw strong sales growth in 2014. The Philippines, Thailand and Malaysia all delivered very strong revenue growth based on strong execution and innovation underpinned our progress in all 3 countries. GDP growth remains strong across most of Southeast Asia, and the fundamental growth drivers for the category and Mead Johnson remain intact. EBIT for the Asia segment increased as revenue grew in 2014, but the resulting improvement was substantially offset by higher dairy cost that adversely impacted profit margins. 
Turning now to Latin America. Constant dollar revenue growth -- rose 14% in the fourth quarter of 2014 over the same quarter of 2013. Volume was up 3%. Improved pricing added 11 points of growth to the quarter. On a constant dollar basis, revenue was up 16% for the full year. Volume increased by 6%, and higher pricing contributed 10 percentage points to our growth. 
Foreign exchange movements once again impacted results for the segment. The strengthening dollar and resulting depreciation of local currencies reduced U.S. dollar sales by 15% in full year 2014, more than offsetting pricing gains. Most of our pricing gains were seen in Venezuela and Argentina. Despite this, in aggregate, we failed to fully offset currency weakness through price in these 2 high-inflation countries. Our performance across Mexico, the Caribbean and Central America provided a highlight within the region. We experienced strong revenue growth as we relaunched our Enfa franchise and introduced several new products towards the end of the year. Despite a tough economic environment in Brazil, we continue to grow our market share and infant formula category there. Our children's business, which is more sensitive to economic fluctuations had a difficult year, however. And overall performance was less strong that it has been in recent years. EBIT for our Latin America segment compared unfavorably to prior year quarter and full year. This was primarily due to the foreign exchange and to a lesser extent, higher dairy cost. 
Let me now turn to our North America/Europe segment. In the fourth quarter of 2014, the North America/Europe segment delivered stronger-than-expected revenue growth. Constant dollar revenue was up 14% on prior year's quarter. And on a full year basis, constant dollar revenue increased 10% over 2013. Pete will provide further detail on this in a moment. The improved performance in North America and Europe was driven by strong share gains in infant formula as well as continued progress towards our stated goal of building a strong and profitable children's business with Enfagrow. We've invested substantially behind our North American brands in recent years, and we're now reaping the rewards. Sales of Enfagrow grew by over 20% in 2014 with demand rising rapidly in both the United States and Canada. While we rarely highlight our European business due to its relative size, I should mention that European profits improved substantially in 2014, and revenue growth was similar to that of North America. Our 2012 restructuring that refocused our efforts in our specialty business continues to pay off. Revenue growth was driven by share gains within the growing European allergy segment. EBIT margin in the segment improved substantially during the year driven by pricing gains and our turnaround and Europe. 
Before I hand over to Pete, let me now wrap up with our perspective of 2015. We look forward to another year of solid sales and earnings growth despite a tougher global macroeconomic climate. There are 3 important factors to keep in mind as we think about 2015. Firstly, let me address our expectations for revenue growth. We expect revenue growth in constant dollars of around 7%. We expect lower commodity costs and currency-related inflationary pressure on governments in many countries will combine to create a more difficult pricing environment even as we introduce innovations. Conversely, we are hopeful a stronger economic climate in the United States will allow us to continue to recover through price the investments made in innovation and product improvement over the past 5 years. 
Secondly, going forward, we expect our profit margins to benefit from lower commodity costs and a weakening euro. That said, approximately 75% of our sales are booked in currencies other than the U.S. dollar while many of our cost are dollar-denominated. So despite our expectation for margin improvement as we move through 2015, there'll be some offsetting effect. 
Thirdly and finally, we intend to continue to invest behind product innovation and marketing initiatives at a level consistent with our growth ambition. I'm excited with our plans for 2015 and look forward to sharing more details with you as we move through the year. 
So to repeat, we expect full year constant dollar sales growth to be around 7%. Pricing will likely make a smaller contribution to sales growth than it did in 2014. And based on some improvement in expected profit margins, we estimate non-GAAP earnings per share for 2015 to be in the range of $3.90 to $4. 
I will now turn the call over to Pete who will provide more detailed commentary in our financial results and our outlook. I'll then return to provide some closing remarks before we field your questions. Pete, over to you"
1002291,280963679,750846,"Mead Johnson Nutrition Company, Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Jan 29, 2015",2015-01-29,"Earnings Calls","Mead Johnson Nutrition Company","Executives","Thanks, Kasper, and good morning, everyone. Kasper addressed constant dollar sales growth, so I'll focus first on foreign exchange.

Kasper addressed constant dollar sales growth, so I'll focus first on foreign exchange. There's been a lot of press about foreign exchange accompanying earnings reports for multinationals, so I'm going to get into a bit more detail in that topic than I might otherwise have done. While there's no doubt that FX is becoming more significant headwind, please keep in mind that our EPS guidance range still anticipates good leverage of sales growth. After discussing currency effects, I'll walk down the income statement providing highlights in both our 2014 results and our 2015 guidance. I'll then share a few noteworthy items on our balance sheet and cash flow. Unless otherwise noted, my comments will be on a non-GAAP basis. 
As Kasper detailed, constant dollar sales grew by 9% in 2014. Foreign exchange reduced full year sales growth by 4%, resulting in reported sales growth of 5%. The dollar started to strengthen noticeably in the third quarter, and this trend accelerated in the fourth quarter. The stronger dollar reduced EPS by about $0.28 during the full year of 2014, including both translation and balance sheet remeasurement impacts, more than double the impact we experienced in 2013. Note that we mitigate the impact of foreign exchange through higher pricing. 
There were 2 critical factors at work. First, we saw a very significant devaluations in Venezuela and to a lesser extent, in Argentina. These 2 markets accounted for almost 2/3 of the total earnings degradation from foreign exchange in 2014. Despite taking significant price increases in both markets, we could not fully offset the impact of rapidly weakening currencies. The second factor relates to the Chinese renminbi. In the past, I pointed out the natural currency protection from the ongoing strengthening of the renminbi when other currencies in Asia and Latin America devalued. This was not the case in 2014. For the first time since our IPO, the renminbi weakened slightly against the dollar on a full year basis. In the prior 3 years from 2011 through 2013, the renminbi strengthened by about 2.5% on average, so there was no favorable offset from this important currency last year. 
We expect to see adverse foreign exchange impacts continue in 2015 based on the recent and pronounced strengthening of the dollar across a very broad basket of currencies in Asia and Latin America. The weaker euro helped to reduce the impact on our bottom line since we export products into China and Hong Kong from the Netherlands, but the breadth and magnitude of the decline elsewhere outweighs the euro benefit. 
Over the last 3 months, the dollar strengthened by an average of about 3% for the company. Practically every market was affected including China. As a result, we believe our largest market will continue to contribute to unfavorable foreign exchange in 2015. If exchange rates remain at their current level but allowing for some continued modest devaluation in Venezuela and Argentina later in the year, we expect foreign exchange to lower sales growth by 4% in 2015. On the same basis, earnings per share would be reduced by at least $0.13 relative to 2014. Another 1% strengthening of the dollar against all currencies where we operate would lead to further reductions in EPS of about $0.05 per share on a full year basis, just from translation only. 
I want to mention a bit more about Venezuela. The conditions in Venezuela continue to deteriorate with the drop in prices. You may recall we use the SICAD I exchange rate, which currently stands at about VEF 12 to the dollar to translate our financial statement. For Mead Johnson, the government provided access to dollars at the official rate of 6.3, which results in a favorable cash settlement currency gain when these funds are received. We use these dollars to pay our Mexican manufacturing operation for products imported into Venezuela. We believe there will be a reduction in these cash settlement FX gains in 2015 for 2 reasons. First, we enter the new year with a lower intercompany payable from our Venezuelan subsidiary. And second, over the past quarter, we've seen a slowdown in access to U.S. dollars and expect this to continue given the significant revenue shortfall faced by the government. The complicated situation in Venezuela, by itself, is another significant foreign exchange downside risk for the company. 
Turning to profitability. We delivered a gross margin of 61.9% in the fourth quarter, up sequentially from 60.2% in the third quarter as we started to realize the benefit from lower dairy prices. On a full year basis, gross margin was in line with our guidance at 61.9% yet down 170 basis points from 2013 as higher dairy costs, adverse foreign exchange and Singapore start-up costs more than offset higher prices and productivity efforts. Cost savings from productivity stood at about 3.5% of our cost of goods sold, slightly above our 3% target. 
Turning to 2015. We expect gross margin will approach 63.5% for the full year, consistent with the level seen in 2013. Lower dairy costs are the key driver. Keep in mind that spot dairy prices are reflected in our cost of goods sold in a 7-month lag. We expect continued quarterly improvement in gross margin on a sequential basis as we progress through 2015. Higher dairy prices last year affected Asia more than any other geographic segment. As a result, the 2015 gross margin improvement will be most visible in that region. 
Finally, costs associated with the start-up of the Singapore manufacturing facility reduced earnings by about $0.10 per share in 2014. Given that the plant is now operational and increasing throughput steadily, we expect to see that expense cut in half to about $0.05 in 2015. We anticipate a further reduction in start-up expenses in 2016 when the plant reaches full capacity. Last year, operating expenses came in at 38% of sales, down 160 basis points from 39.6% in 2013. On a constant dollar basis, we increased demand generation investments, including advertising and promotion, sales force and marketing expenses by about $50 million on top of record spending in 2013. But these investments still grew at a lower rate than reported sales. It is worth noting that R&D spending continue to be strong at 2.5% of sales last year. 
Other income and expense also drove favorable operating expenses measured on a percent of sales basis in 2014 versus the prior year. The cash settlement currency gains in Venezuela that I mentioned earlier was one item at work along with the benefit associated with the sale of our equity interest in the Saudi joint venture to Almarai. For 2015, we intend to reinvest a portion of our higher gross margins back into the business through higher demand generation spending. In addition, we will not have the benefit from the Almarai sales and expect lower cash settlement gains in Venezuela. As a result, operating expenses are anticipated to come in around 39% of sales. 
Given the assumptions I just outlined for both gross margins and operating expenses, 2015 EBIT margins should approach 24.5%, up from 23.8% in 2014 and the highest EBIT margin for the company since 2009. 
Looking at taxes, our non-GAAP effective tax rate or ETR was 22.5% in 2014, which included a $0.05 per share nonrecurring tax benefit that we recognized in the third quarter. Without that benefit, the normalized rate would've been around 23.5%. That's a bit better than our prior guidance for 2014 and added a $0.01 or $0.02 to fourth quarter EPS versus earlier expectations. Our 2015 global ETR is estimated to come in about 24%. This anticipates increased benefits from the new Singapore facility but also our plans to repatriate more earnings from outside the U.S. 
Moving on to interest expense, 2014 was a productive year on the financing front. We refinanced $500 million in notes due in late 2014 with new 30-year bonds at a very attractive rate, significantly extending our long-term debt maturity. We also increased our revolver from $500 million to $750 million while securing lower fees and extending the maturity in additional 3 years. In 2015, we anticipate interest expense will be just under $60 million. 
To summarize our 2015 non-GAAP guidance, we expect constant dollar sales growth of 7% this year with foreign exchange reducing sales growth by 4%. As a result, reported sales would increase by about 3%. 
Turning to segment performance. 2015 constant dollar sales growth in Asia should be similar to the company's overall level of growth around 7%, which is consistent with 2014. However, we expect our pricing will contribute less to growth in 2015 on lower commodity cost while volume growth will be stronger. As a result, the quality of our growth in Asia should improve. In Latin America, we anticipate that constant dollar sales growth will be in the low to mid-teens. 
Turning to North America/Europe. During 2014, we added 2 new WIC contracts, gained non-WIC market share for infant formula and increased our distribution for Enfagrow. We do not expect to see the same gains in 2015. While we obviously strive for higher market share, the impressive 2014 performance is not likely to repeat. In addition, we believe that a few retailers built their inventory late in the year, which contributed to our strong fourth quarter results. As a result, we're forecasting 2015 growth for North America/Europe at a rate below that for the company on a constant dollar basis. 
Non-GAAP earnings are expected to be the range of $3.90 to $4 per share, growth of about 4% to 7%. The lower end of our range assumes a slightly more pessimistic foreign exchange environment, among other factors while still allowing EPS leverage relative to sales. Please note that we expect tougher comparisons in the first half of 2015. This is due in part to more favorable performance in the first half of 2014 both in China and with the more favorable exchange rate environment. The timing of capacity expansions will help comparisons to a greater extent in the second half of the year. 
Just a quick comment on the specified cost excluded from our non-GAAP results. We saw an unfavorable $0.13 per share hit from our mark-to-market pension liabilities in the quarter. This is largely attributed to the adoption of new actuarial mortality tables that's required of most companies. In addition, further softening in interest rates also had an impact. 
Wrapping up with our balance sheet and cash flow. Our cash balance was $1.3 billion at the end of 2014, up about $250 million from the prior year. Note that cash held in the United States was about $215 million, down from $360 million in the prior year. This is what drives the need for greater cash repatriation from abroad during 2015. 
Free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures, was $607 million during 2014, up 7% from the prior year. The change was mainly from lower capital spending and higher earnings as we completed the Singapore construction mid-year. Higher cash flow in 2014 allowed us to increase our dividend by double digits to $1.50 per share. For 2015, capital spending is estimated about $175 million, consistent with our longer-term target of about 4% of sales. Depreciation and amortization expense is expected to be around $100 million, up from $92 million in 2014 but we'll have a full year of depreciation of the Singapore facility. With that, I'll now turn the call back to Kasper"

And then just related to that, if I remember correctly, when you launched Enfa or when you launched a new product in China, it didn't come with a price increase.

My comments regarding reduction in retail inventory, I think, is fairly consistent with what you've heard from many other companies in the consumer products space allude to over the past few weeks and months. It's clear that this slowdown in the Chinese economy is causing most businesspeople, including retailers, to take a more cautious stance. And I think it's also fair to say that the retail trade in China but really right across Asia has for several years been characterized by very, very high levels of inventory. I'm glad to say that I think we are at the more conservative end of the spectrum when it comes to allowing retailers to buy inventory. So I'm not trying to signal any significant sort of abrupt change in the coming months, but we are clearly seeing retailers, many purchases quite carefully. So I hope that helps a little bit."

Can you talk about what the underlying growth rate kind of net of all these effects? And maybe if I could just throw one other piece of confusion into this question we hear at the local companies in China talk briefly about the slowdown in the category, but they appear to be being very negatively affected by the growth of the Internet channel, which appears to be to the favor of the multinational companies like Mead.

Firstly, I should point out that volume growth on a full year basis was plus 2%. But irrespective of that, I think we would still ordinarily expect to see higher volume growth, which I think is really your point, and I concur with that. It's really entirely driven by the change in the China environment. We've said -- I think we've been fairly explicit about the fact that we are -- we are not currently participating as strongly as we would like in the highest growth channels, particularly the e-commerce channel, which is favoring heavily imported brands mostly out of Europe and Australia, New Zealand. And then secondly, the slowing environment in China is clearly sort of hitting everybody. So it's really a China-specific dynamic, and I'll be even more explicit about that, I would say this is mainland China-specific dynamic where as I would say the rest of Asia has been pretty much business as usual, which, as you know, is very positive."

So to the extent that you see, for instance, rising sales in baby stores, you will automatically see the same rise in the Internet channel because that is a major sourcing point for the baby store channel. So we're wary of that. We believe that is likely that there will be some slowdown in the growth particularly in the baby store channel, and that's consistent with what we've seen now really since the beginning of 2013. That channel went through a very rapid pace of expansion as additional stores were opened. But it's much less clear to me that on a same-store basis, that channel is growing as fast as it used to be. But the Internet channel remains interesting. It remains a high priority for us, and we have a number of initiatives in place again to strengthen our profile in that channel."

And there's 3 things going on there, each of which costs us about $0.02 a share for the company. One is the impact of just translating our local currency results into dollars. One is the impact of the fact that we have more cash sitting there because the government hasn't made dollars available to us for the last 3 months. That means when a devaluation comes through, there's a bigger balance sheet remeasurement impact. And then the third of those cash settlement gains when we get cash paid -- cash basically -- the dollars made available to us at the rate of 6 versus the 12, which is what we're using for translation. Each of those is about $0.02 in '15 versus '14. So some is already included in there, but it could be worse than that, too. And certainly, the black market rates is much higher. In the past, I think, it's been high as 50 versus the 12 that the government SICAD I exchange rate, but the volume of that isn't that high, quite frankly. And you would always expect to see the black market rate when currency isn't allowed to trade freely at a super high level. So -- but there is real exposure, and I would say we try to think through that in the guidance range that we've given as one item, but it certainly could be worse than what would be included in our guidance.

Maybe I'll just finish by sort of adding on to your question about Venezuela and say that it's important to understand that our product category, just like the pharmaceutical imports here that go into Venezuela, is considered a high-priority category by the Venezuelan government, which indicates, I think, a likelihood that they will continue to strive to make foreign exchange available to importers of our category and that they would be very reluctant to see the category being priced at, say, the black market rate, which would obviously have an enormous inflationary impact on product pricing in the marketplace. So though we are always cautious about Venezuela and careful, I don't want to send a signal that you should be kind of panicking about the topic."

I'll then turn the call over to Pete, who will provide more details on our financial performance and our outlook. At the end of our prepared remarks, I will then provide a few summary remarks before I give you the opportunity to ask questions or request clarification. 
Let me now turn to our discussion of 2014. As you likely read in our press release issued this morning, we ended the year on a strong note. Despite accelerating headwinds from foreign exchange, we delivered earnings per share slightly above prior guidance, and we closed another year of strong revenue growth. Revenue growth in the fourth quarter of 2014 was 8% in constant dollars and 3% in reported U.S. dollars over prior year's quarter. On a non-GAAP basis, earnings per share for the quarter came in at $0.92, up from $0.82 in the same quarter of 2013. 
Throughout the year, we saw the value of our geographic diversification. Despite challenges in individual markets, including China, we delivered constant dollar revenue growth of 9% for the full year 2014. Volume contributed 4 percentage points to our growth rate, while higher pricing added 5 points. 200 basis points of growth came from pricing in the high-inflation environments of Argentina and Venezuela. We saw volume growth in each of our regions. After several years of weakness, our persistent investments in North America are paying off. And our North America/Europe segment grew volume faster than any other region last year. Latin America continued to show steady volume growth despite challenges in several markets within South America. And in Asia, we saw revenue growth decelerate as performance in mainland China adversely affected results for the broader region. I'll address this in more detail in a moment. 
We faced significant headwinds from foreign exchange throughout the year. This reduced our revenue growth by 4 percentage points when translated into U.S. dollars. As a result, reported U.S. dollar revenue growth was 5% for the full year 2014. The unfavorable trend in the currency markets accelerated in the fourth quarter, impacting all 3 reporting segments. 
Turning now to earnings. Non-GAAP earnings per share of $3.74 for the year was up 7% versus 2013. Our rate of earnings growth was well above the 5% increase we saw in reported U.S. dollar revenue. In light of gross margin headwinds from adverse foreign exchange movements, higher dairy costs and start-up costs associated with our new Singapore facility we're satisfied with the improvement in earnings. Our ability to leverage growth in revenue for even faster growth in earnings is the result of our commitment to prudent cost management and the effectiveness of our ongoing productivity programs. As an example, we continue to invest aggressively behind our brands and key innovation projects but found efficiencies through procurement efforts and optimized media strategies that allowed us to meet our revenue goals with marketing spend as a lower percentage of sales. Before I comment on the outlook for 2015, let me briefly comment on the performance within each of our reporting segments. 
Firstly, turning to our Asia segment. In the fourth quarter, our business in Asia grew 3% on a constant dollar basis. As mentioned previously, revenue growth for the region was adversely impacted by our China business. As I mentioned in our last call, we reduced trade inventory in China during the third quarter and early fourth quarter in advance of an Enfa relaunch in late October. We are monitoring consumer offtake following the launch closely, and we continue to see retailers reduce inventory across categories as they adopt a more cautious stand in light of a moderating growth in GDP. 
I should also note that our 2013 base for comparison was particularly tough due to an impact of a recall by several competitors in the second half of that year. On a full year basis, constant dollar sales in Asia were up 7%. Our China/Hong Kong business grew 5%. As I've stated in the past, we are currently under indexed in the higher growth channels in China, particularly the e-commerce and super-high premium segment that focus mostly on imported products. 
As we have discussed in China, just a brief note on the status of our China-related investigation. Our internal investigation has progressed, and we've shared the results of our work to date with both the SEC and the Department of Justice. And we are responding to their request for additional information. At this time, we can't predict how or when the matter will be resolved. I'm sure you'll appreciate that I can't provide further details at this point. 
Let me now comment on results in the balance of Asia where we saw strong sales growth in 2014. The Philippines, Thailand and Malaysia all delivered very strong revenue growth based on strong execution and innovation, underpinned our progress in all 3 countries. GDP growth remains strong across most of Southeast Asia, and the fundamental growth drivers for the category and Mead Johnson remain intact. EBIT for the Asia segment increased as revenue grew in 2014, but the resulting improvement was substantially offset by higher dairy cost that adversely impacted profit margins. 
Turning now to Latin America. Constant dollar revenue growth -- rose 14% in the fourth quarter of 2014 over the same quarter of 2013. Volume was up 3%. Improved pricing added 11 points of growth to the quarter. On a constant dollar basis, revenue was up 16% for the full year. Volume increased by 6%, and higher pricing contributed 10 percentage points to our growth. 
Foreign exchange movements once again impacted results for the segment. The strengthening dollar and resulting depreciation of local currencies reduced U.S. dollar sales by 15% in full year 2014, more than offsetting pricing gains. Most of our pricing gains were seen in Venezuela and Argentina. Despite this, in aggregate, we failed to fully offset currency weakness through price in these 2 high-inflation countries. 
Our performance across Mexico, the Caribbean and Central America provided a highlight within the region. We experienced strong revenue growth as we relaunched our Enfa franchise and introduced several new products towards the end of the year. Despite a tough economic environment in Brazil, we continue to grow our market share of the infant formula category there. Our children's business, which is more sensitive to economic fluctuations, had a difficult year however. And overall performance was less strong than it has been in recent years. EBIT for our Latin America segment compared unfavorably to prior-year quarter and full year. This was primarily due to the foreign exchange, and to a lesser extent, higher dairy cost. 
Let me now turn to our North America/Europe segment. In the fourth quarter of 2014, the North America/Europe segment delivered stronger-than-expected revenue growth. Constant dollar revenue was up 14% on prior year's quarter. And on a full year basis, constant dollar revenue increased 10% over 2013. Pete will provide further detail on this in a moment. The improved performance in North America and Europe was driven by strong share gains in infant formula as well as continued progress towards our stated goal of building a strong and profitable children's business with Enfagrow. We've invested substantially behind our North American brands in recent years, and we're now reaping the rewards. 
Sales of Enfagrow grew by over 20% in 2014 with demand rising rapidly in both the United States and Canada. While we rarely highlight our European business due to its relative size, I should mention that European profits improved substantially in 2014, and revenue growth was similar to that of North America. Our 2012 restructuring that we focused our efforts on our specialty business continues to pay off. Revenue growth was driven by share gains within a growing European allergy segment. EBIT margin in the segment improved substantially during the year driven by pricing gains and our turnaround in Europe. 
Before I hand over to Pete, let me now wrap up with our perspective of 2015. We look forward to another year of solid sales and earnings growth despite a tougher global macroeconomic climate. There are 3 important factors to keep in mind as we think about 2015. Firstly, let me address our expectations for revenue growth. We expect revenue growth in constant dollars of around 7%. We expect lower commodity costs and currency-related inflationary pressure on governments in many countries will combine to create a more difficult pricing environment even as we introduce innovations. Conversely, we are hopeful a stronger economic climate in the United States will allow us to continue to recover through price the investments made in innovation and product improvement over the past 5 years. 
Secondly, going forward, we expect our profit margins to benefit from lower commodity costs and a weakening euro. That said, approximately 75% of our sales are booked in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, while many of our costs are dollar denominated. So despite our expectation for margin improvement as we move through 2015, there'll be some offsetting effect. 
Thirdly and finally, we intend to continue to invest behind product innovation and marketing initiatives at a level consistent with our growth ambition. I'm excited with our plans for 2015 and look forward to sharing more details with you as we move through the year. 
So to repeat, we expect full year constant dollar sales growth to be around 7%. Pricing will likely make a smaller contribution to sales growth than it did in 2014. And based on some improvement in expected profit margins, we estimate non-GAAP earnings per share for 2015 to be in the range of $3.90 to $4. 
I will now turn the call over to Pete, who will provide more detailed commentary on our financial results and our outlook. I'll then return to provide some closing remarks before we field your questions. Pete, over to you."
1002291,280963679,751235,"Mead Johnson Nutrition Company, Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Jan 29, 2015",2015-01-29,"Earnings Calls","Mead Johnson Nutrition Company","Executives","Thanks, Kasper, and good morning, everyone. Kasper addressed constant dollar sales growth, so I'll focus first on foreign exchange. There's been a lot of press about foreign exchange accompanying earnings reports for multinationals, so I'm going to get in",1920,"Thanks, Kasper, and good morning, everyone. Kasper addressed constant dollar sales growth, so I'll focus first on foreign exchange. There's been a lot of press about foreign exchange accompanying earnings reports for multinationals, so I'm going to get into a bit more detail in that topic than I might otherwise have done. While there's no doubt that FX has become a more significant headwind, please keep in mind that our EPS guidance range still anticipates good leverage of sales growth. After discussing currency effects, I'll walk down the income statement providing highlights on both our 2014 results and our 2015 guidance. I'll then share a few noteworthy items on our balance sheet and cash flow. Unless otherwise noted, my comments will be on a non-GAAP basis. 
As Kasper detailed, constant dollar sales grew by 9% in 2014. Foreign exchange reduced full year sales growth by 4%, resulting in reported sales growth of 5%. The dollar started to strengthen noticeably in the third quarter, and this trend accelerated in the fourth quarter. The stronger dollar reduced EPS by about $0.28 during the full year of 2014, including both translation and balance sheet remeasurement impacts, more than double the impact we experienced in 2013. Note that we mitigate the impact of foreign exchange through higher pricing. 
There were 2 critical factors at work. First, we saw very significant devaluations in Venezuela, and to a lesser extent, in Argentina. These 2 markets accounted for almost 2/3 of the total earnings degradation from foreign exchange in 2014. Despite taking significant price increases in both markets, we could not fully offset the impact of rapidly weakening currencies. 
The second factor relates to the Chinese renminbi. In the past, I pointed out the natural currency protection from the ongoing strengthening of the renminbi when other currencies in Asia and Latin America devalued. This was not the case in 2014. For the first time since our IPO, the renminbi weakened slightly against the dollar on a full year basis. In the prior 3 years from 2011 through 2013, the renminbi strengthened by about 2.5% on average, so there was no favorable offset from this important currency last year. 
We expect to see adverse foreign exchange impacts continue in 2015 based on the recent and pronounced strengthening of the dollar across a very broad basket of currencies in Asia and Latin America. A weaker euro helps to reduce the impact on our bottom line since we export product into China and Hong Kong from the Netherlands. But the breadth and magnitude of the decline elsewhere outweighs the euro benefit. 
Over the last 3 months, the dollar strengthened by an average of about 3% for the company. Practically every market was affected including China. As a result, we believe our largest market will continue to contribute to unfavorable foreign exchange in 2015. If exchange rates remain at their current level, but allowing for some continued modest devaluation in Venezuela and Argentina later in the year, we expect foreign exchange to lower sales growth by 4% in 2015. On the same basis, earnings per share would be reduced by at least $0.13 relative to 2014. Another 1% strengthening of the dollar against all currencies where we operate would lead to further reductions in EPS of about $0.05 per share on a full year basis, just from translation only. 
I want to mention a bit more about Venezuela. The conditions in Venezuela continue to deteriorate with the drop in oil prices. You may recall, we used the SICAD I exchange rate, which currently stands at about VEF 12 to the dollar to translate our financial statements. For Mead Johnson, the government provided access to dollars at the official rate of 6.3, which results in a favorable cash settlement currency gain when these funds are received. We use these dollars to pay our Mexican manufacturing operation for products imported into Venezuela. 
We believe there will be a reduction in these cash settlement FX gains in 2015 for 2 reasons: First, we enter the new year with a lower intercompany payable from our Venezuelan subsidiary; and second, over the past quarter, we've seen a slowdown in access to U.S. dollars and expect this to continue given the significant revenue shortfall faced by the government. The complicated situation in Venezuela, by itself, is another significant foreign exchange downside risk for the company. 
Turning to profitability. We delivered a gross margin of 61.9% in the fourth quarter, up sequentially from 60.2% in the third quarter as we started to realize the benefit from lower dairy prices. On a full year basis, gross margin was in line with our guidance at 61.9%, yet down 170 basis points from 2013 as higher dairy costs, adverse foreign exchange and Singapore start-up costs more than offset higher prices and productivity efforts. Cost savings from productivity stood at about 3.5% of our cost of goods sold, slightly above our 3% target. 
Turning to 2015. We expect gross margin will approach 63.5% for the full year, consistent with the level seen in 2013. Lower dairy costs are the key driver. Keep in mind that spot dairy prices are reflected in our cost of goods sold on a 7-month lag. We expect continued quarterly improvement in gross margin on a sequential basis as we progress through 2015. Higher dairy prices last year affected Asia more than any other geographic segment. As a result, the 2015 gross margin improvement will be most visible in that region. 
Finally, costs associated with the start-up of the Singapore manufacturing facility reduced earnings by about $0.10 per share in 2014. Given that the plant is now operational and increasing throughput steadily, we expect to see that expense cut in half to about $0.05 in 2015. We anticipate a further reduction in start-up expenses in 2016 when the plant reaches full capacity. 
Last year, operating expenses came in at 38% of sales, down 160 basis points from 39.6% in 2013. On a constant dollar basis, we increased demand generation investments, including advertising and promotion, sales force and marketing expenses by about $50 million on top of record spending in 2013. But these investments still grew at a lower rate than reported sales. It is worth noting that R&D spending continue to be strong at 2.5% of sales last year. 
Other income and expense also drove favorable operating expenses measured on a percent of sales basis in 2014 versus the prior year. The cash settlement currency gains in Venezuela that I mentioned earlier was one item at work along with the benefit associated with the sale of our equity interest in the Saudi joint venture to Almarai. For 2015, we intend to reinvest a portion of our higher gross margins back into the business through higher demand generation spending. In addition, we will not have the benefit from the Almarai sales and we expect lower cash settlement gains in Venezuela. As a result, operating expenses are anticipated to come in around 39% of sales. 
Given the assumptions I just outlined about both gross margins and operating expenses, 2015 EBIT margins should approach 24.5%, up from 23.8% in 2014 and the highest EBIT margin for the company since 2009. 
Looking at taxes, our non-GAAP effective tax rate or ETR was 22.5% in 2014, which included a $0.05 per share nonrecurring tax benefit that we recognized in the third quarter. Without that benefit, the normalized rate would have been around 23.5%. That's a bit better than our prior guidance for 2014 and added a $0.01 or $0.02 to fourth quarter EPS versus earlier expectations. Our 2015 global ETR is estimated to come in about 24%. This anticipates increased benefits from the new Singapore facility but also our plans to repatriate more earnings from outside the U.S. 
Moving on to interest expense. 2014 was a productive year on the financing front. We refinanced $500 million in notes due in late 2014 with new 30-year bonds at a very attractive rate, significantly extending our long-term debt maturity. We also increased our revolver from $500 million to $750 million while securing lower fees and extending the maturity in additional 3 years. In 2015, we anticipate interest expense will be just under $60 million. 
To summarize our 2015 non-GAAP guidance, we expect constant dollar sales growth of 7% this year with foreign exchange reducing sales growth by 4%. As a result, reported sales would increase by about 3%. 
Turning to segment performance. 2015 constant dollar sales growth in Asia should be similar to the company's overall level of growth around 7%, which is consistent with 2014. However, we expect that pricing will contribute less to growth in 2015 on lower commodity cost, while volume growth will be stronger. As a result, the quality of our growth in Asia should improve. In Latin America, we anticipate that constant dollar sales growth will be in the low to midteens. 
Turning to North America/Europe. During 2014, we added 2 new WIC contracts, gained non-WIC market share for infant formula and increased our distribution for Enfagrow. We do not expect to see the same gains in 2015. While we obviously strive for higher market share, the unprecedented 2014 performance is not likely to repeat. In addition, we believe that a few retailers built their inventory late in the year, which contributed to our strong fourth quarter results. As a result, we're forecasting 2015 growth for North America/Europe at a rate below that for the company on a constant dollar basis. 
Non-GAAP earnings are expected to be in the range of $3.90 to $4 per share, growth of about 4% to 7%. The lower end of our range assumes a slightly more pessimistic foreign exchange environment, among other factors while still allowing EPS leverage relative to sales. Please note that we expect tougher comparisons in the first half of 2015. This is due in part to more favorable performance in the first half of 2014 both in China and with a more favorable exchange rate environment. The timing of capacity expansions will help comparisons to a greater extent in the second half of the year. 
Just a quick comment on the specified cost excluded from our non-GAAP results. We saw an unfavorable $0.13 per share hit from our mark-to-market pension liabilities in the quarter. This is largely attributed to the adoption of new actuarial mortality tables that's required of most companies. In addition, further softening in interest rates also had an impact. 
Wrapping up with our balance sheet and cash flow. Our cash balance was $1.3 billion at the end of 2014, up about $250 million from the prior year. Note that cash held in the United States was about $215 million, down from $360 million in the prior year. This is what drives the need for greater cash repatriation from abroad during 2015. 
Free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures, was $607 million during 2014, up 7% from the prior year. The change was mainly from lower capital spending and higher earnings as we completed the Singapore construction midyear. Higher cash flow in 2014 allowed us to increase our dividend by double digits to $1.50 per share. For 2015, capital spending is estimated about $175 million, consistent with our longer-term target of about 4% of sales. Depreciation and amortization expense is expected to be around $100 million, up from $92 million in 2014 as we'll have a full year of depreciation on the Singapore facility. 
With that, I'll now turn the call back to Kasper."

As I think about our achievements in 2014, I reflect on a year in which we relaunched our Enfa franchise in many markets with new improved formulations and a fresh look. We expanded our liquids portfolio into several new markets in Asia and Latin America, and we completed the rollout of our key specialty formulas across Asia. We also continue to build our capabilities, opening a new spray drying facility in Singapore and breaking ground on other important capacity expansion projects in both Europe and the United States. As we look forward to another exciting year for our company, we continue to execute against our core growth strategies and stated priorities, our commitment to continuous innovation behind our core products and plans, the growth of our children's nutrition franchise and the continued investment in the quality and relevance of our products to children and parents. We continue to pursue these strategies organically and through selected inorganic activities when opportunities arise. 
I'd like to conclude my comments by acknowledging the exceptional efforts of my Mead Johnson colleagues around the globe. Together, we delivered strong performance in 2014, and we are committed to driving further growth in 2015. 
So with that, I'd like to hand the call back to our operator, Shannon, so we can open the lines to your questions. Shannon, back to you."

One was just, Kasper, you had mentioned in your prepared remarks that you were monitoring the Enfagrow launch and that retailers I guess were -- with tightened inventory or maintaining tight inventory levels based on some assumption maybe that the market is slowing. So if you could just expand upon that just in terms of whether there's been a material slowing in the market, whether that's just a conservative stand. And then just related to that, if I remember correctly, when you launched Enfa or when you launched a new product in China, it didn't come with a price increase. And with the exchange rates maybe working against you in China, is there a chance potentially to put -- to contemplate some price increases, if that's sustainable?"

And obviously, we are staying very closely to how that's -- that is performing. It's a wee bit early to sort of commit ourselves to giving you an indication of performance, but we are pretty confident based on what we've seen in other markets around the world. My comment regarding reduction in retail inventory, I think, is fairly consistent with what you've heard many other companies in the consumer products space allude to over the past few weeks and months. It's clear that this slowdown in the Chinese economy is causing most businesspeople, including retailers, to take a more cautious stance. And I think it's also fair to say that the retail trade in China, but really right across Asia, has for several years been characterized by very, very high levels of inventory. I'm glad to say that I think we are at the more conservative end of the spectrum when it comes to allowing retailers to buy inventory. So I'm not trying to signal any significant, sort of abrupt change in the coming months, but we are clearly seeing retailers manage their purchases quite carefully. So I hope that helps a little bit."

Because I think authorities around the world, as their currencies weaken relative to the dollar, are likely to experience sort of inflationary pressure in the general economy. So they are likely to take a strong interest in pricing, I think. And then secondly, they are likely to be very tuned in to the fact that commodity costs have come down. So though the dynamic you are reflecting might lead you to conclude that we would see some pressure on our margins, I think we are going to be helped to a great degree by falling commodity prices as we move through the year."

But irrespective of that, I think we would still ordinarily expect to see higher volume growth, which I think is really your point, and I concur with that. It's really entirely driven by the change in the China environment. We've said -- I think we've been fairly explicit about the fact that we are -- we are not currently participating as strongly as we would like in the highest growth channels, particularly the e-commerce channel, which is favoring heavily imported brands mostly out of Europe and Australia, New Zealand. And then secondly, the slowing environment in China is clearly sort of hitting everybody. So it's really a China-specific dynamic, and I'd be even more explicit about that.

It's hard to determine exactly when we will break through to the point that it provides a significant impact on our global results, but I can assure you that it's not for lack of effort. I think it's also very important that when you look as I think a number of times of these calls, as you look at these 4 primary channels that really exist in China, sort of the grocery trade in China, the baby store trade in China, the e-commerce channel and then the importation of product through Hong Kong, which are really the 4 channels that we think about when we look at China. It's very important that you don't think that these can be added together to arrive at a total market. There is a lot of cross-channel trading taking place between those channels. So to the extent that you'll see, for instance, rising sales in baby stores, you'll automatically see the same rise in the Internet channel because that is a major sourcing point for the baby store channel. So we are wary of that. We believe that it's likely that there will be some slowdown in the growth, particularly in the baby store channel. And that's consistent with what we've seen now really since the beginning of 2013. That channel went through a very rapid phase of expansion as additional stores were opened. But it's much less clear to me that on a same-store basis, that channel is growing as fast as it used to be. But the Internet channel remains interesting. It remains a high priority for us, and we have a number of initiatives in place that aim to strengthen our profile in that channel."

And there's 3 things going on there, each of which costs us about $0.02 a share for the company. One is the impact of just translating our local currency results into dollars. One is the impact of the fact that we have more cash sitting there because the government hasn't made dollars available to us for the last 3 months. That means when a devaluation comes through, there's a bigger balance sheet remeasurement impact. And then the third of those cash settlement gains when we get cash paid -- cash basically -- the dollars made available to us at the rate of 6 versus the 12 that we're using for translation. Each of those is about $0.02 in '15 versus '14. So some is already included in there, but it could be worse than that, too. And certainly, the black market rates is much higher. In the past, I think it's been as high as 50 versus the 12. That's the government SICAD I exchange rate. But the volume on that isn't that high, quite frankly. And you would always expect, I think, to see a black market rate when currency isn't allowed to trade freely at a super high level. So -- but there is real exposure. And I would say we try to think through that in the guidance range that we've given. That's one item, but it certainly could be worse than what would be included in our guidance.

We'll keep you all posted as this moves along. And obviously, it's a priority for us to try and bring it to resolution as soon as we can. Maybe I'll just finish by sort of adding on to your question about Venezuela and say that it's important to understand that our product category, just like the pharmaceutical imports here that go into Venezuela, is considered a high-priority category by the Venezuelan government, which indicates, I think, a likelihood that they will continue to strive to make foreign exchange available to importers of our category and that they would be very reluctant to see the category being priced at say, the black market rate, which would obviously have an enormous inflationary impact on product pricing in the marketplace. So though we are always cautious about Venezuela and careful, I don't want to send a signal that you should be kind of panicking about the topic."

I'll then turn the call over to Pete, who will provide more details on our financial performance and our outlook. At the end of our prepared remarks, I will then provide a few summary remarks before I give you the opportunity to ask questions or request clarification. 
Let me now turn to our discussion of 2014. As you likely read in our press release issued this morning, we ended the year on a strong note. Despite accelerating headwinds from foreign exchange, we delivered earnings per share slightly above prior guidance, and we closed another year of strong revenue growth. Revenue growth in the fourth quarter of 2014 was 8% in constant dollars and 3% in reported U.S. dollars over prior year's quarter. On a non-GAAP basis, earnings per share for the quarter came in at $0.92, up from $0.82 in the same quarter of 2013. 
Throughout the year, we saw the value of our geographic diversification. Despite challenges in individual markets, including China, we delivered constant dollar revenue growth of 9% for the full year 2014. Volume contributed 4 percentage points to our growth rate, while higher pricing added 5 points. 200 basis points of growth came from pricing in the high-inflation environments of Argentina and Venezuela. We saw volume growth in each of our regions. After several years of weakness, our persistent investments in North America are paying off. And our North America/Europe segment grew volume faster than any other region last year. 
Latin America continued to show steady volume growth despite challenges in several markets within South America. And in Asia, we saw revenue growth decelerate as performance in Mainland China adversely affected results for the broader region. I'll address this in more detail in a moment. 
We faced significant headwinds from foreign exchange throughout the year. This reduced our revenue growth by 4 percentage points when translated into U.S. dollars. As a result, reported U.S. dollar revenue growth was 5% for the full year 2014. The unfavorable trend in the currency markets accelerated in the fourth quarter, impacting all 3 reporting segments. 
Turning now to earnings. Non-GAAP earnings per share of $3.74 for the year was up 7% versus 2013. Our rate of earnings growth was well above the 5% increase we saw in reported U.S. dollar revenue. In light of gross margin headwinds from adverse foreign exchange movements, higher dairy costs and start-up costs associated with our new Singapore facility we're satisfied with the improvement in earnings. Our ability to leverage growth in revenue for even faster growth in earnings is the result of our commitment to prudent cost management and the effectiveness of our ongoing productivity programs. As an example, we continue to invest aggressively behind our brands and key innovation projects but found efficiencies through procurement efforts and optimized media strategies that allowed us to meet our revenue goals with marketing spend as a lower percentage of sales. Before I comment on the outlook for 2015, let me briefly comment on the performance within each of our reporting segments. 
Firstly, turning to our Asia segment. In the fourth quarter, our business in Asia grew 3% on a constant dollar basis. As mentioned previously, revenue growth for the region was adversely impacted by our China business. As I mentioned in our last call, we reduced trade inventory in China during the third quarter and early fourth quarter in advance of an Enfa relaunch in late October. We are monitoring consumer offtake following the launch closely, and we continue to see retailers reduce inventory across categories as they adopt a more cautious stand in light of a moderating growth in GDP. 
I should also note that our 2013 base for comparison was particularly tough due to an impact of a recall by several competitors in the second half of that year. On a full year basis, constant dollar sales in Asia were up 7%. Our China/Hong Kong business grew 5%. As I've stated in the past, we are currently under indexed in the higher growth channels in China, particularly the e-commerce and super-high premium segment that focus mostly on imported products. 
As we have discussed in China, just a brief note on the status of our China-related investigation. Our internal investigation has progressed, and we've shared the results of our work to date with both the SEC and the Department of Justice. And we are responding to their requests for additional information. At this time, we can't predict how or when the matter will be resolved. I'm sure you'll appreciate that I can't provide further details at this point. 
Let me now comment on results in the balance of Asia where we saw strong sales growth in 2014. The Philippines, Thailand and Malaysia all delivered very strong revenue growth based on strong execution and innovation, underpinned our progress in all 3 countries. GDP growth remains strong across most of Southeast Asia, and the fundamental growth drivers for the category and Mead Johnson remain intact. EBIT for the Asia segment increased as revenue grew in 2014, but the resulting improvement was substantially offset by higher dairy cost that adversely impacted profit margins. 
Turning now to Latin America. Constant dollar revenue growth -- rose 14% in the fourth quarter of 2014 over the same quarter of 2013. Volume was up 3%. Improved pricing added 11 points of growth to the quarter. On a constant dollar basis, revenue was up 16% for the full year. Volume increased by 6%, and higher pricing contributed 10 percentage points to our growth. 
Foreign exchange movements once again impacted results for the segment. The strengthening dollar and resulting depreciation of local currencies reduced U.S. dollar sales by 15% in full year 2014, more than offsetting pricing gains. Most of our pricing gains were seen in Venezuela and Argentina. Despite this, in aggregate, we failed to fully offset currency weakness through price in these 2 high-inflation countries. 
Our performance across Mexico, the Caribbean and Central America provided a highlight within the region. We experienced strong revenue growth as we relaunched our Enfa franchise and introduced several new products towards the end of the year. Despite a tough economic environment in Brazil, we continue to grow our market share of the infant formula category there. Our children's business, which is more sensitive to economic fluctuations, had a difficult year however. And overall performance was less strong than it has been in recent years. EBIT for our Latin America segment compared unfavorably to prior-year quarter and full year. This was primarily due to the foreign exchange, and to a lesser extent, higher dairy cost. 
Let me now turn to our North America/Europe segment. In the fourth quarter of 2014, the North America/Europe segment delivered stronger-than-expected revenue growth. Constant dollar revenue was up 14% on prior year's quarter. And on a full year basis, constant dollar revenue increased 10% over 2013. Pete will provide further detail on this in a moment. The improved performance in North America and Europe was driven by strong share gains in infant formula as well as continued progress towards our stated goal of building a strong and profitable children's business with Enfagrow. We've invested substantially behind our North American brands in recent years, and we're now reaping the rewards. 
Sales of Enfagrow grew by over 20% in 2014 with demand rising rapidly in both the United States and Canada. While we rarely highlight our European business due to its relative size, I should mention that European profits improved substantially in 2014, and revenue growth was similar to that of North America. Our 2012 restructuring that refocused our efforts on our specialty business continues to pay off. Revenue growth was driven by share gains within a growing European allergy segment. EBIT margin in the segment improved substantially during the year driven by pricing gains and our turnaround in Europe. 
Before I hand over to Pete, let me now wrap up with our perspective of 2015. We look forward to another year of solid sales and earnings growth despite a tougher global macroeconomic climate. There are 3 important factors to keep in mind as we think about 2015. Firstly, let me address our expectations for revenue growth. We expect revenue growth in constant dollars of around 7%. We expect lower commodity costs and currency-related inflationary pressure on governments in many countries will combine to create a more difficult pricing environment even as we introduce innovations. Conversely, we are hopeful a stronger economic climate in the United States will allow us to continue to recover, through price, the investments made in innovation and product improvement over the past 5 years. 
Secondly, going forward, we expect our profit margins to benefit from lower commodity costs and a weakening euro. That said, approximately 75% of our sales are booked in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, while many of our costs are dollar denominated. So despite our expectation for margin improvement as we move through 2015, there'll be some offsetting effect. 
Thirdly and finally, we intend to continue to invest behind the product innovation and marketing initiatives at a level consistent with our growth ambition. I'm excited with our plans for 2015 and look forward to sharing more details with you as we move through the year. 
So to repeat, we expect full year constant dollar sales growth to be around 7%. Pricing will likely make a smaller contribution to sales growth than it did in 2014. And based on some improvement in expected profit margins, we estimate non-GAAP earnings per share for 2015 to be in the range of $3.90 to $4. 
I will now turn the call over to Pete, who will provide more detailed commentary on our financial results and our outlook. I'll then return to provide some closing remarks before we field your questions. Pete, over to you."
1002291,280963679,751459,"Mead Johnson Nutrition Company, Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Jan 29, 2015",2015-01-29,"Earnings Calls","Mead Johnson Nutrition Company","Executives","Thanks, Kasper, and good morning, everyone. Kasper addressed constant dollar sales growth, so I'll focus first on foreign exchange. There's been a lot of press about foreign exchange accompanying earnings reports for multinationals, so I'm going to get in",1921,"Thanks, Kasper, and good morning, everyone. Kasper addressed constant dollar sales growth, so I'll focus first on foreign exchange. There's been a lot of press about foreign exchange accompanying earnings reports for multinationals, so I'm going to get into a bit more detail in that topic than I might otherwise have done. While there's no doubt that FX has become a more significant headwind, please keep in mind that our EPS guidance range still anticipates good leverage of sales growth. After discussing currency effects, I'll walk down the income statement providing highlights on both our 2014 results and our 2015 guidance. I'll then share a few noteworthy items on our balance sheet and cash flow. Unless otherwise noted, my comments will be on a non-GAAP basis. 
As Kasper detailed, constant dollar sales grew by 9% in 2014. Foreign exchange reduced full year sales growth by 4%, resulting in reported sales growth of 5%. The dollar started to strengthen noticeably in the third quarter, and this trend accelerated in the fourth quarter. The stronger dollar reduced EPS by about $0.28 during the full year of 2014, including both translation and balance sheet remeasurement impacts, more than double the impact we experienced in 2013. Note that we mitigate the impact of foreign exchange through higher pricing. 
There were 2 critical factors at work. First, we saw very significant devaluations in Venezuela, and to a lesser extent, in Argentina. These 2 markets accounted for almost 2/3 of the total earnings degradation from foreign exchange in 2014. Despite taking significant price increases in both markets, we could not fully offset the impact of rapidly weakening currencies. 
The second factor relates to the Chinese renminbi. In the past, I pointed out the natural currency protection from the ongoing strengthening of the renminbi when other currencies in Asia and Latin America devalued. This was not the case in 2014. For the first time since our IPO, the renminbi weakened slightly against the dollar on a full year basis. In the prior 3 years from 2011 through 2013, the renminbi strengthened by about 2.5% on average, so there was no favorable offset from this important currency last year. 
We expect to see adverse foreign exchange impacts continue in 2015 based on the recent and pronounced strengthening of the dollar across a very broad basket of currencies in Asia and Latin America. A weaker euro helps to reduce the impact on our bottom line since we export product into China and Hong Kong from the Netherlands. But the breadth and magnitude of the decline elsewhere outweighs the euro benefit. 
Over the last 3 months, the dollar strengthened by an average of about 3% for the company. Practically every market was affected including China. As a result, we believe our largest market will continue to contribute to unfavorable foreign exchange in 2015. If exchange rates remain at their current level, but allowing for some continued modest devaluation in Venezuela and Argentina later in the year, we expect foreign exchange to lower sales growth by 4% in 2015. On the same basis, earnings per share would be reduced by at least $0.13 relative to 2014. Another 1% strengthening of the dollar against all currencies where we operate would lead to further reductions in EPS of about $0.05 per share on a full year basis, just from translation only. 
I want to mention a bit more about Venezuela. The conditions in Venezuela continue to deteriorate with the drop in oil prices. You may recall, we used the SICAD I exchange rate, which currently stands at about VEF 12 to the dollar to translate our financial statements. For Mead Johnson, the government provided access to dollars at the official rate of VEF 6.3, which results in a favorable cash settlement currency gain when these funds are received. We use these dollars to pay our Mexican manufacturing operation for products imported into Venezuela. 
We believe there will be a reduction in these cash settlement FX gains in 2015 for 2 reasons: First, we enter the New Year with a lower intercompany payable from our Venezuelan subsidiary; and second, over the past quarter, we've seen a slowdown in access to U.S. dollars and expect this to continue given the significant revenue shortfall faced by the government. The complicated situation in Venezuela, by itself, is another significant foreign exchange downside risk for the company. 
Turning to profitability. We delivered a gross margin of 61.9% in the fourth quarter, up sequentially from 60.2% in the third quarter as we started to realize the benefit from lower dairy prices. On a full year basis, gross margin was in line with our guidance at 61.9%, yet down 170 basis points from 2013 as higher dairy costs, adverse foreign exchange and Singapore start-up costs more than offset higher prices and productivity efforts. Cost savings from productivity stood at about 3.5% of our cost of goods sold, slightly above our 3% target. 
Turning to 2015. We expect gross margin will approach 63.5% for the full year, consistent with the level seen in 2013. Lower dairy costs are the key driver. Keep in mind that spot dairy prices are reflected in our cost of goods sold on a 7-month lag. We expect continued quarterly improvement in gross margin on a sequential basis as we progress through 2015. Higher dairy prices last year affected Asia more than any other geographic segment. As a result, the 2015 gross margin improvement will be most visible in that region. 
Finally, costs associated with the start-up of the Singapore manufacturing facility reduced earnings by about $0.10 per share in 2014. Given that the plant is now operational and increasing throughput steadily, we expect to see that expense cut in half to about $0.05 in 2015. We anticipate a further reduction in start-up expenses in 2016 when the plant reaches full capacity. 
Last year, operating expenses came in at 38% of sales, down 160 basis points from 39.6% in 2013. On a constant dollar basis, we increased demand generation investments, including advertising and promotion, sales force and marketing expenses by about $50 million on top of record spending in 2013. But these investments still grew at a lower rate than reported sales. It is worth noting that R&D spending continue to be strong at 2.5% of sales last year. 
Other income and expense also drove favorable operating expenses measured on a percent of sales basis in 2014 versus the prior year. The cash settlement currency gains in Venezuela that I mentioned earlier was one item at work along with the benefit associated with the sale of our equity interest in the Saudi joint venture to Almarai. For 2015, we intend to reinvest a portion of our higher gross margins back into the business through higher demand generation spending. In addition, we will not have the benefit from the Almarai sales and we expect lower cash settlement gains in Venezuela. As a result, operating expenses are anticipated to come in around 39% of sales. 
Given the assumptions I just outlined about both gross margins and operating expenses, 2015 EBIT margins should approach 24.5%, up from 23.8% in 2014 and the highest EBIT margin for the company since 2009. 
Looking at taxes, our non-GAAP effective tax rate or ETR was 22.5% in 2014, which included a $0.05 per share nonrecurring tax benefit that we recognized in the third quarter. Without that benefit, the normalized rate would have been around 23.5%. That's a bit better than our prior guidance for 2014 and added a $0.01 or $0.02 to fourth quarter EPS versus earlier expectations. Our 2015 global ETR is estimated to come in about 24%. This anticipates increased benefits from the new Singapore facility but also our plans to repatriate more earnings from outside the U.S. 
Moving on to interest expense. 2014 was a productive year on the financing front. We refinanced $500 million in notes due in late 2014 with new 30-year bonds at a very attractive rate, significantly extending our long-term debt maturity. We also increased our revolver from $500 million to $750 million while securing lower fees and extending the maturity in additional 3 years. In 2015, we anticipate interest expense will be just under $60 million. 
To summarize our 2015 non-GAAP guidance, we expect constant dollar sales growth of 7% this year with foreign exchange reducing sales growth by 4%. As a result, reported sales would increase by about 3%. 
Turning to segment performance. 2015 constant dollar sales growth in Asia should be similar to the company's overall level of growth around 7%, which is consistent with 2014. However, we expect that pricing will contribute less to growth in 2015 on lower commodity cost, while volume growth will be stronger. As a result, the quality of our growth in Asia should improve. In Latin America, we anticipate that constant dollar sales growth will be in the low to mid-teens. 
Turning to North America/Europe. During 2014, we added 2 new WIC contracts, gained non-WIC market share for infant formula and increased our distribution for Enfagrow. We do not expect to see the same gains in 2015. While we obviously strive for higher market share, the unprecedented 2014 performance is not likely to repeat. In addition, we believe that a few retailers built their inventory late in the year, which contributed to our strong fourth quarter results. As a result, we're forecasting 2015 growth for North America/Europe at a rate below that for the company on a constant dollar basis. 
Non-GAAP earnings are expected to be in the range of $3.90 to $4 per share, growth of about 4% to 7%. The lower end of our range assumes a slightly more pessimistic foreign exchange environment, among other factors while still allowing EPS leverage relative to sales. Please note that we expect tougher comparisons in the first half of 2015. This is due in part to more favorable performance in the first half of 2014 both in China and with a more favorable exchange rate environment. The timing of capacity expansions will help comparisons to a greater extent in the second half of the year. 
Just a quick comment on the specified cost excluded from our non-GAAP results. We saw an unfavorable $0.13 per share hit from our mark-to-market pension liabilities in the quarter. This is largely attributed to the adoption of new actuarial mortality tables that's required of most companies. In addition, further softening in interest rates also had an impact. 
Wrapping up with our balance sheet and cash flow. Our cash balance was $1.3 billion at the end of 2014, up about $250 million from the prior year. Note that cash held in the United States was about $215 million, down from $360 million in the prior year. This is what drives the need for greater cash repatriation from abroad during 2015. 
Free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures, was $607 million during 2014, up 7% from the prior year. The change was mainly from lower capital spending and higher earnings as we completed the Singapore construction midyear. Higher cash flow in 2014 allowed us to increase our dividend by double digits to $1.50 per share. For 2015, capital spending is estimated about $175 million, consistent with our longer-term target of about 4% of sales. Depreciation and amortization expense is expected to be around $100 million, up from $92 million in 2014 as we'll have a full year of depreciation on the Singapore facility. 
With that, I'll now turn the call back to Kasper."

And then just related to that, if I remember correctly, when you launched Enfa or when you launched a new product in China, it didn't come with a price increase.

It's a wee bit early to sort of commit ourselves to giving you an indication of performance, but we are pretty confident based on what we've seen in other markets around the world. My comment regarding reduction in retail inventory, I think, is fairly consistent with what you've heard many other companies in the consumer products space allude to over the past few weeks and months. It's clear that this slowdown in the Chinese economy is causing most businesspeople, including retailers, to take a more cautious stance. And I think it's also fair to say that the retail trade in China, but really right across Asia, has for several years been characterized by very, very high levels of inventory. I'm glad to say that I think we are at the more conservative end of the spectrum when it comes to allowing retailers to buy inventory. So I'm not trying to signal any significant, sort of abrupt change in the coming months, but we are clearly seeing retailers manage their purchases quite carefully. So I hope that helps a little bit."

So though the dynamic you are reflecting might lead you to conclude that we would see some pressure on our margins, I think we are going to be helped to a great degree by falling commodity prices as we move through the year."

It's hard to determine exactly when we would break through to the point that it provides a significant impact on our global results, but I can assure you that it's not for lack of effort. I think it's also very important that when you look as I think a number of times of these calls, as you look at these 4 primary channels that really exist in China, sort of the grocery trade in China, the baby store trade in China, the e-commerce channel and then the importation of product through Hong Kong, which are really the 4 channels that we think about when we look at China, it's very important that you don't think that these can be added together to arrive at a total market. There is a lot of cross-channel trading taking place between those channels. So to the extent that you'll see, for instance, rising sales in baby stores, you will automatically see the same rise in the Internet channel because that is a major sourcing point for the baby store channel. So we are wary of that. We believe that it's likely that there will be some slowdown in the growth, particularly in the baby store channel. And that's consistent with what we've seen now really since the beginning of 2013. That channel went through a very rapid phase of expansion as additional stores were opened. But it's much less clear to me that on a same-store basis, that channel is growing as fast as it used to be. But the Internet channel remains interesting. It remains a high priority for us, and we have a number of initiatives in place that aim to strengthen our profile in that channel."

And there's 3 things going on there, each of which costs us about $0.02 a share for the company. One is the impact of just translating our local currency results into dollars. One is the impact of the fact that we have more cash sitting there because the government hasn't made dollars available to us for the last 3 months. That means when a devaluation comes through, there's a bigger balance sheet remeasurement impact. And then 1/3 of those cash settlement gains when we get cash paid -- cash basically -- the dollars made available to us at the rate of 6 versus the 12 that we're using for translation. Each of those is about $0.02 in '15 versus '14. So some is already included in there, but it could be worse than that, too. And certainly, the black market rates is much higher. In the past, I think it's been as high as 50 versus the 12, that's the government SICAD I exchange rate. But the volume on that isn't that high, quite frankly.

Maybe I'll just finish by sort of adding on to your question about Venezuela and say that it's important to understand that our product category, just like the pharmaceutical imports here that go into Venezuela, is considered a high-priority category by the Venezuelan government, which indicates, I think, a likelihood that they will continue to strive to make foreign exchange available to importers of our category and that they would be very reluctant to see the category being priced at say, the black market rate, which would obviously have an enormous inflationary impact on product pricing in the marketplace.

Good morning to all of you, and thank you for joining us on this morning's call. I'll begin with highlights of our first quarter global performance before discussing each of our operating segments and our expectations for the full year. Then Charles Urbain, who was recently appointed to the role of Interim Chief Financial Officer, will provide additional details on our financial performance. And finally, I'll return to provide a few summary remarks before we, as usual, open the line to your questions. 
Turning now to the first quarter of 2015. Constant dollar sales growth at 3% came in as expected, and we delivered record level non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.09 in the quarter. Price contributed 3% to revenue growth, while, as we left [ph] very strong quarters in the United States and China businesses, volume was unchanged from the same quarter of prior year. As our rate of revenue growth was significantly affected by performance in the 2014 base year, I firstly remind you that during the first half of 2014, we benefited significantly from competitors' supply disruptions in several large Asian markets, including China. Secondly, you'll remember we mentioned in earlier calls that retailers built inventory in the United States in the first quarter of 2014 to support certain weak contract gains, and again, in the fourth quarter of 2014, as they increase inventory ahead of the holiday season and plan promotions in January. These factors affected sales comparisons, and we saw orders lag consumer offtake in the latest quarter. We believe inventory levels are now back to normal and at sustainable levels. I'll provide further details in each of these factors in the segment discussion. 
Like many other companies with significant business outside of the United States, we saw a greater-than-anticipated adverse impact from a strengthening dollar on reported sales this quarter as we translated local currency revenue into dollars. As a result, U.S. dollar revenue for the quarter was 2% below prior year's quarter. The impact of foreign exchange on our income statement provides a good segue to a discussion of gross margin. As indicated in our January call, we saw gross margin improved significantly in the first quarter. The improvement was larger-than-anticipated as we benefited from weakness in the euro. This euro weakness helped mitigate the impact of currency swings on profitability and earnings. Charles will expand on this point later. Gross margin at 64% was up 210 basis points from the prior year quarter. In addition to our margin being helped by the weaker euro, we benefited from lower dairy input costs and the carryover effect of pricing taken through 2014. Similar to the pattern seen in most of our prior years, the timing of marketing initiatives meant that expenditure on advertising and promotion activities was relatively more modest, though still healthy, in the first quarter. 
We normally focus our discussion on non-GAAP earnings. However, I'd like to provide a brief update on our previously reported investigation into certain promotional activities within our China subsidiary. This item impacted our GAAP earnings in the quarter. In our last earnings call and in our 10-K filing, we stated that the company had shared the results of our investigation with both the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Justice. Our discussions with ACC regional staff have now progressed significantly since our last call. And in the first quarter of 2015, we've taken an accrual of $12 million. This amount reflects our best estimate of disclose fines and penalty costs that may be paid to resolve SEC concerns about alleged actions in China. I want to emphasize that discussions with both the SEC and the DOJ are ongoing and no settlement has been agreed to date. Therefore, there can be no assurance that the amount paid by the company to resolve this matter will not exceed the amount accrued to date or that other sanctions will not be imposed. 
Returning now to non-GAAP measures. Earnings per share were up 7% to $1.09 from $1.02 in the first quarter of 2014. Higher gross margin, lower operating expenses and a lower effective tax rate more than offset the impact on revenue of currency swings. I'm very encouraged by the resilience of our global business. Around the world, our teams are working hard to assist the external environment, appropriately adjust pricing where opportunities exist and drive productivity for efforts aggressively. 
Let me now comment on the performance of each of our reporting segments, starting with Asia. In the first quarter, constant dollar sales were in line with the prior year quarter. The quarter was adversely impacted by the effects on sales of several in Hong Kong. I'll return to this topic shortly. In aggregate, pricing gains of 1% within the segment were offset by slightly lower volume in the quarter. As expected, lower commodity costs have created an environment that discourages price increases. 
Let me now disaggregate our sales results and provide some color surrounding performance in key markets. Before I comment on other markets, including our business in Mainland China, let me draw your attention to the ongoing situation in Hong Kong. Many of you will be aware that the civil disturbance has had the effect of deterring mainland residents from visiting the territory. I remind you that the majority of our sales recorded in Hong Kong are to mainland visitors. Many businesses, including our own sales adversely impacted. As local protests and unrest have escalated, we have such slower uptake late in the quarter. Sales in the territory in recent weeks have been down around 20% versus our fourth quarter 2014 average. As you might imagine, we are closely monitoring the Hong Kong situation. We believe it'll be temporary and have great faith in the Hong Kong and China governance ultimately resolving the situation. That said, it's hard to predict exactly when the situation will return to normal. 
Let me now turn to our business in Mainland China. I'm encouraged that we made progress versus first quarter of 2014. We continue to improve our execution and refine our plans to strengthen our presence in channels where we currently are under-indexed. I previously said we are committed to creating a more flexible and more diversified business in China. This is largely about channel and sourcing strategy. I've also alluded to our desire to mitigate risks associated with the disruption to China/Hong Kong trade. Given recent events in Hong Kong, I'm very pleased to report that we have, this March, begun direct shipment of fully imported finished goods from our Netherlands facility into China. The product offered is identical to that showed in Hong Kong. Clearly fact, as produced in The Netherlands, and will be distributed through retailers, our own Tmall store and select baby stores. The launch is a culmination of work begun more than 12 months ago. In contrast, to some alternative Internet-based import models, importation will be done by the company itself in full compliance with Chinese quality standards, regulations and tax laws. Production capacity in our Netherlands facility will increase over the next few quarters and support our outlook for better growth in the second half of 2015. We look forward to providing consumers with more choice and more ways in which to interact with our business. 
You'll recall that we described inventory reductions in China in our January call as it related to the fourth quarter of 2014. We did not see further trade destocking in the latest quarter, and we are satisfied with consumer offtake of our recently restaged infant neuro complete products. 
Let me now comment on the balance of Asia. Our Philippines and Malaysia businesses delivered solid growth, driven by recent Nero complete launches and investment to support this innovation. The comparison for Vietnam was affected by the government imposed price reductions in mid-2014. Because of this prior year event, we expect performance metrics in the second half of 2015 to be more reflective of the progress we are making in the market. Our Thailand business also faced a difficult comparison from first quarter 2014 when we were benefiting from a recall in late 2013 by our biggest competitor. 
As you can tell, we saw a confluence of rather unusual events relating to the external environment. In combination, these events had a depressing effect on Asia's growth within this quarter. We are confident none of these are the lasting nature and that we will return to more normal growth rate in the second half of 2015. 
Turning now to Latin America. Constant dollar revenue rose 13% in the first quarter over the same quarter of prior year. Volume was up 3% and pricing added 10 points of growth. Foreign exchange movements continue to significantly impact results for the entire segment. The impact of a strengthening dollar and resulting depreciation of local currencies more than offset benefits from pricing gains. Pricing gains in the high inflation countries of Venezuela and Argentina contributed 900 basis points to the region's constant dollar growth rate. However, I'm pleased to note that both countries posted very solid double-digit volume growth and that the pricing gains in Argentina more than covered the impact of currency depreciation there. We continued to gain market share in most of the region with our premium Enfa brand. The brand has been supported by the same Neuro Complete innovation we are rolling out across Asia. As you are likely aware, economic conditions in Brazil have deteriorated sharply over the last year. As a result, we are seeing weakness in our Sustagen branded children's business. However, we continue to see strong growth in our Enfa franchise as we establish ourselves as the leading premium infant formula brand in Brazil. We saw strong rebounds in growth in both Colombia and Peru, both markets had a difficult year in 2014 when they addressed unique challenges. From cross-border trade in the case of Colombia and from a deteriorating customer relationship in the case of Peru, we've made good progress on putting both issues behind us. As a consequence, these businesses are seeing growth restored. 
Let me now turn to our North America/Europe segment. Constant dollar revenue in this segment was up 3% on the prior year's quarter driven by share gains in North America and price increases taken last year. Volume for the segment was unchanged compared to a strong base year. In the United States, volume was adversely impacted by a fourth quarter inventory build amongst leading retailers. The buildup late in 2014 was highlighted in our description of 2014 full year results as having contributed to a strong fourth quarter. This incremental inventory was fully consumed in the first quarter. And going forward, we expect sales to be more reflective of consumer demand. Secondly, sales in the first quarter of 2014, driven by certain WIC contract wins, resulted in a tough comparison this quarter. But importantly, we continue to gain market share in North America and Europe, and we now have market-leading positions in both the United States and Canada. In Europe, we made a decision to exit the Russia market. The Russian market is characterized by intense competition and high operating costs in a deteriorating economic environment. This action is consistent with our decision to focus on playing where we can win in Europe with focus on the allergy segment and making only selective plays in routine infant formula. This European strategy continues to payoff. Once again, we delivered double-digit constant dollar growth within a very large but shrinking European market. 
Let me now summarize our 2015 full year outlook. We continue to expect revenue growth around 7% on a constant dollar basis. In this segment, Charles will outline how we now anticipate a slightly stronger headwind from foreign exchange. However, as our cost structure continues to benefit from a weaker euro and lower dairy costs, we now have an improved outlook for gross margin for the full year, allowing us to maintain our non-GAAP earnings per share guidance in the range of $3.90 to $4. At the same time, we anticipate investing more aggressively in demand creation in the coming quarters. 
Before I hand the call over to Charles, let me briefly introduce him to those of you who don't know him. Charles began his career as an auditor at Price Waterhouse before serving in various tax and finance positions in. He then joined Bristol-Myers Squibb where he progressed through a series of local, regional and global treasury and finance roles before serving as Chief Financial Officer for Mead Johnson, while we were still a division within the Bristol-Myers Squibb company. From that road, he was promoted to various business leading roles and has run each of our operating regions prior to his most recent role as Chief Development Officer with responsibility for the company's M&A strategy, Human Resources and external affairs. Charles is being quick to pick up the reigns in his Interim CFO role and I know you'll enjoy your interactions with him. I'm very grateful that Charles has accepted this role as he's the perfect partner to help me build and mentor our next-generation finance organization. 
Charles, I hand the call over to you."

Having had a long and enjoyable history with Mead Johnson, both on a commercial side and earlier in my career in finance, I'm very pleased to be in the Interim CFO role. I've met many of you in the early days [indiscernible] IPO and look forward to renewing those acquaintances. 
Kasper noted that our annual recorded dollar sales growth is expected to be slightly lower than previous guidance due to the impact of a stronger dollar and the translation of sales from local currencies. So I'll begin my prepared remarks with a brief discussion on foreign exchange as it impacts the quarter and outlook for the year. I will then provide highlights on key sales and expense items as I walk down the income statement. And I'll wrap up with comments in our balance sheet and cash flow. Unless otherwise noted that my comments will be on non-GAAP financials results and references to currency impacts are the effects of currency fluctuations on the translation of local currency financial statements into dollars. 
I'll move into a little discussion on foreign exchange. And this really represents our perspective on the foreign exchange environment, which is both pertinent to our discussion of the first quarter and balance of the year. We expect to see adverse foreign exchange conditions throughout 2015 as the dollar is generally forecasted to continue strengthening for the remainder of the year. In exchange rates, which remain at their current level and allowing for some continued modest devaluation in Venezuela and Argentina later in the year, we would expect foreign exchange to adversely affect growth by about 5% for the full year 2015. We experienced the similar impact from foreign exchange fluctuations in the first quarter. While it is clear that FX has become more significant headwind in the translation of sales, bear in mind that they are potential offsets. For example, a weaker euro helps to reduce the impact on our earnings. We have a large manufacturing operation in Europe that, when combined with a relatively local revenue base, makes us a net beneficiary of euro weakness. In the last several months, we have seen a significant slowdown in Venezuela and government approvals to exchange bolivars into dollars to pay for product that we bring into the country. Our expose bolivar cash balance is increasing as a result. We will consider limiting exports to Venezuela in order to manage our overall exposure to that country. We are closely monitoring our exposure and will continue to evaluate options with the most recent facts and circumstances. 
I will now begin my review of income statement, beginning with sales performance. For the first quarter, constant dollar sales grew 3%. Foreign exchange reduced sales growth by 5%, resulting in lower recorded sales of 2% versus the prior year quarter. The U.S. dollar continued to strengthen during the quarter, and its effect on the transition of local currencies impacted all reporting segments. The Venezuelan bolivar and the most recent -- the most, I beg your pardon, had the most significant adverse impact on sales, but most currencies were impacted, notably the Mexican peso and the Chinese renminbi. The impact of increased pricing, particularly in Latin America, partially offset the impact of weakening currencies. Volumes were in line with the prior year quarter on an aggregate basis. North America and Latin America sales grew in constant dollars and Asia sales were in line with the prior year as pricing gains offset small declines in volume. 
I'll now move on to factors discussing the impact -- impacting our gross profit. The gross margin was 64% in the first quarter, up 210 basis points sequentially from the fourth quarter of 2014, and slightly up from the first quarter of 2014. Lower dairy costs and the impact of pricing were the key drivers of this improvement. Pricing gains were primarily the impact of carryover prices taken last year. In our last conference call, we cautioned that with a lower dairy cost, it would be a more difficult pricing environment, even as we introduce innovation. This can already be seen in our first quarter results with pricing contributing 3% compared to last year's annual pricing gains of 5%. While dairy cost in aggregate have decreased quite sharply, it is worth noting that there is a range of cost reductions, depending upon the sourcing region, and several dairy components have, in fact, increased in cost. It should also be noted that nondairy commodities, which represent around 60% of our cost of commodities have in fact increased versus the prior year quarter. In total, the composite reduction in Mead Johnson commodity costs is in the high-single digits. Overall, we're very pleased with the strong gross margin in the first quarter and we now believe that the annual gross margin would be approximately 64%. Keep in mind that spot dairy prices are reflected in our cost of goods on a 7-month lag, so the current spot price takes us through November. 
Moving on to operating expenses. The first quarter's operating expenses of 36.6% of sales was similar to the prior year quarter of 36.9%. On a constant dollar basis, total demand generation investments rose at a similar rate to sales. Please note that salesforce marketing and other demand generating costs are included in this total. Within demand generating expenses, advertising and promotion spend was 13.2% of sales. Historically, these investments are lower in the first quarter of the year. We expect significantly higher investment level starting in the second quarter as additional innovation and promotional campaigns are launched. 
To conclude my discussion on operating expenses, for the full year, we reiterate our intention to reinvest a portion of our higher gross margins back into the business through higher demand generating spends. As a consequence, we anticipate our operating expenses for the year to be approximately 39% of sales with EBIT slightly above 24.5%. 
I will now briefly speak about our taxes and effective tax rate. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate or ETR was 22.5% in the first quarter compared to 25.7% in the prior year quarter. The lower rates is the result of a favorable geographic mix of earnings. On a full year basis, we expect the ETR to be slightly better than our previous guidance of 24% as the favorable earnings mix in Q4 -- in Q1 may not fully prevail for the full year. 
Moving on to factors which would impact EPS guidance on a non-GAAP basis. We continue to expect constant dollar sales growth of approximately 7% this year with the foreign currency reducing sales growth by about 5%. As a result, reported sales would increase by 2%. As you look at key factors which could impact EPS performance in the balance of the year, there are several factors which should be considered. An additional adverse foreign exchange impact on sales, which I referred to earlier, would reduce earnings, but is projected to be fully offset by slightly higher gross margins and a lower tax rate. We anticipate dairy cost tailwinds through the remainder of the year, but I again draw your attention to the other commodity offsets highlighted earlier in my remarks. Higher advertising and promotion spend in the remainder of the year, which will coincide with our key commercial activities. It is anticipated that investments will peak in quarter 2 with increases of at least 400 basis points above quarter 1 levels, taking our first half spend to around 15% of sales. Therefore, non-GAAP earnings guidance continues to be in the range of $3.90 to $4 a share, which is growth of about 4% to 7% versus 2014. The lower end of our range continues to achieve a more pessimistic foreign exchange environment, among other factors, while still delivering EPS leverage to sales. As a reminder, the growth rates and investment levels will continue to vary from quarter-to-quarter, reflecting the timing of our initiatives. 
I will now wrap up with a high level overview of the balance sheet. As an introductory comment, I believe it's worth noting that we have a very high return on invested capital with a return on invested capital greater than 40% and over 100% of net income converted into free cash flow in the first quarter. Of course, these measures can fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter, but this remains a remarkably strong balance sheet. Our cash balance is $1.4 billion as of March 31, 2015, up about $140 million from the prior year-end. Note that cash in the United States was about $205 million. Free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures, was approximately $228 million in the first quarter after consuming $46 million in cash for capital investments. For the full year, capital spending expectations remain unchanged with about $175 million. This is consistent with our longer-term target of about 4% of sales. Depreciation and amortization expense is expected to be around $100 million for the full year. 
During the first quarter, our Board of Directors announced a 10% increase to our dividend, which should annualize to approximately $1.65 per share or $1.65 per share. As a result, dividends paid out in 2015 [ph] earnings are expected to run at a level above $320 million for the year. 
With that, I will now turn the call back to Kasper."

In summing up today's call, I want to emphasize our focus on long-term growth. As we evaluate our performance, we continue to focus on the long-term and on strengthening of our portfolio. 
Over the past year or so, we've launched our newer complete innovation platform in 8 of our 10 largest markets. Wherever we introduced this innovation, it has helped strengthen our brand and our business. At the end of 2014, we introduced ready-to-drink products in several new key markets to diversify our offering to consumers and improve convenience. And just this month, we're introducing fully imported Enfa products into China to satisfy consumer desire for imported quality. Each of these initiatives speak to our focus on driving long-term growth through innovation. I want to recognize the many people throughout Mead Johnson who work on this important initiatives. 
During my recent webcast CAGR presentation, I outlined 4 key factors that were important to our outlook. I'd like to briefly reiterate these before we take your questions. Firstly, I mentioned the effect though foreign exchange with over 70% of our business in emerging markets and more than 75% of sales in non-U.S. dollar currencies. Any change in exchange rates has a significant impact on our top line. Secondly, we will benefit from favorable dairy input costs through much of 2015. Dairy prices impact our income statement with a 7 to 9-month lag. This give us -- this gives us and you great visibility to feature margins and allows us to plan investments accordingly. Finally, outside our 2 largest markets of China/Hong Kong and the United States, we are well diversified. However, these 2 markets account for more than half of our sales. Conditions in the United States continue to improve and our competitive position remains strong. Whereas the China/Hong Kong market is changing rapidly. We see some challenges in the near-term, especially in Hong Kong, but we see many more opportunities in the China market as it continues to evolve and change. And we're investing aggressively around the world and within China to take advantage of emerging consumer trends. 
As we begin our question-and-answer session, let me acknowledge your interest in the progress we are making towards resolution of our China related matter with the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Justice. I ask for your understanding of my inability to go much beyond my prepared remarks and in answering any questions on this topic. As usual, we refer you to the company's disclosure within our 10-Q filing and commit to you that this is reviewed regularly to ensure that you get accurate and timely information. We expect full year constant dollar sales growth to be around 7% and non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $3.90 to $4. 
In summary, we remain confident 2015 will see us once again deliver strong sales and earnings growth consistent with our long-term financial ambition.

And I don't expect that there would be any immediate fix to the situation. However, I'm very confident that we are making progress. And we are closing gaps in our portfolio in China that will allow us to play better. So specifically what our strategy involves is working through the major e-tailers in China such as JD.com, et cetera, and offering these products on -- in our own Tmall store. But I also want you to bear in mind that there is a lot of cross-channel trade happening in China. So a large amount of the sales that you see reflected in data as being Internet sales, are in fact sold for further resale through the baby stores. And we obviously have the ability to go direct to those baby stores rather than going through some Internet-based intermediary. So I feel very good about the strategy. I have previously expressed concern about other business models of which I perceive to be more fragile and, perhaps, unsustainable that involve sort of export or importation into China through private individuals or product that is noncompliant and evasive of Chinese duties. We are not intending to, what shall we say, join that business model. We are trying to set other business model that will allow us to play in China over the long run."

I think, John, you're picking up on a good issue. And clearly, by offering a product in China that is identical from the same manufacturing side as the product we are selling in Hong Kong, we are expecting to see a significant amount of cannibalization between those 2 businesses. However, having said that, we are expecting that this will be a net positive overall business, mainly because servicing the need for imported quality in China solely by the Hong Kong distribution channel limits distribution really to kind of the southern half of China. You might imagine that it's not a very good or effective way to servicing demand in Shanghai or Beijing or even in the West of China. So net-net, we certainly think that this is the right way to go. I also want to stress, I mean, obviously, we didn't have the great foresight to anticipate the disruptions that we are seeing in Hong Kong right now, but I want to sort of stress the risk mitigation element of this initiative as well. You can follow-up with me if I didn't answer that properly. But I want to address your second question as well. I think we continue to be both excited with the potential of the Enfagrow toddler product in the United States, as well as the progress we are making with it. We've seen very significant growth in our distribution of this product as a consequence of the encouraging offtake, really, that the retailers have seen over the past 12 to 24 months. I think most of these distribution gains are probably behind us. And I don't think that we anticipate to see the same number of gains in the 12 months going forward.

We feel obviously, we feel good about projection of around 7% constant dollar growth that is contained in our guidance. Really, it's around comparisons. The first quarter, we were lacking very strong performances for some of -- a series of different reasons but in both the United States and in China how we were lapping really strong compare -- comparison basis. I mentioned there were other factors that kind of impacted that in other smaller markets. So the challenge in the first quarter was always going to be very significant for us and I think we came in, as I said, as expected. So it wasn't as a surprise for us that our growth rate was relatively lower in this quarter, and we feel good about our ability to hit our full year projection. Transitioning to the question about this talk about some enhancement or advertising restrictions in China. I think the industry is still trying to understand what exactly the intent and the plan is of this proposed change to the advertising law. It is likely, I think, that it's not going to turn out to be significantly different from either the current situation in China, which prevents advertising to all products that target infants below 6 months of age, or possibly, it may represent a slight expansion to include products for infants of less than 12 months of age, which is sort of consistent with the approach taken in many other Asian markets. Either way, I think we are very familiar with operating in these kinds of frameworks. It allows us to utilize our medical salesforce quite well. And I think we feel well-positioned to continue to compete and drive demand regardless of where this would go.

Good morning to all of you, and thank you for joining us on this morning's call. I'll begin with highlights of our first quarter global performance before discussing each of our operating segments and our expectations for the full year. Then Charles Urbain, who was recently appointed to the role of Interim Chief Financial Officer, will provide additional details on our financial performance. And finally, I'll return to provide a few summary remarks before we, as usual, open the line to your questions. 
Turning now to the first quarter of 2015. Constant dollar sales growth at 3% came in as expected, and we delivered record level non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.09 in the quarter. Price contributed 3% to revenue growth while, as we lapped very strong quarters in the United States and China businesses, volume was unchanged from the same quarter of prior year. As our rate of revenue growth was significantly affected by performance in the 2014 base year, I firstly remind you that during the first half of 2014, we benefited significantly from competitors' supply disruptions in several large Asian markets, including China. Secondly, you'll remember we mentioned in earlier calls that retailers built inventory in the United States in the first quarter of 2014 to support certain weak contract gains and again, in the fourth quarter of 2014, as they increase inventory ahead of the holiday season and planned promotions in January. These factors affected sales comparisons, and we saw orders lag consumer offtake in the latest quarter. We believe inventory levels are now back to normal and at sustainable levels. I'll provide further details on each of these factors in the segment discussion. 
Like many other companies with significant business outside of the United States, we saw a greater-than-anticipated adverse impact from a strengthening dollar on reported sales this quarter as we translated local currency revenue into dollars. As a result, U.S. dollar revenue for the quarter was 2% below prior year's quarter. The impact of foreign exchange on our income statement provides a good segue to a discussion of gross margin. As indicated in our January call, we saw gross margin improve significantly in the first quarter. The improvement was larger than anticipated as we benefited from weakness in the euro. This euro weakness helped mitigate the impact of currency swings on profitability and earnings. Charles will expand on this point later. Gross margin at 64% was up 210 basis points from the prior quarter. In addition to our margin being helped by the weaker euro, we benefited from lower dairy input costs and the carryover effect of pricing taken through 2014. Similar to the pattern seen in most of our prior years, the timing of marketing initiatives meant that expenditure on advertising and promotion activities was relatively more modest, though still healthy in the first quarter. 
We normally focus our discussion on non-GAAP earnings. However, I'd like to provide a brief update on our previously reported investigation into certain promotional activities within our China subsidiary. This item impacted our GAAP earnings in the quarter. In our last earnings call and in our 10-K filing, we stated that the company had shared the results of our investigation with both the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Justice. Our discussions with ACC regional staff have now progressed significantly since our last call. And in the first quarter of 2015, we've taken an accrual of $12 million. This amount reflects our best estimate of discoursement fines and penalty costs that may be paid to resolve SEC concerns about alleged actions in China. I want to emphasize that discussions with both the SEC and the DOJ are ongoing and no settlement has been agreed to date. Therefore, there can be no assurance that the ultimate amount paid by the company to resolve this matter will not exceed the amount accrued to date or that other sanctions will not be imposed. 
Returning now to non-GAAP measures. Earnings per share were up 7% to $1.09 from $1.02 in the first quarter of 2014. Higher gross margin, lower operating expenses and a lower effective tax rate more than offset the impact on revenue of currency swings. I'm very encouraged by the resilience of our global business. Around the world, our teams are working hard to assist the external environment, appropriately adjust pricing where opportunities exist and drive productivity efforts aggressively. 
Let me now comment on the performance of each of our reporting segments, starting with Asia. In the first quarter, constant dollar sales were in line with the prior year quarter. The quarter was adversely impacted by the effects on sales of civil unrest in Hong Kong. I'll return to this topic shortly. In aggregate, pricing gains of 1% within the segment were offset by slightly lower volume in the quarter. As expected, lower commodity costs have created an environment that discourages price increases. 
Let me now disaggregate our sales results and provide some color surrounding performance in key markets. Before I comment on other markets, including our business in Mainland China, let me draw your attention to the ongoing situation in Hong Kong. Many of you will be aware that the civil disturbance has had the effect of deterring mainland residents from visiting the territory. I remind you that the majority of our sales recorded in Hong Kong are to mainland visitors. Many businesses, including our own, have seen sales adversely impacted. As local protests and unrest have escalated, we have such slower offtake late in the quarter. Sales in the territory in recent weeks have been down around 20% versus our fourth quarter 2014 average. As you might imagine, we are closely monitoring the Hong Kong situation. We believe it'll be temporary and have great faith in the Hong Kong and China government ultimately resolving the situation. That said, it's hard to predict exactly when the situation will return to normal. 
Let me now turn to our business in Mainland China. I'm encouraged that we made progress versus first quarter of 2014. We continue to improve our execution and refine our plans to strengthen our presence in channels where we currently are under-indexed. I previously said we are committed to creating a more flexible and more diversified business in China. This is largely about channel and sourcing strategy. I've also alluded to our desire to mitigate risks associated with the disruption to China/Hong Kong trade. Given recent events in Hong Kong, I'm very pleased to report that we have, this month, begun direct shipment of fully imported finished goods from our Netherlands facility into China. The product offered is identical to that showed in Hong Kong. Clearly flagged as produced in The Netherlands, and will be distributed through e-tailers, our own Tmall store and select baby stores. The launch is a culmination of work begun more than 12 months ago. In contrast to some alternative Internet-based import models, importation will be done by the company itself in full compliance with Chinese quality standards, regulations and tax laws. Production capacity in our Netherlands facility will increase over the next few quarters and support our outlook for better growth in the second half of 2015. We look forward to providing consumers with more choice and more ways in which to interact with our business. 
You'll recall that we described inventory reductions in China in our January call as it related to the fourth quarter of 2014. We did not see further trade destocking in the latest quarter, and we are satisfied with consumer offtake of our recently restaged infant Neuro Complete products. 
Let me now comment on the balance of Asia. Our Philippines and Malaysia businesses delivered solid growth driven by recent Neuro Complete launches and investment to support this innovation. The comparison for Vietnam was affected by the government-imposed price reductions in mid-2014. Because of this prior year event, we expect performance metrics in the second half of 2015 to be more reflective of the progress we are making in the market. Our Thailand business also faced a difficult comparison from first quarter 2014 when we were benefiting from a recall in late 2013 by our biggest competitor. 
As you can tell, we saw a confluence of rather unusual events relating to the external environment. In combination, these events had a depressing effect on Asia's growth within this quarter. We are confident none of these are the lasting nature and that we will return to a more normal growth rate in the second half of 2015. 
Turning now to Latin America. Constant dollar revenue rose 13% in the first quarter over the same quarter of prior year. Volume was up 3% and pricing added 10 points of growth. Foreign exchange movements continue to significantly impact results for the entire segment. The impact of a strengthening dollar and resulting depreciation of local currencies more than offset benefits from pricing gains. Pricing gains in the high inflation countries of Venezuela and Argentina contributed 900 basis points to the region's constant dollar growth rate. However, I'm pleased to note that both countries posted very solid double-digit volume growth and that the pricing gains in Argentina more than covered the impact of currency depreciation there. We continued to gain market share in most of the region with our premium Enfa brand. The brand is being supported by the same Neuro Complete innovation we are rolling out across Asia. As you are likely aware, economic conditions in Brazil have deteriorated sharply over the last year. As a result, we are seeing weakness in our Sustagen branded children's business. However, we continue to see strong growth in our Enfa franchise as we establish ourselves as the leading premium infant formula brand in Brazil. We saw strong rebounds in growth in both Colombia and Peru, both markets had a difficult year in 2014 when they addressed unique challenges. From cross-border trade in the case of Colombia and from a deteriorating customer relationship in the case of Peru, we've made good progress on putting both issues behind us. And as a consequence, these businesses are seeing growth restored. 
Let me now turn to our North America/Europe segment. Constant dollar revenue in this segment was up 3% on the prior year's quarter driven by share gains in North America and price increases taken last year. Volume for the segment was unchanged compared to a strong base year. In the United States, volume was adversely impacted by a fourth quarter inventory build amongst leading retailers. The buildup late in 2014 was highlighted in our description of 2014 full year results as having contributed to a strong fourth quarter. This incremental inventory was fully consumed in the first quarter. And going forward, we expect sales to be more reflective of consumer demand. Secondly, sales in the first quarter of 2014, driven by certain WIC contract wins, resulted in a tough comparison this quarter. But importantly, we continued to gain market share in North America and Europe, and we now have market-leading positions in both the United States and Canada. In Europe, we made a decision to exit the Russia market. The Russian market is characterized by intense competition and high operating costs in a deteriorating economic environment. This action is consistent with our decision to focus on playing where we can win in Europe with focus on the allergy segment and making only selective plays in routine infant formula. This European strategy continues to pay off. Once again, we delivered double-digit constant dollar growth within a very large but shrinking European market. 
Let me now summarize our 2015 full year outlook. We continue to expect revenue growth around 7% on a constant dollar basis. In this segment, Charles will outline how we now anticipate a slightly stronger headwind from foreign exchange. However, as our cost structure continues to benefit from a weaker euro and lower dairy costs, we now have an improved outlook for gross margin for the full year, allowing us to maintain our non-GAAP earnings per share guidance in the range of $3.90 to $4. At the same time, we anticipate investing more aggressively in demand creation in the coming quarters. 
Before I hand the call over to Charles, let me briefly introduce him to those of you who don't know him. Charles began his career as an auditor with Price, Waterhouse before serving in various tax and finance positions in Schlumberger. He then joined Bristol-Myers Squibb, where he progressed through a series of local, regional and global treasury and finance roles, before serving as Chief Financial Officer for Mead Johnson, while we were still a division within the Bristol-Myers Squibb company. From that role, he was promoted to various business-leading roles and has run each of our operating regions prior to his most recent role as Chief Development Officer with responsibility for the company's M&A strategy, Human Resources and external affairs. Charles is being quick to pick up the reigns in his Interim CFO role and I know you'll enjoy your interactions with him. I'm very grateful that Charles has accepted this role as he's the perfect partner to help me build and mentor our next-generation finance organization. 
Charles, I hand the call over to you."

Having had a long and enjoyable history with Mead Johnson, both on the commercial side and earlier in my career in finance, I'm very pleased to be in the Interim CFO role. I've met many of you in the early days after the IPO and look forward to renewing those acquaintances. 
Kasper noted that our annual recorded dollar sales growth is expected to be slightly lower than previous guidance due to the impact of the stronger dollar on the translation of sales from local currencies. So I'll begin my prepared remarks with a brief discussion on foreign exchange as it impacts the quarter and outlook for the year. I will then provide highlights on key sales and expense items as I walk down the income statement. And I'll wrap up with comments on our balance sheet and cash flow. Unless otherwise noted, my comments will be on non-GAAP financials results and references to currency impacts are the effects of currently -- currency fluctuations on the translation of local currency financial statements into dollars. 
I'll move into a little discussion on foreign exchange. And this really represents our perspective on the foreign exchange environment, which is both pertinent to our discussion of the first quarter and balance of the year. We expect to see adverse foreign exchange conditions throughout 2015 as the dollar is generally forecasted to continue strengthening for the remainder of the year. In exchange rates, which remain at their current level and allowing for some continued modest devaluation in Venezuela and Argentina later in the year, we would expect foreign exchange to adversely affect growth by about 5% for the full year 2015. We experienced the similar impact from foreign exchange fluctuations in the first quarter. While it is clear that FX has become a more significant headwind in the translation of sales, bear in mind that they are potential offsets. For example, a weaker euro helps to reduce the impact on our earnings. We have a large manufacturing operation in Europe that, when combined with a relatively low local revenue base, makes us a net beneficiary of euro weakness. In the last several months, we have seen a significant slowdown in Venezuelan government approvals to exchange bolivars into dollars to pay for product that we bring into the country. Our exposed bolivar cash balance is increasing as a result. We will consider limiting exports to Venezuela in order to manage our overall exposure to that country. We are closely monitoring our exposure and will continue to evaluate options with the most recent facts and circumstances. 
I will now begin my review of the income statement, beginning with sales performance. For the first quarter, constant dollar sales grew 3%. Foreign exchange reduced sales growth by 5%, resulting in lower recorded sales of 2% versus the prior year quarter. The U.S. dollar continued to strengthen during the quarter, and its effect on the translation of local currencies impacted all reporting segments. The Venezuelan bolivar and the most recent -- had the most significant adverse impact on sales, but most currencies were impacted, notably the Mexican peso and the Chinese renminbi. The impact of increased pricing, particularly in Latin America, partially offset the impact of weakening currencies. Volumes were in line with the prior year quarter on an aggregate basis. North America and Latin America sales grew in constant dollars and Asia sales were in line with the prior year as pricing gains offset small declines in volume. 
I'll now move on to factors discussing the impact -- impacting our gross profit. The gross margin was 64% in the first quarter, up 210 basis points sequentially from the fourth quarter of 2014, and slightly up from the first quarter of 2014. Lower dairy costs and the impact of pricing were the key drivers of this improvement. Pricing gains were primarily the impact of carryover prices taken last year. In our last conference call, we cautioned that with a lower dairy cost, it would be a more difficult pricing environment even as we introduce innovation. This can already be seen in our first quarter results with pricing contributing 3% compared to last year's annual pricing gains of 5%. While dairy cost in aggregate have decreased quite sharply, it is worth noting that there is a range of cost reductions, depending upon the sourcing region, and several dairy components have, in fact, increased in cost. It should also be noted that nondairy commodities, which represent around 60% of our cost of commodities have, in fact, increased versus the prior year quarter. In total, the composite reduction in Mead Johnson commodity costs is in the high-single digits. Overall, we're very pleased with the strong gross margin in the first quarter and we now believe that the annual gross margin would be approximately 64%. Keep in mind that spot dairy prices are reflected in our cost of goods on a 7-month lag, so the current spot price takes us through November. 
Moving on to operating expenses. The first quarter's operating expenses of 36.6% of sales was similar to the prior year quarter of 36.9%. On a constant dollar basis, total demand generation investments rose at a similar rate to sales. Please note that sales force marketing and other demand generating costs are included in this total. Within demand generating expenses, advertising and promotion spend was 13.2% of sales. Historically, these investments are lower in the first quarter of the year. We expect significantly higher investment level starting in the second quarter as additional innovation and promotional campaigns are launched. 
To conclude my discussion on operating expenses, for the full year, we reiterate our intention to reinvest a portion of our higher gross margins back into the business through higher demand generating spends. As a consequence, we anticipate our operating expenses for the year to be approximately 39% of sales with EBIT slightly above 24.5%. 
I will now briefly speak about our taxes and effective tax rate. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate or ETR was 22.5% in the first quarter compared to 25.7% in the prior year quarter. The lower rates is the result of a favorable geographic mix of earnings. On a full year basis, we expect the ETR to be slightly better than our previous guidance of 24% as the favorable earnings mix in Q4 -- in Q1 may not fully prevail for the full year. 
Moving on to factors which would impact EPS guidance on a non-GAAP basis. We continue to expect constant dollar sales growth of approximately 7% this year with foreign currency reducing sales growth by about 5%. As a result, reported sales would increase by 2%. As you look at key factors which could impact EPS performance in the balance of the year, there are several factors which should be considered. An additional adverse foreign exchange impact on sales, which I referred to earlier, would reduce earnings, but is projected to be fully offset by slightly higher gross margins and a lower tax rate. We anticipate dairy cost tailwinds through the remainder of the year, but I again draw your attention to the other commodity offsets highlighted earlier in my remarks. Higher advertising and promotion spend in the remainder of the year, which will coincide with our key commercial activities. It is anticipated that investment will peak in quarter 2 with increases of at least 400 basis points above quarter 1 levels, taking our first half spend to around 15% of sales. Therefore, non-GAAP earnings guidance continues to be in the range of $3.90 to $4 a share, which is growth of about 4% to 7% versus 2014. The lower end of our range continues to assume a more pessimistic foreign exchange environment, among other factors, while still delivering EPS leverage to sales. As a reminder, growth rates and investment levels will continue to vary from quarter-to-quarter, reflecting the timing of our initiatives. 
I will now wrap up with a high level overview of the balance sheet. As an introductory comment, I believe it's worth noting that we have a very high return on invested capital with a return on invested capital greater than 40% and over 100% of net income converted into free cash flow in the first quarter. Of course, these measures can fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter, but this remains a remarkably strong balance sheet. Our cash balance is $1.4 billion as of March 31, 2015, up about $140 million from the prior year end. Note that cash held in the United States was about $205 million. Free clash -- free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures, was approximately $228 million in the first quarter after consuming $46 million in cash for capital investments. For the full year, capital spending expectations remain unchanged with about $175 million. This is consistent with our longer-term target of about 4% of sales. Depreciation and amortization expense is expected to be around $100 million for the full year. 
During the first quarter, our Board of Directors announced a 10% increase to our dividend, which should annualize to approximately $1.65 per share or $1.65 per share. As a result, dividends paid out as of 200 -- 2015 earnings are expected to run at a level above $320 million for the year. 
With that, I will now turn the call back to Kasper."

In summing up today's call, I want to emphasize our focus on long-term growth. As we evaluate our performance, we'll continue to focus on the long-term and on strengthening of our portfolio. 
Over the past year or so, we've launched our Neuro Complete innovation platform in 8 of our 10 largest markets. Wherever we've introduced this innovation, it has helped strengthen our brand and our business. At the end of 2014, we introduced ready-to-drink products in several new key markets to diversify our offering to consumers and improve convenience. And just this month, we are introducing fully imported Enfa products into China to satisfy consumer desire for imported quality. Each of these initiatives speak to our focus on driving long-term growth through innovation. I want to recognize the many people throughout Mead Johnson who work on this important initiatives. 
During my recent webcast, CAGNY presentation, I outlined 4 key factors that were important to our outlook. I'd like to briefly reiterate these before we take your questions. Firstly, I mentioned the effect of foreign exchange with over 70% of our business in emerging markets and more than 75% of sales in non-U.S. dollar currencies. Any change in exchange rates has a significant impact on our top line. Secondly, we will benefit from favorable dairy input costs through much of 2015. Dairy prices impact our income statement with a 7- to 9-month lag. This give us -- this gives us and you great visibility to future margins and allows us to plan investments accordingly. Finally, outside our 2 largest markets of China/Hong Kong and the United States, we are well diversified. However, these 2 markets account for more than half of our sales. Conditions in the United States continue to improve and our competitive position remains strong. Whereas, the China/Hong Kong market is changing rapidly. We see some challenges in the near-term, especially in Hong Kong, but we see many more opportunities in the China market as it continues to evolve and change. And we're investing aggressively around the world and within China to take advantage of emerging consumer trends. 
As we begin our question-and-answer session, let me acknowledge your interest in the progress we are making towards resolution of our China-related matter with the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Justice. I ask for your understanding of my inability to go much beyond my prepared remarks and in answering any questions on this topic. As usual, we refer you to the company's disclosure within our 10-Q filing and commit to you that this is reviewed regularly to ensure you get accurate and timely information. We expect full year constant dollar sales growth to be around 7% and non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $3.90 to $4. 
In summary, we remain confident 2015 will see us once again deliver strong sales and earnings growth consistent with our long-term financial ambition.

I think that the, what should we say, the discontent amongst local Hong Kong residents go probably much beyond cross-border trade. I think there are political motivations to do with this satisfaction about the level of sale the general populace has in the selection of the Hong Kong Chief Executive, et cetera, which, you can imagine, I don't want to get too far into. But I think it is more than a trade issue, which makes it a little bit more difficult to predict when and where and how it will be resolved. I want to be very clear that there are no significant out-of-stock issues in Hong Kong. The industry, I think, has done a good and responsible job working with the authorities to resolve the out-of-stock issues that led to this initial restriction on parallel exports. Those issues are now being monitored regularly by the authorities and I know that the authorities are satisfied, I think, with the industry as a whole, but extremely satisfied with Mead Johnson's performance on this issue."

However, I'm very confident that we are making progress. And we are closing gaps in our portfolio in China that will allow us to play better. So specifically what our strategy involves is working through the major e-tailers in China such as JD.com, et cetera, and offering these products on -- in our own Tmall store. But I also want you to bear in mind that there is a lot of cross-channel trade happening in China. So a large amount of the sales that you see reflected in data as being Internet sales, are in fact sold for further resale through the baby stores. And we obviously have the ability to go direct to those baby stores rather than going through some Internet-based intermediary. So I feel very good about the strategy. I have previously expressed concern about other business models of -- which I perceive to be more fragile and perhaps, unsustainable that involve sort of export or importation into China through private individuals or product that is noncompliant and evasive of Chinese duties.

I think, John, you're picking up on a good issue. And clearly, by offering a product in China that is identical from the same manufacturing side as the product we are selling in Hong Kong, we are expecting to see a significant amount of cannibalization between those 2 businesses. However, having said that, we are expecting that this will be a net positive for our overall business, mainly because servicing the need for imported quality in China solely by the Hong Kong distribution channel limits distribution really to kind of the southern half of China. You might imagine that it's not a very good or effective way to servicing demand in Shanghai or Beijing or even in the West of China. So net-net, we certainly think that this is the right way to go. I also want to stress, I mean, obviously, we didn't have the great foresight to anticipate the disruptions that we are seeing in Hong Kong right now, but I want to sort of stress the risk mitigation element of this initiative as well. You can follow up with me if you have -- if I didn't answer that properly but I want to address your second question as well. I think we continue to be both excited with the potential of the Enfagrow toddler product in the United States, as well as the progress we are making with it. We've seen very significant growth in our distribution of this product as a consequence of the encouraging offtake, really, that the retailers have seen over the past 12 to 24 months. I think most of these distribution gains are probably behind us. And I don't think that we anticipate to see the same number of gains in the 12 months going forward. However, we, as you might imagine, we monitor sort of same-store sales very, very closely, and we're very encouraged by what we are seeing on that front as well."

We feel -- obviously, we feel good about projection of around 7% constant dollar growth that is contained in our guidance. Really, it's around comparisons. The first quarter, we were lapping very strong performances for sort of a series of different reasons. But in both the United States and in China, we were lapping really strong comparison basis. I mentioned there were other factors that kind of impacted that in other smaller markets. So the challenge in the first quarter was always going to be very significant for us and I think we came in, as I said, as expected. So it wasn't as a surprise for us that our growth rate was relatively lower in this quarter, and we feel good about our ability to hit our full year projection. Transitioning to the question about this talk about some enhancement of advertising restrictions in China. I think the industry is still trying to understand what exactly the intent and the plan is of this proposed change to the advertising law. It is likely, I think, that it's not going to turn out to be significantly different from either the current situation in China, which prevents advertising to all products that target infants below 6 months of age, or possibly, it may represent a slight expansion to include products for infants of less than 12 months of age, which is sort of consistent with the approach taking -- taken in many other Asian markets. Either way, I think we are very familiar with operating in these kinds of frameworks. It allows us to utilize our medical sales force quite well, and I think we feel well positioned to continue to compete and drive demand regardless of where this would go.

I also want to say that what we do understand about, particularly the Internet channel in China, is that a lot of the growth in the Internet channel is coming from third and fourth tier cities in China, where the offering of a greater selection of goods is a much bigger advantage than it is in the major cities. So this also becomes a way to -- for us to expand at a relatively low fixed cost into some of those cities, where we don't currently have feet on the ground."

Good morning to all of you, and thank you for joining us on this morning's call. I'll begin with highlights of our first quarter global performance before discussing each of our operating segments and our expectations for the full year. Then Charles Urbain, who was recently appointed to the role of Interim Chief Financial Officer, will provide additional details on our financial performance. And finally, I'll return to provide a few summary remarks before we, as usual, open the line to your questions. 
Turning now to the first quarter of 2015. Constant dollar sales growth at 3% came in as expected, and we delivered record level non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.09 in the quarter. Price contributed 3% to revenue growth while, as we lapped very strong quarters in the United States and China businesses, volume was unchanged from the same quarter of prior year. As our rate of revenue growth was significantly affected by performance in the 2014 base year, I firstly remind you that during the first half of 2014, we benefited significantly from competitors' supply disruptions in several large Asian markets, including China. Secondly, you'll remember we mentioned in earlier calls that retailers built inventory in the United States in the first quarter of 2014 to support certain WIC contract gains and again, in the fourth quarter of 2014, as they increased inventory ahead of the holiday season and planned promotions in January. These factors affected sales comparisons, and we saw orders lag consumer offtake in the latest quarter. We believe inventory levels are now back to normal and at sustainable levels. I'll provide further details on each of these factors in the segment discussion. 
Like many other companies with significant business outside of the United States, we saw a greater-than-anticipated adverse impact from a strengthening dollar on reported sales this quarter as we translated local currency revenue into dollars. As a result, U.S. dollar revenue for the quarter was 2% below prior year's quarter. The impact of foreign exchange on our income statement provides a good segue to a discussion of gross margin. As indicated in our January call, we saw gross margin improve significantly in the first quarter. The improvement was larger than anticipated as we benefited from weakness in the euro. This euro weakness helped mitigate the impact of currency swings on profitability and earnings. Charles will expand on this point later. Gross margin at 64% was up 210 basis points from the prior quarter. In addition to our margin being helped by the weaker euro, we benefited from lower dairy input costs and the carryover effect of pricing taken through 2014. Similar to the pattern seen in most of our prior years, the timing of marketing initiatives meant that expenditure on advertising and promotion activities was relatively more modest, though still healthy in the first quarter. 
We normally focus our discussion on non-GAAP earnings. However, I'd like to provide a brief update on our previously reported investigation into certain promotional activities within our China subsidiary. This item impacted our GAAP earnings in the quarter. In our last earnings call and in our 10-K filing, we stated that the company had shared the results of our investigation with both the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Justice. Our discussions with ACC regional staff have now progressed significantly since our last call. And in the first quarter of 2015, we've taken an accrual of $12 million. This amount reflects our best estimate of discoursement fines and penalty costs that may be paid to resolve SEC concerns about alleged actions in China. I want to emphasize that discussions with both the SEC and the DOJ are ongoing and no settlement has been agreed to date. Therefore, there can be no assurance that the ultimate amount paid by the company to resolve this matter will not exceed the amount accrued to date or that other sanctions will not be imposed. 
Returning now to non-GAAP measures. Earnings per share were up 7% to $1.09 from $1.02 in the first quarter of 2014. Higher gross margin, lower operating expenses and a lower effective tax rate more than offset the impact on revenue of currency swings. I'm very encouraged by the resilience of our global business. Around the world, our teams are working hard to assist the external environment, appropriately adjust pricing where opportunities exist and drive productivity efforts aggressively. 
Let me now comment on the performance of each of our reporting segments, starting with Asia. In the first quarter, constant dollar sales were in line with the prior year quarter. The quarter was adversely impacted by the effects on sales of civil unrest in Hong Kong. I'll return to this topic shortly. In aggregate, pricing gains of 1% within the segment were offset by slightly lower volume in the quarter. As expected, lower commodity costs have created an environment that discourages price increases. 
Let me now disaggregate our sales results and provide some color surrounding performance in key markets. Before I comment on other markets, including our business in Mainland China, let me draw your attention to the ongoing situation in Hong Kong. Many of you will be aware that the civil disturbance has had the effect of deterring mainland residents from visiting the territory. I remind you that the majority of our sales recorded in Hong Kong are to mainland visitors. Many businesses, including our own, have seen sales adversely impacted. As local protests and unrest have escalated, we have served slower offtake late in the quarter. Sales in the territory in recent weeks have been down around 20% versus our fourth quarter 2014 average. As you might imagine, we are closely monitoring the Hong Kong situation. We believe it'll be temporary and have great faith in the Hong Kong and China government ultimately resolving the situation. That said, it's hard to predict exactly when the situation will return to normal. 
Let me now turn to our business in Mainland China. I'm encouraged that we made progress versus first quarter of 2014. We continue to improve our execution and refine our plans to strengthen our presence in channels where we currently are under-indexed. I previously said we are committed to creating a more flexible and more diversified business in China. This is largely about channel and sourcing strategy. I've also alluded to our desire to mitigate risks associated with the disruption to China/Hong Kong trade. Given recent events in Hong Kong, I'm very pleased to report that we have, this month, begun direct shipment of fully imported finished goods from our Netherlands facility into China. The product offered is identical to that showed in Hong Kong. Clearly flagged as produced in The Netherlands, and will be distributed through e-tailers, our own Tmall store and select baby stores. The launch is a culmination of work begun more than 12 months ago. In contrast to some alternative Internet-based import models, importation will be done by the company itself in full compliance with Chinese quality standards, regulations and tax laws. Production capacity in our Netherlands facility will increase over the next few quarters and support our outlook for better growth in the second half of 2015. We look forward to providing consumers with more choice and more ways in which to interact with our business. 
You'll recall that we described inventory reductions in China in our January call as it related to the fourth quarter of 2014. We did not see further trade destocking in the latest quarter, and we are satisfied with consumer offtake of our recently restaged infant Neuro Complete products. 
Let me now comment on the balance of Asia. Our Philippines and Malaysia businesses delivered solid growth driven by recent Neuro Complete launches and investment to support this innovation. The comparison for Vietnam was affected by the government-imposed price reductions in mid-2014. Because of this prior year event, we expect performance metrics in the second half of 2015 to be more reflective of the progress we are making in the market. Our Thailand business also faced a difficult comparison from first quarter 2014 when we were benefiting from a recall in late 2013 by our biggest competitor. 
As you can tell, we saw a confluence of rather unusual events relating to the external environment. In combination, these events had a depressing effect on Asia's growth within this quarter. We are confident none of these are of a lasting nature and that we will return to a more normal growth rate in the second half of 2015. 
Turning now to Latin America. Constant dollar revenue rose 13% in the first quarter over the same quarter of prior year. Volume was up 3% and pricing added 10 points of growth. Foreign exchange movements continue to significantly impact results for the entire segment. The impact of a strengthening dollar and resulting depreciation of local currencies more than offset benefits from pricing gains. Pricing gains in the high inflation countries of Venezuela and Argentina contributed 900 basis points to the region's constant dollar growth rate. However, I'm pleased to note that both countries posted very solid double-digit volume growth and that the pricing gains in Argentina more than covered the impact of currency depreciation there. We continued to gain market share in most of the region with our premium Enfa brand. The brand is being supported by the same Neuro Complete innovation we are rolling out across Asia. As you are likely aware, economic conditions in Brazil have deteriorated sharply over the last year. As a result, we are seeing weakness in our Sustagen branded children's business. However, we continue to see strong growth in our Enfa franchise as we establish ourselves as the leading premium infant formula brand in Brazil. We saw strong rebounds in growth in both Colombia and Peru, both markets had a difficult year in 2014 when they addressed unique challenges. From cross-border trade in the case of Colombia and from a deteriorating customer relationship in the case of Peru, we've made good progress on putting both issues behind us. And as a consequence, these businesses are seeing growth restored. 
Let me now turn to our North America/Europe segment. Constant dollar revenue in this segment was up 3% on the prior year's quarter driven by share gains in North America and price increases taken last year. Volume for the segment was unchanged compared to a strong base year. In the United States, volume was adversely impacted by a fourth quarter inventory build amongst leading retailers. The buildup late in 2014 was highlighted in our description of 2014 full year results as having contributed to a strong fourth quarter. This incremental inventory was fully consumed in the first quarter. And going forward, we expect sales to be more reflective of consumer demand. Secondly, sales in the first quarter of 2014, driven by certain WIC contract wins, resulted in a tough comparison this quarter. But importantly, we continued to gain market share in North America and Europe, and we now have market-leading positions in both the United States and Canada. In Europe, we made a decision to exit the Russia market. The Russian market is characterized by intense competition and high operating costs in a deteriorating economic environment. This action is consistent with our decision to focus on playing where we can win in Europe with focus on the allergy segment and making only selective plays in routine infant formula. This European strategy continues to pay off. Once again, we delivered double-digit constant dollar growth within a very large but shrinking European market. 
Let me now summarize our 2015 full year outlook. We continue to expect revenue growth around 7% on a constant dollar basis. In this segment, Charles will outline how we now anticipate a slightly stronger headwind from foreign exchange. However, as our cost structure continues to benefit from a weaker euro and lower dairy costs, we now have an improved outlook for gross margin for the full year, allowing us to maintain our non-GAAP earnings per share guidance in the range of $3.90 to $4. At the same time, we anticipate investing more aggressively in demand creation in the coming quarters. 
Before I hand the call over to Charles, let me briefly introduce him to those of you who don't know him. Charles began his career as an auditor with Price Waterhouse before serving in various tax and finance positions in Schlumberger. He then joined Bristol-Myers Squibb, where he progressed through a series of local, regional and global treasury and finance roles, before serving as Chief Financial Officer for Mead Johnson, while we were still a division within the Bristol-Myers Squibb company. From that role, he was promoted to various business-leading roles and has run each of our operating regions prior to his most recent role as Chief Development Officer with responsibility for the company's M&A strategy, Human Resources and external affairs. Charles has been quick to pick up the reigns in his Interim CFO role and I know you'll enjoy your interactions with him. I'm very grateful that Charles has accepted this role as he's the perfect partner to help me build and mentor our next-generation finance organization. 
Charles, I hand the call over to you."

Having had a long and enjoyable history with Mead Johnson, both on the commercial side and earlier in my career in finance, I'm very pleased to be in the Interim CFO role. I've met many of you in the early days after the IPO and look forward to renewing those acquaintances. 
Kasper noted that our annual recorded dollar sales growth is expected to be slightly lower than previous guidance due to the impact of the stronger dollar on the translation of sales from local currencies. So I'll begin my prepared remarks with a brief discussion on foreign exchange as it impacts the quarter and outlook for the year. I will then provide highlights on key sales and expense items as I walk down the income statement. And I'll wrap up with comments on our balance sheet and cash flow. Unless otherwise noted, my comments will be on our non-GAAP financials results and references to currency impacts are the effects of currently -- currency fluctuations on the translation of local currency financial statements into dollars. 
I'll move into a little discussion on foreign exchange. And this really represents our perspective on the foreign exchange environment, which is both pertinent to our discussion of the first quarter and balance of the year. We expect to see adverse foreign exchange conditions throughout 2015 as the dollar is generally forecasted to continue strengthening for the remainder of the year. If exchange rates were to remain at their current level and allowing for some continued modest devaluation in Venezuela and Argentina later in the year, we would expect foreign exchange to adversely affect growth by about 5% for the full year 2015. We experienced the similar impact from foreign exchange fluctuations in the first quarter. While it is clear that FX has become a more significant headwind in the translation of sales, bear in mind that they are potential offsets. For example, a weaker euro helps to reduce the impact on our earnings. We have a large manufacturing operation in Europe that, when combined with a relatively low local revenue base, makes us a net beneficiary of euro weakness. In the last several months, we have seen a significant slowdown in Venezuelan government approvals to exchange bolivars into dollars to pay for product that we bring into the country. Our exposed bolivar cash balance is increasing as a result. We will consider limiting exports to Venezuela in order to manage our overall exposure to that country. We are closely monitoring our exposure and will continue to evaluate options with the most recent facts and circumstances. 
I will now begin my review of the income statement, beginning with sales performance. For the first quarter, constant dollar sales grew 3%. Foreign exchange reduced sales growth by 5%, resulting in lower recorded sales of 2% versus the prior year quarter. The U.S. dollar continued to strengthen during the quarter, and its effect on the translation of local currencies impacted all reporting segments. The Venezuelan bolivar and the most recent -- had the most significant adverse impact on sales, but most currencies were impacted, notably the Mexican peso and the Chinese renminbi. The impact of increased pricing, particularly in Latin America, partially offset the impact of weakening currencies. Volumes were in line with the prior year quarter on an aggregate basis. North America and Latin America sales grew in constant dollars and Asia sales were in line with the prior year as pricing gains offset small declines in volume. 
I'll now move on to factors discussing the impact -- impacting our gross profit. The gross margin was 64% in the first quarter, up 210 basis points sequentially from the fourth quarter of 2014, and slightly up from the first quarter of 2014. Lower dairy costs and the impact of pricing were the key drivers of this improvement. Pricing gains were primarily the impact of carryover prices taken last year. In our last conference call, we cautioned that with a lower dairy cost, it would be a more difficult pricing environment even as we introduce innovation. This can already be seen in our first quarter results with pricing contributing 3% compared to last year's annual pricing gains of 5%. While dairy costs in aggregate have decreased quite sharply, it is worth noting that there is a range of cost reductions, depending upon the sourcing region, and several dairy components have, in fact, increased in cost. It should also be noted that nondairy commodities, which represent around 60% of our cost of commodities have, in fact, increased versus the prior year quarter. In total, the composite reduction in Mead Johnson commodity costs is in the high-single digits. Overall, we're very pleased with the strong gross margin in the first quarter and we now believe that the annual gross margin would be approximately 64%. Keep in mind that spot dairy prices are reflected in our cost of goods on a 7-month lag, so the current spot price takes us through November. 
Moving on to operating expenses. The first quarter's operating expenses of 36.6% of sales was similar to the prior year quarter of 36.9%. On a constant dollar basis, total demand generation investments rose at a similar rate to sales. Please note that sales force marketing and other demand generating costs are included in this total. Within demand generating expenses, advertising and promotion spend was 13.2% of sales. Historically, these investments are lower in the first quarter of the year. We expect significantly higher investment level starting in the second quarter as additional innovation and promotional campaigns are launched. 
To conclude my discussion on operating expenses, for the full year, we reiterate our intention to reinvest a portion of our higher gross margins back into the business through higher demand generating spends. As a consequence, we anticipate our operating expenses for the year to be approximately 39% of sales with EBIT slightly above 24.5%. 
I will now briefly speak about our taxes and effective tax rate. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate or ETR was 22.5% in the first quarter compared to 25.7% in the prior year quarter. The lower rate is the result of a favorable geographic mix of earnings. On a full year basis, we expect the ETR to be slightly better than our previous guidance of 24% as the favorable earnings mix in Q4 -- in Q1 may not fully prevail for the full year. 
Moving on to factors which would impact EPS guidance on a non-GAAP basis. We continue to expect constant dollar sales growth of approximately 7% this year with foreign currency reducing sales growth by about 5%. As a result, reported sales would increase by 2%. As you look at key factors which could impact EPS performance in the balance of the year, there are several factors which should be considered. An additional adverse foreign exchange impact on sales, which I referred to earlier, would reduce earnings, but is projected to be fully offset by slightly higher gross margins and a lower tax rate. We anticipate dairy cost tailwinds through the remainder of the year, but I again draw your attention to the other commodity offsets highlighted earlier in my remarks. Higher advertising and promotion spend in the remainder of the year, which will coincide with our key commercial activities. It is anticipated that investment will peak in quarter 2 with increases of at least 400 basis points above quarter 1 levels, taking our first half spend to around 15% of sales. Therefore, non-GAAP earnings guidance continues to be in the range of $3.90 to $4 a share, which is growth of about 4% to 7% versus 2014. The lower end of our range continues to assume a more pessimistic foreign exchange environment, among other factors, while still delivering EPS leverage to sales. As a reminder, growth rates and investment levels will continue to vary from quarter-to-quarter, reflecting the timing of our initiatives. 
I will now wrap up with a high level overview of the balance sheet. As an introductory comment, I believe it's worth noting that we have a very high return on invested capital with a return on invested capital greater than 40% and over 100% of net income converted into free cash flow in the first quarter. Of course, these measures can fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter, but this remains a remarkably strong balance sheet. Our cash balance is $1.4 billion as of March 31, 2015, up about $140 million from the prior year end. Note that cash held in the United States was about $205 million. Free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures, was approximately $228 million in the first quarter after consuming $46 million in cash for capital investments. For the full year, capital spending expectations remain unchanged with about $175 million. This is consistent with our longer-term target of about 4% of sales. Depreciation and amortization expense is expected to be around $100 million for the full year. 
During the first quarter, our Board of Directors announced a 10% increase to our dividend, which should annualize to approximately $1.65 per share, $1.65 per share. As a result, dividends paid out of the 220 -- '15 earnings are expected to run at a level above $320 million for the year. 
With that, I will now turn the call back to Kasper."

In summing up today's call, I want to emphasize our focus on long-term growth. As we evaluate our performance, we'll continue to focus on the long-term and on strengthening of our portfolio. 
Over the past year or so, we've launched our Neuro Complete innovation platform in 8 of our 10 largest markets. Wherever we've introduced this innovation, it has helped strengthen our brand and our business. At the end of 2014, we introduced ready-to-drink products in several new key markets to diversify our offering to consumers and improve convenience. And just this month, we are introducing fully imported Enfa products into China to satisfy consumer desire for imported quality. Each of these initiatives speak to our focus on driving long-term growth through innovation. I want to recognize the many people throughout Mead Johnson who work on this important initiatives. 
During my recent webcast CAGNY presentation, I outlined 4 key factors that were important to our outlook. I'd like to briefly reiterate these before we take your questions. Firstly, I mentioned the effect of foreign exchange with over 70% of our business in emerging markets and more than 75% of sales in non-U.S. dollar currencies. Any change in exchange rates has a significant impact on our top line. Secondly, we will benefit from favorable dairy input costs through much of 2015. Dairy prices impact our income statement with a 7- to 9-month lag. This give us -- this gives us and you great visibility to future margins and allows us to plan investments accordingly. Finally, outside our 2 largest markets of China/Hong Kong and the United States, we are well diversified. However, these 2 markets account for more than half of our sales. Conditions in the United States continue to improve and our competitive position remains strong. Whereas, the China/Hong Kong market is changing rapidly. We see some challenges in the near-term, especially in Hong Kong, but we see many more opportunities in the China market as it continues to evolve and change. And we're investing aggressively around the world and within China to take advantage of emerging consumer trends. 
As we begin our question-and-answer session, let me acknowledge your interest in the progress we are making towards resolution of our China-related matter with the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Justice. I ask for your understanding of my inability to go much beyond my prepared remarks and in answering any questions on this topic. As usual, we refer you to the company's disclosure within our 10-Q filing and commit to you that this is reviewed regularly to ensure you get accurate and timely information. We expect full year constant dollar sales growth to be around 7% and non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $3.90 to $4. 
In summary, we remain confident 2015 will see us once again deliver strong sales and earnings growth consistent with our long-term financial ambition. 
I'll now turn the call back to the operator so we can open the lines to your questions. Amanda, over to you."

I think that the, what should we say, the discontent amongst local Hong Kong residents go probably much beyond cross-border trade. I think there are political motivations to do with this satisfaction about the level of say the general populace has in the selection of the Hong Kong Chief Executive, et cetera, which, you can imagine, I don't want to get too far into. But I think it is more than a trade issue, which makes it a little bit more difficult to predict when and where and how it will be resolved. I want to be very clear that there are no significant out-of-stock issues in Hong Kong. The industry, I think, has done a good and responsible job working with the authorities to resolve the out-of-stock issues that led to this initial restriction on parallel exports. Those issues are now being monitored regularly by the authorities and I know that the authorities are satisfied, I think, with the industry as a whole, but extremely satisfied with Mead Johnson's performance on this issue."

However, I'm very confident that we are making progress. And we are closing gaps in our portfolio in China that will allow us to play better. So specifically what our strategy involves is working through the major e-tailers in China such as JD.com, et cetera, and offering these products on -- in our own Tmall store. But I also want you to bear in mind that there is a lot of cross-channel trade happening in China. So a large amount of the sales that you see reflected in data as being Internet sales, are in fact sold for further resale through the baby stores. And we obviously have the ability to go direct to those baby stores rather than going through some Internet-based intermediary. So I feel very good about the strategy. I have previously expressed concern about other business models of -- which I perceive to be more fragile and perhaps, unsustainable that involve sort of export or importation into China through private individuals or product that is noncompliant and evasive of Chinese duties. We are not intending to, what should we say, join that business model. We are trying to set up a business model that will allow us to play in China over the long run."

Importantly, it's fully -- it's approved for sale, right, which is a big distinction, I think. Isn't that really sort of the strategy here?

I think, John, you're picking up on a good issue. And clearly, by offering a product in China that is identical, from the same manufacturing site, as the product we are selling in Hong Kong, we are expecting to see a significant amount of cannibalization between those 2 businesses. However, having said that, we are expecting that this will be a net positive for our overall business, mainly because servicing the need for imported quality in China solely by the Hong Kong distribution channel limits distribution really to kind of the southern half of China. You might imagine that it's not a very good or effective way to servicing demand in Shanghai or Beijing or even in the West of China. So net-net, we certainly think that this is the right way to go. I also want to stress, I mean, obviously, we didn't have the great foresight to anticipate the disruptions that we are seeing in Hong Kong right now, but I want to sort of stress the risk mitigation element of this initiative as well. You can follow up with me if you have -- if I didn't answer that properly but I want to address your second question as well. I think we continue to be both excited with the potential of the Enfagrow toddler product in the United States, as well as the progress we are making with it. We've seen very significant growth in our distribution of this product as a consequence of the encouraging offtake, really, that the retailers have seen over the past 12 to 24 months. I think most of these distribution gains are probably behind us. And I don't think that we anticipate to see the same number of gains in the 12 months going forward. However, we, as you might imagine, we monitor sort of same-store sales very, very closely, and we're very encouraged by what we are seeing on that front as well."

We feel -- obviously, we feel good about projection of around 7% constant dollar growth that is contained in our guidance. Really, it's around comparisons. The first quarter, we were lapping very strong performances for sort of a series of different reasons. But in both the United States and in China, we were lapping really strong comparison basis. I mentioned there were other factors that kind of impacted that in other smaller markets. So the challenge in the first quarter was always going to be very significant for us and I think we came in, as I said, as expected. So it wasn't as a surprise for us that our growth rate was relatively lower in this quarter, and we feel good about our ability to hit our full year projection. Transitioning to the question about this talk about some enhancement of advertising restrictions in China. I think the industry is still trying to understand what exactly the intent and the plan is of this proposed change to the advertising law. It is likely, I think, that it's not going to turn out to be significantly different from either the current situation in China, which prevents advertising to all products that target infants below 6 months of age, or possibly, it may represent a slight expansion to include products for infants of less than 12 months of age, which is sort of consistent with the approach taking -- taken in many other Asian markets. Either way, I think we are very familiar with operating in these kinds of frameworks. It allows us to utilize our medical sales force quite well, and I think we feel well positioned to continue to compete and drive demand regardless of where this would go. But I know that the industry association is in the process of clarifying this with the local authorities."

But I guess, I'm just not as familiar with whatever discount schedules you have with retailers, brick-and-mortar versus what you can expect on the e-commerce side. So could you talk about expectations? Is there going to be a margin hit from shifting out of Hong Kong into China on that business, the imported business? Maybe you could give us a little background there on distribution channels and discounting, wholesale, et cetera, would be helpful."

I think any improvement in sales and market share as a consequence of this initiatives in China are likely to drown out any impact on our gross margin. I feel very good about the margin trajectory for the business and I'm not overly concerned, though if you ask me about the precise math, you are right to say that the Hong Kong gross margin is slightly higher than that of the mainland China business."

Good morning to all of you, and thank you for joining us on this call. In a moment, I'll provide commentary on our overall company performance in the second quarter of 2015 and the first half of the year. As our prepared remarks today, a little more detail than usual. We have decided to expand this morning's call to an hour and 15 minutes. I hope this will allow us time to cover things in a bit more detail, while allowing you enough time for questions. At the CAGNY conference in February, I suggested 4 factors to focus on when you think about our revenue and earnings trajectory for 2015. Since then, we repeatedly come back to these factors at both our first quarter earnings call in April and more recently, at the Deutsche Bank conference in early June. Since I'm sure we'll spend a good deal of time on this call discussing these again, let me remind you upfront what these factors were. 
Firstly, the impact of favorable commodity costs. Then the counterbalancing headwinds from foreign exchange. And lastly, market dynamics and competitiveness in our 2 largest markets, North America and China. At the Deutsche Bank investor conference in early June, I spoke in more detail about the unique dynamics playing out in China currently, and I'll return to that topic a little later this morning. I'll also discuss the continuing strong performance of our business in North America and Europe. 
Turning in a moment to the overall company results, I'll provide highlights of our second quarter global performance before discussing each of our operating segments and our expectations for the full year. Then Charles will provide additional details on our financial performance. And finally, I'll return to provide a few summary remarks before we, as usual, open the lines for questions. 
Please note, except where otherwise stated, as Kathy said, my comments will refer to our non-GAAP financials. Turning now to the second quarter of 2015. Our second quarter results were as described in last week's pre-announcement, constant dollar sales were 3% below prior year quarter and non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.76 for the quarter. Volume was 5% lower than the same quarter of the prior year. There were 2 key factors that drove the lower volume. Firstly, competitor's price-based promotional activities in several markets negatively impacted market share in these countries. Secondly, in Hong Kong, our sales remained at levels below last year due to the residual effect of the March civil unrest. Price contributed 2 percentage points to revenue growth from the prior year quarter. Improved pricing in the United States and several other markets, however, failed to fully offset the impact of volume losses caused by competitive price discounting in China/Hong Kong, Thailand and Mexico. 
Apart from these few, but unfortunately large markets, almost every business delivered price growth many markets to price increases to help mitigate negative foreign exchange impact. 
As you look sequentially from the first quarter, you will notice as we expected, the contribution to growth from price is diminishing. As we've explained before and this is non-unexpected, lower commodity costs have made it difficult to take price increases in many of our emerging markets. In these markets, we see governments interested in controlling inflationary impact of weakening currencies. Finally, as you know, with approximately 75% of our revenue and profit outside of the United States, we are subject to the adverse impact from a strengthening dollar. In the second quarter, the sales impact from foreign exchange translation was approximately 4%. This was slightly lower than the 5% impact we saw in the first quarter of 2015 reflective the changes to our overall revenue mix. Gross margin in the quarter at 65.4%, was our highest in over 5 years, it was up 360 basis points from the same quarter prior year. All segments benefited from lower dairy costs. And sequentially, our gross margin improved by 140 basis points from the first quarter of 2015. Charles will provide additional information on this a little later. 
As we told you in the first quarter earnings call, we increased our advertising and promotional spend significantly in the second quarter. Our spend of $190 million or 18.4% [ph] of sales in the quarter was at a new record level as we invested heavily behind select growth initiatives in the latter half of the quarter. 
Year-to-date, our advertising and promotional expenditure was 15.7% of sales, well above last year's full year spend of 14.5%. Our level of investment in demand creation will continue to fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter and occasionally from year-to-year. The variation reflects timing of innovation projects and other gross initiatives. We've continued to ensure that investment is competitive and at levels sufficient to support our growth initiatives. 
Second quarter non-GAAP earnings per share was 76% compared to $0.88 in prior year's quarter. Halfway through this year, earnings per share stand at $1.85 compared to $1.90 last year. The impact of foreign exchange was not quite fully offset by higher gross margin. 
Let me now comment on the performance of each of our operating segments, starting with Asia. In the second quarter, constant dollar sales were 10% below prior year quarter as we saw reduced volume in the phase of widespread price discounting by competitors at both wholesale and retail level. We opted to respond with pricing actions of our own, only late in the quarter. Though we saw increased pricing activity in several countries, including Thailand and Mexico, the activity in China was particularly noteworthy. 
Talking now specifically about China. It is clear to us that a combination of a slowing China economy, a proliferation of brand offerings and the lower dairy costs, have created a competitive environment where both wholesalers and consumers are being tempted with special deals. Mindful of the potential for such discounting activity to cause inventory bubbles, we took a cautious approach in the early part of the quarter and took steps to underpin our competitiveness towards the second half of the quarter only. Surprisingly, we saw activity across all price segments and channels. Within the quarter, we continue to witness the China market shift towards imported products at the expense of locally produced goods and towards the newer channels of baby stores and e-commerce. 
I've spoken previously about the strategic journey to address these trends by creating flexibility to compete in more consumer segments and strengthen our competitiveness in the fastest-growing channels. I'd like to provide a few highlights that demonstrate the progress we've made to date. 
As you recall, we launched a fully imported line of infant branded in China at the beginning -- towards the end of April. As evidenced of the velocity of the shift in consumer preference, by the end of the just completed quarter, this line represented approximately 20% of our total sales in Mainland China. Unfortunately, the rapid growth of our imported line was still insufficient to fully offset moderating sales of our locally products. A broader portfolio is putting us in a better position to compete in the important baby store channel and growth in e-commerce continues to outstrip that of other channels. This phenomenon is driven by a combination of direct-to-consumer and wholesaling activity. Our focus remains on growing company controlled e-commerce, which is the most rapidly expanding channel. If initiated last year are beginning to pay off now. According to external sources, our e-commerce sales are up by nearly 70% on the year prior. Admittedly, this is still off of a relatively small base, but it shows we're figuring things out and moving in the right direction. Our progress where priority partners like Tmall and .com was also satisfactory with year-to-date growth, ranging between 40% and 90%. 
Enfagrow, our growing-up milk, for instance, is the fourth most search for line item on Tmall. To get a flavor of this, I encourage you to try searches on either of these sites. Those sites allow for a more refined searches in Mandarin, you'll find that in English language search is still illustrative. By sharing these operating metrics, I hope to give you a sense of our commitment to developing these capabilities and are tracking progress. I'm encouraged by the early indications that our China strategy is working. You should not expect this level of update in every call going forward. However, we do plan to return to the theme of e-commerce in China at our Investor Day on November 4. We look forward to seeing many of you there. 
Let me complete my discussion of China with a few comments pertaining to Hong Kong. We continue to see some residual effect of the March civil disturbance and visitor numbers to the territory remain below the highs seen late last year. That said, March appears to have been the low point and visitor numbers have since begun to recover. Second quarter sales in the territory were at a lower level not seen since mid-2013. It's difficult to predict exactly how quickly the situation will return to normal, but we remain confident that the Hong Kong and China governments will ultimately resolve the situation and avoid further damage to local commerce. 
Turning now to the rest of Asia. In Thailand, our performance did not meet our expectations. Consumer confidence is very low and as mentioned earlier, competitive pricing pressure resulted in a loss of market share. It is clear we did not execute, as well as we would've liked to. And we're determined to improve performance in the second half of the year. In the balance of the region, we saw a solid performance in the Philippines, offset by a slowdown in Malaysia associated with the introduction of a general sales tax. We believe this slowdown in Malaysia to be temporary and primarily retailer-driven. 
In summary, we are cost-disappointed with the latest quarter in Asia, where series of external factors coincided to produce weaker-than-expected performance. That said, we believe we have accurately identified opportunities to improve execution, and we have good evidence our China strategy will deliver results. 
Turning now to Latin America. Constant dollar revenue rose 1% in the second quarter over the same quarter of 2014. Pricing added 6 points of growth, but was partially offset by 5% of adverse impact from volume. Pricing gains in the high inflation countries of Venezuela and Argentina more than cover the impact of currency depreciation in these markets. Our decision to hold back shipments into and inside Venezuela was a significant driver of relatively weaker volume performance. As we've stated in previous calls, we are managing risk associated with intercompany payables within defined parameters. Foreign exchange movements continue to significantly impact results for the segment. The impact was seen across the segment, with Colombia and Brazil the most severely affected. Performance within our Mexican subsidiary was below expectations in part due to this fact also. However, results were further impacted by a loss in market share in the face of strong competition in the modifiers. Our core Enfa brand performed well within the quarter, but I remind you that a significant part of our business is done within the local brands and the modifiers. Our Argentina business continues to exceed expectations. We are constantly making operational and strategic improvements to the business there. And in the last few weeks, we finalize agreement to acquire an additional 10% equity stake in the joint venture we have formed in early 2012. This transaction to our equity position to 90%. 
We are likewise seeing sustained strong performance across Central America, the Caribbean and the Indian markets. 
Let me now turn to our North America/Europe segment. I'm very pleased with the continued strong performance of this reporting segment. Constant dollar revenue growth was 6% on the prior year's quarter and sequential quarterly growth was solid also. Growth in our United States business reflected continued improvements in the overall economic conditions, allowing us to realize better pricing. The impact year-to-date was, however, largely carryover effect of pricing taken in the third quarter of last year. On top of this, we now understand 2014 birth increased by as much as 1.5% according to data recently released by the Center for Disease Control. This represents the first solid year of rebound since the economic crisis of late 2008. The rebound in birth was not entirely unexpected, and consistent with expectations described in earnings calls over the last few years. It is, however, rewarding to see the rebound finally materialized. 
Market share gains within our North American and European infant formula businesses and continued strong growth from our Enfagrow Toddler initiative in North America, also helped our performance in the quarter. Our growth in the relatively smaller European business was somewhat understated due to our exit from Russia early in the year. Excluding this effect of the lost revenue from the discontinued business in Russia, the rest of our European business has grown at a double-digit rate year-to-date. Our growth in North America and Europe, in many ways, validates our strategy to continue investing in brand-equity building and demand creation during the economic downturn. The last couple of years have seen us reap the rewards from investments we made over the 2009 to 2013 period. 
Before I hand over to Charles, let me now discuss our outlook for full year 2015. We see 2015 as a year of transition for the business where we are facing a number of unique challenges. I'm thinking here firstly about the impact of a strengthening dollar on both our top-line performance and our earnings per share. And secondly, of the less well understood impact of lower dairy input costs, that on the one hand makes for tougher pricing environment and on the other hand, support stronger-than-average gross margin performance. The impact of a stronger dollar alone is likely to take us much as 4 to 5 percentage point of our reported sales growth and around $0.10 of our 2015's earnings per share. In this environment, I once again direct your attention to the performance of our 2 largest markets of China/Hong Kong and the United States. These being the major swing factors that will impact full year performance. As we find it difficult to determine how long the current price discounting in China will last, the wider-than-usual earnings per share range contained within our recently revised guidance, reflects this level of uncertainty. Our outlook now expects constant dollar revenue growth over prior year between 0 and 2%, with non-GAAP earnings per share in between $3.63 and $3.78. This revised outlook reflects an expectation that our new growth initiatives in China will continue to pay off and play an ever larger part in our performance there. We expect to be seeing sequential growth in China again as we exit the year. 
Gross margin is expected to remain around 64.5% as we continue to benefit from lower dairy costs. This, despite a tougher-than-anticipated pricing environment. The significant investments that we remain committed to making do present the short-term challenge. Yet we are convinced investments to reshape our portfolio, improve competitiveness in higher gross channels and create added flexibility unnecessary. And they will allow us to come out of this year of transition in China in a stronger position. With an improved gross margin, we expect our EBIT margin slightly above the 24.5%. Charles, I'll now turn the call over to you."

There are several factors contributing to the recent update to our guidance.

There are several factors contributing to the recent update to our guidance. Therefore, I will walk down the income statement and provide insight and context on how these changes impacted our performance and our financial outlook. I will then briefly discuss the geographic reporting segments results before concluding these comments on our balance sheet and cash flow. Unless otherwise noted, my comments will be in our non-GAAP financial results and references to currency impacts or the effects of currency fluctuations generally referred to their impact from the translation of local currency financial statements into dollars. 
I'll begin my review of the income statement primarily focusing on changes versus the prior quarter starting with our sales performance. Kasper already discussed our constant dollar sales results and guidance. For the second quarter, sales on a reported basis was 7% below the prior year quarter. A 2% increase from price was insufficient to offset a 5% volume reduction, and a further 4% impact from adverse foreign exchange translation rates. 
I'd now like to make some comments about foreign exchange and its impact on the business. The U.S. dollar continued to exhibit strengthen during the quarter. It's effect on the translation of local currencies adversely impacted most markets in which we operate. In particular, the Latin American markets experienced widespread adverse foreign exchange headwinds with the Mexican peso and Brazilian real having the most significant impact on sales and as Kasper alluded to, some impact from Colombia as well. The rate, which we used to translate our Venezuelan-bolivar-denominated financial statements was devalued from 12 to 12.8 during the quarter, impacting both the P&L and balance sheet translation. This adversely impacted the quarter by around $3 million on a pretax basis versus the prior year period. The balance sheet impact from this devaluation is classified in Other income and Expense. 
Additionally, we opted to slow down the shipment to and distribution of goods in Venezuela due to a build-up of unpaid invoices in the first half of the year. The situation remains fluid, but we continue to pursue a constructive dialogue with the relevant authorities -- local authorities, and receive a small payment early in July at the same 6.3 exchange rate received in the past. If exchange rates were to remain at their current levels, we estimate that foreign exchange will adversely impact sales growth by between 4% and 5% for the full year 2015. This is not a significant driver of the change in guidance. While we anticipate currency translations have an adverse impact on full year sales, there are factors which mitigate the impact of foreign exchange translation on the EPS. Pricing, lower dairy costs, the euro-denominated components of our cost of goods, and the translation of local currency denominated expenses, serves to mitigate, but not fully offset, the EPS impact from the stronger dollar on local currency sales translation. 
I will now comment on our gross profit. Our gross margin was 65.4% in the second quarter, up 140 basis points sequentially from the first quarter of 2015, and up 360 basis points from the second quarter of 2014. The increase in gross margins was driven primarily by lower dairy cost, both versus the first quarter of 2015 and the prior year quarter. As we've previously indicated, a consequence of lower dairy costs is that it becomes tougher price increases in support newer innovations or to offset pressure from currency fluctuations. This was evidenced in our second quarter results and is expected to result in a less favorable impact from price in the balance of the year as we left the pricing taken in 2014. Additionally, we expect to see continued trade discounting in select markets. 
I remind you that dairy makes up around 1/3 of our total cost of goods. For the full year 2015, we expect dairy costs will decrease around 20% over 2014, while other commodity cost in combination with conversion costs, should rise around 1%. So in aggregate, our annual cost of goods is expected to decrease in the mid-single-digit range. 
Finally, we have locked in our dairy costs for the year. On a sequential basis, the benefit from the dairy will reduce in the second half versus the first half of 2015. Bearing in mind these factors, we estimate that our annual gross margin will be around 64.5%, which is 50 basis points higher than the prior guidance. 
Moving on to operating expenses. You'll recall that on the first quarter, we alluded to significantly higher than margin generation expenses in subsequent quarters with the second quarter likely to be the peak investment period. In the second quarter, the advertising and promotional expense was at a record of 18.4% of sales resulting in first half year-to-date expenditure close to 16% of sales. The second quarter increase is largely due to selected investments in Asia, most notably in China. As Kasper indicated, the China investment was primarily to support recent introduction of our fully imported product. 
Turning to the other income expense line. The current year quarter expense was related to the depreciation of the rate in Venezuela. This compares to income in the prior year quarter when we recognized a gain related to payments for product supplied from our plants at our Venezuela and affiliates at exchange rates which were favorable to the rates used in translating our financial statements. 
To conclude my discussion on operating expenses, for the year, we reiterate our intention to reinvest a portion of our higher gross margins back into the business through higher demand generation -- excuse me, investments. As a consequence to the factors I mentioned, we anticipate annual EBIT to be slightly above 24.5% of sales, similar to our guidance in the last call. 
I will now briefly run through the geographic segment results for the quarter. Asia sales were 10% below the prior year quarter on a constant-dollar basis. Higher gross margins were invested in strong advertising and promotion support for the region, led by an investment in China against our recently launched fully imported product. EBIT was 30% of sales. Latin America sales were 1% above the prior year quarter in constant dollars and again, the higher gross margins funded investments in advertising and promotion. EBIT was 23% of sales compared to 24% in the prior year quarter. Our North America/Europe sales was 6% above the prior year quarter in constant dollars. EBIT was 25% above the prior year quarter mainly driven by higher gross margins. 
I will now briefly speak about our taxes and our effective tax rate. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate, or ETR, was 25.6% in the second quarter compared to 23.8% in the prior year quarter. The higher rate is primarily the result of a change in geographic earnings mix. On a full year basis, we expect the non-GAAP ETR to be approximately 24%. 
Now, to summarize our annual guidance. To reiterate, the guidance statement in our recent pre-announcement, we anticipate constant dollar sales growth of approximately 0 to 2% this year. Including the impact of adverse foreign currency rates, reported sales are estimated to decrease by 2% to 4% this fiscal year over the prior year. As we consider other factors which could impact EPS performance during the remainder of the year, there are a number of key potential swing factors, which should be considered. Our balance of the year sales trajectory, recall it, Kasper alluded to the North America China mix are seeing a key swing item. The impact of foreign exchange translation on our financial statements. And finally, the impact of pricing and the extent of ongoing discounting in selected key markets. As mentioned in our previous quarterly earnings calls, a significant devaluation in Venezuela, should it happen, is not considered in our current guidance. 7% the valuation of at rate has already occurred in the second quarter and our guidance assumes no further devaluation in Venezuela. The dairy costs should remain favorable for the balance of the year but not incremental to assumptions included in our guidance. Remember that we locked in dairy prices about 7 months out. This favorability will not be conducive to price increases, as evidenced by level of marketplace discounting in the second quarter. 
Overall, our gross margin had seen a healthy improvement over last year and is near levels last seen around the time of the IPO. While the supply of dairy products continues to exceed demand, we could for see a scenario with supply could become more constrained, but likely not in the near future. 
Non-GAAP earnings for 2015 are expected to be in the range of $3.63 to $3.78 per share and GAAP earnings per share for the quarter were $0.80 per share. GAAP earnings guidance is expected in the range of $3.56 to $3.71 dollars per share. 
I will now conclude with a high level overview of the balance sheet. While we had a difficult quarter, we continue to generate strong cash flows and the balance sheet remains strong. Our cash balance was $1.5 billion as of June 30, 2015, up about $40 million from the first quarter 2015, and approximately $180 million from year-end 2014. Cash held in the United States was approximately $215 million. Debt stood at $1.5 billion as of June 30, 2015, with our net debt position close to 0. Free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures, was approximately $377 million in the first half of 2015 after consuming $80 million in cash for capital investment. We continued to expand our European plant in the second quarter to meet increased requirements for our fully imported product in China. For the full year, capital spending expectations remain unchanged at around $175 million. This is in line with our long-term goal of about 4% of sales. Depreciation and amortization expense is expected to be around $100 million for the full year. 
I'll talk a little bit about cash utilization before concluding. On June 11, 2015, our Board of Directors announced the dividend of just over $0.41 a share, which should annualize to approximately $1.65 per share for the year. As a result, full year dividends paid out of earnings are expected to exceed $320 million for 2015. As you may recall, in September 2013, the Board of Directors approved an additional $500 million share repurchase program following the full utilization of our previous $300 million program. We have approximately $430 million unutilized under this new program. We expect to activate this program in the coming quarters either through open market or privately negotiated transactions. The program is intended to offset the dilutive impact on earnings from employee stock-based compensation plans and allow opportunistic stock-based repurchases to return capital to shareholders. With that, I shall now turn the call back to Kasper."

Before we take your questions, I'd like to briefly reiterate the key components of our strategy and highlight our recently added strategic initiative. Our strategy of investing in brand building and innovation in North America, despite the economic turndown -- or downturn, sorry, is now being improved. Shows our decision to increased investments in the creation of toddler business there, we are happy with our current momentum. Our decision to focus our European business likewise, has produced a smaller but faster growing and more profitable business. And we've talked in recent months about our desire to become channel-agnostic in China by broadening our portfolio and creating a more flexible business model. We are convinced this is the right strategy. We are satisfied with teh early progress of our new growth initiatives, and we're committed to continued investment behind this tragedy. 
The Latin America region has been particularly challenged by currency headwinds this year. Over time, we'll see this stabilized and our ability to translate more of our constant dollar growth into reported sales growth would be enhanced. Within the last few weeks, we've launched a new initiative, project fuel for growth. This major strategic initiative that will reshape our income statement by increasing operating expense productivity. The project is central to our goal of becoming an even more agile and flexible business that is best able to respond to changes in market dynamics and consumer preferences. We see it as an integral part of our continued improvement effort. Over the next 3 years, we intend to reduce our non-AMP operating expenses by 300 basis points, with an intent to reinvest the majority of these savings behind new growth initiatives. The project is targeting productivity in both external and internal cost and infrastructure. This project will be directly overseen by our Executive Council, that includes myself. We'll begin to see the impact from early 2016. We plan to provide you with periodic updates on our progress. As we open the lines to questions, I'd like to remind you that recognizing our longer-than-usual prepared remarks and likely surplus of questions, we've decided to extend the call by 15 minutes.

So I want to just highlight the fact that obviously, we don't have the ability to predict how competitors will act over the next 6, 12 or 24 months for that matter. I do think that as people begin to lap these extraordinary windfalls that they've had from depressed dairy costs, we expect that most businesses of these most of our large competitors, will again begin to run the businesses in a more normal fashion where both sales and profit growth becomes a sort of an objective. I think at the moment, there is a lot of spare gross margin, sort of kind of slashing around in the system that people are choosing to spend in different ways and some people are clearly choosing to spend it on price discounting, both at the consumer and at the wholesale kind of level. Let me address the second part of your question, which was around how it's affecting our imported products. I think this is where it's beneficial for us to have a broader product portfolio in China because we are able to at least, at the moment, we are able to hold the price of the imported product relatively stable and most of the pricing activities that we have had to engage in. First of all, only began in the last months of the quarter. So we didn't see the full impact in the quarter of that. And consequently, we saw further a reasonably significant adverse volume impact. But most of that has been on the locally manufactured product, and most of it has gone towards ensuring that we are somewhat -- we are somewhat competitive when it comes to trade margin and obviously, that we are attractively priced when it comes to the consumer. We'll continue to do that. I do think that this abnormal price environment in China is creating quite abnormal inventory situations where we see spare inventory being created in many different pools around the country, and hence, moving in quite a disorganized fashion between provinces and in many cases, between channels. So we see examples of people offering wholesale prices that are 15% to 25% below the prices they're selling to retail at. I don't particularly want to point the finger at anybody, as I'm sure everybody's doing what is right for their business. But I think you're going to see a lot of variability in individual company performances in China over the coming quarters."

And individual company reactions to a slowdown in the Chinese economy and in demand there. So most companies, I think, are struggling having gone into 2015 with an overly optimistic view of what they will achieve in China this year. And I'm -- we, obviously, have to recognize it so that's the case for us and I'd be surprised if we were entirely alone. So when you combine that with this, what shall we call it surplus of gross margin, different companies are taking a different paths in their efforts to hold the volume, if I can describe it like that. We can't say how long that would last, and you're right, I don't want to set an expectation of a sudden kind of reversal of that trend from one quarter to the next, but I do think our perspective is that dairy prices are either at/or near their natural lows and you are probably going to begin to see some calling of herds around the world, if dairy prices do not rebound. So in one way or another, we believe there's more risk associated with dairy prices looking forward than there is opportunity. So sometime depending on how companies recognize costs. Sometimes over the next few quarters, people will begin to substantially let these low dairy costs. Charles, do you want to add anything?"

But with your gross margins just continuing to grow higher, I was suprised to see how high they got. And the economic backdrop getting weaker, are you concerned that you are -- that, that need is pushing margins higher at a time when everyone else is -- your competitors are pushing margins lower and that you're kind of of setting yourself up for more market share losses as the year goes on? And I guess, the follow-up question to that is when you look at your top-line target of kind of like 6% to 7%, the backdrop has changed. And especially in China, but not just the China but throughout the world. And now that you're looking at the fuel for growth program where you're going to attack the middle of the P&L, do you think that by your Analyst Day, you might come back to us with kind of a different outlook for what the top line environment really is?"

And it's all about creating flexibility to cope with different market circumstances, Rob. So it's good that you take note of that. And it of course gives us choices by becoming leaner and more efficient, it will give us flexibility to invest in growth initiatives. And those growth initiatives can be in different lines of the P&L, they don't necessarily all need to be in the A&P line. So one of the things we could potentially investing would be higher retail trade margins. Or we could -- I'm not sure that, that's going to be what we want to do, but we could invest in a more competitive price level, if that was what we felt was important. To date, to date, we have not -- we've, obviously, made adjustment that lowering prices would not lead to significantly increased offtake in a way that would represent an overall benefit to the business. You might imagine that we are continually reevaluating that. Obviously, particularly in light of such strong margins, and we're not going to be dogmatic about this. If we believe that lowering the prices in China would make us more competitive, but I emphasize, make us more competitive at the consumer level, then we would clearly do so. We are not going to do so simply to allow us, ourselves, to boost performance in a given quarter in order to escape a little bit of heat, so to speak."

Jason, let me first to say that the registration changes that are happening in China do not present a problem to us. We compliance with those as of, I think, July 1. And so for us, that's was a nonissue. And my understanding is that it does not, at least at the outset, apply to products that are imported at least by e-commerce. So that's my current understanding. As often as the case when these things are introduced in China, there is little bit of uncertainty about how they will be enforced. But certainly, from our perspective and we've had extensive interaction, including having had input on the regulations, we don't see that as an issue for us. I think what you're saying about pricing in Europe, and if it's to harmonize, it highlights a very interesting dynamic that we are spending a lot of time reflecting on here, and that is that company share of the sales in China, in many cases, differ quite substantially from their share of the profit pool in China because a lot of these -- a lot of these sales that go into China via the e-Commerce channel originate in Europe where our margins are significantly lower and much of the profitability therefore, leaks outside of the companies that engage in that practice. I think as a consequence of that, they're trying to do 2 things. Just like us, they're trying to bring more of this trade under their direct control, which we believe is a good thing, and we believe will help both create pricing that is more reflective of value and create a greater conformance with China laws and regulations from the industry. And secondly, I suspect they are trying to take prices up in Europe in order to reduce the overall parallel trade, though I believe that the latter might be quite difficult to achieve."

And obviously, they are above, what shall we say, many companies that you guys might view as a broad word. However, it's very important to recognize that so is our EBIT margin and so is our gross margin. Much of the differential comes from differences in business models. We spent higher-than-average amount on A&P. We do that in order to create a sustainable value proposition for the consumer who is ultimately paying a higher price that supports a higher gross margin. So we believe that to be a virtuous circle, and though we undoubtedly have opportunities over time to become even better at judging the cost effectiveness of our A&P spend, we are not substantially going to look at that line for productivity opportunity at this stage. So we are down to, let's say, about 25% or so in non-A&P operating expenses. And why 300 basis points and why not another number? We recognize that we do have 2 sales forces as part of our demand creation model. We have our medical sales force and the trade sales force, both of them are very important to our demand creation model, and that creates a different cost structure from some of our sort of, PSF that you look at that rely more heavily just on a trade sale -- on a single trade sales force. We believe that 300 basis points is significant. It is meaningful, and we are going to go after that in a fairly determined and aggressive fashion. And then we will evaluate whether or not it is the right target or not once we get a bit into it. When I can assure you that we are not going to just be satisfied if that's what we can do and where we going to continue to challenge that. But at this point in time, I think that's right number to aim for. And where we're going to find it, well, we're going to look both externally and internally. We, obviously, as many companies do, we have a large number of outsourcing agreements with third-party providers. We, from time to time, engage with consultants that assist us in different projects. And we have created a lot of the processes and infrastructure that we had to create relatively quickly as we separated from Bristol-Myers Squibb in order to create standalone capabilities. And in some cases, we see opportunities within those areas for to eliminate kind of duplication and overlap between different functions or in some cases, between regional, local and global functions. So we're going to look at all of that and we have begun the exercise and, I guess, at this point, we are kind of in the analysis phase, but we will -- we clearly see ourselves being in the execution phase by the time we get into the -- get through the fourth quarter of this year.

What happened was that obviously built through the quarter, as you can imagine, because you are building distribution and therefore, you exit the quarter at quite a different rate from what you're at in the early phase of the launch. What we did say was that the growth in the new product that we launched was insufficient to offset the decline that we saw in the quarter of the locally-manufactured product. So I hope that help. Now you're quite right to say that spending $190 million, well, why didn't we see any impact on sale? Well, the reason is a large proportion of that increase was invested behind the introduction of this new product. And obviously, you don't get an instant return of that.

At the CAGNY conference in February, I suggested 4 factors to focus on when you think about our revenue and earnings trajectory for 2015. Since then, we have repeatedly come back to these factors at both our first quarter earnings call in April and more recently, at the Deutsche Bank conference in early June. Since I'm sure we'll spend a good deal of time on this call discussing these again, let me remind you upfront what these factors were. 
Firstly, the impact of favorable commodity costs. Then, the counterbalancing headwinds from foreign exchange. And lastly, market dynamics and competitiveness in our 2 largest markets, North America and China. At the Deutsche Bank investor conference in early June, I spoke in more detail about the unique dynamics playing out in China currently, and I'll return to that topic a little later this morning. I'll also discuss the continuing strong performance of our business in North America and Europe. 
Turning in a moment to the overall company results, I'll provide highlights of our second quarter global performance before discussing each of our operating segments and our expectations for the full year. Then Charles will provide additional details on our financial performance. And finally, I'll return to provide a few summary remarks before we, as usual, open the lines for questions. 
Please note, except where otherwise stated, as Kathy said, my comments will refer to our non-GAAP financials. Turning now to the second quarter of 2015. Our second quarter results were as described in last week's pre-announcement. Constant dollar sales were 3% below prior year quarter and non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.76 for the quarter. Volume was 5% lower than the same quarter of the prior year. There were 2 key factors that drove the lower volume: Firstly, competitors' price-based promotional activities in several markets negatively impacted market share in these countries; secondly, in Hong Kong, our sales remained at levels below last year due to the residual effect of the March civil unrest. Price contributed 2 percentage points to revenue growth from the prior year quarter. Improved pricing in the United States and several other markets, however, failed to fully offset the impact of volume losses caused by competitive price discounting in China/Hong Kong, Thailand and Mexico. 
Apart from these few, but unfortunately large markets, almost every business delivered price growth. Many markets took price increases to help mitigate negative foreign exchange impact. 
As you look sequentially from the first quarter, you will notice as we expected, the contribution to growth from price is diminishing. As we've explained before and this is not unexpected, lower commodity costs have made it difficult to take price increases in many of our emerging markets. In these markets, we see governments interested in controlling inflationary impact of weakening currencies. Finally, as you know, with approximately 75% of our revenue and profit outside of the United States, we are subject to the adverse impact from a strengthening dollar. In the second quarter, the sales impact from foreign exchange translation was approximately 4%. This was slightly lower than the 5% impact we saw in the first quarter of 2015, reflective of changes to our overall revenue mix. Gross margin in the quarter, at 65.4%, was our highest in over 5 years. It was up 360 basis points from the same quarter prior year. All segments benefited from lower dairy costs. And sequentially, our gross margin improved by 140 basis points from the first quarter of 2015. Charles will provide additional information on this a little later. 
As we told you in the first quarter earnings call, we increased our advertising and promotional spend significantly in the second quarter. Our spend of $190 million or 18.4% of sales in the quarter was at a new record level as we invested heavily behind select growth initiatives in the latter half of the quarter. 
Year-to-date, our advertising and promotional expenditure was 15.7% of sales, well above last year's full year spend of 14.5%. Our level of investment in demand creation will continue to fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter and occasionally from year-to-year. The variation reflects timing of innovation projects and other gross initiatives. We've continued to ensure that investment is competitive and at levels sufficient to support our growth initiatives. 
Second quarter non-GAAP earnings per share was 76% compared to $0.88 in prior year's quarter. Halfway through this year, earnings per share stand at $1.85 compared to $1.90 last year. The impact of foreign exchange was not quite fully offset by higher gross margin. 
Let me now comment on the performance of each of our operating segments, starting with Asia. In the second quarter, constant dollar sales were 10% below prior year quarter, as we saw reduced volume in the face of widespread price discounting by competitors at both wholesale and retail level. We opted to respond with pricing actions of our own, only late in the quarter. Though we saw increased pricing activity in several countries, including Thailand and Mexico, the activity in China was particularly noteworthy. 
Talking now specifically about China. It is clear to us that a combination of a slowing China economy, a proliferation of brand offerings and the lower dairy costs, have created a competitive environment where both wholesalers and consumers are being tempted with special deals. Mindful of the potential for such discounting activity to cause inventory bubbles, we took a cautious approach in the early part of the quarter and took steps to underpin our competitiveness towards the second half of the quarter only. Surprisingly, we saw activity across all price segments and channels. Within the quarter, we continue to witness the China market shift towards imported products at the expense of locally produced goods and towards the newer channels of baby stores and e-commerce. 
I've spoken previously about the strategic journey to address these trends by creating flexibility to compete in more consumer segments and strengthen our competitiveness in the fastest-growing channels. I'd like to provide a few highlights that demonstrate the progress we've made to date. 
As you recall, we launched a fully imported line of Enfa branded products in China in the beginning -- towards the end of April. As evidenced, as evidence of the velocity of the shift in consumer preference, by the end of the just completed quarter, this line represented approximately 20% of our total sales in Mainland China. Unfortunately, the rapid growth of our imported line was still insufficient to fully offset moderating sales of our locally-packaged products. A broader portfolio is putting us in a better position to compete in the important baby store channel, and growth in e-commerce continues to outstrip that of other channels. This phenomenon is driven by a combination of direct-to-consumer and wholesaling activity. Our focus remains on growing company controlled e-commerce, which is the most rapidly expanding channel. Efforts initiated last year are beginning to pay off now. According to external sources, our e-commerce sales are up by nearly 70% on the year prior. Admittedly, this is still off of a relatively small base, but it shows we are figuring things out and moving in the right direction. Our progress where priority partners like Tmall and JD.com was also satisfactory, with year-to-date growth, ranging between 40% and 90%. 
Enfagrow, our growing-up milk, for instance, is the fourth most searched for line item on Tmall. To get a flavor of this, I'd encourage you to try searches on either of these sites. Those sites allow for more refined searches in Mandarin, you'll find that in English language search is still illustrative. By sharing these operating metrics, I hope to give you a sense of our commitment to developing these capabilities and our tracking of progress. I'm encouraged by the early indications that our China strategy is working. You should not expect this level of update in every call going forward. However, we do plan to return to the theme of e-commerce in China at our Investor Day on November 4. We look forward to seeing many of you there. 
Let me complete my discussion of China with a few comments pertaining to Hong Kong. We continue to see some residual effect of the March civil disturbance and visitor numbers to the territory remain below the highs seen late last year. That said, March appears to have been the low point and visitor numbers have since begun to recover. Second quarter sales in the territory were at a lower level not seen since mid-2013. It's difficult to predict exactly how quickly the situation will return to normal, but we remain confident that the Hong Kong and China governments will ultimately resolve the situation and avoid further damage to local commerce. 
Turning now to the rest of Asia. In Thailand, our performance did not meet our expectations. Consumer confidence is very low and as mentioned earlier, competitive pricing pressure resulted in a loss of market share. It is clear we did not execute as well as we would've liked to. And we're determined to improve performance in the second half of the year. In the balance of the region, we saw a solid performance in the Philippines, offset by a slowdown in Malaysia, associated with the introduction of a general sales tax. We believe this slowdown in Malaysia to be temporary and primarily retailer-driven. 
In summary, we are cost-disappointed with the latest quarter in Asia, where a series of external factors coincided to produce weaker-than-expected performance. That said, we believe we have accurately identified opportunities to improve execution, and we have good evidence our China strategy will deliver results. 
Turning now to Latin America. Constant dollar revenue rose 1% in the second quarter over the same quarter of 2014. Pricing added 6 points of growth, but was partially offset by 5% of adverse impact from volume. Pricing gains in the high inflation countries of Venezuela and Argentina more than covered the impact of currency depreciation in these markets. Our decision to hold back shipments into and inside Venezuela was a significant driver of relatively weaker volume performance. As we've stated in previous calls, we are managing risk associated with intercompany payables within defined parameters. Foreign exchange movements continue to significantly impact results for the segment. The impact was seen across the segment, with Colombia and Brazil the most severely affected. Performance within our Mexican subsidiary was below expectations, in part due to this fact also. However, results were further impacted by a loss of market share in the face of strong competition and milk modifiers. Our core Enfa brand performed well within the quarter, but I remind you that a significant part of our business is done within the local brands and milk modifiers. Our Argentina business continues to exceed expectations. We are constantly making operational and strategic improvements to the business there. And in the last few weeks, we finalized an agreement to acquire an additional 10% equity stake in the joint venture we formed in early 2012. This transaction to our equity position to 90%. 
We are likewise seeing sustained strong performance across Central America, the Caribbean and the Indian markets. 
Let me now turn to our North America/Europe segment. I'm very pleased with the continued strong performance of this reporting segment. Constant dollar revenue growth was 6% on the prior year's quarter and sequential quarterly growth was solid also. Growth in our United States business reflected continued improvements in the overall economic conditions, allowing us to realize better pricing. The impact year-to-date was however, largely the carryover effect of pricing, taking in the third quarter of last year. On top of this, we now understand 2014 birth increased by as much as 1.5%, according to data recently released by the Center for Disease Control. This represents the first solid year of rebound since the economic crisis of late 2008. The rebound in birth was not entirely unexpected, and consistent with expectations described in earnings calls over the last few years. It is, however, rewarding to see the rebound finally materialize. 
Market share gains within our North American and European infant formula businesses and continued strong growth from our Enfagrow Toddler initiative in North America, also helped our performance in the quarter. Our growth in the relatively smaller European business was somewhat understated due to our exit from Russia early in the year. Excluding this effect of the lost revenue from the discontinued business in Russia, the rest of our European business has grown at a double-digit rate year-to-date. Our growth in North America and Europe, in many ways, validates our strategy to continue investing in brand-equity building and demand creation during the economic downturn. The last couple of years have seen us reap the rewards from investments we made over the 2009 to 2013 period. 
Before I hand over to Charles, let me now discuss our outlook for full year 2015. We see 2015 as a year of transition for the business, where we are facing a number of unique challenges. I'm thinking here firstly about the impact of a strengthening dollar on both our top-line performance and our earnings per share. And secondly, of the less well understood impact of lower dairy input costs, that on the one hand makes for a tougher pricing environment and on the other hand, supports stronger-than-average gross margin performance. The impact of a stronger dollar alone is likely to take as much as 4 to 5 percentage points of our reported sales growth and around $0.10 of our 2015's earnings per share. In this environment, I once again direct your attention to the performance of our 2 largest markets of China/Hong Kong and the United States. These being the major swing factors that will impact full year performance. As we find it difficult to determine how long the current price discounting in China will last, the wider-than-usual earnings per share range contained within our recently revised guidance, reflects this level of uncertainty. Our outlook now expects constant dollar revenue growth over prior year between 0 and 2%, with non-GAAP earnings per share in between $3.63 and $3.78. This revised outlook reflects an expectation that our new growth initiatives in China will continue to pay off and play an ever larger part in our performance there. We expect to be seeing sequential growth in China again as we exit the year. 
Gross margin is expected to remain around 64.5% as we continue to benefit from lower dairy costs. This, despite a tougher-than-anticipated pricing environment. The significant investments that we remain committed to making, do present a short-term challenge. Yet we are convinced investments to reshape our portfolio, improve competitiveness in higher gross channels and create added flexibility are necessary. And they will allow us to come out of this year of transition in China in a stronger position. With an improved gross margin, we expect our EBIT margin slightly above the 24.5%. Charles, I now turn the call over to you."

There are several factors contributing to the recent update to our guidance. Therefore, I will walk down the income statement and provide insight and context on how these changes impacted our performance and",1804,"Thank you, Kasper, and good morning, everyone. There are several factors contributing to the recent update to our guidance. Therefore, I will walk down the income statement and provide insight and context on how these changes impacted our performance and our financial outlook. I will then briefly discuss the geographic reporting segments results before concluding with comments on our balance sheet and cash flow. Unless otherwise noted, my comments will be in our non-GAAP financial results and references to currency impacts or the effects of currency fluctuations generally refer to their impact from the translation of local currency financial statements into dollars. 
I'll begin my review of the income statement primarily focusing on changes versus the prior quarter, starting with our sales performance. Kasper already discussed our constant dollar sales results and guidance. For the second quarter, sales on a reported basis was 7% below the prior year quarter. A 2% increase from price was insufficient to offset a 5% volume reduction, and a further 4% impact from adverse foreign exchange translation rates. 
I'd now like to make some comments about foreign exchange and its impact on the business. The U.S. dollar continued to exhibit strength during the quarter. It's effect on the translation of local currencies adversely impacted most markets in which we operate. In particular, the Latin American markets experienced widespread adverse foreign exchange headwinds, with the Mexican peso and Brazilian real having the most significant impact on sales and as Kasper alluded to, some impact from Colombia as well. The SICAD rate, which we used to translate our Venezuelan-bolivar-denominated financial statements was devalued from 12 to 12.8 during the quarter, impacting both the P&L and balance sheet translation. This adversely impacted the quarter by around $3 million on a pretax basis versus the prior year period. The balance sheet impact from this devaluation is classified in Other Income and Expense. 
Additionally, we opted to slow down the shipment to and distribution of goods in Venezuela due to a build-up of unpaid invoices in the first half of the year. The situation remains fluid, but we continue to pursue a constructive dialogue with the relevant authorities -- local authorities, and received a small payment early in July at the same 6.3 exchange rate received in the past. If exchange rates were to remain at their current levels, we estimate that foreign exchange will adversely impact sales growth by between 4% and 5% for the full year 2015. This is not a significant driver of the change in guidance. While we anticipate currency translations have an adverse impact on full year sales, there are factors which mitigate the impact of foreign exchange translation on the EPS. Pricing, lower dairy costs, the euro-denominated components of our cost of goods, and the translation of local currency denominated expenses, serve to mitigate, but not fully offset, the EPS impact from the stronger dollar on local currency sales translation. 
I will now comment on our gross profit. Our gross margin was 65.4% in the second quarter, up 140 basis points sequentially from the first quarter of 2015, and up 360 basis points from the second quarter of 2014. The increase in gross margins was driven primarily by lower dairy costs, both versus the first quarter of 2015 and the prior year quarter. As we've previously indicated, a consequence of lower dairy cost is that it becomes tougher to set price increases in support of newer innovations or to offset pressure from currency fluctuation. This was evident in our second quarter results and is expected to result in a less favorable impact from price in the balance of the year as we left the pricing taken in 2014. Additionally, we expect to see continued trade discounting in select markets. 
I remind you that dairy makes up around 1/3 of our total cost of goods. For the full year 2015, we expect dairy costs will decrease around 20% over 2014, while other commodity costs, in combination with conversion costs, should rise around 1%. So in aggregate, our annual cost of goods is expected to decrease in the mid-single-digit range. 
Finally, we have locked in our dairy costs for the year. On a sequential basis, the benefit from the dairy will reduce in the second half versus the first half of 2015. Bearing in mind these factors, we estimate that our annual gross margin will be around 64.5%, which is 50 basis points higher than the prior guidance. 
Moving on to operating expenses. You'll recall that on the first quarter, we alluded to significantly higher margin generation expenses in subsequent quarters with the second quarter likely to be the peak investment period. In the second quarter, the advertising and promotional expense was at a record of 18.4% of sales resulting in first half year-to-date expenditure close to 16% of sales. The second quarter increase is largely due to selected investments in Asia, most notably in China. As Kasper indicated, the China investment was primarily to support recent introduction of our fully imported product. 
Turning to the other income expense line. The current year quarter expense was related to the depreciation of the SICAD rate in Venezuela. This compares to income in the prior year quarter when we recognized a gain related to payments for products supplied from our plants in our Venezuelan affiliate at exchange rates which were favorable to the SICAD rate used in translating our financial statements. 
To conclude my discussion on operating expenses, for the year, we reiterate our intention to reinvest a portion of our higher gross margins back into the business through higher demand generation -- excuse me, investment. As a consequence to the factors I mentioned, we anticipate annual EBIT to be slightly above 24.5% of sales, similar to our guidance in the last call. 
I will now briefly run through the geographic segment results for the quarter. Asia sales were 10% below the prior year quarter on a constant-dollar basis. Higher gross margins were invested in strong advertising and promotion support for the region, led by investment in China against our recently launched fully imported product. EBIT was 30% of sales. Latin America sales were 1% above the prior year quarter in constant dollars and again, the higher gross margins funded investments in advertising and promotion. EBIT was 23% of sales compared to 24% in the prior year quarter. Our North America/Europe sales were 6% above the prior year quarter in constant dollars. EBIT was 25% above the prior year quarter mainly driven by higher gross margins. 
I will now briefly speak about our taxes and our effective tax rate. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate, or ETR, was 25.6% in the second quarter compared to 23.8% in the prior year quarter. The higher rate is primarily the result of a change in geographic earnings mix. On a full year basis, we expect the non-GAAP ETR to be approximately 24%. 
Now, to summarize our annual guidance. To reiterate, the guidance statement in our recent pre-announcement, we anticipate constant dollar sales growth of approximately 0 to 2% this year. Including the impact of adverse foreign currency rates, reported sales are estimated to decrease by 2% to 4% this fiscal year over the prior year. As we consider other factors which could impact EPS performance during the remainder of the year, there are a number of key potential swing factors, which should be considered. Our balance of the year sales trajectory, recall that Kasper alluded to the North America/China mix as being a key swing item. The impact of foreign exchange translation on our financial statements, and finally, the impact of pricing and the extent of ongoing discounting in selected key markets. As mentioned in our previous quarterly earnings calls, a significant devaluation in Venezuela, should it happen, is not considered in our current guidance. 7%, the valuation of the SICAD rate, has already occurred in the second quarter and our guidance assumes no further devaluation in Venezuela. Dairy costs should remain favorable for the balance of the year, but not incremental to assumptions included in our guidance. Remember that we lock in dairy prices about 7 months out. This favorability will not be conducive to price increases, as evidenced by the level of marketplace discounting in the second quarter. 
Overall, our gross margin had seen a healthy improvement over last year and is near levels last seen around the time of the IPO. While the supply of dairy products continues to exceed demand, we could foresee a scenario where supply could become more constrained, but likely not in the near future. 
Non-GAAP earnings for 2015 are expected to be in the range of $3.63 to $3.78 per share and GAAP earnings per share for the quarter were $0.80 per share. GAAP earnings guidance is expected in the range of $3.56 to $3.71 dollars per share. 
I will now conclude with a high level overview of the balance sheet. While we had a difficult quarter, we continue to generate strong cash flows and the balance sheet remains strong. Our cash balance was $1.5 billion as of June 30, 2015, up about $40 million from the first quarter 2015, and approximately $180 million from year-end 2014. Cash held in the United States was approximately $215 million. Debt stood at $1.5 billion as of June 30, 2015, with our net debt position close to 0. Free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures, was approximately $377 million in the first half of 2015 after consuming $80 million in cash for capital investment. We continue to expand our European plant in the second quarter to meet increased requirements for our fully imported product in China. For the full year, capital spending expectations remain unchanged at around $175 million. This is in line with our long-term goal of about 4% of sales. Depreciation and amortization expense is expected to be around $100 million for the full year. 
I'll talk a little bit about cash utilization before concluding. On June 11, 2015, our Board of Directors announced the dividend of just over $0.41 a share, which should annualize to approximately $1.65 per share for the year. As a result, full year dividends paid out of earnings are expected to exceed $320 million for 2015. As you may recall, in September 2013, the Board of Directors approved an additional $500 million share repurchase program, following the full utilization of our previous $300 million program. We have approximately $430 million unutilized under this new program. We expect to activate this program in the coming quarters, either through open market or privately negotiated transactions. The program is intended to offset the dilutive impact on earnings from employee stock-based compensation plans and allow opportunistic stock-based repurchases to return capital to shareholders. With that, I shall now turn the call back to Kasper."

Before we take your questions, I'd like to briefly reiterate the key components of our strategy and highlight our recently added strategic initiative. Our strategy of investing in brand building and innovation in North America, despite the economic turndown -- or downturn, sorry, is now being proved. Shows our decision to increase investments in the creation of a toddler business there, we are happy with our current momentum. Our decision to focus our European business likewise, has produced a smaller but faster growing and more profitable business. And we've talked in recent months about our desire to become channel-agnostic in China by broadening our portfolio and creating a more flexible business model. We are convinced this is the right strategy. We are satisfied with the early progress of our new growth initiatives, and we are committed to continued investment behind this strategy. 
The Latin America region has been particularly challenged by currency headwinds this year. Over time, we'll see this stabilize and our ability to translate more of our constant dollar growth into reported sales growth will be enhanced. Within the last few weeks, we've launched a new initiative, project fuel for growth. This major strategic initiative will reshape our income statement by increasing operating expense productivity. The project is central to our goal of becoming an even more agile and flexible business that is best able to respond to changes in market dynamics and consumer preferences. We see it as an integral part of our continued improvement effort. Over the next 3 years, we intend to reduce our non-A&P operating expenses by 300 basis points, with an intent to reinvest the majority of these savings behind new growth initiatives. The project is targeting productivity in both external and internal cost and infrastructure. This project will be directly overseen by our Executive Council, that includes myself. We'll begin to see the impact from early 2016. We plan to provide you with periodic updates on our progress. As we open the lines to questions, I'd like to remind you that recognizing our longer-than-usual prepared remarks and likely surplus of questions, we've decided to extend the call by 15 minutes.

So I want to just highlight the fact that obviously, we don't have the ability to predict how competitors will act in the -- over the next 6, 12 or 24 months, for that matter. I do think that as people begin to lap these extraordinary windfalls that they have had from depressed dairy costs, we expect that most businesses, or at least most of our large competitors, will again begin to run the businesses in a more normal fashion where both sales and profit growth becomes a sort of -- an objective. I think at the moment, there is a lot of spare gross margin, sort of kind of slushing around in the system that people are choosing to spend in different ways and some people are clearly choosing to spend it on price discounting, both at the consumer and at the wholesale kind of level. Let me address the second part of your question, which was around how it's affecting our imported products. I think this is where it's beneficial for us to have a broader product portfolio in China because we are able to, at least at the moment, we are able to hold the price of the imported product relatively stable and most of the pricing activities that we have had to engage in. First of all, only began in the last months of the quarter. So we didn't see the full impact in the quarter of that. And consequently, we saw further a reasonably significant adverse volume impact. But most of that has been on the locally manufactured product, and most of it has gone towards ensuring that we are somewhat, we are somewhat competitive when it comes to trade margin and obviously, that we are attractively priced when it comes to the consumer. We'll continue to do that. I do think that this abnormal price environment in China is creating quite abnormal inventory situations, where we see spare inventory being created in many different pools around the country, and hence, moving in quite a disorganized fashion between provinces, and in many cases, between channels. So we see examples of people offering wholesale prices that are 15% to 25% below the prices they are selling to retail at. I don't particularly want to point the finger at anybody, as I'm sure everybody's doing what is right for their business. But I think you're going to see a lot of variability in individual company performances in China over the coming quarters."

The global milk, this month, just dropped another 20% sequentially or so. So when do you think that lap actually takes place? Why we will not see continued irrationality in prices drop even more for the next 6 months or so? And I guess, in relation to that, isn't this quite an irrational environment wherein where we've never seen anything like this before? We've seen freight cost drop before, but we've never seen pricing drop to this degree. So doesn't that speak a little bit toward the -- and you've talked about this to some extent, but the economy's impact as well. So I guess I'm curious, how do we get confidence that in a declining milk environment and a tough Chinese economy, this negative cycle really comes to a conclusion soon?"

I think it's a combination of the favorable dairy costs. And individual company reactions to a slowdown in the Chinese economy and in demand there. So most companies, I think, are struggling, having gone into 2015 with an overly optimistic view of what they would achieve in China this year. And I am -- we obviously have to recognize that, that's the case for us and I'd be surprised if we were entirely alone. So when you combine that with this, what shall we call it, surplus of gross margin, different companies are taking a different path in their efforts to hold up volume, if I can describe it like that. We can't say how long that would last, and you're right, I don't want to set an expectation of a sudden kind of reversal of that trend from one quarter to the next, but I do think our perspective is that dairy prices are either at or near their natural lows, and you are probably going to begin to see some culling of herds around the world, if dairy prices do not rebound. So in one way or another, we believe there's more risk associated with dairy prices looking forward than there is opportunity. So sometime depending on how companies recognize costs. Sometimes over the next few quarters, people will begin to substantially lap these low dairy costs. Charles, I don't know if you want to add anything?"

But clearly, there's a number of temporary factors at play with lower dairy prices and inventory building up. But one of the, I guess, more structurally worrisome aspects of what's gone on recently is the fact that many of your competitors have followed the locals, it's proved tempting to consumers who are reacting to it. And historically, we always talk about the fact that reducing your price point was the worst thing you could do, it would damage consumer perception of the brand.

But we have been -- we've been very reluctant, and we are very cautious in engaging in this level of discounting as it seems to us that the overwhelming effect of it is to create additional inventory in the retail trade, regardless of what channel you're in, whether you're in baby stores or for that matter, with the dot-com retailers, or with the supermarket chains. And it is not clear to us that a efficiently large part of that is translating into increased consumer offtake. It is also true, as we've said before, that as people move from infant formula, where there is relatively little price orientation from consumers into children's products, people become a little bit more, what shall we say, promiscuous and easier to attract through different promotional vehicles, price being one of them."

And those growth initiatives can be in different lines of the P&L, they don't necessarily all need to be in the A&P line. So one of the things we could potentially invest in would be higher retail trade margins. Or we could -- I'm not sure that, that's going to be what we want to do, but we could invest in a more competitive price level, if that was what we felt was important. To date, to date, we have not -- we've obviously made the judgment that lowering prices would not lead to significantly increased offtake in a way that would represent an overall benefit to the business. You might imagine that we are continually reevaluating that. Obviously, particularly in light of such strong margins, and we are not going to be dogmatic about this. If we believe that lowering the prices in China would make us more competitive, but I emphasize, make us more competitive at the consumer level, then we would clearly do so.

Jason, let me firstly say that the registration changes that are happening in China do not present a problem to us. We are in full compliance with those as of, I think, July 1. And so for us, that's a nonissue. And my understanding is that it does not, at least at the outset, apply to products that are imported, at least not by e-commerce. So that's my current understanding. As often is the case when these things are introduced in China, there is a little bit of uncertainty about how they will be enforced. But certainly, from our perspective and we've had extensive interaction, including having had input on the regulations, we don't see that as an issue for us. I think what you are saying about pricing in Europe, and efforts to harmonize, it highlights a very interesting dynamic that we are spending a lot of time reflecting on here, and that is that the company's share of the sales in China, in many cases, differ quite substantially from their share of the profit pool in China, because a lot of these -- a lot of these sales that go into China via the e-Commerce channel originate in Europe where margins are significantly lower and much of the profitability therefore, leaks outside of the companies that engage in that practice. I think as a consequence of that, they're trying to do 2 things. Just like us, they are trying to bring more of this trade under their direct control, which we believe is a good thing, and we believe will help both create pricing that is more reflective of value and create a greater conformance with China laws and regulations from the industry. And secondly, I suspect they are trying to take prices up in Europe in order to reduce the overall parallel trade, though I believe that the latter might be quite difficult to achieve."

And obviously, they are above, what shall we say, many of what, many companies that you guys might view as our broad peer set. However, it's very important to recognize that, so is our EBIT margin and so is our gross margin. I -- much of the differential comes from differences in business models. We spend a higher-than-average amount on A&P. We do that in order to create a sustainable value proposition for the consumer, who is ultimately paying a higher price that supports a higher gross margin. So we believe that to be a virtuous circle, and though we undoubtedly have opportunities over time to become even better at judging the cost effectiveness of our A&P spend, we are not substantially going to look at that line for productivity opportunity at this stage. So we are down to, let's say, about 25% or so in non-A&P operating expenses. And why 300 basis points and why not another number? We recognize that we do have 2 sales forces as part of our demand creation model. We have our medical sales force and the trade sales force, both of them are very important to our demand creation model, and that creates a different cost structure from some of our sort of, peer set that you look at, that rely more heavily just on a trade sale -- on a single trade sales force. We believe that 300 basis points is significant. It is meaningful, and we are going to go after that in a fairly determined and aggressive fashion. And then we will evaluate whether or not it is the right target or not, once we get a bit into it. When I can assure you that we are not going to just be satisfied, if that's what we can do, and where we are going to continue to challenge that. But at this point in time, I think that's the right number to aim for. And where are we going to find it? Well, we're going to look both externally and internally. We, obviously, as many companies do, we have a large number of outsourcing agreements with third-party providers. We, from time to time, engage with consultants that assist us in different projects. And we have created a lot of the processes and infrastructure that we had to create relatively quickly, as we separated from Bristol-Myers Squibb, in order to create standalone capabilities. And in some cases, we see opportunities within those areas for -- to eliminate kind of duplication and overlap between different functions or in some cases, between regional, local and global functions. So we're going to look at all of that, and we have begun the exercise and, I guess, at this point, we are kind of in the analysis phase, but we will -- we clearly see ourselves being in the execution phase by the time we get into the -- get through the fourth quarter of this year. And we'll talk more about this on our Investor Day."

We did not say that we were disappointed with the launch of the new product in China. In fact, we are quite pleased with the early trajectory of that launch. What happened was that obviously built through the quarter, as you can imagine, because you are building distribution and therefore, you exit the quarter at quite a different rate from what you're at in the early phase of the launch. What we did say was that the growth in the new product that we launched was insufficient to offset the decline that we saw in the quarter of the locally-manufactured product. So I hope that helped. Now you're quite right to say that spending $190 million, well, why didn't we see any impact on sale? Well, the reason is that, a large proportion of that increase was invested behind the introduction of this new product. And obviously, you don't get an instant return on that. But it obviously helped create very good momentum for that new launch. And I can assure you that we will hold ourselves accountable for continuing to see a positive trajectory from that product as we go forward."

Good morning to all of you, and thank you for joining us on this call. In a moment, I'll provide commentary on our overall company performance in the second quarter of 2015 and the first half of the year. As our prepared remarks today, a little more detail than usual. We've decided to expand this morning's call to an hour and 15 minutes. I hope this will allow us time to cover things in a bit more detail, while allowing you enough time for questions. At the CAGNY conference in February, I suggested 4 factors to focus on when you think about our revenue and earnings trajectory for 2015. Since then, we have repeatedly come back to these factors at both our first quarter earnings call in April and more recently, at the Deutsche Bank conference in early June. Since I'm sure we'll spend a good deal of time on this call discussing these again, let me remind you upfront what these factors were. 
Firstly, the impact of favorable commodity costs. Then, the counterbalancing headwinds from foreign exchange. And lastly, market dynamics and competitiveness in our 2 largest markets, North America and China. At the Deutsche Bank investor conference in early June, I spoke in more detail about the unique dynamics playing out in China currently, and I'll return to that topic a little later this morning. I'll also discuss the continuing strong performance of our business in North America and Europe. 
Turning in a moment to the overall company results, I'll provide highlights of our second quarter global performance before discussing each of our operating segments and our expectations for the full year. Then Charles will provide additional details on our financial performance. And finally, I'll return to provide a few summary remarks before we, as usual, open the lines for questions. 
Please note, except where otherwise stated, as Kathy said, my comments will refer to our non-GAAP financials. Turning now to the second quarter of 2015. Our second quarter results were as described in last week's pre-announcement. Constant dollar sales were 3% below prior year quarter and non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.76 for the quarter. Volume was 5% lower than the same quarter of the prior year. There were 2 key factors that drove the lower volume: Firstly, competitors' price-based promotional activities in several markets negatively impacted market share in these countries; secondly, in Hong Kong, our sales remained at levels below last year due to the residual effect of the March civil unrest. Price contributed 2 percentage points to revenue growth from the prior year quarter. Improved pricing in the United States and several other markets, however, failed to fully offset the impact of volume losses caused by competitive price discounting in China/Hong Kong, Thailand and Mexico. 
Apart from these few, but unfortunately large markets, almost every business delivered price growth. Many markets took price increases to help mitigate negative foreign exchange impacts. 
As you look sequentially from the first quarter, you will notice, as we expected, the contribution to growth from price is diminishing. As we've explained before, and this is not unexpected, lower commodity costs have made it difficult to take price increases in many of our emerging markets. In these markets, we see governments interested in controlling inflationary impact of weakening currencies. Finally, as you know, with approximately 75% of our revenue and profit outside of the United States, we are subject to the adverse impact from a strengthening dollar. In the second quarter, the sales impact from foreign exchange translation was approximately 4%. This was slightly lower than the 5% impact we saw in the first quarter of 2015, reflective of changes to our overall revenue mix. Gross margin in the quarter, at 65.4%, was our highest in over 5 years. It was up 360 basis points from the same quarter prior year. All segments benefited from lower dairy costs. And sequentially, our gross margin improved by 140 basis points from the first quarter of 2015. Charles will provide additional information on this a little later. 
As we told you in the first quarter earnings call, we increased our advertising and promotional spend significantly in the second quarter. Our spend of $190 million or 18.4% of sales in the quarter was at a new record level as we invested heavily behind select growth initiatives in the latter half of the quarter. 
Year-to-date, our advertising and promotional expenditure was 15.7% of sales, well above last year's full year spend of 14.5%. Our level of investment in demand creation will continue to fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter and occasionally from year-to-year. The variation reflects timing of innovation projects and other gross initiatives. We've continued to ensure that investment is competitive and at levels sufficient to support our growth initiatives. 
Second quarter non-GAAP earnings per share was 76% compared to $0.88 in prior year's quarter. Halfway through this year, earnings per share stand at $1.85 compared to $1.90 last year. The impact of foreign exchange was not quite fully offset by higher gross margin. 
Let me now comment on the performance of each of our operating segments, starting with Asia. In the second quarter, constant dollar sales were 10% below prior year quarter, as we saw reduced volume in the face of widespread price discounting by competitors at both wholesale and retail level. We opted to respond with pricing actions of our own, only late in the quarter. Though we saw increased pricing activity in several countries, including Thailand and Mexico, the activity in China was particularly noteworthy. 
Talking now specifically about China. It is clear to us that a combination of a slowing China economy, a proliferation of brand offerings and the lower dairy costs have created a competitive environment where both wholesalers and consumers are being tempted with special deals. Mindful of the potential for such discounting activity to cause inventory bubbles, we took a cautious approach in the early part of the quarter and took steps to underpin our competitiveness towards the second half of the quarter only. Surprisingly, we saw activity across all price segments and channels. Within the quarter, we continued to witness the China market shift towards imported products at the expense of locally produced goods, and towards the newer channels of baby stores and e-commerce. 
I've spoken previously about the strategic journey to address these trends by creating flexibility to compete in more consumer segments and strengthen our competitiveness in the fastest-growing channels. I'd like to provide a few highlights that demonstrate the progress we've made to date. 
As you recall, we launched a fully imported line of Enfa branded products in China in the beginning -- towards the end of April. As evidenced -- as evidence of the velocity of the shift in consumer preference, by the end of the just completed quarter, this line represented approximately 20% of our total sales in Mainland China. Unfortunately, the rapid growth of our imported line was still insufficient to fully offset moderating sales of our locally packaged products. A broader portfolio is putting us in a better position to compete in the important baby store channel, and growth in e-commerce continues to outstrip that of other channels. This phenomenon is driven by a combination of direct-to-consumer and wholesaling activity. Our focus remains on growing company-controlled e-commerce, which is the most rapidly expanding channel. Efforts initiated last year are beginning to pay off now. According to external sources, our e-commerce sales are up by nearly 70% on the year prior. Admittedly, this is still off of a relatively small base, but it shows we are figuring things out and moving in the right direction. Our progress with priority partners like Tmall and JD.com was also satisfactory, with year-to-date growth ranging between 40% and 90%. 
Enfagrow, our growing-up milk, for instance, is the fourth most searched for line item on Tmall. To get a flavor of this, I'd encourage you to try searches on either of these sites. Though the sites allow for more refined searches in Mandarin, you'll find that an English language search is still illustrative. By sharing these operating metrics, I hope to give you a sense of our commitment to developing these capabilities and our tracking of progress. I'm encouraged by the early indications that our China strategy is working. You should not expect this level of update in every call going forward. However, we do plan to return to the theme of e-commerce in China at our Investor Day on November 4. We look forward to seeing many of you there. 
Let me complete my discussion of China with a few comments pertaining to Hong Kong. We continue to see some residual effect of the March civil disturbance, and visitor numbers to the territory remain below the highs seen late last year. That said, March appears to have been the low point and visitor numbers have since begun to recover. Second quarter sales in the territory were at a lower level not seen since mid-2013. It's difficult to predict exactly how quickly the situation will return to normal, but we remain confident that the Hong Kong and China governments will ultimately resolve the situation and avoid further damage to local commerce. 
Turning now to the rest of Asia. In Thailand, our performance did not meet our expectations. Consumer confidence is very low and as mentioned earlier, competitive pricing pressure resulted in a loss of market share. It is clear we did not execute as well as we would've liked to. And we're determined to improve performance in the second half of the year. In the balance of the region, we saw solid performance in the Philippines, offset by a slowdown in Malaysia, associated with the introduction of a general sales tax. We believe this slowdown in Malaysia to be temporary and primarily retailer-driven. 
In summary, we are, of course, disappointed with the latest quarter in Asia, where a series of external factors coincided to produce weaker-than-expected performance. That said, we believe we have accurately identified opportunities to improve execution, and we have good evidence our China strategy will deliver results. 
Turning now to Latin America. Constant dollar revenue rose 1% in the second quarter over the same quarter of 2014. Pricing added 6 points of growth, but was partially offset by 5% of adverse impact from volume. Pricing gains in the high inflation countries of Venezuela and Argentina more than covered the impact of currency depreciation in these markets. Our decision to hold back shipments into and inside Venezuela was a significant driver of relatively weaker volume performance. As we've stated in previous calls, we are managing risk associated with intercompany payables within defined parameters. Foreign exchange movements continue to significantly impact results for the segment. The impact was seen across the segment, with Colombia and Brazil the most severely affected. Performance within our Mexican subsidiary was below expectations, in part due to this fact also. However, results were further impacted by a loss of market share in the face of strong competition in milk modifiers. Our core Enfa brand performed well within the quarter, but I remind you that a significant part of our business is done within the local brands or milk modifiers. Our Argentina business continues to exceed expectations. We are constantly making operational and strategic improvements to the business there. And in the last few weeks, we finalized an agreement to acquire an additional 10% equity stake in the joint venture we formed in early 2012. This transaction took our equity position to 90%. 
We are likewise seeing sustained strong performance across Central America, the Caribbean and the Indian markets. 
Let me now turn to our North America/Europe segment. I'm very pleased with the continued strong performance of this reporting segment. Constant dollar revenue growth was 6% on the prior year's quarter, and sequential quarterly growth was solid also. Growth in our United States business reflected continued improvements in the overall economic conditions, allowing us to realize better pricing. The impact year-to-date was, however, largely the carryover effect of pricing taken in the third quarter of last year. On top of this, we now understand 2014 births increased by as much as 1.5%, according to data recently released by the Center for Disease Control. This represents the first solid year of rebound since the economic crisis of late 2008. The rebound in births was not entirely unexpected, and consistent with expectations described in earnings calls over the last few years. It is, however, rewarding to see the rebound finally materialize. 
Market share gains within our North American and European infant formula businesses, and continued strong growth from our Enfagrow Toddler initiative in North America, also helped our performance in the quarter. Our growth in the relatively smaller European business was somewhat understated due to our exit from Russia early in the year. Excluding this effect of the lost revenue from the discontinued business in Russia, the rest of our European business has grown at a double-digit rate year-to-date. Our growth in North America and Europe, in many ways, validates our strategy to continue investing in brand-equity building and demand creation during the economic downturn. The last couple of years have seen us reap the rewards from investments we made over the 2009 to 2013 period. 
Before I hand over to Charles, let me now discuss our outlook for full year 2015. We see 2015 as a year of transition for the business, where we are facing a number of unique challenges. I'm thinking here firstly about the impact of a strengthening dollar on both our top line performance and our earnings per share. And secondly, of the less well understood impact of lower dairy input costs, that on the one hand makes for a tougher pricing environment and on the other hand, supports stronger-than-average gross margin performance. The impact of a stronger dollar alone is likely to take as much as 4 to 5 percentage points of our reported sales growth and around $0.10 of our 2015's earnings per share. In this environment, I once again direct your attention to the performance of our 2 largest markets of China/Hong Kong and the United States, these being the major swing factors that will impact full year performance. As we find it difficult to determine how long the current price discounting in China will last, the wider-than-usual earnings per share range contained within our recently revised guidance reflects this level of uncertainty. Our outlook now expects constant dollar revenue growth over prior year between 0 and 2%, with non-GAAP earnings per share in between $3.63 and $3.78. This revised outlook reflects an expectation that our new growth initiatives in China will continue to pay off and play an ever-larger part in our performance there. We expect to be seeing sequential growth in China again as we exit the year. 
Gross margin is expected to remain around 64.5% as we continue to benefit from lower dairy costs. This, despite a tougher-than-anticipated pricing environment. The significant investments that we remain committed to making, do present a short-term challenge. Yet we are convinced investments to reshape our portfolio, improve competitiveness in higher growth channels and create added flexibility are necessary. And they will allow us to come out of this year of transition in China in a stronger position. With an improved gross margin, we expect our EBIT margin slightly above the 24.5%. Charles, I now turn the call over to you."

There are several factors contributing to the recent update to our guidance. Therefore, I will walk down the income statement and provide insight and context on how these changes impacted our performance and our financial outlook. I will then briefly discuss the geographic reporting segments results before concluding with comments on our balance sheet and cash flow. Unless otherwise noted, my comments will be on our non-GAAP financial results, and references to currency impacts or the effects of currency fluctuations generally refer to their impact on the translation of local currency financial statements into dollars. 
I'll begin my review of the income statement primarily focusing on changes versus the prior quarter, starting with our sales performance. Kasper already discussed our constant dollar sales results and guidance. For the second quarter, sales on a reported basis were 7% below the prior year quarter. The 2% increase in price was insufficient to offset a 5% volume reduction and a further 4% impact from adverse foreign exchange translation rates. 
I'd now like to make some comments about foreign exchange and its impact on the business. The U.S. dollar continued to exhibit strength during the quarter. Its effect on the translation of local currencies adversely impacted most markets in which we operate. In particular, the Latin American markets experienced widespread adverse foreign exchange headwinds, with the Mexican peso and Brazilian real having the most significant impact on sales and as Kasper alluded to, some impact from Colombia as well. The SICAD rate, which we use to translate our Venezuelan-bolivar-denominated financial statements, was devalued from 12 to 12.8 during the quarter, impacting both the P&L and balance sheet translation. This adversely impacted the quarter by around $3 million on a pretax basis versus the prior year period. The balance sheet impact from this devaluation is classified in Other Income and Expense. 
Additionally, we opted to slow down the shipment to and distribution of goods in Venezuela due to a buildup of unpaid invoices in the first half of the year. The situation remains fluid, but we continue to pursue a constructive dialogue with the relevant authorities -- local authorities, and received a small payment early in July at the same 6.3 exchange rate received in the past. If exchange rates were to remain at their current levels, we estimate that foreign exchange will adversely impact sales growth by between 4% and 5% for the full year 2015. This is not a significant driver of the change in guidance. While we anticipate currency translations have an adverse impact on full year sales, there are factors which mitigate the impact of foreign exchange translation on the EPS. Pricing, lower dairy costs, the euro-denominated components of our cost of goods, and the translation of local currency denominated expenses, serve to mitigate, but not fully offset, the EPS impact from the stronger dollar on local currency sales translation. 
I will now comment on our gross profit. Our gross margin was 65.4% in the second quarter, up 140 basis points sequentially from the first quarter of 2015 and up 360 basis points from the second quarter of 2014. The increase in gross margins was driven primarily by lower dairy costs, both versus the first quarter of 2015 and the prior year quarter. As we've previously indicated, a consequence of lower dairy costs is that it becomes tougher to set price increases in support of newer innovations or to offset pressure from currency fluctuation. This was evident in our second quarter results and is expected to result in a less favorable impact from price in the balance of the year as we lap the pricing taken in 2014. Additionally, we expect to see continued trade discounting in select markets. 
I remind you that dairy makes up around 1/3 of our total cost of goods. For the full year 2015, we expect dairy costs will decrease around 20% over 2014, while other commodity costs, in combination with conversion costs, should rise around 1%. So in aggregate, our annual cost of goods is expected to decrease in the mid-single-digit range. 
Finally, we have locked in our dairy costs for the year. On a sequential basis, the benefit from dairy will reduce in the second half versus the first half of 2015. Bearing in mind these factors, we estimate that our annual gross margin will be around 64.5%, which is 50 basis points higher than the prior guidance. 
Moving on to operating expenses. You'll recall that in the first quarter, we alluded to significantly higher demand generation expenses in subsequent quarters with the second quarter likely to be the peak investment period. In the second quarter, the advertising and promotional expense was at a record of 18.4% of sales, resulting in first half year-to-date expenditure close to 16% of sales. The second quarter increase was largely due to selected investments in Asia, most notably in China. As Kasper indicated, the China investment was primarily to support recent introduction of our fully imported product. 
Turning to the other income expense line. The current year quarter expense was related to the depreciation of the SICAD rate in Venezuela. This compares to income in the prior year quarter when we recognized a gain related to payments for products supplied from our plants to our Venezuelan affiliate at exchange rates which were favorable to the SICAD rate used in translating our financial statements. 
To conclude my discussion on operating expenses, for the year, we reiterate our intention to reinvest a portion of our higher gross margins back into the business through higher demand generation investment. As a consequence of the factors I mentioned, we anticipate annual EBIT to be slightly above 24.5% of sales, similar to our guidance in the last call. 
I will now briefly run through the geographic segment results for the quarter. Asia sales were 10% below the prior year quarter on a constant-dollar basis. Higher gross margins were invested in strong advertising and promotion support for the region, led by investment in China against our recently launched fully imported product. EBIT was 30% of sales. Latin America sales were 1% above the prior year quarter in constant dollars, and again, the higher gross margins funded investments in advertising and promotion. EBIT was 23% of sales compared to 24% in the prior year quarter. Our North America/Europe sales were 6% above the prior year quarter in constant dollars. EBIT was 25% above the prior year quarter, mainly driven by higher gross margins. 
I will now briefly speak about our taxes and our effective tax rate. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate, or ETR, was 25.6% in the second quarter compared to 23.8% in the prior year quarter. The higher rate is primarily the result of a change in geographic earnings mix. On a full year basis, we expect the non-GAAP ETR to be approximately 24%. 
Now, to summarize our annual guidance. To reiterate the guidance statement in our recent pre-announcement, we anticipate constant dollar sales growth of approximately 0 to 2% this year. Including the impact of adverse foreign currency rates, reported sales are estimated to decrease by 2% to 4% this fiscal year over the prior year. As we consider other factors which could impact EPS performance during the remainder of the year, there are a number of key potential swing factors, which should be considered: our balance of the year sales trajectory, recall that Kasper alluded to the North America/China mix as being a key swing item; the impact of foreign exchange translation on our financial statements; and finally, the impact of pricing and the extent of ongoing discounting in selected key markets. As mentioned in our previous quarterly earnings calls, a significant devaluation in Venezuela, should it happen, is not considered in our current guidance. 7%, the valuation of the SICAD rate, has already occurred in the second quarter, and our guidance assumes no further devaluation in Venezuela. Dairy costs should remain favorable for the balance of the year, but not incremental to assumptions included in our guidance. Remember that we lock in dairy prices about 7 months out. This favorability will not be conducive to price increases, as evidenced by the level of marketplace discounting in the second quarter. 
Overall, our gross margin has seen a healthy improvement over last year and is near levels last seen around the time of the IPO. While the supply of dairy products continues to exceed demand, we could foresee a scenario where supply could become more constrained, but likely not in the near future. 
Non-GAAP earnings for 2015 are expected to be in the range of $3.63 to $3.78 per share, and GAAP earnings per share for the quarter were $0.80 per share. GAAP earnings guidance is expected in the range of $3.56 to $3.71 per share. 
I will now conclude with a high level overview of the balance sheet. While we had a difficult quarter, we continue to generate strong cash flows and the balance sheet remains strong. Our cash balance was $1.5 billion as of June 30, 2015, up about $40 million from the first quarter 2015, and approximately $180 million from year-end 2014. Cash held in the United States was approximately $215 million. Debt stood at $1.5 billion as of June 30, 2015, with our net debt position close to 0. Free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures, was approximately $377 million in the first half of 2015 after consuming $80 million in cash for capital investment. We continue to expand our European plant in the second quarter to meet increased requirements for our fully imported product in China. For the full year, capital spending expectations remain unchanged at around $175 million. This is in line with our long-term goal of about 4% of sales. Depreciation and amortization expense is expected to be around $100 million for the full year. 
I'll talk a little bit about cash utilization before concluding. On June 11, 2015, our Board of Directors announced a dividend of just over $0.41 a share, which should annualize to approximately $1.65 per share for the year. As a result, full year dividends paid out of earnings are expected to exceed $320 million for 2015. As you may recall, in September 2013, the Board of Directors approved an additional $500 million share repurchase program, following the full utilization of our previous $300 million program. We have approximately $430 million unutilized under this new program. We expect to activate this program in the coming quarters, either through open market or privately negotiated transactions. The program is intended to offset the dilutive impact on earnings from employee stock-based compensation plans and allow opportunistic stock-based repurchases to return capital to shareholders. With that, I shall now turn the call back to Kasper."

Before we take your questions, I'd like to briefly reiterate the key components of our strategy and highlight our recently added strategic initiative. Our strategy of investing in brand building and innovation in North America, despite the economic turndown -- or downturn, sorry, is now bearing fruit. So is our decision to increase investment in the creation of a toddler business there. We are happy with our current momentum. Our decision to focus our European business likewise has produced a smaller but faster growing and more profitable business. And we've talked in recent months about our desire to become channel-agnostic in China by broadening our portfolio and creating a more flexible business model. We are convinced this is the right strategy. We are satisfied with the early progress of our new growth initiatives, and we are committed to continued investment behind this strategy. 
The Latin America region has been particularly challenged by currency headwinds this year. Over time, we'll see this stabilize and our ability to translate more of our constant dollar growth into reported sales growth will be enhanced. Within the last few weeks, we've launched a new initiative, project fuel for growth. This major strategic initiative will reshape our income statement by increasing operating expense productivity. The project is central to our goal of becoming an even more agile and flexible business that is best able to respond to changes in market dynamics and consumer preferences. We see it as an integral part of our continued improvement effort. Over the next 3 years, we intend to reduce our non-A&P operating expenses by 300 basis points, with an intent to reinvest the majority of these savings behind new growth initiatives. The project is targeting productivity in both external and internal costs and infrastructure. This project will be directly overseen by our Executive Council, that includes myself. We'll begin to see the impact from early 2016. We plan to provide you with periodic updates on our progress. As we open the lines to questions, I'd like to remind you that recognizing our longer-than-usual prepared remarks and likely surplus of questions, we've decided to extend the call by 15 minutes. Operator, if you would now open the lines to questions, please?"

So I want to just highlight the fact that obviously, we don't have the ability to predict how competitors will act in the -- over the next 6, 12 or 24 months, for that matter. I do think that as people begin to lap these extraordinary windfalls that they have had from depressed dairy costs, we expect that most businesses, or at least most of our large competitors, will again begin to run the businesses in a more normal fashion where both sales and profit growth becomes a sort of -- an objective. I think at the moment, there is a lot of spare gross margin, sort of kind of sloshing around in the system that people are choosing to spend in different ways, and some people are clearly choosing to spend it on price discounting, both at the consumer and at the wholesale kind of level. Let me address the second part of your question, which was around how it's affecting our imported product. I think this is where it's beneficial for us to have a broader product portfolio in China because we are able to, at least at the moment, we are able to hold the price of the imported product relatively stable. And most of the pricing activities that we have had to engage in, first of all, only began in the last months of the quarter. So we didn't see the full impact in the quarter of that. And consequently, we saw further a reasonably significant adverse volume impact. But most of that has been on the locally manufactured product, and most of it has gone towards ensuring that we are somewhat, we are somewhat competitive when it comes to trade margin and obviously, that we are attractively priced when it comes to the consumer. We'll continue to do that. I do think that this abnormal price environment in China is creating quite abnormal inventory situations, where we see spare inventory being created in many different pools around the country, and hence, moving in quite a disorganized fashion between provinces, and in many cases, between channels. So we see examples of people offering wholesale prices that are 15% to 25% below the prices they are selling to retail at. I don't particularly want to point the finger at anybody, as I'm sure everybody's doing what is right for their business. But I think you're going to see a lot of variability in individual company performances in China over the coming quarters."

I think it's a combination of the favorable dairy costs. And individual company reactions to a slowdown in the Chinese economy and in demand there. So most companies, I think, are struggling, having gone into 2015 with an overly optimistic view of what they would achieve in China this year. And I am -- we obviously have to recognize that, that's the case for us, and I'd be surprised if we were entirely alone. So when you combine that with this, what shall we call it, surplus of gross margin, different companies are taking a different path in their efforts to hold up volume, if I can describe it like that. We can't say how long that will last, and you're right, I don't want to set an expectation of a sudden kind of reversal of that trend from one quarter to the next, but I do think our perspective is that dairy prices are either at or near their natural lows, and you are probably going to begin to see some culling of herds around the world, if dairy prices do not rebound. So in one way or another, we believe there's more risk associated with dairy prices looking forward than there is opportunity. So sometime depending on how companies recognize costs. Sometimes over the next few quarters, people will begin to substantially lap these low dairy costs. Charles, I don't know if you want to add anything."

So -- and I suppose that's what I was trying to say in my prepared comments, and if I wasn't clear enough, I apologize. But we have been -- we've been very reluctant, and we are very cautious in engaging in this level of discounting as it seems to us that the overwhelming effect of it is to create additional inventory in the retail trade, regardless of what channel you're in, whether you're in baby stores or for that matter, with the dot-com retailers, or with the supermarket chains. And it is not clear to us that a sufficiently large part of that is translating into increased consumer offtake. It is also true, as we've said before, that as people move from infant formula, where there is relatively little price orientation from consumers, into children's products, people become a little bit more, what shall we say, promiscuous and easier to attract through different promotional vehicles, price being one of them."

But with your gross margins just continuing to grow higher -- I was surprised to see how high they got -- and the economic backdrop getting weaker, are you concerned that you are -- that Mead is pushing margins higher at a time when everyone else is -- your competitors are pushing margins lower and that you're kind of setting yourself up for more market share losses as the year goes on? And I guess, the follow-up question to that is, when you look at your top line targets of kind of like 6% to 7%, the backdrop has changed. And especially in China, but not just in China, but throughout the world.

I think that program is very important to us, and it's all about creating flexibility to cope with different market circumstances, Rob. So it's good that you take note of that. And it of course gives us choices. By becoming leaner and more efficient, it will give us flexibility to invest in growth initiatives. And those growth initiatives can be in different lines of the P&L. They don't necessarily all need to be in the A&P line. So one of the things we could potentially invest in would be higher retail trade margins. Or we could -- I'm not sure that, that's going to be what we want to do, but we could invest in a more competitive price level, if that was what we felt was important. To date, to date, we have not -- we've obviously made the judgment that lowering prices would not lead to significantly increased offtake in a way that would represent an overall benefit to the business. You might imagine that we are continually reevaluating that. Obviously, particularly in light of such strong margins, and we are not going to be dogmatic about this. If we believe that lowering the prices in China would make us more competitive, but I emphasize, make us more competitive at the consumer level, then we would clearly do so. We are not going to do so simply to allow ourselves to boost performance in a given quarter in order to escape a little bit of heat, so to speak."

Jason, let me firstly say that the registration changes that are happening in China do not present a problem to us. We are in full compliance with those as of, I think, July 1. And so for us, that's a nonissue. And my understanding is that it does not, at least at the outset, apply to products that are imported, at least not by e-commerce. So that's my current understanding. As often is the case when these things are introduced in China, there is a little bit of uncertainty about how they will be enforced. But certainly, from our perspective and we've had extensive interaction, including having had input on the regulations, we don't see that as an issue for us. I think what you are saying about pricing in Europe and efforts to harmonize, it highlights a very interesting dynamic that we are spending a lot of time reflecting on here, and that is that companies' share of the sales in China, in many cases, differ quite substantially from their share of the profit pool in China, because a lot of these -- a lot of these sales that go into China via the e-commerce channel originate in Europe where margins are significantly lower and much of the profitability therefore leaks outside of the companies that engage in that practice. I think as a consequence of that, they're trying to do 2 things. Just like us, they are trying to bring more of this trade under their direct control, which we believe is a good thing, and we believe will help both create pricing that is more reflective of value and create a greater conformance with China laws and regulations from the industry. And secondly, I suspect they are trying to take prices up in Europe in order to reduce the overall parallel trade, though I believe that the latter might be quite difficult to achieve."

And obviously, they are above what, shall we say, many of what, many companies that you guys might view as our broad peer set. However, it's very important to recognize that, so is our EBIT margin and so is our gross margin. I -- much of the differential comes from differences in business models. We spend a higher-than-average amount on A&P. We do that in order to create a sustainable value proposition for the consumer, who is ultimately paying a higher price that supports a higher gross margin. So we believe that to be a virtuous circle, and though we undoubtedly have opportunities over time to become even better at judging the cost effectiveness of our A&P spend, we are not substantially going to look at that line for productivity opportunity at this stage. So we are down to, let's say, about 25% or so in non-A&P operating expenses. And why 300 basis points and why not another number? We recognize that we do have 2 sales forces as part of our demand creation model. We have our medical sales force and the trade sales force. Both of them are very important to our demand creation model, and that creates a different cost structure from some of our sort of, peer set that you look at, that rely more heavily just on a trade sale -- on a single trade sales force. We believe that 300 basis points is significant. It is meaningful, and we are going to go after that in a fairly determined and aggressive fashion. And then we will evaluate whether or not it is the right target or not, once we get a bit into it. When I can assure you that we are not going to just be satisfied, if that's what we can do, and where we are going to continue to challenge that. But at this point in time, I think that's the right number to aim for. And where are we going to find it? Well, we're going to look both externally and internally. We, obviously, as many companies do, we have a large number of outsourcing agreements with third-party providers. We, from time to time, engage with consultants that assist us in different projects. And we have created a lot of the processes and infrastructure that we had to create relatively quickly, as we separated from Bristol-Myers Squibb, in order to create stand-alone capabilities. And in some cases, we see opportunities within those areas for -- to eliminate kind of duplication and overlap between different functions or in some cases, between regional, local and global functions. So we're going to look at all of that, and we have begun the exercise and, I guess, at this point, we are kind of in the analysis phase, but we will -- we clearly see ourselves being in the execution phase by the time we get into the -- get through the fourth quarter of this year.

We did not say that we were disappointed with the launch of the new product in China. In fact, we are quite pleased with the early trajectory of that launch. What happened was that obviously built through the quarter, as you can imagine, because you are building distribution and therefore, you exit the quarter at quite a different rate from what you're at in the early phase of the launch. What we did say was that the growth in the new product that we launched was insufficient to offset the decline that we saw in the quarter of the locally manufactured product. So I hope that helped. Now you're quite right to say that spending $190 million, well, why didn't we see an impact on sale? Well, the reason is that a large proportion of that increase was invested behind the introduction of this new product. And obviously, you don't get an instant return on that.
