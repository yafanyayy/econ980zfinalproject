262913,281075400,747273,"CA Technologies, Inc., Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 20, 2015",2015-01-20,"Earnings Calls","CA, Inc.","Executives","Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us.

During the third quarter, we saw further evidence of the strategy we put in place is beginning to yield results. While total third quarter new sales declined approximately 10% year-over-year, this was mainly the result of a headwind from the timing of our renewable portfolio, which was down in the mid-30% range year-over-year. As a reminder, we faced a tough year-over-year comparison from a $300 million-plus transaction with a systems integrator that closed in the third quarter of fiscal 2014. As we have said in the past, a large percentage of our new sales are still attached to renewal opportunities.
Within Enterprise Solutions, we are beginning to see success in our strategy to seed accounts with smaller deals through the value of our software and expand our footprint with follow-on transactions. An impact on the smaller transactions size is near-term headwinds to the Enterprise Solutions' new sales growth. However, while our Enterprise new sales were below our expectations during the quarter, we are seeing a higher volume of transactions both during the quarter and year-to-date in our growth product solutions. This is creating beachheads with our named accounts, which is leading to additional follow-on pipeline for many of these solutions.
Turning to Mainframe. Our Mainframe new sales grew in the low single digits year-over-year. Their performance was driven by an increased demand for Mainframe Solutions that leveraged the existing data and logic residing on the Mainframe to develop mobile and web-based applications. Additionally, we are enhancing our current application development portfolio to address larger Mainframe-to-mobile development market, which is providing us the opportunity to expand our footprint within our installed base. In the fourth quarter, we expect the renewable portfolio to be up in the 20% range year-over-year and total new sales to increase at least in the mid single digits year-over-year. I am confident we're on our way to achieving our medium-term goals.
Across every industry, business models are being transformed by software, specifically by interconnected applications. As software applications become the vital component of a global economic supply chain, and the expectations of applications speed to market accelerate, brand loyalty can be attained or lost within seconds. This makes the quality of software development more critical today than ever.
Our solutions enable enterprises to unlock the opportunities of this Application Economy, where the software is the competitive differentiator in application development is the engine of innovation. We are one of the few software providers that can deliver an integrated set of solutions, at scale across multiple platforms to help plan, develop, manage and secure applications. Let me provide you with more insight into the progress we're making towards our strategy to deliver differentiated solutions, improve sales execution and increase our velocity.
First, developing differentiated solutions in our 3 product pillars of management cloud, DevOps and security is the foundation of our strategy. In order to be a leader in the next generation of software, innovation must be the lifeblood of our company. Over the last 2 years, we have dramatically improved the efficiency of our development organization. This has allowed us to redeploy resources to focus areas such as improving the user experience and the time to value of our existing solutions, as well as bringing new products to market. An example that touches upon each of these focus areas is within our DevOps. Following the successful release of CA APM 9.7, this quarter, we launched our mobile application analytics solution. This solution provides analytics into the user experience of mobile apps and integrates with our flagship CA APM product to provide end-to-end transaction monitoring. We are already seeing early traction with the product, as demonstrated by a win at a large U.S.-based telco that will leverage CA mobile app analytics and CA APM to monitor transactions from tablets in its local stores all the way back to its data center.
Over the last 2 years, through the hard work of the APM team, our APM business has regained momentum in the market. This is evidenced by our year-to-date double-digit year-over-year growth in APM new sales and APM revenue growth returning to industry rates. 
Our security group is one of the businesses driving differentiated product development. The frequency and severity of breaches we have all seen over the course of 2014 are threatening the enterprises like never before. The marketplace is looking to software firms like CA to provide new approaches to protect their users and data. We are making investments on multiple fronts to ensure organizations can protect themselves against attacks initiated to compromise identities. One example of this is an investment in our latest release of CA advanced authentication. Malicious hackers often use stolen or compromised identities to gain access to applications. Our latest release of CA advanced authentication uses real-time analytics such as location and IP addresses to assess whether a user is who they claim to be. Simultaneously, it ensures that the password that the legitimate employee and customers use to gain access to corporate systems are all was secure and unusable if compromised.
As we stated last quarter, we are also reallocating incremental investments towards API management. APIs are the next-generation middleware of how customers are connecting hybrid cloud applications and infrastructure. We are the only vendor that can provide API management solution at the scale and security levels needed for the massive amount of data traversing these newly-created digital platforms. As an example, a large consumer electronics provider chose our API management solution for its newly architected e-commerce platform following a failure on Cyber Monday of its previous e-commerce platform. We have the ability to triple our revenue run rate with this customer over the next 12 months with our API management solutions. We see many other API management opportunities like this emerging in the marketplace. 
In addition, to the development of our core product areas, we are also redeploying our investment in 2 adjacent capacities. First, we are improving the integration with our current product set and with third-party providers. For example, we are tightening the integration between our Application Performance Management and Infrastructure Management solutions. As software becomes that underlie supply-chain of every organization, any failure in that delivery can no longer be examined independently for each specific computing layer. Instead, the service quality must be scrutinized in the context of the entire end-to-end transaction, from the mobile interface through the application server and back to the database on the Mainframe or in the cloud. Once again, we are one of few software providers that can provide that level of end-to-end visibility and scale.
Secondly, this part of the reallocation of our software development efforts, we are focusing on what customers will need in the future. We see 3 disruptive forces emerging in the market that will impact software development and we are focused on providing solutions in these areas. The first disruptive force is the unwired enterprise. How will customers manage the complexity of the billions of IP-connected devices with multiple operating systems on multiple standards which will proliferate their IP infrastructure. We have a deep history in managing network-connected devices and its natural extension of our capabilities to solve this emerging challenge.
This leads us to the second emerging market. As these IP-connected devices create a massive amount of ambient data, both structured and unstructured coming from new sources such as sensors and social networks, enterprise is under tremendous pressure to security combine their sensitive data with less risky social data and arrive at a revenue generating business outcome. Given our expertise in managing data across multiple platforms, we are working on solutions to help manage the movement of and access to this data and transform it into usable information that delivers competitive advantage to our customers.
For the third emerging opportunity, API-assembled applications, we already have a strong presence in core API management. We are leveraging our leadership in API management to help customers create and deploy interconnected applications to unlock the potential of their APIs and create new revenue opportunities.
In these 3 emerging markets, we are not making investments haphazardly or with a win at all cost mentality. We are taking a systematic approach where when we fail, we will fail early and when we win, we will have a plan in place to accelerate that product's escape velocity.
Turning now to our second major component of our strategy, I will walk you through how we are improving marketing and sales execution. We continue to improve our brand recognition in the marketplace. At CA World, our global user conference held in November, we showcased our expanding portfolio of solutions to thousands of customers and partners. Overall feedback from customers, prospects and analysts noted the emergence of a new CA with a clear focus on the challenges and opportunities faced by enterprises in a world increasingly driven by software.
Turning to sales execution. We are continuing to see evidence that our strategy of separating platinum accounts from our named and growth accounts, as well as having sales specialized by product discipline, is paying off. As I stated earlier, while new sales in the quarter declined on a year-over-year basis, this was mainly due to a tough year-over-year compare in our renewable portfolio. We are seeing 3 healthy trends in our sales execution which reinforce my confidence in the ability to grow new sales over the medium term. First, with our platinum accounts. Our third quarter renewal rates and attach rates were in line with historical trends. Additionally, we are seeing success with platinum reps truly partnering with our customers to understand their IP challenges. For example, our EMEA platinum team had a Service Virtualization win with a large multi national bank that is in the midst of a digital transformation. Longer term, this customer expects only 5% of banking interactions to occur in a physical location, thus making software development crucial to their success. The CA account team is in constant dialogue with the customer to understand how CA can help it along its digital transformation journey. This transaction marks their 6 new transaction with CA over the last 24 months, and they have increased their spending with CA over the last 4 years.
The second observation is, while our named and growth team's new sales performance was below plan, the volume of their transactions in our growth products grew year-over-year. As we increase the number of transactions, we are seeing a shortening of our sales cycles, as the technical aspect of the buying process is already proven. As a result, the quality of that pipeline has improved.
Let me provide a couple of examples. First, our Service Virtualization solution landed a win with a Fortune 500 multinational restaurant chain that had not bought a new product from CA in over 7 years. The initial transaction was just $250,000 and is focused on the specific development project. This solution alone has the ability to expand into many additional transactions over the next 24 months. Furthermore, this customer could have a greater than $5 million revenue run rate with us through cross-sell opportunities. We have identified many other accounts that have this potential.
And the second example, we forged a partnership with a leading software virtualization vendor to help build their internal DevOps strategy. They are leveraging our Service Virtualization solution to improve the speed at which they can develop and test against third-party SaaS applications, as well as their own internal IT services. Again, this is an initial transaction for which there is an opportunity to significantly expand our wallet share over the next year.
The final sales highlight I'll touch upon is with respect to the renewal portfolio. In the fourth quarter, our renewable portfolio is expected to increase in the 20% range year-over-year. As such, we are expecting at least mid-single-digit year-over-year total new sales growth, taking into account the tailwind from the sales opportunities related to renewals, plus the quality of the pipelines from our named account team.
Let me now speak to velocity. In order for us to be a modern software company, we need to deliver innovation to our customers rapidly, seamlessly and predictively. This requires a culture of empowerment where our professionals have the autonomy to drive their work forward and are held accountable for progress and results. How we get things done is as important as what that work is, and we are highly focused on evolving our internal culture so we can operate at or above market velocity. On balance, in the third quarter, we make progress against achieving our medium-term goals. We are building CA with a focus on innovation, execution and speed to compete and win in one of the fastest and most exciting industries in the world. However, we are doing so with financial discipline to preserve and enhance shareholder value over the long term.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Rich to review our third quarter financials and full-year guidance. Thank you."

Before we get started with the quarter review, let me remind you that all comparisons are year-over-year and in constant currency unless otherwise indicated. This afternoon, I'm going to focus my comments on the key business drivers and performance indicators for the quarter. The balance of our financial details can be found in our supplemental and press release. 
As many of you are aware, the dollar continues to strengthen against most major currencies, which negatively impacts both our results and guidance. Our Q3 revenue was $1.09 billion and was down 1%; Mainframe was down 1%; Enterprise Solutions was flat; and Services declined 2%.
On an as-reported basis, Q3 renewals were down in the high 30% range but in line with our expectations. As Mike stated earlier, in Q3 fiscal 2014, we renewed our 4-year system integrator transaction for over $300 million, which created a tough year-over-year compare for both renewals and new sales this quarter. As we have previously stated, the increase and decrease year-over-year in our renewal bookings can vary on a quarterly basis due to the timing of large transactions.
Q3 total new product and capacity sales were down low teens as reported. This is due mainly to the headwinds from the renewal portfolio. The renewal yield during the quarter was approximately 90%. We continue to expect fiscal 2015 renewals to be down high single-digit year-over-year as compared to fiscal 2014 and flat year-over-year excluding the large system integrator renewal that closed in Q3 of fiscal 2014. We expect Q4 renewals to be up in the 20% range year-over-year both in constant currency and as reported.
From a geographic basis during the quarter, we saw continued improvement from our EMEA team sales execution as they grew year-over-year this quarter. This marks the EMEA team's third quarter in a row of performance that was in line with our expectations. We are also seeing good performance in our Asia team. However, North America fell short of our expectations mainly due to smaller transaction sizes. Latin America performance was again below expectations, which we believe is mainly a result of macro related headwinds.
In our Mainframe segment. Mainframe new sales including the product and capacity were up low single digit in constant currency, but down slightly as reported. Mainframe new sales benefited from good capacity sales and growth in new Mainframe products. Overall, we expect our Mainframe revenue growth to be flat to down low single digits over the medium term, which we believe is in line with the Mainframe market.
Enterprise Solutions' new product sales were down midteens in constant currency and down high teens as reported. As Mike stated, the decline in Enterprise Solutions' new product sales is mainly a result of headwinds from the renewal portfolio and smaller transaction sizes.
Services' revenue during the quarter decreased 2%. As we previously stated, the primary driver of the decline is due to us deemphasizing non-core government services subcontracting engagement that are not directly related to our software sales. We are refocusing on Services engagements that drive new product sales. As we outlined over the last 2 quarters, we currently expect professional Services revenue to decrease more than the total revenue during fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014.
Current revenue backlog was down 2%. As I said before, consistent year-over-year growth in current revenue backlog is one of the indicators of future revenue growth. Current revenue backlog will likely grow when we demonstrate multiple quarters of new sales growth, while maintaining a low-90s renewal rate.
Q3 non-GAAP operating margin is 38% and GAAP operating margin was 29%. Our segment operating margins were 58% for Mainframe Solutions, 14% for Enterprise Solutions and 6% for Services.
Our Q3 non-GAAP tax rate was 26% and our GAAP tax rate was 29%. Q3 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.67, down 16% year-over-year. The decrease in our non-GAAP EPS is mainly driven by a lower non-GAAP tax rate in fiscal 2014. GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.49, flat year-over-year.
Our Q3 CFFO was $313 million. Single-installment payments were $88 million and down year-over-year. We ended Q3 with approximately $1.29 billion in net cash. During the third quarter, we repurchased $75 million of shares, paid $111 million in dividends and repaid $502 million in debt. Additionally, we have entered into an agreement to repurchase an additional $75 million in CA shares during Q4. Including the $75 million Q4 repurchase agreement, we will have repurchased $200 million shares in fiscal 2015. We will have $800 million remaining of our original $1 billion share repurchase program at March 31, 2015.
Turning to guidance. Updated guidance is based upon exchange rates on the last day of the preceding quarter which was December 31, 2014. This includes a partial hedge of operating income.
We expect currency to have a negative impact on our full-year revenue approximately 2% and a negative impact on our fourth quarter revenue growth of approximately 4% at December 31 rates. Total revenue is still expected to be in the range of negative 2% to negative 1% in constant currency. This translates to reported revenue of $4.26 billion to $4.3 billion.
Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share growth is expected to be in the range of minus 17% to minus 14% in constant currency, an increase from our prior guidance of minus 20% to minus 18%, mainly due to the impact from lower tax rate. This reflects an approximate 18% headwind from taxes based upon a 28% tax rate. This translates to reported non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.45 to $2.52.
GAAP diluted earnings per share growth is expected to be in the range of minus 7% to minus 4% in constant currency, an increase from our prior guidance of minus 12% to minus 8%. This translates to reported GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.76 to $1.83.
Cash flow from operations are still expected to increase 5% to 12% in constant currency. This translates to reported cash flow from operations of $1 billion to $1.07 billion. The guidance does not include the effect of any future material acquisitions.
Underlying this guidance, we expect our non-GAAP tax rate to be 28%, which is down from our previous expectation of 30%. We still expect a full year GAAP operating margin of 27% and a full year non-GAAP operating margin of 37%. At the end of the year, we expect approximately 436 million shares outstanding and a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 440 million shares.
For modeling purposes, we would like to provide you with our initial expectation for fiscal year 2016. We expect our 2016 renewal portfolio to increase compared to the fiscal 2015. Given our modest expectation for Enterprise Solutions and a revenue growth headwind for Mainframe Solutions, we do not expect fiscal 2016 revenue to grow in constant currency. We expect a similar operating margin in fiscal 2016 as in 2015.
And now I will turn the call back over to Jonathan, and we will take your questions."

But if I was to focus on just 3 things, first, I'd go to products. If you're going to be a software company, you have to have great innovative products. And if you look at what we've done over the last 2 years and the trajectory that we're on, we're putting some great products out into the market. A great example of that is APM. APM 2 years ago, we lost share. This is last quarter. We're up over 20%, and this is a great effort by our team that really put a lot of innovation to that product both on user interface, the capability and the lowering the cost of sales. And that's been an inspiration for all the engineers in CA. API management, the world is definitely moving to an API-enabled world. We'd really think that this is going to be a software-enabled economy. This is the glue that puts all of these disparate applications together. That product is selling extraordinarily well. Where I'll put us in the top quartile of all competitors in that space. DevOps, a lot of innovation going into DevOps. I would argue that we are the market leader in that space, really driving what we could do with virtualization in a DevOps environment. We just launched another net new product and mobile app analytics. I think we're the only company that can go directly from a mobile application, all the way through all of the middleware, into the Mainframe or the cloud. And we've got a very, very strong Mainframe group. This group has done a tremendous amount of work over the last 2 years. They've put new innovation, I think, once again, we're one of the only companies still investing in the Mainframe. The quality of our Mainframe applications has gone up tremendously. Last quarter, we did -- all of our releases had 0 defects, which I think was the first time in our history, and really makes a statement to the quality we put in place in the last couple of years. On the sales, we're in Q4, and as we're thinking about Q4 and going into 2016, I think it's the first time ever there's no structural changes going on in the sales organization. I think the restructuring that we did last year is absolutely working, and we're only going to be adding fuel to that already existing structure, not changing reporting structures and what people are working on our accounts that they're covering in a material way. And the way I look at this is it's showing up in the numbers. Now, 2 years ago, the Enterprise segment was shrinking by 20%. After one year of being here, we cut that in half. And if you take a look at where we'll end this year, Enterprise segment will be down to flat, which puts us in a position with net new products coming out in the June time frame that we'll be able to get this flywheel to move. And at the end of the day, it really comes down to the team. We put a team in place here that is really driving innovation, execution and speed. They put CA first. They're very, very competitive and they're doing it the right way, which means doing the right thing. So we're not -- put all that stuff together, it gives me confidence that we're definitely on the right path. And when I look at the numbers and the trajectory of the things that our -- paying important to, our innovative new products, is ESTG growing, is the Mainframe a stable component of our ecosystem, it gives me confidence that we're on the right track. A long answer, but thank you for a great question."

As we're getting into these sales cycle, I don't think it's different for anybody. The technical buyer wants to try and buy. And we have an opportunity to do what we do a mezzanine transaction, get it in, make sure it works, they usually do that now before they go for the big transaction. I think you have to be very careful to be an LS 100 [ph] these days. That's how you get really awkward and jump the bookings quarter-to-quarter. What we've been training our sales force to do is get in there, we'll very confident in our products, we're more than happy to do try and buy, we're more than happy to do a proof of concept. And in the end, we take a look at over a 12 to 18-month time frame, we think it's going to shorten sales cycles rather than a long elongate them. Having a very long sales cycle for a very large transaction compared to having 8 to 10 transactions going on at the same time, where the customer sees the true value for product, we just think that's the way the industry is moving and you're seeing some of that transition happen. It's been happening all year long. So I don't see anything systemic. I like the North American market. I think we feel very good about security. That portfolio is very competitive, and we see a lot of need for security. I love what we're doing in DevOps because I think as customers start building applications, especially custom applications for mobile, I think we're very well positioned for that. And then when you take a look at our management cloud, everybody wants to understand where these transactions are. Is it the network that's down? Is that the application that down? Is it the hardware that's down? We're one of the few companies that can monitor that scale across multiplatform. So I feel pretty good about those problems being solved in North America. Europe was very strong. Once again, 3 quarters in a row Europe's been very strong. We definitely over performed in Asia this quarter, so it's a very happy with that. The big area that we are a little bit surprised about is how poorly Latin America did for this last quarter, and we're taking a look at that from an economic perspective as well as from an execution perspective."

This market is changing so quickly, customers are so demanding that you have to have your innovation thinking cap on.

I think customers are getting very careful about Mainframe purchases especially maintenance. If you can't show in a maintenance cycle that you've actually put some sweat equity into adding value to existing code, I think you're getting a tremendous amount of pushback from customers. So that's why in my opening remarks I talked about the Mainframe and I haven't let them off the hook in any way, shape or form on innovation. And every new release has got to have something in there that is better than the previous release, whether it be user interface, the amount of mips it uses, whether it's ease in use of that application adjustment new SKUs, coupled with features that have been on the box for a while with respect to customers. So I think if you do that, we've seen a lot of stability in our maintenance pricing, and I think our customer satisfaction just last quarter was the highest in the history of CA. So I like the imagery of that. I like the feel of that business. Now I do think we have some more opportunity with what's going on with the announcement of the Z System coming from IBM. IBM, we participate in the relationship with them in 3 ways. They are a great partner for us in the systems integrators side. They are a great partner for us with respect to the hardware side. They share a lot of data with us with what we're doing in the product road map. They want that platform to be as powerful as possible, and they encourage companies like CA to write software for that platform. And then, of course, we do build out on the software side. So when I took a look at the whole relationship and we take a look at their investment am I think we spent $1 billion over the last 5 years. I think that's net good for us because at the end of the day, customers are going to want to have choice. There are certain customer segments that we like dealing with CA, and they could picked any vendor they wanted on the Mainframe. They standardized on us and they want us to invest. And I think that, that's -- the fact that IBM has made that platform once again relevant, I think him as a good showing for us in our Mainframe segment. Now Rich spent a lot of time on pricing and a lot of the maintenance contract, maybe he can give some contextual information, Rich?"

As far as the Z box, I think it will benefit is over time. It helps our entire ecosystem, as Mike said with a total cost of computing driving that down. The fact that Z Linux will play a bigger and bigger part of that, we have a lot of products on the distributed side that, that is a bit and we're really the only vendor with IBM that have a strong Linux and strong Mainframe.

During the third quarter, we saw further evidence of the strategy we've put in place is beginning to yield results. While total third quarter new sales declined approximately 10% year-over-year, this was mainly the result of a headwind from the timing of our renewal portfolio, which was down in the mid-30% range year-over-year. As a reminder, we faced a tough year-over-year comparison from a $300 million-plus transaction with a system integrator that closed in the third quarter of fiscal 2014. As we have said in the past, a large percentage of our new sales are still attached to renewal opportunities.
Within Enterprise Solutions, we are beginning to see success in our strategy to seed accounts with smaller deals through the value of our software and expand our footprint with follow-on transactions. An impact from the smaller transaction size is near-term headwinds to the Enterprise Solution new sales growth. However, while our enterprise new sales were below our expectations during the quarter, we are seeing a higher volume of transactions both during the quarter and year-to-date in our growth product solutions. This is creating beachheads with our named accounts, which is leading to additional follow-on pipeline for many of these solutions.
Turning to mainframe. Our mainframe new sales grew in the low single digits year-over-year. Their performance was driven by an increased demand for Mainframe Solutions that leveraged the existing data and logic residing on the mainframe to develop mobile and web-based applications. Additionally, we are enhancing our current application development portfolio to address larger mainframe-to-mobile development market, which is providing us new opportunities to expand our footprint within our install base. In the fourth quarter, we expect the renewal portfolio to be up in the 20% range year-over-year and total new sales to increase at least in the mid-single digits year-over-year. I am confident we're on our way to achieving our medium-term goals.
Across every industry, business models are being transformed by software, specifically by interconnected applications. As software applications become the vital component of a global economic supply chain, and the expectations of applications speed to market accelerate, brand loyalty can be attained or lost within seconds. This makes the quality of software development more critical today than ever.
Our solutions enable enterprises to unlock the opportunities of this Application Economy, where the software is the competitive differentiator in application development is the engine of innovation. We are one of the few software providers that can deliver an integrated set of solutions at scale across multiple platforms to help plan, develop, manage and secure applications. Let me provide you with more insight into the progress we're making towards our strategy to deliver differentiated solutions, improve sales execution and increase our velocity.
First, developing differentiated solutions in our 3 product pillars of Management Cloud, DevOps and security is the foundation of our strategy. In order to be a leader in the next generation of software, innovation must be the lifeblood of our company. Over the last 2 years, we have dramatically improved the efficiency of our development organization. This has allowed us to redeploy resources to focus areas such as improving the user experience and the time to value of our existing solutions, as well as bringing new products to market. An example that touches upon each one of these focus areas is within our DevOps. Following the successful release of CA APM 9.7, this quarter, we launched our mobile application analytics solution. This solution provides analytics into the user experience of mobile apps and integrates with our flagship CA APM product to provide end-to-end transaction monitoring. We are already seeing early traction with the product, as demonstrated by a win at a large U.S.-based telco that will leverage CA mobile app analytics and CA APM to monitor transactions from tablets in its local stores all the way back to its data center.
Over the last 2 years, through the hard work of the APM team, our APM business has regained momentum in the market. This is evidenced by our year-to-date double-digit year-over-year growth in APM new sales and APM revenue growth returning to industry rates. 
Our security group is one of the businesses driving differentiated product development. The frequency and severity of breaches we have all seen over the course of 2014 are threatening the enterprises like never before. The marketplace is looking to software firms like CA to provide new approaches to protect their users and data. We are making investments on multiple fronts to ensure organizations can protect themselves against attacks initiated through compromised identities. One example of this is an investment in our latest release of CA Advanced Authentication. Malicious hackers often use stolen or compromised identities to gain access to applications. Our latest release of CA Advanced Authentication uses real-time analytics such as the location and IP addresses to assess whether a user is who they claim to be. Simultaneously, it ensures that the password that the legitimate employee and customers use to gain access to corporate systems are always secure and unusable if compromised.
As we stated last quarter, we are also reallocating incremental investments towards API management. APIs are the next-generation middleware of how customers are connecting hybrid cloud applications and infrastructure. We are the only vendor that can provide API management solution at the scale and security levels needed for the massive amount of data traversing these newly-created digital platforms. As an example, a large consumer electronics provider chose our API management solution for its newly architected e-commerce platform following a failure on Cyber Monday of its previous e-commerce platform. We have the ability to triple our revenue run rate with this customer over the next 12 months with our API management solutions. We see many other API management opportunities like this emerging in the marketplace. 
In addition, to the development of our core product areas, we are also redeploying our investment in 2 adjacent capacities. First, we are improving the integration with our current product set and with third-party providers. For example, we are tightening the integration between our Application Performance Management and Infrastructure Management solutions. As software becomes that underlie supply chain of every organization, any failure in that delivery can no longer be examined independently for each specific computing layer. Instead, the service quality must be scrutinized in the context of the entire end-to-end transaction, from the mobile interface through the application server and back to the database on the mainframe or in the cloud. Once again, we are one of few software providers that can provide that level of end-to-end visibility and scale.
Secondly, as part of the reallocation of our software development efforts, we are focusing on what customers will need in the future. We see 3 disruptive forces emerging in the market that will impact software development and we are focused on providing solutions in these areas. The first disruptive force is the unwired enterprise. How will customers manage the complexity of the billions of IP-connected devices with multiple operating systems on multiple standards which will proliferate their IT infrastructure. We have a deep history in managing network-connected devices and its natural extension of our capabilities to solve this emerging challenge.
This leads us to the second emerging market. As these IP-connected devices create a massive amount of ambient data, both structured and unstructured coming from new sources such as sensors and social networks, enterprise is under tremendous pressure to securely combine their sensitive data with less risky social data and arrive at a revenue-generating business outcome. Given our expertise in managing data across multiple platforms, we are working on solutions to help manage the movement of and access to this data and transform it into usable information that delivers competitive advantage to our customers.
For the third emerging opportunity, API-assembled applications, we already have a strong presence in core API management. We are leveraging our leadership in API management to help customers create and deploy interconnected applications to unlock the potential of their APIs and create new revenue opportunities.
In these 3 emerging markets, we are not making investments haphazardly or with a ""win at all cost"" mentality. We are taking a systematic approach where when we fail, we will fail early; and when we win, we will have a plan in place to accelerate that product's escape velocity.
Turning now to our second major component of our strategy, I will walk you through how we are improving marketing and sales executions. We continue to improve our brand recognition in the marketplace. At CA World, our global user conference held in November, we showcased our expanding portfolio of solutions to thousands of customers and partners. Overall feedback from customers, prospects and analysts noted the emergence of a new CA with a clear focus on the challenges and opportunities faced by enterprises in a world increasingly driven by software.
Turning to sales execution. We are continuing to see evidence that our strategy of separating platinum accounts from our named and growth accounts, as well as having sales specialized by product discipline, is paying off. As I stated earlier, while new sales in the quarter declined on a year-over-year basis, this was mainly due to a tough year-over-year compare in our renewal portfolio. We are seeing 3 healthy trends in our sales execution, which reinforce my confidence in the ability to grow new sales over the medium term. First, with our platinum accounts. Our third quarter renewal rates and attach rates were in line with historical trends. Additionally, we are seeing success with platinum reps truly partnering with our customers to understand their IT challenges. For example, our EMEA platinum team had a Service Virtualization win with a large multinational bank that is in the midst of a digital transformation. Longer term, this customer expects only 5% of banking interactions to occur in a physical location, thus making software development crucial to their success. The CA account team is in constant dialogue with the customers to understand how CA can help it along its digital transformation journey. This transaction marks their sixth new transaction with CA over the last 24 months, and they have increased their spending with CA over the last 4 years.
The second observation is, while our named and growth team's new sales performance was below plan, the volume of their transactions in our growth products grew year-over-year. As we increase the number of transactions, we are seeing a shortening of our sales cycles, as the technical aspect of the buying process is already proven. As a result, the quality of that pipeline has improved.
Let me provide a couple of examples. First, our Service Virtualization solution landed a win with a Fortune 500 multinational restaurant chain that had not bought a new product from CA in over 7 years. The initial transaction was just $250,000 and is focused on a specific development project. This solution alone has the ability to expand into many additional transactions over the next 24 months. Furthermore, this customer could have a greater than $5 million revenue run rate with us through cross-sell opportunities. We have identified many other accounts that have this potential.
And the second example, we forged a partnership with a leading software virtualization vendor to help build their internal DevOps strategy. They are leveraging our Service Virtualization solution to improve the speed at which they can develop and test against third-party SaaS applications as well as their own internal IT services. Again, this is an initial transaction through which there is an opportunity to significantly expand our wallet share over the next year.
The final sales highlight I'll touch upon is with respect to the renewal portfolio. In the fourth quarter, our renewal portfolio is expected to increase in the 20% range year-over-year. As such, we are expecting at least mid-single-digit year-over-year total new sales growth, taking into account the tailwind from the sales opportunities related to renewals, plus the quality of the pipelines from our named account team.
Let me now speak to velocity. In order for us to be a modern software company, we need to deliver innovation to our customers rapidly, seamlessly and predictively. This requires a culture of empowerment where our professionals have the autonomy to drive their work forward and are held accountable for progress and results. How we get things done is as important as what that work is, and we are highly focused on evolving our internal culture so we can operate at or above market velocity. On balance, in the third quarter, we made progress against achieving our medium-term goals. We are building CA with a focus on innovation, execution and speed to compete and win in one of the fastest and most exciting industries in the world. However, we are doing so with financial discipline to preserve and enhance shareholder value over the long term.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Rich to review our third quarter financials and full year guidance. Thank you."

Before we get started with the quarter review, let me remind you that all comparisons are year-over-year and in constant currency unless otherwise indicated. This afternoon, I'm going to focus my comments on the key business drivers and performance indicators for the quarter. The balance of our financial details can be found in our supplemental and press release. 
As many of you are aware, the dollar continues to strengthen against most major currencies, which negatively impacts both our results and guidance. Our Q3 revenue was $1.09 billion and was down 1%; Mainframe was down 1%; Enterprise Solutions was flat; and Services declined 2%.
On as-reported basis, Q3 renewals were down in the high 30% range but in line with our expectations. As Mike stated earlier, in Q3 fiscal 2014, we renewed our 4-year system integrator transaction for over $300 million, which created a tough year-over-year compare for both renewals and new sales this quarter. As we have previously stated, the increase and decrease year-over-year in our renewal bookings can vary on a quarterly basis due to the timing of large transactions.
Q3 total new product and capacity sales were down low teens as reported. This is due mainly to the headwinds from the renewal portfolio. The renewal yield during the quarter was approximately 90%. We continue to expect fiscal 2015 renewals to be down high single digit year-over-year as compared to fiscal 2014 and flat year-over-year excluding the large system integrator renewal that closed in Q3 of fiscal 2014. We expect Q4 renewals to be up in the 20% range year-over-year both in constant currency and as reported.
From a geographic basis during the quarter, we saw continued improvement from our EMEA team sales execution as they grew year-over-year this quarter. This marks the EMEA team's third quarter in a row of performance that was in line with our expectations. We are also seeing good performance in our Asia team. However, North America fell short of our expectations mainly due to smaller transaction sizes. Latin America performance was again below expectations, which we believe is mainly a result of macro-related headwinds.
In our mainframe segment. Mainframe new sales including the product and capacity were up low single digit in constant currency, but down slightly as reported. Mainframe new sales benefited from good capacity sales and growth in new mainframe products. Overall, we expect Our mainframe revenue growth to be flat to down low single digits over the medium term, which we believe is in line with the mainframe market.
Enterprise Solutions' new product sales were down mid-teens in constant currency and down high teens as reported. As Mike stated, the decline in Enterprise Solutions' new product sales is mainly a result of headwinds from the renewal portfolio and smaller transaction sizes.
Services' revenue during the quarter decreased 2%. As we previously stated, the primary driver of the decline is due to us deemphasizing noncore government services subcontracting engagements that are not directly related to our software sales. We are refocusing on Services engagements that drive new product sales. As we outlined over the last 2 quarters, we currently expect professional Services revenue to decrease more than the total revenue during fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014.
Current revenue backlog was down 2%. As I said before, consistent year-over-year growth in current revenue backlog is one of the indicators of future revenue growth. Current revenue backlog will likely grow when we demonstrate multiple quarters of new sales growth, while maintaining a low-90s renewal rate.
Q3 non-GAAP operating margin was 38% and GAAP operating margin was 29%. Our segment operating margins were 58% for Mainframe Solutions, 14% for Enterprise Solutions and 6% for Services.
Our Q3 non-GAAP tax rate was 26% and our GAAP tax rate was 29%. Q3 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.67, down 16% year-over-year. The decrease in our non-GAAP EPS is mainly driven by a lower non-GAAP tax rate in fiscal 2014. GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.49, flat year-over-year.
Our Q3 CFFO was $313 million. Single-installment payments were $88 million and down year-over-year. We ended Q3 with approximately $1.29 billion in net cash. During the third quarter, we repurchased $75 million of shares, paid $111 million in dividends and repaid $502 million in debt. Additionally, we have entered into an agreement to repurchase an additional $75 million in CA shares during Q4. Including the $75 million Q4 repurchase agreement, we will have repurchased $200 million shares in fiscal 2015. We will have $800 million remaining of our original $1 billion share repurchase program at March 31, 2015.
Turning to guidance. Updated guidance is based upon exchange rates on the last day of the preceding quarter which was December 31, 2014. This includes a partial hedge of operating income.
We expect currency to have a negative impact on our full year revenue approximately 2% and a negative impact on our fourth quarter revenue growth of approximately 4% at December 31 rates. Total revenue is still expected to be in the range of negative 2% to negative 1% in constant currency. This translates to reported revenue of $4.26 billion to $4.3 billion.
Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share growth is expected to be in the range of minus 17% to minus 14% in constant currency, an increase from our prior guidance of minus 20% to minus 18%, mainly due to the impact from lower tax rate. This reflects an approximate 18% headwind from taxes based upon a 28% tax rate. This translates to reported non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.45 to $2.52.
GAAP diluted earnings per share growth is expected to be in the range of minus 7% to minus 4% in constant currency, an increase from our prior guidance of minus 12% to minus 8%. This translates to reported GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.76 to $1.83.
Cash flow from operations are still expected to increase 5% to 12% in constant currency. This translates to reported cash flow from operations of $1 billion to $1.07 billion. The guidance does not include the effect of any future material acquisitions.
Underlying this guidance, we expect our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate to be 28%, which is down from our previous expectation of 30%. We still expect a full year GAAP operating margin of 27% and a full year non-GAAP operating margin of 37%. At the end of the year, we expect approximately 436 million shares outstanding and a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 440 million shares.
For modeling purposes, we would like to provide you with our initial expectation for fiscal year 2016. We expect our 2016 renewal portfolio to increase compared to the fiscal 2015. Given our modest expectation for Enterprise Solutions and a revenue growth headwind for Mainframe Solutions, we do not expect fiscal 2016 revenue to grow in constant currency. We expect a similar operating margin in fiscal 2016 as in 2015.
And now I will turn the call back over to Jonathan, and we will take your questions."

But if I was to focus on just 3 things, first, I'd go to products. If you're going to be a software company, you have to have great innovative products. And if you look at what we've done over the last 2 years and the trajectory that we're on, we're putting some great products out into the market. A great example of that is APM. APM, 2 years ago, we lost share. This is last quarter. We're up over 20%, and this is a great effort by our team that really put a lot of innovation into that product both on the user interface, the capability and the lowering the cost to sales. And that's been an inspiration for all of the engineers in CA. API management, the world is definitely moving to an API-enabled world. We'd really think that this is going to be a software-enabled economy. This is the glue that puts all of these disparate applications together. That product is selling extraordinarily well, where I put us in the top quartile of all competitors in that space. DevOps, a lot of innovation going into DevOps. I would argue that we are the market leader in that space, really driving what you can do with virtualization in a DevOps environment. We just launched another net new product and mobile app analytics. I think we're the only company that can go directly from a mobile application, all the way through all the middleware, into the mainframe or the cloud. And we've got a very, very strong mainframe group. This group has done a tremendous amount of work over the last 2 years. They've put new innovation, I think, once again, we're one of the only companies still investing in the mainframe. The quality of our mainframe applications has gone up tremendously. Last quarter, we did -- all of our releases had 0 defects, which I think was the first time in our history, and it really makes a statement to the quality we put in place over the last couple of years. On the sales, we're in Q4, and as we're thinking about Q4 and going into 2016, I think it's the first time ever there's no structural changes going on in the sales organization. I think the restructuring we did last year is absolutely working, and we're only going to be adding fuel to that already existing structure, not changing reporting structures and what people are working on or accounts that they're covering in a material way. And the way I look at this is it's showing up in the numbers. Two years ago, the enterprise segment was shrinking by 20%. After 1 year of being here, we cut that in half. And if you take a look at where we'll end this year, enterprise segment will be down to flat, which puts us in a position with net new products coming out in the June time frame that we'll be able to get this flywheel to move. And at the end of the day, it really comes down to the team. We put a team in place here that is really driving innovation, execution and speed. They put CA first. They're very, very competitive and they're doing it the right way, which means doing the right thing. So we're not -- put all that stuff together, it gives me confidence that we're definitely on the right path. And when I look at the numbers and the trajectory of the things that our -- paying important to, are we innovating new products? Is eSTG growing? Is the mainframe a stable component of our ecosystem? It gives me confidence that we're on the right track. A long answer, but thank you for a great question."

I'm encouraged by the number of that batch we're getting and it kind of goes to John DiFucci's comment where people are looking at CA a little bit differently, which means we're getting into more sales cycles. As we're getting into these sales cycles, I don't think it's different for anybody. The technical buyer wants to try and buy. And if they have an opportunity to do what we I call a mezzanine transaction, get it in, make sure it works, they usually do that now before they go for the big transaction. I think you have to be very careful to be an elephant hunter these days. That's how you get really awkward and jumpy bookings quarter-to-quarter. What we've been training our sales force to do is get in there, we're very confident in our products, we're more than happy to do try and buy, we're more than happy to do a proof of concept. And in the end, we think, if you take a look at over a 12- to 18-month time frame, we think it's going to shorten sales cycles rather than elongate them. Having a very long sales cycle for a very large transaction compared to having 8 to 10 transactions going on at the same time, where the customer sees the true value of the product, we just think that's the way the industry is moving and you're seeing some of that transition happen. It's been happening all year long. So I don't see anything systemic. I like the North American market. I think we feel very good about security. That portfolio is very competitive, and we see a lot of need for security. I love what we're doing in DevOps because I think as customers start building applications, especially custom applications for mobile, I think we're very well positioned for that. And then when you take a look at our Management Cloud, everybody wants to understand where these transactions are. Is it the network that's down? Is that the application's that down? Is it the hardware that's down? We're one of the few companies that can monitor that at scale across multi-platform. So I feel pretty good about those problems being solved in North America. Europe was very strong. Once again, 3 quarters in a row, Europe's been very strong. We definitely over-performed in Asia this quarter, so I was very happy with that. The big area that we were a little bit surprised about is how poorly Latin America did for this last quarter, and we're taking a look at that from an economic perspective as well as from an execution perspective."

So I think that, that's a systemic challenge that all software companies have to deal with. I think we recognized this 2 years ago and started working our way towards it. But I wouldn't declare victory on it as of yet. Secondly, as it comes down to net new product innovation. This market is changing so quickly, customers are so demanding that you have to have your innovation thinking cap on. You have to imagine the problems that customers are going to have 1 to 2 years out, because it takes an enterprise company to build software at scale at least a year to get it through the development process through the testing process to make sure that it works as promised and at scale.

So when you're taking a look at our API management, you take a look at Service Virtualization, those types of products, those -- all of the higher growth products kind of exhibited that kind of feel. We also had some smaller deals happen in the mid market in the Unified Infrastructure Management, which is exactly what we've been pushing for. We use to only sell that product and that suite of products to some of the biggest customers in the world. The fact that a couple billion dollar companies started to use that product and understand it, and that product comes from a very sophisticated try-and-buy platform with Unified Infrastructure Management Snap.

I think customers are getting very careful about mainframe purchases especially maintenance. If you can't show in a maintenance cycle that you've actually put some real sweat equity into adding value to existing code, I think you're getting a tremendous amount of pushback from customers. So that's why in my opening remarks I talked about the mainframe and I haven't let them off the hook in any way, shape or form on innovation. And every new release has got to have something in there that is better than the previous release, whether it be user interface, the amount of MIPS it uses, whether it's the ease of use of that application or just net new SKUs, coupled with features that have been on the blocks for a while with respect to customers. So I think if you do that, we've seen a lot of stability in our maintenance pricing, and I think our customer satisfaction this last quarter was the highest in the history of CA. So I like the imagery of that. I like the feel of that business. Now I do think we have some more opportunity with what's going on with the announcement of the new z System coming from IBM. IBM, we participate in the relationship with them in 3 ways. They are a great partner for us in the systems integrator side. They are a great partner for us with respect to the hardware side. They share a lot of information with us on what they're doing with their product road map. They want that platform to be as powerful as possible, and they encourage companies like CA to write software for that platform. And then, of course, we duke it out on the software side. So when I take a look at the whole relationship and I take a look at their investment, I think they spent $1 billion over the last 5 years. I think that's net good for us because at the end of the day, customers are going to want to have a choice. There are certain customer segments that really like dealing with CA, and they could have picked any vendor they wanted to on the mainframe. They standardized on us and they want us to invest. And I think that, that's -- the fact that IBM has made that platform once again relevant, I think is a good showing for us in our mainframe segment. Now Rich spends a lot of time on pricing and a lot of the maintenance contracts, maybe he can give us some contextual information. Rich?"

So to have single digit growth on a lighter renewal portfolio is a pretty strong statement of the platform. And then I'd also say we saw a good attach rate and as -- we had a 90-plus percent like normal on the renewal yield, so that says we're not trading off our maintenance stream for that incremental sales. As far as the z box, I think that will really benefit us over time. It helps the entire ecosystem, as Mike said, with the total cost to computing driving that down. The fact that z/Linux will play a bigger and bigger part of that, we have a lot of products on the distributed side that participate, and we're really the only vendor with IBM that have a strong Linux and strong mainframe. And if you read a lot of their prepared remarks, that is becoming a bigger and bigger place for people to consolidate their Linux forms back onto the mainframe and that plays right into our sweet spot."

During the third quarter, we saw further evidence that the strategy we've put in place is beginning to yield results. While total third quarter new sales declined approximately 10% year-over-year, this was mainly the result of a headwind from the timing of our renewal portfolio, which was down in the mid-30% range year-over-year. As a reminder, we faced a tough year-over-year comparison from a $300 million-plus transaction with a system integrator that closed in the third quarter of fiscal 2014. As we have said in the past, a large percentage of our new sales are still attached to renewal opportunities.
Within Enterprise Solutions, we are beginning to see success in our strategy to seed accounts with smaller deals, prove the value of our software and expand our footprint with follow-on transactions. An impact from the smaller transaction size is near-term headwinds to the Enterprise Solution new sales growth. However, while our enterprise new sales were below our expectations during the quarter, we are seeing a higher volume of transactions both during the quarter and year-to-date in our growth product solutions. This is creating beachheads with our named accounts, which is leading to additional follow-on pipeline for many of these solutions.
Turning to Mainframe. Our Mainframe new sales grew in the low-single digits year-over-year. Their performance was driven by an increased demand for Mainframe Solutions that leveraged the existing data and logic residing on the mainframe to develop mobile and web-based applications. Additionally, we are enhancing our current application development portfolio to address larger mainframe-to-mobile development market, which is providing us new opportunities to expand our footprint within our installed base. In the fourth quarter, we expect the renewal portfolio to be up in the 20% range year-over-year and total new sales to increase at least in the mid-single digits year-over-year. I am confident we're on our way to achieving our medium-term goals.
Across every industry, business models are being transformed by software, specifically by interconnected applications. As software applications become the vital component of a global economic supply chain, and the expectations of applications speed to market accelerate, brand loyalty can be attained or lost within seconds. This makes the quality of software development more critical today than ever.
Our solutions enable enterprises to unlock the opportunities of this Application Economy, where the software is the competitive differentiator and application development is the engine of innovation. We are one of the few software providers that can deliver an integrated set of solutions at scale across multiple platforms to help plan, develop, manage and secure applications. Let me provide you with more insight into the progress we're making towards our strategy to deliver differentiated solutions, improve sales execution and increase our velocity.
First, developing differentiated solutions in our 3 product pillars of Management Cloud, DevOps and Security is the foundation of our strategy. In order to be a leader in the next generation of software, innovation must be the lifeblood of our company. Over the last 2 years, we have dramatically improved the efficiency of our development organization. This has allowed us to redeploy resources to focus areas such as improving the user experience and the time to value of our existing solutions, as well as bringing new products to market. An example that touches upon each one of these focus areas is within our DevOps. Following the successful release of CA APM 9.7, this quarter, we launched our mobile application analytics solution. This solution provides analytics into the user experience of mobile apps and integrates with our flagship CA APM product to provide end-to-end transaction monitoring. We are already seeing early traction with the product, as demonstrated by a win at a large U.S.-based telco that will leverage CA mobile app analytics and CA APM to monitor transactions from tablets in its local stores all the way back to its data center.
Over the last 2 years, through the hard work of the APM team, our APM business has regained momentum in the market. This is evidenced by our year-to-date double-digit year-over-year growth in APM new sales and APM revenue growth returning to industry rates. 
Our Security group is one of the businesses driving differentiated product development. The frequency and severity of breaches we have all seen over the course of 2014 are threatening the enterprises like never before. The marketplace is looking to software firms like CA to provide new approaches to protect their users and data. We are making investments on multiple fronts to ensure organizations can protect themselves against attacks initiated through compromised identities. One example of this is an investment in our latest release of CA Advanced Authentication. Malicious hackers often use stolen or compromised identities to gain access to applications. Our latest release of CA Advanced Authentication uses real-time analytics, such as the location and IP addresses, to assess whether a user is who they claim to be. Simultaneously, it ensures that the password that the legitimate employee and customers use to gain access to corporate systems are always secure and unusable if compromised.
As we stated last quarter, we are also reallocating incremental investments towards API management. APIs are the next-generation middleware of how customers are connecting hybrid cloud applications and infrastructure. We are the only vendor that can provide API management solution at the scale and security levels needed for the massive amount of data traversing these newly-created digital platforms. As an example, a large consumer electronics provider chose our API management solution for its newly architected e-commerce platform following a failure on Cyber Monday of its previous e-commerce platform. We have the ability to triple our revenue run rate with this customer over the next 12 months with our API management solutions. We see many other API management opportunities like this emerging in the marketplace. 
In addition to the development of our core product areas, we are also redeploying our investment in 2 adjacent capacities. First, we are improving the integration with our current product set and with third-party providers. For example, we are tightening the integration between our Application Performance Management and Infrastructure Management solutions. As software becomes the underlying supply chain of every organization, any failure in that delivery can no longer be examined independently for each specific computing layer. Instead, the service quality must be scrutinized in the context of the entire end-to-end transaction, from the mobile interface through the application server and back to the database on the mainframe or in the cloud. Once again, we are one of few software providers that can provide that level of end-to-end visibility and scale.
Secondly, as part of the reallocation of our software development efforts, we are focusing on what customers will need in the future. We see 3 disruptive forces emerging in the market that will impact software development, and we are focused on providing solutions in these areas. The first disruptive force is the unwired enterprise. How will customers manage the complexity of the billions of IP-connected devices with multiple operating systems on multiple standards, which will proliferate their IT infrastructure? We have a deep history in managing network-connected devices, and it's a natural extension of our capabilities to solve this emerging challenge.
This leads us to the second emerging market. As these IP-connected devices create a massive amount of ambient data, both structured and unstructured, coming from new sources such as sensors and social networks, enterprise is under tremendous pressure to securely combine their sensitive data with less risky social data and arrive at a revenue-generating business outcome. Given our expertise in managing data across multiple platforms, we are working on solutions to help manage the movement of and access to this data and transform it into usable information that delivers competitive advantage to our customers.
For the third emerging opportunity, API-assembled applications, we already have a strong presence in core API management. We are leveraging our leadership in API management to help customers create and deploy interconnected applications to unlock the potential of their APIs and create new revenue opportunities.
In these 3 emerging markets, we are not making investments haphazardly or with a ""win at all costs"" mentality. We are taking a systematic approach where, when we fail, we will fail early; and when we win, we will have a plan in place to accelerate that product's escape velocity.
Turning now to our second major component of our strategy, I will walk you through how we are improving marketing and sales execution. We continue to improve our brand recognition in the marketplace. At CA World, our global user conference held in November, we showcased our expanding portfolio of solutions to thousands of customers and partners. Overall, feedback from customers, prospects and analysts noted the emergence of a new CA with a clear focus on the challenges and opportunities faced by enterprises in a world increasingly driven by software.
Turning to sales execution. We are continuing to see evidence that our strategy of separating platinum accounts from our named and growth accounts, as well as having sales specialized by product discipline, is paying off. As I stated earlier, while new sales in the quarter declined on a year-over-year basis, this was mainly due to a tough year-over-year compare in our renewal portfolio. We are seeing 3 healthy trends in our sales execution, which reinforce my confidence in the ability to grow new sales over the medium term. First, with our platinum accounts. Our third quarter renewal rates and attach rates were in line with historical trends. Additionally, we are seeing success with platinum reps truly partnering with our customers to understand their IT challenges. For example, our EMEA platinum team had a Service Virtualization win with a large multinational bank that is in the midst of a digital transformation. Longer term, this customer expects only 5% of banking interactions to occur in a physical location, thus making software development crucial to their success. The CA account team is in constant dialogue with the customer to understand how CA can help it along its digital transformation journey. This transaction marks their sixth new transaction with CA over the last 24 months, and they have increased their spending with CA over the last 4 years.
The second observation is, while our named and growth team's new sales performance was below plan, the volume of their transactions in our growth products grew year-over-year. As we increase the number of transactions, we are seeing a shortening of our sales cycles, as the technical aspect of the buying process is already proven. As a result, the quality of that pipeline has improved.
Let me provide a couple of examples. First, our Service Virtualization solution landed a win with a Fortune 500 multinational restaurant chain that had not bought a new product from CA in over 7 years. The initial transaction was just $250,000 and is focused on a specific development project. This solution alone has the ability to expand into many additional transactions over the next 24 months. Furthermore, this customer could have a greater than $5 million revenue run rate with us through cross-sell opportunities. We have identified many other accounts that have this potential.
In the second example, we forged a partnership with a leading software virtualization vendor to help build their internal DevOps strategy. They are leveraging our Service Virtualization solution to improve the speed at which they can develop and test against third-party SaaS applications as well as their own internal IT services. Again, this is an initial transaction through which there is an opportunity to significantly expand our wallet share over the next year.
The final sales highlight I'll touch upon is with respect to the renewal portfolio. In the fourth quarter, our renewal portfolio is expected to increase in the 20% range year-over-year. As such, we are expecting at least mid-single-digit year-over-year total new sales growth, taking into account the tailwind from the sales opportunities related to renewals, plus the quality of the pipelines from our named account team.
Let me now speak to velocity. In order for us to be a modern software company, we need to deliver innovation to our customers rapidly, seamlessly and predictably. This requires a culture of empowerment where our professionals have the autonomy to drive their work forward and are held accountable for progress and results. How we get things done is as important as what that work is, and we are highly focused on evolving our internal culture so we can operate at or above market velocity. On balance, in the third quarter, we made progress against achieving our medium-term goals. We are building CA with a focus on innovation, execution and speed to compete and win in one of the fastest and most exciting industries in the world. However, we are doing so with financial discipline to preserve and enhance shareholder value over the long term.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Rich to review our third quarter financials and full year guidance. Thank you."

Before we get started with the quarter review, let me remind you that all comparisons are year-over-year and in constant currency unless otherwise indicated. This afternoon, I'm going to focus my comments on the key business drivers and performance indicators for the quarter. The balance of our financial details can be found in our supplemental and press release. 
As many of you are aware, the dollar continues to strengthen against most major currencies, which negatively impacts both our results and guidance. Our Q3 revenue was $1.09 billion and was down 1%; Mainframe was down 1%; Enterprise Solutions was flat; and Services declined 2%.
On an as-reported basis, Q3 renewals were down in the high 30% range, but in line with our expectations. As Mike stated earlier, in Q3 fiscal 2014, we renewed our 4-year system integrator transaction for over $300 million, which created a tough year-over-year compare for both renewals and new sales this quarter. As we have previously stated, the increase and decrease year-over-year in our renewal bookings can vary on a quarterly basis due to the timing of large transactions.
Q3 total new product and capacity sales were down low teens as reported. This is due mainly to the headwinds from the renewal portfolio. The renewal yield during the quarter was approximately 90%. We continue to expect fiscal 2015 renewals to be down high-single digit year-over-year as compared to fiscal 2014, and flat year-over-year excluding the large system integrator renewal that closed in Q3 of fiscal 2014. We expect Q4 renewals to be up in the 20% range year-over-year, both in constant currency and as reported.
From a geographic basis during the quarter, we saw continued improvement from our EMEA team sales execution as they grew year-over-year this quarter. This marks the EMEA team's third quarter in a row of performance that was in line with our expectations. We are also seeing good performance in our Asia team. However, North America fell short of our expectations, mainly due to smaller transaction sizes. Latin America performance was again below expectations, which we believe is mainly a result of macro-related headwinds.
In our Mainframe segment, Mainframe new sales, including new product and capacity, were up low-single digit in constant currency, but down slightly as reported. Mainframe new sales benefited from good capacity sales and growth in new Mainframe products. Overall, we expect our Mainframe revenue growth to be flat to down low-single digits over the medium term, which we believe is in line with the mainframe market.
Enterprise Solutions new product sales were down mid-teens in constant currency and down high teens as reported. As Mike stated, the decline in Enterprise Solutions new product sales is mainly a result of headwinds from the renewal portfolio and smaller transaction sizes.
Services revenue during the quarter decreased 2%, as we previously stated. The primary driver of the decline is due to us deemphasizing noncore government services subcontracting engagements that are not directly related to our software sales. We are refocusing on Services engagements that drive new product sales. As we outlined over the last 2 quarters, we currently expect professional Services revenue to decrease more than the total revenue during fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014.
Current revenue backlog was down 2%. As I said before, consistent year-over-year growth in current revenue backlog is one of the indicators of future revenue growth. Current revenue backlog will likely grow when we demonstrate multiple quarters of new sales growth while maintaining a low-90s renewal rate.
Q3 non-GAAP operating margin was 38% and GAAP operating margin was 29%. Our segment operating margins were 58% for Mainframe Solutions, 14% for Enterprise Solutions and 6% for Services.
Our Q3 non-GAAP tax rate was 26% and our GAAP tax rate was 29%. Q3 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.67, down 16% year-over-year. The decrease in our non-GAAP EPS is mainly driven by a lower non-GAAP tax rate in fiscal 2014. GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.49, flat year-over-year.
Our Q3 CFFO was $313 million. Single-installment payments were $88 million and down year-over-year. We ended Q3 with approximately $1.29 billion in net cash. During the third quarter, we repurchased $75 million of shares, paid $111 million in dividends and repaid $502 million in debt. Additionally, we have entered into an agreement to repurchase an additional $75 million in CA shares during Q4. Including the $75 million Q4 repurchase agreement, we will have repurchased $200 million in shares in fiscal 2015. We will have $800 million remaining of our original $1 billion share repurchase program at March 31, 2015.
Turning to guidance. Updated guidance is based upon exchange rates on the last day of the preceding quarter, which was December 31, 2014. This includes a partial hedge of operating income.
We expect currency to have a negative impact on our full year revenue of approximately 2% and a negative impact on our fourth quarter revenue growth of approximately 4% at December 31 rates. Total revenue is still expected to be in the range of negative 2% to negative 1% in constant currency. This translates to reported revenue of $4.26 billion to $4.3 billion.
Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share growth is expected to be in the range of minus 17% to minus 14% in constant currency, an increase from our prior guidance of minus 20% to minus 18%, mainly due to the impact from the lower tax rate. This reflects an approximate 18% headwind from taxes based upon a 28% tax rate. This translates to reported non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.45 to $2.52.
GAAP diluted earnings per share growth is expected to be in the range of minus 7% to minus 4% in constant currency, an increase from our prior guidance of minus 12% to minus 8%. This translates to reported GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.76 to $1.83.
Cash flow from operations are still expected to increase 5% to 12% in constant currency. This translates to reported cash flow from operations of $1 billion to $1.07 billion. The guidance does not include the effect of any future material acquisitions.
Underlying this guidance, we expect our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate to be 28%, which is down from our previous expectation of 30%. We still expect a full year GAAP operating margin of 27% and a full year non-GAAP operating margin of 37%. At the end of the year, we expect approximately 436 million shares outstanding and a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 440 million shares.
For modeling purposes, we would like to provide you with our initial expectation for fiscal year 2016. We expect our 2016 renewal portfolio to increase compared to fiscal 2015. Given our modest expectation for Enterprise Solutions and a revenue growth headwind for Mainframe Solutions, we do not expect fiscal 2016 revenue to grow in constant currency. We expect a similar operating margin in fiscal 2016 as in 2015.
And now I will turn the call back over to Jonathan, and we will take your questions."

But if I was to focus on just 3 things, first, I'd go to products. If you're going to be a software company, you have to have great innovative products. And if you look at what we've done over the last 2 years and the trajectory that we're on, we're putting some great products out into the market. A great example of that is APM. APM, 2 years ago, we lost share. Just this last quarter, we're up over 20%. And this is a great effort by our team that really put a lot of innovation into that product, both on the user interface, the capability and the lowering the cost of sales. And that's been an inspiration for all of the engineers in CA. API management, the world is definitely moving to an API-enabled world. We'd really think that this is going to be a software-enabled economy. This is the glue that puts all of these disparate applications together. That product is selling extraordinarily well, where I put us in the top quartile of all competitors in that space. DevOps, a lot of innovation going into DevOps. I would argue that we are the market leader in that space, really driving what you can do with virtualization in a DevOps environment. We just launched another net new product in mobile app analytics. I think we're the only company that can go directly from a mobile application, all the way through all the middleware, into the mainframe or the cloud. And we've got a very, very strong mainframe group. This group has done a tremendous amount of work over the last 2 years. They've put new innovation -- I think, once again, we're one of the only companies still investing in the mainframe. The quality of our mainframe applications has gone up tremendously. Last quarter, we did -- all of our releases had 0 defects, which I think was the first time in our history, and it really makes a statement to the quality we put in place over the last couple of years. On the sales, we're in Q4, and as we're thinking about Q4 and going into 2016, I think it's the first time ever there's no structural changes going on in the sales organization. I think the restructuring we did last year is absolutely working, and we're only going to be adding fuel to that already existing structure, not changing reporting structures and what people are working on or accounts that they're covering in a material way. And the way I look at this is it's showing up in the numbers. Two years ago, the enterprise segment was shrinking by 20%. After 1 year of being here, we cut that in half. And if you take a look at where we'll end this year, Enterprise segment will be down to flat, which puts us in a position, with net new products coming out in the June time frame, that we'll be able to get this flywheel to move. And at the end of the day, it really comes down to the team. We put a team in place here that is really driving innovation, execution and speed. They put CA first. They're very, very competitive and they're doing it the right way, which means doing the right thing. So when I put all that stuff together, it gives me confidence that we're definitely on the right path. And when I look at the numbers and the trajectory of the things that are -- paying important to, are we innovating new products? Is eSTG growing? Is the mainframe a stable component of our ecosystem? It gives me confidence that we're on the right track. A long answer, but thank you for a great question."

I'm encouraged by the number of at-bats we're getting, and it kind of goes to John DiFucci's comment where people are looking at CA a little bit differently, which means we're getting into more sales cycles. As we're getting into these sales cycles, I don't think it's different for anybody. The technical buyer wants to try and buy. And if they have an opportunity to do what I call a mezzanine transaction, get it in, make sure it works, they usually do that now before they go for the big transaction. I think you have to be very careful to be an elephant hunter these days. That's how you get really awkward and jumpy bookings quarter-to-quarter. What we've been training our sales force to do is get in there, we're very confident in our products, we're more than happy to do try and buy, we're more than happy to do a proof of concept. And in the end, we think, if you take a look at over a 12- to 18-month time frame, we think it's going to shorten sales cycles rather than elongate them. Having a very long sales cycle for a very large transaction compared to having 8 to 10 transactions going on at the same time, where the customer sees the true value of the product, we just think that's the way the industry is moving. And you're seeing some of that transition happen. It's been happening all year long. So I don't see anything systemic. I like the North American market. I think we feel very good about Security. That portfolio is very competitive, and we see a lot of need for security. I love what we're doing in DevOps because I think as customers start building applications, especially custom applications for mobile, I think we're very well positioned for that. And then when you take a look at our Management Cloud, everybody wants to understand where these transactions are. Is it the network that's down? Is it the application that's down? Is it the hardware that's down? We're one of the few companies that can monitor that at scale across multi-platforms. So I feel pretty good about those problems being solved in North America. Europe was very strong. Once again, 3 quarters in a row, Europe's been very strong. We definitely over-performed in Asia this quarter, so I was very happy with that. The big area that we were a little bit surprised about is how poorly Latin America did for this last quarter, and we're taking a look at that from an economic perspective as well as from an execution perspective."

But if you take a look at the way all of our marketing programs run, all of our lead generation programs run, how our sales compensation works, how we're allocating resources, it's really driving to getting the software in the hands of the people that are going to use it so they can see the value and then come in for to the larger purchase. So I think that that's a systemic challenge that all software companies have to deal with. I think we recognized this 2 years ago and started working our way towards it. But I wouldn't declare victory on it as of yet. Secondly, as it comes down to net new product innovation, this market is changing so quickly, customers are so demanding that you have to have your innovation thinking cap on. You have to imagine the problems that customers are going to have 1 to 2 years out, because it takes an enterprise company to build software at scale at least a year to get it through the development process, through the testing process, to make sure that it works as promised and at scale. And so that's something that we're constantly, constantly thinking about. And I think we're in much, much better shape to accomplish that mission today than we were a year ago."

I think customers are getting very careful about mainframe purchases, especially maintenance. If you can't show in a maintenance cycle that you've actually put some real sweat equity into adding value to existing code, I think you're getting a tremendous amount of pushback from customers. So that's why in my opening remarks I talked about the mainframe, and I haven't let them off the hook in any way, shape or form on innovation. And every new release has got to have something in there that is better than the previous release, whether it be user interface, the amount of MIPS it uses, whether it's the ease of use of that application or just net new SKUs, coupled with features that have been on the blocks for a while with respect to customers. So I think if you do that, we've seen a lot of stability in our maintenance pricing, and I think our customer satisfaction this last quarter was the highest in the history of CA. So I like the imagery of that. I like the feel of that business. Now I do think we have some more opportunity with what's going on with the announcement of the new z System coming from IBM. IBM, we participate in a relationship with them in 3 ways. They are a great partner for us in the systems integrator side. They are a great partner for us with respect to the hardware side. They share a lot of information with us on what they're doing with their product road map. They want that platform to be as powerful as possible, and they encourage companies like CA to write software for that platform. And then, of course, we duke it out on the software side. So when I take a look at the whole relationship and I take a look at their investment -- I think they spent $1 billion over the last 5 years -- I think that's net good for us because at the end of the day, customers are going to want to have a choice. There are certain customer segments that really like dealing with CA, and they could have picked any vendor they wanted to on the mainframe. They standardized on us and they want us to invest. And I think that that's -- the fact that IBM has made that platform once again relevant, I think is a good showing for us in our mainframe segment. Now Rich spends a lot of time on pricing in a lot of the maintenance contracts. Maybe he can give us some contextual information. Rich?"

So to have single-digit growth on a lighter renewal portfolio is a pretty strong statement of the platform. And then I'd also say we saw a good attach rate and as -- we had a 90-plus percent, like normal, on the renewal yield, so that says we're not trading off our maintenance stream for that incremental sales. As far as the z box, I think that will really benefit us over time. It helps the entire ecosystem, as Mike said, with the total cost to computing driving that down. The fact that z/Linux will play a bigger and bigger part of that, we have a lot of products on the distributed side that participate, and we're really the only vendor with IBM that have a strong Linux and strong mainframe. And if you read a lot of their prepared remarks, that is becoming a bigger and bigger place for people to consolidate their Linux farms back onto the mainframe, and that plays right into our sweet spot."

And we are definitely one of the top players in the Nordics, but it's also a relatively small market."

During the third quarter, we saw further evidence that the strategy we've put in place is beginning to yield results. While total third quarter new sales declined approximately 10% year-over-year, this was mainly the result of a headwind from the timing of our renewal portfolio, which was down in the mid-30% range year-over-year. As a reminder, we faced a tough year-over-year comparison from a $300 million-plus transaction with a system integrator that closed in the third quarter of fiscal 2014. As we have said in the past, a large percentage of our new sales are still attached to renewal opportunities.
Within Enterprise Solutions, we are beginning to see success in our strategy to seed accounts with smaller deals, prove the value of our software and expand our footprint with follow-on transactions. An impact from the smaller transaction size is near-term headwinds to the Enterprise Solution new sales growth. However, while our enterprise new sales were below our expectations during the quarter, we are seeing a higher volume of transactions both during the quarter and year-to-date in our growth product solutions. This is creating beachheads with our named accounts, which is leading to additional follow-on pipeline for many of these solutions.
Turning to Mainframe. Our Mainframe new sales grew in the low-single digits year-over-year. Their performance was driven by an increased demand for Mainframe Solutions that leveraged the existing data and logic residing on the mainframe to develop mobile and web-based applications. Additionally, we are enhancing our current application development portfolio to address larger mainframe-to-mobile development market, which is providing us new opportunities to expand our footprint within our installed base. In the fourth quarter, we expect the renewal portfolio to be up in the 20% range year-over-year and total new sales to increase at least in the mid-single digits year-over-year. I am confident we're on our way to achieving our medium-term goals.
Across every industry, business models are being transformed by software, specifically by interconnected applications. As software applications become the vital component of a global economic supply chain, and the expectations of applications speed to market accelerate, brand loyalty can be attained or lost within seconds. This makes the quality of software development more critical today than ever.
Our solutions enable enterprises to unlock the opportunities of this Application Economy, where the software is the competitive differentiator and application development is the engine of innovation. We are one of the few software providers that can deliver an integrated set of solutions at scale across multiple platforms to help plan, develop, manage and secure applications. Let me provide you with more insight into the progress we're making towards our strategy to deliver differentiated solutions, improve sales execution and increase our velocity.
First, developing differentiated solutions in our 3 product pillars of Management Cloud, DevOps and Security is the foundation of our strategy. In order to be a leader in the next generation of software, innovation must be the lifeblood of our company. Over the last 2 years, we have dramatically improved the efficiency of our development organization. This has allowed us to redeploy resources to focus areas such as improving the user experience and the time to value of our existing solutions, as well as bringing new products to market. An example that touches upon each one of these focus areas is within our DevOps. Following the successful release of CA APM 9.7, this quarter, we launched our mobile application analytics solution. This solution provides analytics into the user experience of mobile apps and integrates with our flagship CA APM product to provide end-to-end transaction monitoring. We are already seeing early traction with the product, as demonstrated by a win at a large U.S.-based telco that will leverage CA mobile app analytics and CA APM to monitor transactions from tablets in its local stores all the way back to its data center.
Over the last 2 years, through the hard work of the APM team, our APM business has regained momentum in the market. This is evident by our year-to-date double-digit year-over-year growth in APM new sales and APM revenue growth returning to industry rates. 
Our Security group is one of the businesses driving differentiated product development. The frequency and severity of breaches we have all seen over the course of 2014 are threatening the enterprises like never before. The marketplace is looking to software firms like CA to provide new approaches to protect their users and data. We are making investments on multiple fronts to ensure organizations can protect themselves against attacks initiated through compromised identities. One example of this is an investment in our latest release of CA Advanced Authentication. Malicious hackers often use stolen or compromised identities to gain access to applications. Our latest release of CA Advanced Authentication uses real-time analytics, such as the location and IP addresses, to assess whether a user is who they claim to be. Simultaneously, it ensures that the password that the legitimate employee and customers use to gain access to corporate systems are always secure and unusable if compromised.
As we stated last quarter, we are also reallocating incremental investments towards API management. APIs are the next-generation middleware of how customers are connecting hybrid cloud applications and infrastructure. We are the only vendor that can provide API management solution at the scale and security levels needed for the massive amount of data traversing these newly-created digital platforms. As an example, a large consumer electronics provider chose our API management solution for its newly architected e-commerce platform following a failure on Cyber Monday of its previous e-commerce platform. We have the ability to triple our revenue run rate with this customer over the next 12 months with our API management solutions. We see many other API management opportunities like this emerging in the marketplace. 
In addition to the development of our core product areas, we are also redeploying our investment in 2 adjacent capacities. First, we are improving the integration with our current product set and with third-party providers. For example, we are tightening the integration between our Application Performance Management and Infrastructure Management solutions. As software becomes the underlying supply chain of every organization, any failure in that delivery can no longer be examined independently for each specific computing layer. Instead, the service quality must be scrutinized in the context of the entire end-to-end transaction, from the mobile interface through the application server and back to the database on the mainframe or in the cloud. Once again, we are one of few software providers that can provide that level of end-to-end visibility and scale.
Secondly, as part of the reallocation of our software development efforts, we are focusing on what customers will need in the future. We see 3 disruptive forces emerging in the market that will impact software development, and we are focused on providing solutions in these areas. The first disruptive force is the unwired enterprise. How will customers manage the complexity of the billions of IP-connected devices with multiple operating systems on multiple standards, which will proliferate their IT infrastructure? We have a deep history in managing network-connected devices, and it's a natural extension of our capabilities to solve this emerging challenge.
This leads us to the second emerging market. As these IP-connected devices create a massive amount of ambient data, both structured and unstructured, coming from new sources such as sensors and social networks, enterprise is under tremendous pressure to securely combine their sensitive data with less risky social data and arrive at a revenue-generating business outcome. Given our expertise in managing data across multiple platforms, we are working on solutions to help manage the movement of and access to this data and transform it into usable information that delivers competitive advantage to our customers.
For the third emerging opportunity, API-assembled applications, we already have a strong presence in core API management. We are leveraging our leadership in API management to help customers create and deploy interconnected applications to unlock the potential of their APIs and create new revenue opportunities.
In these 3 emerging markets, we are not making investments haphazardly or with a ""win at all costs"" mentality. We are taking a systematic approach where, when we fail, we will fail early; and when we win, we will have a plan in place to accelerate that product's escape velocity.
Turning now to our second major component of our strategy, I will walk you through how we are improving marketing and sales execution. We continue to improve our brand recognition in the marketplace. At CA World, our global user conference held in November, we showcased our expanding portfolio of solutions to thousands of customers and partners. Overall, feedback from customers, prospects and analysts noted the emergence of a new CA with a clear focus on the challenges and opportunities faced by enterprises in a world increasingly driven by software.
Turning to sales execution. We are continuing to see evidence that our strategy of separating platinum accounts from our named and growth accounts, as well as having sales specialized by product discipline, is paying off. As I stated earlier, while new sales in the quarter declined on a year-over-year basis, this was mainly due to a tough year-over-year compare in our renewal portfolio. We are seeing 3 healthy trends in our sales execution, which reinforce my confidence in the ability to grow new sales over the medium term. First, with our platinum accounts. Our third quarter renewal rates and attach rates were in line with historical trends. Additionally, we are seeing success with platinum reps truly partnering with our customers to understand their IT challenges. For example, our EMEA platinum team had a Service Virtualization win with a large multinational bank that is in the midst of a digital transformation. Longer term, this customer expects only 5% of banking interactions to occur in a physical location, thus making software development crucial to their success. The CA account team is in constant dialogue with the customer to understand how CA can help it along its digital transformation journey. This transaction marks their sixth new transaction with CA over the last 24 months, and they have increased their spending with CA over the last 4 years.
The second observation is, while our named and growth team's new sales performance was below plan, the volume of their transactions in our growth products grew year-over-year. As we increase the number of transactions, we are seeing a shortening of our sales cycles, as the technical aspect of the buying process is already proven. As a result, the quality of that pipeline has improved.
Let me provide a couple of examples. First, our Service Virtualization solution landed a win with a Fortune 500 multinational restaurant chain that had not bought a new product from CA in over 7 years. The initial transaction was just $250,000 and is focused on a specific development project. This solution alone has the ability to expand into many additional transactions over the next 24 months. Furthermore, this customer could have a greater than $5 million revenue run rate with us through cross-sell opportunities. We have identified other accounts that have this potential.
In the second example, we forged a partnership with a leading software virtualization vendor to help build their internal DevOps strategy. They are leveraging our Service Virtualization solution to improve the speed at which they can develop and test against third-party SaaS applications as well as their own internal IT services. Again, this is an initial transaction through which there is an opportunity to significantly expand our wallet share over the next year.
The final sales highlight I'll touch upon is with respect to the renewal portfolio. In the fourth quarter, our renewal portfolio is expected to increase in the 20% range year-over-year. As such, we are expecting at least mid-single-digit year-over-year total new sales growth, taking into account the tailwind from the sales opportunities related to renewals, plus the quality of the pipelines from our named account team.
Let me now speak to velocity. In order for us to be a modern software company, we need to deliver innovation to our customers rapidly, seamlessly and predictably. This requires a culture of empowerment where our professionals have the autonomy to drive their work forward and are held accountable for progress and results. How we get things done is as important as what that work is, and we are highly focused on evolving our internal culture so we can operate at or above market velocity. On balance, in the third quarter, we made progress against achieving our medium-term goals. We are building CA with a focus on innovation, execution and speed to compete and win in one of the fastest and most exciting industries in the world. However, we are doing so with financial discipline to preserve and enhance shareholder value over the long term.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Rich to review our third quarter financials and full year guidance. Thank you."

Before we get started with the quarter review, let me remind you that all comparisons are year-over-year and in constant currency unless otherwise indicated. This afternoon, I'm going to focus my comments on the key business drivers and performance indicators for the quarter. The balance of our financial details can be found in our supplemental and press release. 
As many of you are aware, the dollar continues to strengthen against most major currencies, which negatively impacts both our results and guidance. Our Q3 revenue was $1.09 billion and was down 1%; Mainframe was down 1%; Enterprise Solutions was flat; and Services declined 2%.
On an as-reported basis, Q3 renewals were down in the high 30% range, but in line with our expectations. As Mike stated earlier, in Q3 fiscal 2014, we renewed our 4-year system integrator transaction for over $300 million, which created a tough year-over-year compare for both renewals and new sales this quarter. As we have previously stated, the increase and decrease year-over-year in our renewal bookings can vary on a quarterly basis due to the timing of large transactions.
Q3 total new product and capacity sales were down low teens as reported. This is due mainly to the headwinds from the renewal portfolio. The renewal yield during the quarter was approximately 90%. We continue to expect fiscal 2015 renewals to be down high-single digit year-over-year as compared to fiscal 2014, and flat year-over-year excluding the large system integrator renewal that closed in Q3 of fiscal 2014. We expect Q4 renewals to be up in the 20% range year-over-year, both in constant currency and as reported.
From a geographic basis during the quarter, we saw continued improvement from our EMEA team sales execution as they grew year-over-year this quarter. This marks the EMEA team's third quarter in a row of performance that was in line with our expectations. We are also seeing good performance in our Asia team. However, North America fell short of our expectations, mainly due to smaller transaction sizes. Latin America performance was again below expectations, which we believe is mainly a result of macro-related headwinds.
In our Mainframe segment, Mainframe new sales, including new product and capacity, were up low-single digit in constant currency, but down slightly as reported. Mainframe new sales benefited from good capacity sales and growth in new Mainframe products. Overall, we expect our Mainframe revenue growth to be flat to down low-single digits over the medium term, which we believe is in line with the mainframe market.
Enterprise Solutions new product sales were down mid-teens in constant currency and down high teens as reported. As Mike stated, the decline in Enterprise Solutions new product sales is mainly a result of headwinds from the renewal portfolio and smaller transaction sizes.
Services revenue during the quarter decreased 2%, as we previously stated. The primary driver of the decline is due to us deemphasizing noncore government services subcontracting engagements that are not directly related to our software sales. We are refocusing on Services engagements that drive new product sales. As we outlined over the last 2 quarters, we currently expect professional Services revenue to decrease more than the total revenue during fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014.
Current revenue backlog was down 2%. As I said before, consistent year-over-year growth in current revenue backlog is one of the indicators of future revenue growth. Current revenue backlog will likely grow when we demonstrate multiple quarters of new sales growth while maintaining a low-90s renewal rate.
Q3 non-GAAP operating margin was 38% and GAAP operating margin was 29%. Our segment operating margins were 58% for Mainframe Solutions, 14% for Enterprise Solutions and 6% for Services.
Our Q3 non-GAAP tax rate was 26% and our GAAP tax rate was 29%. Q3 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.67, down 16% year-over-year. The decrease in our non-GAAP EPS is mainly driven by a lower non-GAAP tax rate in fiscal 2014. GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.49, flat year-over-year.
Our Q3 CFFO was $313 million. Single-installment payments were $88 million and down year-over-year. We ended Q3 with approximately $1.29 billion in net cash. During the third quarter, we repurchased $75 million of shares, paid $111 million in dividends and repaid $502 million in debt. Additionally, we have entered into an agreement to repurchase an additional $75 million in CA shares during Q4. Including the $75 million Q4 repurchase agreement, we will have repurchased $200 million in shares in fiscal 2015. We will have $800 million remaining of our original $1 billion share repurchase program at March 31, 2015.
Turning to guidance. Updated guidance is based upon exchange rates on the last day of the preceding quarter, which was December 31, 2014. This includes a partial hedge of operating income.
We expect currency to have a negative impact on our full year revenue of approximately 2% and a negative impact on our fourth quarter revenue growth of approximately 4% at December 31 rates. Total revenue is still expected to be in the range of negative 2% to negative 1% in constant currency. This translates to reported revenue of $4.26 billion to $4.3 billion.
Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share growth is expected to be in the range of minus 17% to minus 14% in constant currency, an increase from our prior guidance of minus 20% to minus 18%, mainly due to the impact from the lower tax rate. This reflects an approximate 18% headwind from taxes based upon a 28% tax rate. This translates to reported non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.45 to $2.52.
GAAP diluted earnings per share growth is expected to be in the range of minus 7% to minus 4% in constant currency, an increase from our prior guidance of minus 12% to minus 8%. This translates to reported GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.76 to $1.83.
Cash flow from operations are still expected to increase 5% to 12% in constant currency. This translates to reported cash flow from operations of $1 billion to $1.07 billion. The guidance does not include the effect of any future material acquisitions.
Underlying this guidance, we expect our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate to be 28%, which is down from our previous expectation of 30%. We still expect a full year GAAP operating margin of 27% and a full year non-GAAP operating margin of 37%. At the end of the year, we expect approximately 436 million shares outstanding and a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 440 million shares.
For modeling purposes, we would like to provide you with our initial expectation for fiscal year 2016. We expect our 2016 renewal portfolio to increase compared to fiscal 2015. Given our modest expectation for Enterprise Solutions and a revenue growth headwind for Mainframe Solutions, we do not expect fiscal 2016 revenue to grow in constant currency. We expect a similar operating margin in fiscal 2016 as in 2015.
And now I will turn the call back over to Jonathan, and we will take your questions."

And this is a great effort by our team that really put a lot of innovation into that product, both on the user interface, the capability and the lowering the cost of sales. And that's been an inspiration for all of the engineers in CA. API management, the world is definitely moving to an API-enabled world. We'd really think that this is going to be a software-enabled economy. This is the glue that puts all of these disparate applications together. That product is selling extraordinarily well, where I put us in the top quartile of all competitors in that space. DevOps, a lot of innovation going into DevOps. I would argue that we are the market leader in that space, really driving what you can do with virtualization in a DevOps environment. We just launched another net new product in mobile app analytics. I think we're the only company that can go directly from a mobile application, all the way through all the middleware, into the mainframe or the cloud. And we've got a very, very strong mainframe group. This group has done a tremendous amount of work over the last 2 years. They've put new innovation -- I think, once again, we're one of the only companies still investing in the mainframe. The quality of our mainframe applications has gone up tremendously. Last quarter, we did -- all of our releases had 0 defects, which I think was the first time in our history, and it really makes a statement to the quality we put in place over the last couple of years. On the sales, we're in Q4, and as we're thinking about Q4 and going into 2016, I think it's the first time ever there's no structural changes going on in the sales organization. I think the restructuring we did last year is absolutely working, and we're only going to be adding fuel to that already existing structure, not changing reporting structures and what people are working on or accounts that they're covering in a material way. And the way I look at this is it's showing up in the numbers. Two years ago, the enterprise segment was shrinking by 20%. After 1 year of being here, we cut that in half. And if you take a look at where we'll end this year, Enterprise segment will be down to flat, which puts us in a position, with net new products coming out in the June time frame, that we'll be able to get this flywheel to move. And at the end of the day, it really comes down to the team. We put a team in place here that is really driving innovation, execution and speed. They put CA first. They're very, very competitive and they're doing it the right way, which means doing the right thing. So when I put all that stuff together, it gives me confidence that we're definitely on the right path. And when I look at the numbers and the trajectory of the things that are -- paying important to, are we innovating new products? Is eSTG growing? Is the mainframe a stable component of our ecosystem? It gives me confidence that we're on the right track. A long answer, but thank you for a great question."

I'm encouraged by the number of at-bats we're getting, and it kind of goes to John DiFucci's comment where people are looking at CA a little bit differently, which means we're getting into more sales cycles. As we're getting into these sales cycles, I don't think it's different for anybody. The technical buyer wants to try and buy. And if they have an opportunity to do what I call a mezzanine transaction, get it in, make sure it works, they usually do that now before they go for the big transaction. I think you have to be very careful to be an elephant hunter these days. That's how you get really awkward and jumpy bookings quarter-to-quarter. What we've been training our sales force to do is get in there, we're very confident in our products, we're more than happy to do try and buy, we're more than happy to do a proof of concept. And in the end, we think, if you take a look at over a 12- to 18-month time frame, we think it's going to shorten sales cycles rather than elongate them. Having a very long sales cycle for a very large transaction compared to having 8 to 10 transactions going on at the same time, where the customer sees the true value of the product, we just think that's the way the industry is moving. And you're seeing some of that transition happen. It's been happening all year long. So I don't see anything systemic. I like the North American market. I think we feel very good about Security. That portfolio is very competitive, and we see a lot of need for security. I love what we're doing in DevOps because I think as customers start building applications, especially custom applications for mobile, I think we're very well positioned for that. And then when you take a look at our Management Cloud, everybody wants to understand where these transactions are. Is it the network that's down? Is it the application that's down? Is it the hardware that's down? We're one of the few companies that can monitor that at scale across multi-platforms. So I feel pretty good about those problems being solved in North America. Europe was very strong. Once again, 3 quarters in a row, Europe's been very strong. We definitely over-performed in Asia this quarter, so I was very happy with that. The big area that we were a little bit surprised about is how poorly Latin America did for this last quarter, and we're taking a look at that from an economic perspective as well as from an execution perspective."

So I think that that's a systemic challenge that all software companies have to deal with. I think we recognized this 2 years ago and started working our way towards it. But I wouldn't declare victory on it as of yet. Secondly, as it comes down to net new product innovation, this market is changing so quickly, customers are so demanding that you have to have your innovation thinking cap on. You have to imagine the problems that customers are going to have 1 to 2 years out, because it takes an enterprise company to build software at scale at least a year to get it through the development process, through the testing process, to make sure that it works as promised and at scale.

If you can't show in a maintenance cycle that you've actually put some real sweat equity into adding value to existing code, I think you're getting a tremendous amount of pushback from customers. So that's why in my opening remarks I talked about the mainframe, and I haven't let them off the hook in any way, shape or form on innovation. And every new release has got to have something in there that is better than the previous release, whether it be user interface, the amount of MIPS it uses, whether it's the ease of use of that application or just net new SKUs, coupled with features that have been on the blocks for a while with respect to customers. So I think if you do that, we've seen a lot of stability in our maintenance pricing, and I think our customer satisfaction this last quarter was the highest in the history of CA. So I like the imagery of that. I like the feel of that business. Now I do think we have some more opportunity with what's going on with the announcement of the new z System coming from IBM. IBM, we participate in a relationship with them in 3 ways. They are a great partner for us in the systems integrator side. They are a great partner for us with respect to the hardware side. They share a lot of information with us on what they're doing with their product road map. They want that platform to be as powerful as possible, and they encourage companies like CA to write software for that platform. And then, of course, we duke it out on the software side. So when I take a look at the whole relationship and I take a look at their investment -- I think they spent $1 billion over the last 5 years -- I think that's net good for us because at the end of the day, customers are going to want to have a choice. There are certain customer segments that really like dealing with CA, and they could have picked any vendor they wanted to on the mainframe. They standardized on us and they want us to invest. And I think that that's -- the fact that IBM has made that platform once again relevant, I think is a good showing for us in our mainframe segment. Now Rich spends a lot of time on pricing in a lot of the maintenance contracts. Maybe he can give us some contextual information. Rich?"

So to have single-digit growth on a lighter renewal portfolio is a pretty strong statement of the platform. And then I'd also say we saw a good attach rate and as -- we had a 90-plus percent, like normal, on the renewal yield, so that says we're not trading off our maintenance stream for that incremental sales. As far as the z box, I think that will really benefit us over time. It helps the entire ecosystem, as Mike said, with the total cost to computing driving that down. The fact that z/Linux will play a bigger and bigger part of that, we have a lot of products on the distributed side that participate, and we're really the only vendor with IBM that have a strong Linux and strong mainframe. And if you read a lot of their prepared remarks, that is becoming a bigger and bigger place for people to consolidate their Linux farms back onto the mainframe, and that plays right into our sweet spot."

And where we currently sit at a minus 2 in constant currency, we think at this point in time, it's prudent to tell you that we're closer to the flatter end of that than to start to see the growth. As I think John had asked a question earlier, though, Q4 is always an important and big quarter for us. How that booking is recorded, either ratable over time or a little more upfront, will start to push that.

During fiscal year 2015, we focused our efforts on our go-to-market strategy, introduced new products and strengthened relationships with our customers. As demonstrated by this quarter's results, however, we still have work to do to drive the kind of growth that our company has the potential to achieve.
I'm convinced that we have set in place the appropriate strategy to transform CA and return it to growth. Over the last 2 years, we have significantly improved the underlying efficiency of our business. In fiscal year 2016, we will make the required investments to drive innovation, while continuing to demonstrate financial discipline by expanding full year non-GAAP operating margins by 2 percentage points to 39%, excluding the impact of any future material acquisitions.
Over the medium term, we will bring the market new products that will help our customers succeed in the Application Economy and we are confident that we can achieve sustainable low- to mid-single-digit cash flow growth.
Turning to our fourth quarter results, total new sales decreased in the high single digits year-over-year. Relative to our expectations, this decline was mainly the result of a headwind from the timing of our renewal portfolio, which was down in the single digits range year-over-year. And as we have said in the past, a large percentage of our new sales are still attached to renewal opportunities. While we had expected the renewal portfolio to be up in the 20% range for the quarter, we closed a substantially lower number of future quarter renewals than historical levels. These renewals primarily large deals within North America and EMEA, were not competitive losses and are expected to close within their natural expiration during fiscal 2016. We expect the renewal portfolio to be up in the mid-teens for fiscal 2016.
Let me provide you with a deeper insight into our strategy to deliver differentiated solutions, improve sales execution and increase our velocity.
First, solution development and delivery. We have stated that in order to be a leader in software, delivering next-generation solutions must be the lifeblood of our company. I am beginning to see the evidence of improvement in our ability to organically develop new product offerings and differentiate our products in the market. 
During fiscal 2015, we released differentiated new products such as mobile app analytics and our Cloud Service Management solution. While small in terms of revenue contribution now, these solutions are in the market today and growing significantly.
In the last 2 years, our development team has improved the core products within our portfolio, such as CA APM, and our on-premise security solutions. While the improvement is yet to be visible in our overall revenue growth, we are seeing positive underlying trends that reinforce my confidence in the business. 
For example, APM was declining in revenue in fiscal 2013 and 2014. Today, that trajectory has reversed course. APM grew revenue for our fiscal 2015 and surpassed the plan we set for it. Over the next 12 months, we have several new or updated products being released in the marketplace, such as identity as a service solution, new innovation from our API management team, a truly integrated approach to DevOps and continuous delivery as well as meaningful offerings that extend our leading infrastructure management capabilities. We are confident their impact will begin to become visible in our results.
Despite the progress we have made in these key areas, it's clear we need to increase our delivery velocity and achieve even greater leverage from CA product development end to end. Over the past couple of quarters, I've come to the conclusion that we and our customers would be better served by a product management model that is more fully aligned. To achieve this, I will be consolidating all of CA product management and development from mobile to mainframe under the leadership of a new executive position, the Chief Product Officer. This new leader will have a track record of managing and growing a large portfolio and work closely with the company's Chief Technology Officer, who's will role is long-term technology vision, platform management and cross development processes. Both positions are in the process of being filled, and with these new changes, Amit Chatterjee will be leading CA.
Turning to sales execution. The attach rate of new sales to renewals held steady for the fiscal year. However, we are still too reliant on large deals with existing large customers.
In order for us to reach our medium-term goals, we need to sell to our underserved and new customers, which we referred to as our named and growth accounts. While our fiscal 2015 new sales in our named account grew in the low to mid-teens, collectively our named and growth sales teams are not converting pipeline and follow-on transactions at the velocity needed for the company to grow total revenue. We believe this is due to a combination of the following factors, which we have already begun to address: First, we need to further improve our brand recognition in the marketplace. Throughout every sector of the economy, software is disrupting traditional business model in what has become an Application Economy. Our management cloud, DevOps and Security solutions, are empowering enterprises at the leverage software applications in all facets of their business. 
For example, our API management solutions are used in the largest car manufacturers in the world to security allow the automobile to evolve into an infotainment platform and eventually revolutionized into a fully autonomous technology-enabled vehicle. Specifically, these solution secured the data being transferred into and out of these connected cars. 
We need to better market the opportunity for our API management solutions to be leveraged in many other emerging API connected computing environments.
Another example of how brand recognition needs to improve is within DevOps. Our service virtualization and release automation solutions are allowing customers to move beyond agile software development and into a continuous delivery software development model. Many of the top enterprises in the world are partnering with us on this journey. 
For example, during the quarter, we closed 14 service virtualization and release automation new sales transactions that were over 500k, including an $8 million transaction. These wins were across the consumer goods, retail, leisure, financial services and energy industries, but only one was in named account. This is not enough, as there are ample opportunities for 500k transactions within our named accounts in each one of these industries. We need to better evangelize the value of our DevOps solutions in the marketplace.
The second area in which we are investing to improve velocity is within inside sales. For many of our new lighter-weight products, we need to better integrate digital marketing with our inside sales organization. Last quarter, we upgraded  the leadership of our global inside sales organization by appointing a Senior Executive as it's new head. In addition, we shifted investment to higher, more quota carrying inside sales reps who are focused on converting digitally generated leads, building more pipeline and driving new business. We believe these changes will both lower our cost of sale and increase the velocity of new product sales growth.
The third area in which we are taking steps to improve sales execution is within our partner business. We have revamped our entire partner go-to-market model. The team is now focused on working with a smaller number of highly engaged partners with whom we plan to heavily invest to reach underserved and new customers. For fiscal 2016, we have modest expectations for our partner team, but we are excited by the opportunity ahead of us.
Let me now speak to velocity. As I stated earlier, there are still some areas of our operations that need to move faster. We have formulated a plan of action to address these concerns, which we believe are overshadowing the underlying progress that we are making.
When I look at CA, I see a great deal of qualitative progress that needs to turn into quantitative results. The key qualitative metrics that I look to that gives me confidence that we will reach our medium-term goals are as follows: The trajectory of our organic Enterprise Solutions new sales performance has improved and stabilized over the last 2 years. We are seeing better sales execution in APJ and EMEA. During fiscal 2015, they were both able to meet the plans we set for them. Our market studies are showing steady and meaningful gains in name recognition. A recent Wall Street Journal corporate perception study, which track [ph] 662 companies in 50 industries, showed CA moving up 23 points in quality of management and in overall reputation, a very significant 33 points. 
Moving on to industry analysts. CA is being ranked as a leader by firms such as Gartner and Forrester. New sales of our growth products were up in the low mid-teens in FY '15 and more than 1/3 of our total new sales compared to FY '13 when they made fewer than 20% of new sales. Account coverage continually is critical to effective sales execution. Therefore, in fiscal 2016, we are not making any wholesale changes in account average. We believe our go-to-market strategy is intact and with a few tweaks to improve sales velocity and close rates, we do not foresee any major changes. 
And lastly, where it counts the most, we had high single-digit increase in our Net Promoter Score year-over-year. We intend to do that again this year.
With that, I will turn the call over to Rich for a review our fourth quarter financials and fiscal 2016 full year guidance. Thank you."

Before we get started with the quarter review, let me remind you that all comparisons are year-over-year and in constant currency, unless otherwise indicated. This afternoon, I'm going to focus my comments on the key business drivers and",1256,"Thank you, Mike. Before we get started with the quarter review, let me remind you that all comparisons are year-over-year and in constant currency, unless otherwise indicated. This afternoon, I'm going to focus my comments on the key business drivers and performance indicators for the quarter. The balance of our financial details can be found in our supplemental and press release.
As many of you are aware, the dollar continues to strengthen against most major currencies, which negatively impacts both our results and guidance. Our Q4 total revenue was $1.02 billion and was down 1%. Mainframe was down 2%. Enterprise Solutions was up 2% and services declined 3%. Fiscal 2015 total revenue was $4.26 billion and was down 2%, in line with our guidance of down 2% to down 1%. Mainframe was down 2%. Enterprise Solutions was down 1% and services declined 6%.
Q4 renewals were down in the low single digits and down high single digits as reported. As Mike stated earlier, while we expected the renewal portfolio to be up in the 20% range, we closed a substantially lower number of future year renewals than planned. And as we previously stated, the year-over-year change in our renewal bookings can vary on a quarterly basis due to the timing of large transactions. 
Q4 total new product and capacity sales were down approximately high single digits and low teens as reported. This is due mainly to the headwinds from the renewal portfolio, lack of performance set outside the renewal opportunity and a headwind for macro weakness in Latin America.
Fiscal 2015 renewals were down in the high teens and down in the low 20s as reported. Fiscal 2015 new product and capacity sales were down mid-single digits and down slightly more, just into the high single-digit range as reported. The renewal yield during the quarter was in the low 90% range and at or above 90% during each quarter of the fiscal year. We expect fiscal 2016 renewals to be up mid-teens year-over-year as compared to fiscal 2015 and that low single digits year-over-year, excluding a large system integrator renewal that is expected to close in Q4 2016.
As reported, we expect fiscal 2016 renewals to be up approximately 10% year-over-year as compared to fiscal 2015, including a large system integrator renewal that is expected to close in Q4 of fiscal 2016.
From a geographic basis during the quarter, we saw a continued improvement from our EMEA teams sales execution as they grew new sales year-over-year this quarter. For the full year, excluding the impact of currency, EMEA new sales were up mid-single digits and we were encouraged with their underlying performance. While Asia fell short of our expectations for Q4, for the full year, they surpassed our expectations. However, North America fell short of our expectations, mainly due to weakness selling outside the renewal opportunity. Latin America performance was again below expectations set at the beginning of the year, which we believe is mainly a result of macro-related headwinds in the region.
In our Mainframe segment, Q4 Mainframe new sales including new product and capacity were down mid-single digits in constant currency and down low teens as reported. Fiscal 2015 Mainframe new sales, including new product and capacity, were down high single digits in constant currency and approximately 10% as reported. Overall, we expect our Mainframe revenue growth to be down low single digits over the medium term, which we believe is in line with the mainframe market.
Q4 Enterprise Solutions' new product sales were down high single digits in constant currency and down low teens as reported. Fiscal 2015 Enterprise Solutions' new product sales were down mid-single digits in constant currency and as reported. As Mike stated, the decline in Enterprise Solutions' new product sales is mainly a result of headwinds from the renewal portfolio and weaknesses selling outside the renewal opportunity.
Services revenue decreased 3% and 6% for the quarter and the year, respectively. As we've previously stated, the primary driver of the decline during fiscal 2015 is due to us deemphasizing noncore government services contracting engagements, which are not directly related to software sales. 
Going forward, we expect lower services bookings to be a headwind to fiscal 2016 revenue. Over the longer term, we expect a negative impact to our services revenue growth, as we design our products to be easier to install and leverage partners for more services engagements.
Current revenue backlog was down 3%. Current revenue backlog was impacted by lower-than-expected fourth quarter renewals and lower services bookings. As I've said before, consistent year-over-year growth in current revenue backlog is one of the indicators of future revenue growth. Current revenue backlog is likely to grow when we demonstrate multiple quarters of new sales growth, while maintaining a low 90s renewal yield.
Q4 non-GAAP operating margin was 32% and GAAP operating margin was 21%. Fiscal 2015 non-GAAP operating margin was 37% and GAAP operating margin was 27%. Fiscal 2015 segment operating margins were 59% for Mainframe Solutions, 11% for Enterprise Solutions and 3% for Services. Our Q4 non-GAAP tax rate was 23% and our GAAP tax rate was 28%.
Q4 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.56, down 11% year-over-year. Fiscal 2015 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $2.53, down 15% year-over-year. The decrease in our non-GAAP EPS is driven by a lower non-GAAP tax rate in fiscal 2014. Q4 GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.33, up 48%. Fiscal 2015 GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.82, down 5%.
Our Q4 CFFO was $485 million, up 8%. Single installment cash payments were at $191 million and up year-over-year. Fiscal 2015 CFFO was $1,030,000,000, up 9% and in line with our guidance of 5% to 12% year-over-year growth. 
We ended Q4 with approximately $1.4 billion in net cash. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased $90 million in shares, paid $111 million in dividends. We repurchased $250 [ph] million in shares in fiscal 2015 and paid $444 million in dividends, which represents over 65% of our free cash flow. We have $785 million remaining of our original $1 billion share repurchase program.
Turning to guidance. Guidance is based upon exchange rates on the last day of the preceding quarter, which is March 31, 2015. This includes a partial hedge of operating income.
We expect currency to have a negative impact to our full year fiscal 2016 revenue of approximately 5% as of March 31 rates. Total revenue is expected to decrease 2% in constant currency. This translates to reported revenue of $3.95 billion to $3.99 billion.
Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to grow 2% to 5% in constant currency. This translates to reported non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.38 to $2.45.
GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to grow 12% to 17%. This translates to reported GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.83 to $1.90.
Cash flow from operations is expected to increase 2% to 7% in constant currency. This translates to reported cash flow from operations of $970 million to $1.01 billion.
Guidance does not include the effect of any future material acquisitions. Underlining this guidance, we expect our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates to be between 28% to 29%. We expect full year GAAP operating margin of 30% and full year non-GAAP operating margin of 39%.
At the end of the year, we expect approximately 433 million shares outstanding and a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 437 million.
And now I'll turn the call back over to Jonathan and we will take your questions."

The growth products that have continued to do well, they did very well in Q4. When you take a look at release automation, Service Virtualization, API management had an extraordinary quarter in the mid-30s growth. Service virtualization was in the high 20s. And then we had a good performance by some of our more mature products with security was up in the low 20s and e-commerce had the best quarter that, well, we've ever had. Over the course of the year, we've seen a lot of lumpiness in some of our value products. The big standout there is APM management -- API management. It had the -- a really, really strong quarter grew above our plan for the year. And if you remember, this particular product was shrinking 2 years ago and we've definitely got it into a place where we're definitely seeing growth and continue to see growth. So if I was to characterize those as the big winners systematically, the newer products are selling very well and a little bit of lumpiness in some of the value products."

I would characterize it as the last 2 years, we spent really getting operationally sound. And when you take a look at our confidence in getting to 39%, it's now we're at a point where we're pretty much steady stream. I still think there's room for improvement down the road with respect to the enterprise segment, but that's got to be associated with growth. So we've been focused over the last 2 years completely on organic growth. So getting to that 39% from an organic perspective I think is where the company is operating very, very well. Net Promoter Score's gone up. The talent that we've been able to attract to the company and the talent that we had in the company's operating and I would consider to be pretty much best of class. When you take a look at where we spend revenue on a percentage basis -- of where we spend as a percentage of revenue in all the categories, I'm feeling much more comfortable about that. So now we've got a very good platform in which we could start layering on growth. The new products that we've been investing in and building out over the last year are coming to market. We had a number of products we'll be launching at CA World, so I feel good about that. So to get to the 39%, I think we've got a little bit more work ahead of us coming into the quarter -- coming into the next quarter or 2 but I feel pretty confident organically we're in a good spot to get to that kind of operating margin."

I've also said consistently that we'll spend $300 million to $500 million a year on average. And to the extent that we see products and companies in the market that make sense to our strategy and hit our internal hurdle rates with respect to evaluation, I feel very confident that I've got a management that can execute. Going back to my previous answer, I talked about on how we're improving the operation I think we've cleaned up a lot of those types of issues. So we have the ability to be able to do that. And the other thing that should be very clear, I talked about it in the prepared remarks, is we made our plan in EMEA, which is the first time that we've done that, an awful long time. I think the EMEA team has done a very, very good job getting very serious about how our products need to be represented in that market. So that's a confidence builder. And when you've got that distribution engine working in a market' as big as that, you can start thinking about acquisitions again."

Because renewals are supposed to be up in the mid-teens for next year right now, which I think it's a little bit better than you thought it would be nd which makes sense because of the slippage of renewals from this quarter into next. Previously, you had said that revenue would not grow on a constant currency basis and now you're saying its going to decline a couple of percent on a constant currency basis. And are you thinking about those renewals pushing from this quarter to next quarter? And it's a big delta, right? I mean it was supposed to be up I think around -- I mean, we thought around 15%, 20% now it's down high single digits. So that would hurt this year and help next year relative to this year. Not a lot, I realized the timing of the year but a little bit anyway. And I'm just curious as to why revenue is -- the outlook is a little bit worse than -- at least on the margin. When you said it wasn't going to grow, it couldn't mean it could decline, but you could have said it's going to decline, too. Are you sort of this assuming, Mike, some of the stuff that happened here? Or it's going to take longer? It wasn't just renewals. It take longer to fix over the course of next year?"

If taken a bit longer to get some of these product traction and getting the sales environment to sell consistently. When I look across the board as I so I was super happy with EMEA. They've been able to sell outside of the renewal. They've been able to sell stand-alone. In the U.S., we have pockets where it worked well and pockets where it didn't work so well. In order for us to get to that growth, we have to keep our fingers on several levers and I talked about that in the prepared remarks. Number one is we have to get net new products that is in tuned to what a customer wants to buy. So we need more net new products to offset some of the legacy products and we're on that all day every day. And secondly, we have do have more consistency in our sales operation. It's not okay to be good in certain territories and not good in other territories. This is something I'm spending an awful lot of time on with the sales leadership team and we're going to be focused on that to get that kind of consistent result. Now there's a number of mechanics, some of which you already pointed out. I'll get rich to talk about some of the mechanics that show up in the CA model."

So if you think through where we did say we we're going to end up with our renewals and bookings, you can -- a view about -- 2/3 of that were actually fiscal '16 renewals that would come in our fiscal year end. They'd be in their calendar year. Those transactions, we now -- they did not occur in the quarter. So we didn't lose any of those. They just will now happen at their normal expiration date. Most of those expiration dates are back half loaded. So as opposed to closing a transaction in Q4 of fiscal '15, we plumb them now that the majority of those will close in Q3, Q4 with the rentable mall you can see that it pushes. So that's just a statement of about 2/3 of that bookings change. But there is 1/3 of that bookings change, as Mike talked about, where we didn't do as well in North America freestanding and Services continues to be a drag. And Services are a drag of about 0.5 point. So mechanically, those are the things that drove the change just in the overall bookings. On a positive note, Mike alluded to earlier though, if you look at our new sales, about 1/3 of that now is our new fast-growing products that. So as that product that becomes a bigger and bigger part of the overall new sales, it will over time overshadow the older products that are either in decline or flat."

And I -- listen, with all due respect, both of you guys are very logical people and really sharp people from my experience. But we hear of good things in the field about CA.

But when do you -- is there a point where you say, you know what, maybe with this kind of software or with this product set, maybe we should just stop trying to grow and just give it -- get cash back to investors. And you've already given a lot of cash to investors but just give more back to investors and run it a little differently. Listen, I'm not saying you should give up.

If you go back to those transactions that moved out and you heard Mike talked earlier about some of the other products. An example a lot of the existing not new products, they grow via capacity growth, which is driven. So to the degree that those CLAs naturally are going to happen in the back of the year, a lot of the growth of the traditional products will happen in the capacity. As Mike said, it's been lumpy. The first half of the year, we actually saw some good growth in some of our more traditional products. So those -- so we are not giving up on that product set at all. We do see that is happening more still in tune with the natural expiration date. I think as far as North America, North America still needs to continue to grow outside of renewals but the platinum account actually did well around the world in all quarters. So they're tied to the renewal cycle, but they perform well and we saw growth in our named accounts."

If I saw consistent poor performance on a global basis, I would be more apt to take a look at a different strategy. But when I can see a us turning Asia Pac, turning EMEA, platinum working pretty much across the globe and North America, especially in the named and growth being spotty where it works really, really well with some territories and some executives and it doesn't work nearly as well with some territories and some executives, it gives me confidence that if I can understand that and get more products and continue to improve customer satisfaction, Net Promoter Scores that we'll be able to get this company to grow. The other thing, too, in the category of no good deed goes unpunished, we have become a mature disciplined company. So some of these renewals that customers wanted to do in Q4, the economics were not in our favor. And I'd really pushed hard to not discount these new products. These new products are of the high value. We're selling them across the globe and just because you've had an ELA and an experience with CA where at the end of our Q4, you want to squeeze us on economics, I'm just not willing to give up that kind of value.

At the end of the day, you want to hold the value of your highest performing products and make sure that the market doesn't deteriorate and commoditize them. The other thing is we had a huge event called CA World where we bring all of our customers together. And if you start selling software like at a Turkish bazaar, you are not considered to be an honest broker and you eventually get into a cycle where your product commoditize is quicker than you wanted to and then you stop investing in R&D and then we stop investing in R&D, you get taken over by competitors. I've seen that happen so much in our industry that I think you have to take a stand on where is value. And if you'll hold the line in value and you also hold the line on the value of ELA, these ELAs drive an incredible amount of value for our customers.

Are we",526,"Great question. First of all, the thought process here is that we're operating the company for a while and taking a look at the last 2 years and really taking a look at the last 2 quarters and thinking about the velocity that we keep talking about. Are we getting new product and differentiated product to the market as quickly as I would like it to be? And secondly, listening to customers of the kinds of problem that they want us to solve. And most of those problems that they want us to solve have to do with complexity. And what is unique about CA is we truly can go from mobile to mainframe. And we think of this Application Economy driving for mobile to mainframe and trying to reduce complexity, I'll take a look at our organization and it's actually the -- is more complex than I think it should be. In order to -- when we're building products having the mainframe completely separated from the rest of the eSTG product, it became more difficult to think through holistically solving the problems of our customers. When you take a look at a lot of our growth products, API management, for example, most of the target of the API management product, the product is opening up well the transactional processing of the mainframe. Service Virtualization, one of the most popular use cases of that is virtualizing the mainframe. When it comes to release automation, there is as much software being released and changed at a higher velocity on the mainframe as well as the massive amounts of distributed architectures that customers are deploying. So having 1 person managing all of the products I think is an opportunity for us to make sure when we go to a customer, we're going to that customer with 1 voice. Now talk to a big job and to have that 1 person think of all of the products and the nuances of our products and also worry about our platform and the technical platform that's going to be required 1 to 2 years out, I didn't feel that we would be best served by having 1 person do that. So I've had to search out for a CTO now for probably about 1.5 months to 2 months, and I've seen an incredible number of candidates. And as I'm looking through those candidates, I think that we're going to have an opportunity to up our game and up our ability to serve our customers. Now the other thing is underneath that Chief Product Officer is all of our general managers and they're not changing around. This is a group that is definitely committed to understanding modern software development and their focus in life is to make sure they're building products that are easy to use, easy to install, easier to sell, try and buy and I don't see that changing at all going forward. It's more just a -- more a of logical view of listening to customers and positioning ourselves to accelerated growth. Does that answer your question and help you get an understanding for why go through this change?"

But in summary, I would take a look at the quarter and the year as qualitative and quantitative success. From a qualitative perspective, we have a lot of margin expansion, 3 quarters of a point. That's showing our continued efficiency. We had CFFO growth. We returned over 65% of our free cash flow to shareholders. Named account performance and traction is in double digits. We have healthy attach rates to our renewals and I think that's a big testament to the work that the team has done over the last year to improve our Net Promoter Score. The growth products are both 16% growing year-over-year and in Q4, most of them were in the high 20s. And we've completed the FY '14 rebalancing actions. So when I take a look at the year in general for FY '15, a lot of qualitative performance that I think the team's really proud. But at the end of the day, it does have to show up in the quantitative results and we are very committed to drive growth. So when you think of 2014, things we have to look forward to, we have 2% points of margin expansion. We've seen the ES revenue trajectory go from negative to start moving into the positive. EMEA revenue turning to positive in FY '16, a strong renewal portfolio in FY '16 and strong CFFO growth.
So with that, I want to thank you for your time and we'll be talking to you in the field. I think we're already in the market talking to a number of investors in a number of shows and we'll be able to answer your questions more further then. Take care."

During fiscal year 2015, we focused our efforts on our go-to-market strategy, introduced new products and strengthened relationships with our customers. As demonstrated by this quarter's results, however, we s",1594,"Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. During fiscal year 2015, we focused our efforts on our go-to-market strategy, introduced new products and strengthened relationships with our customers. As demonstrated by this quarter's results, however, we still have work to do to drive the kind of growth that our company has the potential to achieve.
I'm convinced that we have set in place the appropriate strategy to transform CA and return it to growth. Over the last 2 years, we have significantly improved the underlying efficiency of our business. In fiscal year 2016, we will make the required investments to drive innovation while continuing to demonstrate financial discipline by expanding full year non-GAAP operating margins by 2 percentage points to 39%, excluding the impact of any future material acquisitions. Over the medium term, we will bring to market new products that will help our customers succeed in the Application Economy, and we are confident that we can achieve sustainable low- to mid-single-digit cash flow growth.
Turning to our fourth quarter results. Total new sales decreased in the high single digits year-over-year. Relative to our expectations, this decline was mainly the result of a headwind from the timing of our renewal portfolio, which was down in the low single digits range year-over-year. And as we have said in the past, a large percentage of our new sales are still attached to renewal opportunities. While we had expected the renewal portfolio to be up in the 20% range for the quarter, we closed a substantially lower number of future quarter renewals than historical levels. These renewals, primarily large deals within North America and EMEA, were not competitive losses and are expected to close within their natural expiration during fiscal 2016. We expect the renewal portfolio to be up in the mid-teens for fiscal 2016.
Let me provide you with a deeper insight into our strategy to deliver differentiated solutions, improve sales execution and increase our velocity.
First, solution development and delivery. We have stated that in order to be a leader in software, delivering next-generation solutions must be the lifeblood of our company. I am beginning to see the evidence of improvement in our ability to organically develop new product offerings and differentiate our products in the market. During fiscal 2015, we released differentiated new products such as Mobile App Analytics and our Cloud Service Management solution. While small in terms of revenue contribution now, these solutions are in the market today and growing significantly.
In the last 2 years, our development team has improved the core products within our portfolio such as CA APM and our on-premise security solutions. While the improvement is yet to be visible in our overall revenue growth, we are seeing positive underlying trends that reinforce my confidence in the business. For example, APM was declining in revenue in fiscal 2013 and 2014. Today, that trajectory has reversed course. APM grew revenue for fiscal 2015 and surpassed the plan we set for it. Over the next 12 months, we have several new or updated products being released in the marketplace such as Identity-as-a-Service solution, new innovation from our API management team, a truly integrated approach to DevOps and Continuous Delivery as well as meaningful offerings that extend our leading infrastructure management capabilities. We are confident their impact will begin to become visible in our results.
Despite the progress we have made in these key areas, it's clear we need to increase our delivery velocity and achieve even greater leverage from CA product development end to end. Over the past couple of quarters, I've come to the conclusion that we and our customers would be better served by a product management model that is more fully aligned. To achieve this, I will be consolidating all of CA product management and development from mobile to mainframe under the leadership of a new executive position, the Chief Product Officer. This new leader will have a track record of managing and growing a large portfolio and work closely with the company's Chief Technology Officer, whose role is long-term technology vision, platform management and cross-development processes. Both positions are in the process of being filled, and with these new changes, Amit Chatterjee will be leaving CA.
Turning to sales execution. The attach rate of new sales to renewals held steady for the fiscal year. However, we are still too reliant on large deals with existing large customers. In order for us to reach our medium-term goals, we need to sell to our underserved and new customers, which we refer to as our named and growth accounts. While our fiscal 2015 new sales in our named account grew in the low to mid-teens, collectively our named and growth sales teams are not converting pipeline and follow-on transactions at the velocity needed for the company to grow total revenue. We believe this is due to a combination of the following factors, which we have already begun to address. 
First, we need to further improve our brand recognition in the marketplace. Throughout every sector of the economy, software is disrupting traditional business model in what has become an Application Economy. Our Management Cloud, DevOps and Security solutions are empowering enterprises to leverage software applications in all facets of their business. 
For example, our API management solutions are used in the largest car manufacturers in the world to security allow the automobile to evolve into an infotainment platform and eventually revolutionized into a fully autonomous technology-enabled vehicle. Specifically, these solutions secured the data being transferred into and out of these connected cars. We need to better market the opportunity for our API management solutions to be leveraged in many other emerging API-connected computing environments.
Another example of how brand recognition needs to improve is within DevOps. Our service virtualization and release automation solutions are allowing customers to move beyond Agile software development and into a continuous delivery software development model. Many of the top enterprises in the world are partnering with us on this journey.
For example, during the quarter, we closed 14 service virtualization and release automation new sales transactions that were over 500k, including an $8 million transaction. These wins were across the consumer goods, retail, leisure, financial services and energy industries, but only one was a named account. This is not enough as there are ample opportunities for 500k transactions within our named accounts in each one of these industries. We need to better evangelize the value of our DevOps solutions in the marketplace.
The second area in which we are investing to improve velocity is within inside sales. For many of our new lighter-weight products, we need to better integrate digital marketing with our inside sales organization. Last quarter, we upgraded the leadership of our global inside sales organization by appointing a Senior Executive as it's new head. In addition, we shifted investment to hire more quota-carrying inside sales reps who are focused on converting digitally generated leads, building more pipeline and driving new business. We believe these changes will both lower our cost of sale and increase the velocity of new product sales growth.
The third area in which we are taking steps to improve sales execution is within our partner business. We have revamped our entire partner go-to-market model. The team is now focused on working with a smaller number of highly engaged partners with whom we plan to heavily invest to reach underserved and new customers. For fiscal 2016, we have modest expectations for our partner team, but we are excited about the opportunity ahead of us.
Let me now speak to velocity. As I stated earlier, there are still some areas of our operations that need to move faster. We have formulated a plan of action to address these concerns, which we believe are overshadowing the underlying progress that we are making.
When I look at CA, I see a great deal of qualitative progress that needs to turn into quantitative results. The key qualitative metrics that I look to that give me confidence that we will reach our medium-term goals are as follows. The trajectory of our organic Enterprise Solutions new sales performance has improved and stabilized over the last 2 years. We are seeing better sales execution in APJ and EMEA. During fiscal 2015, they were both able to meet the plans we set for them. Our market studies are showing steady and meaningful gains in name recognition. A recent Wall Street Journal corporate perception study, which tracks 662 companies in 50 industries, showed CA moving up 23 points in quality of management and in overall reputation, a very significant 33 points.
Moving on to industry analysts. CA is being ranked as a leader by firms such as Gartner and Forrester. New sales of our growth products were up in the low mid-teens in FY '15 and more than 1/3 of our total new sales compared to FY '13 when they made up fewer than 20% of new sales. Account coverage continuity is critical to effective sales execution. Therefore, in fiscal 2016, we are not making any wholesale changes in account coverage. We believe our go-to-market strategy is intact, and with a few tweaks to improve sales velocity and close rates, we do not foresee any major changes.
And lastly, where it counts the most, we had high single-digit increase in our Net Promoter Score year-over-year. We intend to do that again this year.
With that, I will turn the call over to Rich for a review our fourth quarter financials and fiscal 2016 full year guidance. Thank you."

Before we get started with the quarter review, let me remind you that all comparisons are year-over-year and in constant currency, unless otherwise indicated. This afternoon, I'm going to focus my comments on the key business drivers and",1254,"Thank you, Mike. Before we get started with the quarter review, let me remind you that all comparisons are year-over-year and in constant currency, unless otherwise indicated. This afternoon, I'm going to focus my comments on the key business drivers and performance indicators for the quarter. The balance of our financial details can be found in our supplemental and press release.
As many of you are aware, the dollar continues to strengthen against most major currencies, which negatively impacts both our results and guidance. Our Q4 total revenue was $1.02 billion and was down 1%. Mainframe was down 2%. Enterprise Solutions was up 2% and services declined 3%. Fiscal 2015 total revenue was $4.26 billion and was down 2%, in line with our guidance of down 2% to down 1%. Mainframe was down 2%. Enterprise Solutions was down 1%, and Services declined 6%.
Q4 renewals were down in the low single digits and down high single digits as reported. As Mike stated earlier, while we expected the renewal portfolio to be up in the 20% range, we closed a substantially lower number of future year renewals than planned. And as we previously stated, the year-over-year change in our renewal bookings can vary on a quarterly basis due to the timing of large transactions.
Q4 total new product and capacity sales were down approximately high single digits and low teens as reported. This is due mainly to the headwinds from the renewal portfolio, lack of performance selling outside the renewal opportunity and a headwind for macro weakness in Latin America.
Fiscal 2015 renewals were down in the high teens and down in the low 20s as reported. Fiscal 2015 new product and capacity sales were down mid-single digits and down slightly more, just into the high single-digit range as reported. The renewal yield during the quarter was in the low 90% range and at or above 90% during each quarter of the fiscal year. 
We expect fiscal 2016 renewals to be up mid-teens year-over-year as compared to fiscal 2015 and up low single digits year-over-year, excluding a large system integrator renewal that is expected to close in Q4 fiscal 2016. As reported, we expect fiscal 2016 renewals to be up approximately 10% year-over-year as compared to fiscal 2015, including a large system integrator renewal that is expected to close in Q4 of fiscal 2016.
From a geographic basis during the quarter, we saw continued improvement from our EMEA team sales execution as they grew new sales year-over-year this quarter. For the full year, excluding the impact of currency, EMEA new sales were up mid-single digits, and we were encouraged with their underlying performance. While Asia fell short of our expectations for Q4, for the full year, they surpassed our expectations. However, North America fell short of our expectations, mainly due to weakness selling outside the renewal opportunity. Latin America performance was again below expectations set at the beginning of the year, which we believe is mainly a result of macro-related headwinds in the region.
In our Mainframe segment, Q4 Mainframe new sales, including new product and capacity, were down mid-single digits in constant currency and down low teens as reported. Fiscal 2015 Mainframe new sales, including new product and capacity, were down high single digits in constant currency and approximately 10% as reported. Overall, we expect our Mainframe revenue growth to be down low single digits over the medium term, which we believe is in line with the mainframe market.
Q4 Enterprise Solutions' new product sales were down high single digits in constant currency and down low teens as reported. Fiscal 2015 Enterprise Solutions' new product sales were down mid-single digit in constant currency and as reported. As Mike stated, the decline in Enterprise Solutions' new product sales is mainly a result of headwinds from the renewal portfolio and weaknesses selling outside the renewal opportunity.
Services revenue decreased 3% and 6% for the quarter and the year, respectively. As we previously stated, the primary driver of the decline during fiscal 2015 is due to us deemphasizing noncore government services subcontracting engagements, which are not directly related to software sales. Going forward, we expect lower Services bookings to be a headwind to fiscal 2016 revenue. Over the longer term, we expect a negative impact to our Services revenue growth as we design our products to be easier to install and leverage partners for more services engagements.
Current revenue backlog was down 3%. Current revenue backlog was impacted by lower-than-expected fourth quarter renewals and lower services bookings. As I've said before, consistent year-over-year growth in current revenue backlog is one of the indicators of future revenue growth. Current revenue backlog is likely to grow when we demonstrate multiple quarters of new sales growth while maintaining a low 90s renewal yield.
Q4 non-GAAP operating margin was 32% and GAAP operating margin was 21%. Fiscal 2015 non-GAAP operating margin was 37% and GAAP operating margin was 27%. Fiscal 2015 segment operating margins were 59% for Mainframe Solutions, 11% for Enterprise Solutions and 3% for Services. Our Q4 non-GAAP tax rate was 23% and our GAAP tax rate was 28%.
Q4 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.56, down 11% year-over-year. Fiscal 2015 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $2.53, down 15% year-over-year. The decrease in our non-GAAP EPS is driven by a lower non-GAAP tax rate in fiscal 2014. Q4 GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.33, up 48%. Fiscal 2015 GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.82, down 5%.
Our Q4 CFFO was $485 million, up 8%. Single installment cash payments were $191 million and up year-over-year. Fiscal 2015 CFFO was $1,030,000,000, up 9% and in line with our guidance of 5% to 12% year-over-year growth.
We ended Q4 with approximately $1.4 billion in net cash. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased $90 million in shares, paid $111 million in dividends. We repurchased $215 million in shares in fiscal 2015 and paid $444 million in dividends, which represents over 65% of our free cash flow. We have $785 million remaining of our original $1 billion share repurchase program.
Turning to guidance. Guidance is based upon exchange rates at the last day of the preceding quarter, which is March 31, 2015. This includes a partial hedge of operating income.
We expect currency to have a negative impact to our full year fiscal 2016 revenue of approximately 5% as of March 31 rates. Total revenue is expected to decrease 2% in constant currency. This translates to reported revenue of $3.95 billion to $3.99 billion.
Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to grow 2% to 5% in constant currency. This translates to reported non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.38 to $2.45. GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to grow 12% to 17%. This translates to reported GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.83 to $1.90.
Cash flow from operations is expected to increase 2% to 7% in constant currency. This translates to reported cash flow from operations of $970 million to $1.01 billion.
Guidance does not include the effect of any future material acquisitions. Underlining this guidance, we expect our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates to be between 28% to 29%. We expect full year GAAP operating margin of 30% and full year non-GAAP operating margin of 39%.
At the end of the year, we expect approximately 433 million shares outstanding and a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 437 million.
And now I'll turn the call back over to Jonathan, and we will take your questions."

The growth products that have continued to do well, they did very well in Q4. When you take a look at Release Automation, Service Virtualization, API management had an extraordinary quarter in the mid-30s growth. Service Virtualization was in the high 20s. And then we had good performance by some of our more mature products with -- Security was up in the low 20s and e-commerce had the best quarter that, well, we've ever had. Over the course of the year, we've seen a lot of lumpiness in some of our value products. The big standout there is APM management -- API management. It had the -- a really, really strong quarter, grew above our plan for the year. And if you remember, this particular product was shrinking 2 years ago, and we've definitely got it into a place where we're definitely seeing growth and continue to see growth. So if I was to characterize those as the big winners, and thematically [ph], the newer products are selling very well and a little bit of lumpiness in some of the value products."

And when you take a look at our confidence in getting to 39%, it's now we're at a point where we're pretty much steady stream. I still think there's room for improvement down the road with respect to the Enterprise segment, but that's got to be associated with growth. So we've been focused over the last 2 years completely on organic growth. So getting to that 39% from an organic perspective, I think, is where the company is operating very, very well. Net Promoter Score's gone up. The talent that we've been able to attract to the company and the talent that we had in the company is operating at what I would consider to be pretty much best of class. When you take a look at where we spend revenue on a percentage basis of where we spend as a percentage of revenue in all the categories, I'm feeling much more comfortable about that. So now we've got a very good platform in which we can start layering on growth. The new products that we've been investing in and building out over the last year are coming to market. We have a number of products we'll be launching at CA World, so I feel good about that. So to get to the 39%, I think we've got a little bit more work ahead of us coming into the quarter -- coming into the next quarter or 2. But I feel pretty confident organically we're in a good spot to get to that kind of operating margin."

I've also said consistently that we will spend $300 million to $500 million a year on average. And to the extent that we see products and companies in the market that make sense to our strategy and hit our internal hurdle rates with respect to valuation, I feel very confident I've got a management that can execute. Going back to my -- the previous answer I talked about on how we're improving the operations, I think we've cleaned up a lot of those types of issues. So we have the ability to be able to do that. And the other thing that should be very clear, I talked about it in the prepared remarks, is we made our plan on EMEA, which is the first time that we've done that, an awful long time. I think the EMEA team has done a very, very good job, getting very serious about how our products need to be represented in that market. So that's a confidence builder. And when you've got that distribution engine working in a market as big as that, you can start thinking about acquisitions again."

Because renewals are supposed to be up in the mid-teens for next year right now, which I think is a little bit better than you thought it would be and -- which makes sense because of the slippage of renewals from this quarter into next. Previously, you had said that revenue would not grow on a constant currency basis, and now you're saying its going to decline a couple of percent on a constant currency basis. And I think about those renewals pushing from this quarter to next quarter, and it's a big delta, right? I mean, it was supposed to be up, I think, around -- I mean, we thought around 15%, 20%. Now it's down in the high single digits. So that would hurt this year and help next year relative to this year. Not a lot. I realized the timing of the year but a little bit anyway. And I'm just curious as to why revenue is -- the outlook is a little bit worse than -- at least on the margin. I don't know. When you said it wasn't going to grow, it couldn't mean it could decline, but you could have said it's going to decline, too. Are you sort of just assuming, Mike, some of the stuff that happened here? Or it's just going to take longer? It wasn't just renewals and it take longer to fix over the course of next year?"

And the change, the trajectory of something like CA, is it 2 years, 1 month and a day? Is it 2 years, 6 months and a day? It's taken a bit longer to get some of this product traction and getting the sales environment to sell consistently. When I look across the board, as I said, I was super happy with EMEA. They've been able to sell outside of the renewal. They've been able to sell stand-alone. In the U.S., we have pockets where it worked well and pockets where it didn't work so well. In order for us to get to that growth, we have to keep our fingers on several levers, and I talked about that in the prepared remarks. Number one is we have to get net new products that is in tune to what a customer wants to buy. So we need more net new products to offset some of the legacy products, and we're on that all day every day. And secondly, we have do have more consistency in our sales operations. It's not okay to be good in certain territories and not good in other territories. This is something I'm spending an awful lot of time on with the sales leadership team, and we're going to be focused on that to get the kind of consistent result. Now there's a number of mechanics, some of which you already pointed out. I'll get Rich to talk about some of the mechanics that show up in the CA model."

Tho",246,"John, so if you think through where we did say we were going to end up with our renewals and bookings, you can -- a view about -- 2/3 of that were actually fiscal '16 renewals that would come into our fiscal year-end. They'd be in their calendar year. Those transactions, we now -- they did not occur in the quarter. So we didn't lose any of those. They just will now happen at their normal expiration date. Most of those expiration dates are back half loaded. So as opposed to closing a transaction in Q4 of fiscal '15, we plumb them now that the majority of those will close in Q3, Q4. With the ratable model, you can see if that pushes. So that's just a statement of about 2/3 of that booking change. But there is 1/3 of that booking change, as Mike talked about, where we didn't do as well in North America freestanding, and Services continues to be a drag. Services is a drag of about 0.5 point. So mechanically, those are the things that drove the change just in the overall bookings. On a positive note, Mike alluded to earlier it though, if you look at our new sales, about 1/3 of that now is our new fast-growing product set. So as that product set becomes a bigger and bigger part of the overall new sales, it will over time overshadow the older products that are either in decline or flat."

We currently already give 65% of our free cash flow back to our investors, so that's a pretty healthy return. If you go back to those transactions that moved out and you heard Mike talked earlier about some of the other products, an example, a lot of the existing not new products, they grow via capacity growth, which is ELA driven. So to the degree that those ELAs naturally are going to happen in the back of the year, a lot of the growth of the traditional products will happen in the capacity. As Mike said, it's been lumpy. The first half of the year, we actually saw some good growth in some of our more traditional products. So those -- so we are not giving up on that product set at all. We do see that just happening more still in tune with the natural expiration date. I think as far as North America, North America still needs to continue to grow outside of renewals, but the platinum accounts actually did well around the world in all quarters. So they're tied to the renewal cycle, but they performed well, and we saw growth in our named accounts."

But when I can see us turning Asia Pac, turning EMEA, platinum working pretty much across the globe and North America, especially in the named and growth being spotty where it works really, really well with some territories and some executives and it doesn't work nearly as well with some territories and some executives, it gives me confidence that if I can understand that and get more products and continue to improve customer satisfaction, Net Promoter Scores, that we'll be able to get this company to grow. The other thing, too, in the category of no good deed goes unpunished, we have become a mature disciplined company. So some of these renewals that customers wanted to do in Q4, the economics were not in our favor. And I've really pushed hard to not discount these new products. These new products are of high value. We're selling them across the globe. And just because you've had an ELA and an experience with CA where at the end of our Q4, you want to squeeze us on economics, I'm just not willing to give up that kind of value. And I think that was a little bit of a different performance that customers have seen from CA than they have seen in the past. So hopefully, that gives you a little bit more color on the machinations that go into running CA."

At the end of the day, you want to hold the value of your highest-performing products and make sure that the market doesn't deteriorate and commoditize them. The other thing is we have a huge event called CA World where we bring all of our customers together. And if you start selling software like rugs at a Turkish bazaar, you are not considered to be an honest broker and you eventually get into a cycle where your product commoditizes quicker than you want it to, and then you stop investing in R&D. And then when you stop investing in R&D, you get taken over by competitors. I've seen that happen so much in our industry that I think you have to take a stand on where is value. And if you hold the line in value and you also hold the line on the value of the ELA, these ELAs drive an incredible amount of value for our customers. And you want to be in a situation where you're negotiating fairly but you don't want to give up the economics just to make a number for one particular quarter when you're giving up the long-term and medium-term value of your company."

It's faster for us to get to. If you look at it from the G&A functions, we actually came down and we'll come down again. And that's the normal pattern we'll continue to drive to.

First of all, the thought process here is after operating the company for a while and taking a look at the last 2 years and really taking a look at the last 2 quarters and thinking about the velocity that we keep talking about, are we getting new products and differentiated products to the market as quickly as I would like it to be, and secondly, listening to customers of the kinds of problems that they want us to solve. And most of those problems that they want us to solve have to do with complexity. And what is unique about CA is we truly can go from mobile to mainframe. And when you think of this Application Economy, driving from mobile to mainframe and trying to reduce complexity, I'll take a look at our organization and it's actually the -- is more complex than I think it should be. In order to -- when we're building products having the mainframe completely separated from the rest of the eSTG product, it became more difficult to think through holistically solving the problems of our customers. When you take a look at a lot of our growth products, API management, for example, most of the targets of the API management product, the product is opening up the transactional processing of the mainframe. Service Virtualization, one of the most popular use cases of that is virtualizing the mainframe. When it comes to Release Automation, there is as much software being released and changed at a higher velocity on the mainframe as well as the massive amounts of distributed architectures that customers are deploying. So having one person managing all of the products, I think, is an opportunity for us to make sure when we go to a customer, we're going to that customer with one voice. Now talk to a big job and to have that one person think of all of the products and the nuances of our products and also worry about our platform and the technical platform that's going to be required 1 to 2 years out, I didn't feel that we would be best served by having 1 person do that. So I've had to search out for a CTO now for probably about 1.5 months to 2 months, and I've seen an incredible number of candidates. And as I'm looking through those candidates, I think that we're going to have an opportunity to up our game and up our ability to serve our customers. Now the other thing is underneath that Chief Product Officer is all of our general managers, and they're not changing around. This is a group that is definitely committed to understanding modern software development, and their focus in life is to make sure they're building products that are easy to use, easy to install, easier to sell, try and buy. And I don't see that changing at all going forward. It's more just a -- more of a logical view of listening to customers and positioning ourselves for accelerated growth. Does that answer your question and help you get an understanding for why go through this change?"

You go take a look at the industry analyst reports, they constantly hold us out as the volume player for almost every enterprise and vertical. So we feel very good about our Security business.

But in summary, I would take a look at the quarter and the year as qualitative and quantitative success. From a qualitative perspective, we have a lot of margin expansion, 0.75 points. That's showing the continued efficiency. We had CFFO growth. We returned over 65% of our free cash flow to shareholders. Named account performance and traction is in double digits. We have healthy attach rates to our renewals, and I think that's a big testament to the work that the team has done over the last year to improve our Net Promoter Score. The growth products are both 16% growing year-over-year. And in Q4, most of them were in the high 20s. And we've completed the FY '14 rebalancing actions. So when I take a look at the year in general for FY '15, a lot of qualitative performance that I think the team is really proud. But at the end of the day, it does have to show up in the quantitative results, and we are very committed to drive growth. So when you think of 2014, things we have to look forward to, we have 2% points [ph] of margin expansion. We've seen the ES revenue trajectory go from negative to start moving into the positive, EMEA revenue turning to positive in FY '16, a strong renewal portfolio in FY '16 and strong CFFF (sic) [CFFO] growth.

During fiscal year 2015, we focused our efforts on our go-to-market strategy, introduced new products and strengthened relationships with our customers. As demonstrated by this quarter's results, however, we s",1588,"Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. During fiscal year 2015, we focused our efforts on our go-to-market strategy, introduced new products and strengthened relationships with our customers. As demonstrated by this quarter's results, however, we still have work to do to drive the kind of growth that our company has the potential to achieve.
I'm convinced that we have set in place the appropriate strategy to transform CA and return it to growth. Over the last 2 years, we have significantly improved the underlying efficiency of our business. In fiscal year 2016, we will make the required investments to drive innovation while continuing to demonstrate financial discipline by expanding full year non-GAAP operating margins by 2 percentage points to 39%, excluding the impact of any future material acquisitions. Over the medium term, we will bring to market new products that will help our customers succeed in the Application Economy, and we are confident that we can achieve sustainable low- to mid-single-digit cash flow growth.
Turning to our fourth quarter results. Total new sales decreased in the high-single digits year-over-year. Relative to our expectations, this decline was mainly the result of a headwind from the timing of our renewal portfolio, which was down in the low-single-digits range year-over-year. And as we have said in the past, a large percentage of our new sales are still attached to renewal opportunities. While we had expected the renewal portfolio to be up in the 20% range for the quarter, we closed a substantially lower number of future-quarter renewals than historical levels. These renewals, primarily large deals within North America and EMEA, were not competitive losses and are expected to close within their natural expiration during fiscal 2016. We expect the renewal portfolio to be up in the mid-teens for fiscal 2016.
Let me provide you with a deeper insight into our strategy to deliver differentiated solutions, improve sales execution and increase our velocity.
First, solution development and delivery. We have stated that in order to be a leader in software, delivering next-generation solutions must be the lifeblood of our company. I am beginning to see the evidence of improvement in our ability to organically develop new product offerings and differentiate our products in the market. During fiscal 2015, we released differentiated new products such as Mobile App Analytics and our Cloud Service Management solution. While small in terms of revenue contribution now, these solutions are in the market today and growing significantly.
In the last 2 years, our development team has improved the core products within our portfolio such as CA APM and our on-premise security solutions. While the improvement is yet to be visible in our overall revenue growth, we are seeing positive underlying trends that reinforce my confidence in the business. For example, APM was declining in revenue in fiscal 2013 and 2014. Today, that trajectory has reversed course. APM grew revenue for fiscal 2015 and surpassed the plan we set for it. Over the next 12 months, we have several new or updated products being released in the marketplace such as Identity-as-a-Service solution, new innovation from our API management team, a truly integrated approach to DevOps and Continuous Delivery, as well as meaningful offerings that extend our leading infrastructure management capabilities. We are confident their impact will begin to become visible in our results.
Despite the progress we have made in these key areas, it's clear we need to increase our delivery velocity and achieve even greater leverage from CA product development end-to-end. Over the past couple of quarters, I've come to the conclusion that we and our customers would be better served by a product management model that is more fully aligned. To achieve this, I will be consolidating all of CA product management and development, from mobile to mainframe, under the leadership of a new executive position, the Chief Product Officer. This new leader will have a track record of managing and growing a large portfolio and work closely with the company's Chief Technology Officer, whose role is long-term technology vision, platform management and cross-development processes. Both positions are in the process of being filled, and with these new changes, Amit Chatterjee will be leaving CA.
Turning to sales execution. The attach rate of new sales to renewals held steady for the fiscal year. However, we are still too reliant on large deals with existing large customers. In order for us to reach our medium-term goals, we need to sell to our underserved and new customers, which we refer to as our named and growth accounts. While our fiscal 2015 new sales in our named accounts grew in the low to mid-teens, collectively our named and growth sales teams are not converting pipeline and follow-on transactions at the velocity needed for the company to grow total revenue. We believe this is due to a combination of the following factors, which we have already begun to address. 
First, we need to further improve our brand recognition in the marketplace. Throughout every sector of the economy, software is disrupting traditional business models in what has become an Application Economy. Our Management Cloud, DevOps and Security solutions are empowering enterprises to leverage software applications in all facets of their business. 
For example, our API management solutions are used in the largest car manufacturers in the world to securely allow the automobile to evolve into an infotainment platform and eventually revolutionize into a fully autonomous technology-enabled vehicle. Specifically, these solutions secure the data being transferred into and out of these connected cars. We need to better market the opportunity for our API management solutions to be leveraged in many other emerging API-connected computing environments.
Another example of how brand recognition needs to improve is within DevOps. Our Service Virtualization and Release Automation solutions are allowing customers to move beyond Agile software development and into a continuous delivery software development model. Many of the top enterprises in the world are partnering with us on this journey.
For example, during the quarter, we closed 14 Service Virtualization and Release Automation new sales transactions that were over $500,000, including an $8 million transaction. These wins were across the consumer goods, retail, leisure, financial services and energy industries, but only one was a named account. This is not enough, as there are ample opportunities for $500,000 transactions within our named accounts in each one of these industries. We need to better evangelize the value of our DevOps solutions in the marketplace.
The second area in which we are investing to improve velocity is within inside sales. For many of our new lighter-weight products, we need to better integrate digital marketing with our inside sales organization. Last quarter, we upgraded the leadership of our global inside sales organization by appointing a senior executive as its new head. In addition, we shifted investment to hire more quota-carrying inside sales reps, who are focused on converting digitally generated leads, building more pipeline and driving new business. We believe these changes will both lower our cost of sales and increase the velocity of new product sales growth.
The third area in which we are taking steps to improve sales execution is within our partner business. We have revamped our entire partner go-to-market model. The team is now focused on working with a smaller number of highly engaged partners with whom we plan to heavily invest to reach underserved and new customers. For fiscal 2016, we have modest expectations for our partner team, but we are excited about the opportunity ahead of us.
Let me now speak to velocity. As I stated earlier, there are still some areas of our operations that need to move faster. We have formulated a plan of action to address these concerns, which we believe are overshadowing the underlying progress that we are making.
When I look at CA, I see a great deal of qualitative progress that needs to turn into quantitative results. The key qualitative metrics that I look to that give me confidence that we will reach our medium-term goals are as follows. The trajectory of our organic Enterprise Solutions new sales performance has improved and stabilized over the last 2 years. We are seeing better sales execution in APJ and EMEA. During fiscal 2015, they were both able to meet the plans we set for them. Our market studies are showing steady and meaningful gains in name recognition. A recent Wall Street Journal corporate perception study, which tracks 662 companies in 50 industries, showed CA moving up 23 points in quality of management; and in overall reputation, a very significant 33 points.
Moving on to industry analysts. CA is being ranked as a leader by firms such as Gartner and Forrester. New sales of our growth products were up in the low mid-teens in FY '15 and more than 1/3 of our total new sales compared to FY '13, when they made up fewer than 20% of new sales. Account coverage continuity is critical to effective sales execution. Therefore, in fiscal 2016, we are not making any wholesale changes in account coverage. We believe our go-to-market strategy is intact, and with a few tweaks to improve sales velocity and close rates, we do not foresee any major changes.
And lastly, where it counts the most, we had high single-digit increase in our Net Promoter Score year-over-year. We intend to do that again this year.
With that, I will turn the call over to Rich for a review our fourth quarter financials and fiscal 2016 full year guidance. Thank you."
262913,292236974,807819,"CA, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, May 07, 2015",2015-05-07,"Earnings Calls","CA, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Mike. Before we get started with the quarter review, let me remind you that all comparisons are year-over-year and in constant currency, unless otherwise indicated. This afternoon, I'm going to focus my comments on the key business drivers and",1245,"Thank you, Mike. Before we get started with the quarter review, let me remind you that all comparisons are year-over-year and in constant currency, unless otherwise indicated. This afternoon, I'm going to focus my comments on the key business drivers and performance indicators for the quarter. The balance of our financial details can be found in our supplemental and press release.
As many of you are aware, the dollar continues to strengthen against most major currencies, which negatively impacts both our results and guidance. Our Q4 total revenue was $1.02 billion and was down 1%. Mainframe was down 2%. Enterprise Solutions was up 2% and Services declined 3%. Fiscal 2015 total revenue was $4.26 billion and was down 2%, in line with our guidance of down 2% to down 1%. Mainframe was down 2%. Enterprise Solutions was down 1%, and Services declined 6%.
Q4 renewals were down in the low-single digits and down high-single digits as reported. As Mike stated earlier, while we expected the renewal portfolio to be up in the 20% range, we closed a substantially lower number of future-year renewals than planned. And as we previously stated, the year-over-year change in our renewal bookings can vary on a quarterly basis due to the timing of large transactions.
Q4 total new product and capacity sales were down approximately high-single digits and low teens as reported. This is due mainly to the headwinds from the renewal portfolio, lack of performance selling outside the renewal opportunity and a headwind from macro weakness in Latin America.
Fiscal 2015 renewals were down in the high teens and down in the low 20s as reported. Fiscal 2015 new product and capacity sales were down mid-single digits and down slightly more, just into the high single-digit range as reported. The renewal yield during the quarter was in the low 90% range and at or above 90% during each quarter of the fiscal year. 
We expect fiscal 2016 renewals to be up mid-teens year-over-year as compared to fiscal 2015 and up low-single digits year-over-year, excluding a large system integrator renewal that is expected to close in Q4 fiscal 2016. As reported, we expect fiscal 2016 renewals to be up approximately 10% year-over-year as compared to fiscal 2015, including a large system integrator renewal that is expected to close in Q4 of fiscal 2016.
From a geographic basis, during the quarter, we saw continued improvement from our EMEA team sales execution as they grew new sales year-over-year this quarter. For the full year, excluding the impact of currency, EMEA new sales were up mid-single digits, and we were encouraged with their underlying performance. While Asia fell short of our expectations for Q4, for the full year, they surpassed our expectations. However, North America fell short of our expectations, mainly due to weakness selling outside the renewal opportunity. Latin America performance was again below expectations set at the beginning of the year, which we believe is mainly a result of macro-related headwinds in the region.
In our Mainframe segment, Q4 Mainframe new sales, including new product and capacity, were down mid-single digits in constant currency and down low teens as reported. Fiscal 2015 Mainframe new sales, including new product and capacity, were down high-single digits in constant currency and approximately 10% as reported. Overall, we expect our Mainframe revenue growth to be down low-single digits over the medium term, which we believe is in line with the mainframe market.
Q4 Enterprise Solutions' new product sales were down high-single digits in constant currency and down low teens as reported. Fiscal 2015 Enterprise Solutions' new product sales were down mid-single digit in constant currency and as reported. As Mike stated, the decline in Enterprise Solutions' new product sales is mainly a result of headwinds from the renewal portfolio and weaknesses selling outside the renewal opportunity.
Services revenue decreased 3% and 6% for the quarter and the year, respectively. As we previously stated, the primary driver of the decline during fiscal 2015 is due to us deemphasizing noncore government services subcontracting engagements, which are not directly related to software sales. Going forward, we expect lower Services bookings to be a headwind to fiscal 2016 revenue. Over the longer term, we expect a negative impact to our Services revenue growth as we design our products to be easier to install and leverage partners for more Services engagements.
Current revenue backlog was down 3%. Current revenue backlog was impacted by lower-than-expected fourth quarter renewals and lower Services bookings. As I've said before, consistent year-over-year growth in current revenue backlog is one of the indicators of future revenue growth. Current revenue backlog is likely to grow when we demonstrate multiple quarters of new sales growth while maintaining a low 90s renewal yield.
Q4 non-GAAP operating margin was 32% and GAAP operating margin was 21%. Fiscal 2015 non-GAAP operating margin was 37% and GAAP operating margin was 27%. Fiscal 2015 segment operating margins were 59% for Mainframe Solutions, 11% for Enterprise Solutions and 3% for Services. Our Q4 non-GAAP tax rate was 23% and our GAAP tax rate was 28%.
Q4 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.56, down 11% year-over-year. Fiscal 2015 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $2.53, down 15% year-over-year. The decrease in our non-GAAP EPS is driven by a lower non-GAAP tax rate in fiscal 2014. Q4 GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.33, up 48%. Fiscal 2015 GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.82, down 5%.
Our Q4 CFFO was $485 million, up 8%. Single-installment cash payments were $191 million and up year-over-year. Fiscal 2015 CFFO was $1,030,000,000, up 9% and in line with our guidance of 5% to 12% year-over-year growth.
We ended Q4 with approximately $1.4 billion in net cash. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased $90 million in shares, paid $111 million in dividends. We repurchased $215 million in shares in fiscal 2015 and paid $444 million in dividends, which represents over 65% of our free cash flow. We have $785 million remaining of our original $1 billion share repurchase program.
Turning to guidance. Guidance is based upon exchange rates at the last day of the preceding quarter, which is March 31, 2015. This includes a partial hedge of operating income.
We expect currency to have a negative impact to our full year fiscal 2016 revenue of approximately 5% as of March 31 rates. Total revenue is expected to decrease 2% in constant currency. This translates to reported revenue of $3.95 billion to $3.99 billion.
Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to grow 2% to 5% in constant currency. This translates to reported non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.38 to $2.45. GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to grow 12% to 17%. This translates to reported GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.83 to $1.90.
Cash flow from operations is expected to increase 2% to 7% in constant currency. This translates to reported cash flow from operations of $970 million to $1.01 billion.
Guidance does not include the effect of any future material acquisitions. Underlining this guidance, we expect our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates to be between 28% to 29%. We expect full year GAAP operating margin of 30% and full year non-GAAP operating margin of 39%.
At the end of the year, we expect approximately 433 million shares outstanding and a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 437 million.

The growth products have continued to do well, they did very well in Q4. When you take a look at Release Automation, Service Virtualization, API management had an extraordinary quarter in the mid-30s growth. Service Virtualization was in the high 20s. And then we had good performance by some of our more mature products with -- Security was up in the low 20s and e-commerce had the best quarter that, well, we've ever had. Over the course of the year, we've seen a lot of lumpiness in some of our value products. The big standout there is APM management -- API management. It had the -- a really, really strong quarter, grew above our plan for the year. And if you remember, this particular product was shrinking 2 years ago, and we've definitely got it into a place where we're definitely seeing growth and continue to see growth. So if I was to characterize those as the big winners, and thematically, the newer products are selling very well and a little bit of lumpiness in some of the value products."

I would characterize it as the last 2 years we spent really getting operationally sound. And when you take a look at our confidence in getting to 39%, it's now we're at a point where we're pretty much steady stream. I still think there's room for improvement down the road with respect to the Enterprise segment, but that's got to be associated with growth. So we've been focused over the last 2 years completely on organic growth. So getting to that 39% from an organic perspective, I think, is where the company is operating very, very well. Net Promoter Score's gone up. The talent that we've been able to attract to the company and the talent that we had in the company is operating at what I would consider to be pretty much best of class. When you take a look at where we spend revenue on a percentage basis -- of where we spend as a percentage of revenue in all the categories, I'm feeling much more comfortable about that. So now we've got a very good platform in which we can start layering on growth. The new products that we've been investing in and building out over the last year are coming to market. We have a number of products we'll be launching at CA World, so I feel good about that. So to get to the 39%, I think we've got a little bit more work ahead of us coming into the quarter -- coming into the next quarter or 2. But I feel pretty confident. Organically, we're in a good spot to get to that kind of operating margin."

And to the extent that we see products and companies in the market that make sense to our strategy and hit our internal hurdle rates with respect to valuation, I feel very confident I've got a management team that can execute. Going back to my -- the previous answer I talked about on how we're improving the operations, I think we've cleaned up a lot of those types of issues. So we have the ability to be able to do that. And the other thing that should be very clear, I talked about it in the prepared remarks, is we made our plan on EMEA, which is the first time that we've done that in an awful long time. I think the EMEA team has done a very, very good job, getting very serious about how our products need to be represented in that market. So that's a confidence builder.

Because renewals are supposed to be up in the mid-teens for next year right now, which I think is a little bit better than you thought it would be and -- which makes sense because of the slippage of renewals from this quarter into next. Previously, you had said that revenue would not grow on a constant currency basis, and now you're saying it's going to decline a couple of percent on a constant currency basis. And I think about those renewals pushing from this quarter to next quarter, and it's a big delta, right? I mean, it was supposed to be up, I think, around -- I mean, we thought around 15%, 20%. Now it's down in the high-single digits. So that would hurt this year and help next year relative to this year. Not a lot. I realize the timing of the year, but a little bit anyway. And I'm just curious as to why revenue is -- the outlook is a little bit worse than -- at least on the margin. I don't know. When you said it wasn't going to grow, it could mean it could decline, but you could have said it's going to decline, too. Are you sort of just assuming, Mike, some of the stuff that happened here? Or it's just going to take longer? It wasn't just renewals and does it takes longer to fix over the course of next year?"

It's taken a bit longer to get some of this product traction and getting the sales environment to sell consistently. When I look across the board, as I said, I was super happy with EMEA. They've been able to sell outside of the renewal. They've been able to sell standalone. In the U.S., we have pockets where it worked well and pockets where it didn't work so well. In order for us to get to that growth, we have to keep our fingers on several levers, and I talked about that in the prepared remarks. Number one is we have to get net new product that is in tune to what a customer wants to buy. So we need more net new products to offset some of the legacy products, and we're on that all day, every day. And secondly, we have to have more consistency in our sales operations. It's not okay to be good in certain territories and not good in other territories. This is something I'm spending an awful lot of time on with the sales leadership team, and we're going to be focused on that to get the kind of consistent result. Now there's a number of mechanics, some of which you already pointed out. I'll get Rich to talk about some of the mechanics that show up in the CA model."

They'd be in their calendar year. Those transactions, we now -- they did not occur in the quarter. So we didn't lose any of those. They just will now happen at their normal expiration date. Most of those expiration dates are back-half loaded. So as opposed to closing a transaction in Q4 of fiscal '15, we plumb them now that the majority of those will close in Q3, Q4. With the ratable model, you can see if that pushes. So that's just a statement of about 2/3 of that booking change. But there is 1/3 of that booking change, as Mike talked about, where we didn't do as well in North America freestanding, and Services continues to be a drag. Services is a drag of about 0.5 point. So mechanically, those are the things that drove the change just in the overall bookings. On a positive note, Mike alluded to earlier it though, if you look at our new sales, about 1/3 of that now is our new fast-growing product set. So as that product set becomes a bigger and bigger part of the overall new sales, it will over time overshadow the older products that are either in decline or flat."

If you go back to those transactions that moved out -- and you heard Mike talk earlier about some of the other products. An example, a lot of the existing not new products, they grow via capacity growth, which is ELA driven. So to the degree that those ELAs naturally are going to happen in the back of the year, a lot of the growth of the traditional products will happen in the capacity. As Mike said, it's been lumpy. The first half of the year, we actually saw some good growth in some of our more traditional products. So those -- so we are not giving up on that product set at all. We do see that just happening more still in tune with the natural expiration date. I think as far as North America, North America still needs to continue to grow outside of renewals, but the platinum accounts actually did well around the world in all quarters. So they're tied to the renewal cycle, but they performed well, and we saw growth in our named accounts."

And to think that we haven't played around with some of those ideas would be naïve. So the way I would also look at it is this way. If I saw consistent poor performance on a global basis, I would be more apt to take a look at a different strategy. But when I can see us turning Asia Pac, turning EMEA, platinum working pretty much across the globe and North America, especially in the named and growth, being spotty, where it works really, really well with some territories and some executives and it doesn't work nearly as well with some territories and some executives, it gives me confidence that if I can understand that and get more products and continue to improve customer satisfaction, Net Promoter Scores, that we'll be able to get this company to grow. The other thing, too, in the category of no good deed goes unpunished, we have become a mature disciplined company. So some of these renewals that customers wanted to do in Q4, the economics were not in our favor. And I've really pushed hard to not discount these new products. These new products are of high value. We're selling them across the globe. And just because you've had an ELA and an experience with CA where, at the end of our Q4, you want to squeeze us on economics, I'm just not willing to give up that kind of value. And I think that was a little bit of a different performance that customers have seen from CA than they have seen in the past. So hopefully, that gives you a little bit more color on the machinations that go into running CA."

The other thing is we have a huge event called CA World where we bring all of our customers together. And if you start selling software like rugs at a Turkish bazaar, you are not considered to be an honest broker and you eventually get into a cycle where your product commoditizes quicker than you want it to, and then you stop investing in R&D. And then when you stop investing in R&D, you get taken over by competitors. I've seen that happen so much in our industry that I think you have to take a stand on where is value. And if you hold the line on the value and you also hold the line on the value of the ELA, these ELAs drive an incredible amount of value for our customers. And you want to be in a situation where you're negotiating fairly, but you don't want to give up the economics just to make a number for one particular quarter when you're giving up the long-term and medium-term value of your company."

It's faster for us to get to. If you look at it from the G&A functions, we actually came down and we'll come down again. And that's the normal pattern we'll continue to drive to. We're very comfortable with the 39%. And remember, and you'll see it tomorrow in the K, there's $40 million worth of people that left the company that we had to pay for in the last year's number, which comes out of the run rate.

First of all, the thought process here is, after operating the company for a while and taking a look at the last 2 years and really taking a look at the last 2 quarters and thinking about the velocity that we keep talking about, are we getting new products and differentiated products to the market as quickly as I would like it to be? And secondly, listening to customers of the kinds of problems that they want us to solve. And most of those problems that they want us to solve have to do with complexity. And what is unique about CA is we truly can go from mobile to mainframe. And when you think of this Application Economy, driving from mobile to mainframe and trying to reduce complexity, I took a look at our organization and it's actually the -- is more complex than I think it should be. In order to -- when we're building products, having the mainframe completely separated from the rest of the eSTG product, it became more difficult to think through holistically solving the problems of our customers. When you take a look at a lot of our growth products, API management, for example, most of the targets of the API management product, the product is opening up the transactional processing of the mainframe. Service Virtualization, one of the most popular use cases of that is virtualizing the mainframe. When it comes to Release Automation, there is as much software being released and changed at a higher velocity on the mainframe as well as the massive amounts of distributed architectures that customers are deploying. So having one person managing all of the products, I think, is an opportunity for us to make sure when we go to a customer, we're going to that customer with one voice. Now it's also a big job, and to have that one person think of all of the products and the nuances of our products and also worry about our platform and the technical platform that's going to be required 1 to 2 years out, I didn't feel that we would be best served by having 1 person do that. So I've had to search out for a CTO now for probably about 1.5 months to 2 months, and I've seen an incredible number of candidates. And as I'm looking through those candidates, I think that we're going to have an opportunity to up our game and up our ability to serve our customers. Now the other thing is underneath that Chief Product Officer is all of our general managers, and they're not changing around. This is a group that is definitely committed to understanding modern software development. And their focus in life is to make sure they're building products that are easy to use, easy to install, easier to sell, try and buy. And I don't see that changing at all going forward. It's more just a -- more of a logical view of listening to customers and positioning ourselves for accelerated growth. Does that answer your question and help you get an understanding for why go through this change?"

When you think about what has happened over the last 18 months, identities have become the savior for most companies. So the fact that they can understand who's using their systems and who has the authorization to use those systems and understanding privileged identity, that is an absolute superstrong spot for us to be. When it comes to managing identities at volume and at scale, we are by far the #1 player in that space. You go take a look at the industry analyst reports, they constantly hold us out as the volume player for almost every enterprise and vertical. So we feel very good about our Security business.

But in summary, I would take a look at the quarter and the year as qualitative and quantitative success. From a qualitative perspective, we have a lot of margin expansion, 0.75 points. That's showing the continued efficiency. We had CFFO growth. We returned over 65% of our free cash flow to shareholders. Named account performance and traction is in double digits. We have healthy attach rates to our renewals, and I think that's a big testament to the work that the team has done over the last year to improve our Net Promoter Score. The growth products are both 16% growing year-over-year. And in Q4, most of them were in the high 20s. And we've completed the FY '14 rebalancing actions. So when I take a look at the year in general for FY '15, a lot of qualitative performance that I think the team is really proud of. But at the end of the day, it does have to show up in the quantitative results, and we are very committed to drive growth. So when you think of 2014 [ph], things we have to look forward to, we have 2% points [ph] of margin expansion. We've seen the ES revenue trajectory go from negative to start moving into the positive, EMEA revenue turning to positive in FY '16, a strong renewal portfolio in FY '16 and strong CFFF (sic) [CFFO] growth.
So with that, I want to thank you for your time, and we'll be talking to you in the field. I think we're out on the market talking to a number of investors in a number of shows, and we'll be able to answer your questions more further then. Take care."

We had an encouraging first quarter driven by improved sales execution, strong operating margin performance and continued progress towards achieving our long-term goals. While our overall first quarter total new sales were down mid-single digits year-over-year, Enterprise Solutions new sales were up low-single digits over the year. This was offset by mainframe new sales, which were down in the high teens. 
The decline in mainframe new sales was in line with our expectations. Mainframe capacity was negatively impacted by both the decline and composition of our Q1 renewal portfolio as well as a renewal with a large North American financial institution that required less capacity following a merger that occurred multiple years ago. That said, our outlook for the Mainframe business remains unchanged as we continue to expect mainframe revenue to be down low-single digits over the medium term, which we believe is in-line with the mainframe market. 
Non-GAAP operating margin was 41% in the quarter as we remain focused on efficient execution and financial discipline. Although I am pleased with the efficiency of the business and encouraged by the improvement in Enterprise new sales, we still have work to do to drive the kind of growth that our company has the potential to achieve. Our recent results only partly capture the traction we are experiencing in the field and the strong market opportunity in front of the company. 
The disruption of traditional business models is clearly accelerating as enterprises across the globe are embracing the Application Economy to drive innovation. CA solutions enable enterprises to capitalize on the opportunities created by this Application Economy, where software is the competitive differentiator and application development is the driver of innovation. Let me provide you with more insight into the progress we're making towards our strategy to deliver differentiated solutions, improve sales execution and increase our velocity. 
First, in product development, we have stated that in order to be a leader in the next generation of software, innovation must be the lifeblood of our company. The recent hiring of Otto Berkes as our new Chief Technology Officer signals our intent to accelerate organic innovation and enrich CA's long-term technology vision. Otto's experience as Chief Technology Officer at HBO and his 18-year tenure at Microsoft, where he was one of the 4 original innovators of Xbox, exemplifies the talent we are attracting that will be critical in helping us achieve our longer-term product development goals. 
I am also very pleased that Ayman Sayed will be joining CA as the Chief Product Officer on August 10. Ayman comes to us from Cisco, where he was the Senior Vice President of Network Operating Systems Technology Group, leading the development of network operating software, in which nearly every Cisco networking product runs. Ayman is a very accomplished executive, who oversaw the vision and engineering direction for Cisco's software strategy. He has experience with Agile software development and pioneered the Internet of Things innovation at Cisco. At CA, he will work closely with Otto to create the best-in-class products. Their teamwork and focus will drive organic technology and product development, which continues to be our priority and help CA's customers gain advantage in the Application Economy. 
To complement our organic road map, we recently enhanced our internal development capabilities with 3 transactions. We characterized 2 of the deals as technology tuck-ins that expand our capabilities in Security and DevOps. The acquisition of Rally, which closed a few weeks ago, represents a more significant investment. By adding Rally's award-winning cloud-based Agile development platform and its transformation consultants and coaches to the fold, CA becomes an industry leader in the fast growing Agile application Life-Cycle Management software market. Importantly, this acquisition also adds product and service capabilities that are highly complementary to our award-winning PPM solution and strengthens CA's existing DevOps leadership. 
With less than 5% customer overlap in our platinum accounts, Rally's, best-of-breed technology and unmatched scalability provides ample opportunity to cross sell into these strategically important accounts as well as cross sell our solutions into their install base. I am confident that Rally is a natural, strategic fit for CA. Our products and go-to-market methods align well, and equally as important, Rally's culture and focus on delivering high-quality solutions mirrors ours. 
To maintain the current momentum, the Rally organization and its leadership team will continue to report to Tim Miller in his new position as General Manager, and over time, will be fully integrated into CA. Later during the call, Rich will discuss rally's impact to our fiscal 2016 guidance. 
Our management cloud solutions experienced success in the quarter and our solutions continue to be recognized for their leadership in the space. For example, in the quarter, CA PPM was designated as a leader in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for IT Project and Portfolio Management software. In addition, during Q1, CA PPM had several high-profile wins such as the competitive replacement with Delta Airlines that is leveraging our technology to automate the vast number of complex business process across a multitude of different internal organizations. Equally impressive was a win with Macy's, which required enterprise-wide PPM to provide a common system of record and process for all business and IT projects. Overall, I'm encouraged by the improved execution during the quarter and I look forward to updating you on integration of Rally and our product road maps through this fiscal year. 
Turning to DevOps. The new release of CA APM 10 and CA UIM 8.3 feature compelling, new user interfaces and analytics to facilitate collaboration in dynamic environments. Specifically, these new integrated solutions dramatically improve the ease of use for IT operations teams by providing the speed and scale organizations need to rapidly deploy new applications, monitor dynamic environments and continuously optimize application quality to ensure superb customer experiences. 
Let me briefly highlight our continued APM success. I am pleased to report that APM's positive momentum has continued in fiscal 2016. In the quarter, the product posted impressive new sales growth of approximately 20%. Our fiscal Q1 release of APM 10 was a highlight in a brief to market new capabilities that accelerate customers' DevOps initiatives. Key patent pending functionality added to APM 10 include: A completely redesigned user interface that enables first level production support personnel to resolve production problems much more effectively; analytics technology designed to reduce the skill level required for troubleshooting; unique time line functionality that quickly correlates performance issues with past app changes. This is differentiated technology that enables DevOps teams to receive recommended fixes in real-time, a must-have in the highly dynamic world of cloud and micro services. 
I am very excited about our continued success in APM and the launch of APM 10. Importantly, customers in the broader market share enthusiasm. For example, just a few weeks ago, CA APM was featured as the #1 APM product by Dow Jones newswire based on the number of customer reviews on crowdsourced review site, IT Central. 
Our security pillar demonstrated consistent execution during the quarter. The need for comprehensive security solutions continues to strengthen worldwide. With the frequency and severity of breaches continuing to impact enterprises across the globe, companies are looking to software firms like CA to provide guidance on how to protect their users and data. 
Leveraging our position within security and application delivery, our API management solutions continue to gain mind share. During the quarter, CA was positioned in the leaders' quadrant of the Gartner Magic Quadrant for Application Services Governance for our API management product. APIs allow customers to modernize existing architectures and connect to hybrid cloud applications and mobile devices, while unlocking the value of data. We are a leader in this fast growing opportunity as we can provide API management solutions to scale and security levels needed for the massive amount of data traversing these newly-created digital platforms. For example, after an extensive evaluation of the top vendors in the API management market, a leader in the peer-to-peer lending FinTech space chose CA's API management for ease of use, flexibility and security profile. We see many API management opportunities like this emerging in the marketplace. 
Now let's turn to the second piece of our strategy: sales execution. During Q1, we saw continuing evidence that our decision to separate platinum accounts from our named and growth accounts, and to specialize sales by product discipline, is yielding results. The highlight for the quarter from a sales perspective was the accelerated new sales growth from our named and growth sales teams. Importantly, participation within these combined customer accounts was broad as every geography grew double digits during Q1. Worldwide, these more seasoned sales teams increased deal counts, improved pipeline conversion rates and improved win rates on a year-over-year basis. Additionally, inside sales demonstrated an impressive performance as the team substantially increased its participation in closing business during the quarter. This is important and exciting progress for our company. It's a key indicator of the value of our products and consistent performance from these customer accounts is critical to the success of our strategy. 
Finally, let me address velocity. While Q1 represents progress towards our long-term goals, we still need to move faster in some areas. Our focus on brand awareness and demand generation are vital to improving CA's velocity. 
Let me briefly highlight a recent success our marketing team has experienced. During the quarter, our digital marketing team won the highest accolade in demand generation marketing, Marketo’s Revvie. Winning this award represents our marketing team's use of next-generation technology to push the status quo and help CA break away from the competition. 
Before I conclude, let me be the first to invite you to CA World 2015 at Mandalay Bay, Las Vegas. CA World '15 is bringing the brightest minds in the Application Economy together. Building off our success from last year, this year's event will showcase several new organically developed solutions that will help our customers develop and manage apps and modern IT infrastructures with confidence in definition economy. I hope you will join me in Las Vegas on November 16 through to November 20. 
On balance, our first quarter results and qualitative indicators reinforce my confidence that our improvement in product quality is resonating with customers. In fact, our global net promoter score improved in all geographies and increased more than 10 points year-over-year. During fiscal 2016, we will build upon our progress by focusing on innovation, execution and speed to compete and win in the Application Economy. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Rich to review our first quarter financials and full year guidance. Thank you."

Before we get started with the quarter review, let me remind you that all comparisons are year-over-year and in constant currency unless otherwise indicated. This afternoon, I'm going to focus my comments on the key business drivers and p",1058,"Thank you, Mike. Before we get started with the quarter review, let me remind you that all comparisons are year-over-year and in constant currency unless otherwise indicated. This afternoon, I'm going to focus my comments on the key business drivers and performance indicators for the quarter. The balance of our financial details can be found in our supplemental and press release. 
As many of you are aware, the dollar continues to strengthen against most major currencies, which negatively impacts both our results and guidance. Our Q1 total revenue was $977 million and was down 3%. Enterprise Solutions declined 2%, and Mainframe Solutions and Services were each down 3%. Q1 renewals were down in the mid-single digits and down in the low teens as reported. 
As we have previously stated, the year-over-year changes in our renewal bookings can vary on a quarterly basis due to the timing of large transactions. Q1 total new product and capacity sales were down in the mid-single digits and approximately 10% as reported. This is due mainly to headwinds from the renewal portfolio. Renewal yield for the quarter was in the mid-80% range. The lower-than-historical average renewal yield was the result of a large renewal with the North American financial institution that required less capacity following a merger that occurred multiple years back. Excluding this one transaction, our renewal yield was in the mid-90% range. 
We continue to expect fiscal 2016 renewals to be up mid-teens year-over-year as compared to fiscal 2015 and up low-single digits year-over-year, excluding the large system integrator renewal that is expected to close in fiscal 2016. As reported, we expect fiscal 2016 renewals to be up approximately 10% year-over-year as compared to fiscal 2015, including a large system integrator renewal that is expected to close in fiscal 2016. 
Turning to the geographies. We experienced an improvement in new sales in Latin America in spite of the macro headwinds in the region. However, sales in EMEA and North America were down, reflecting both decline and composition of the renewal portfolio in Q1. 
In our Mainframe segment, Q1 mainframe new sales, including new product and capacity, were down high teens in constant currency and down in the mid-to 20% range as reported. Overall, we continue to expect our Mainframe revenue to be down low-single digits over the medium term, which we believe is in-line with the mainframe market. 
Q1 Enterprise Solutions new product sales were up low-single digits in constant currency and down mid-single digits as reported. The improvement in Enterprise Solutions' new product sales was mainly a result of improvement in sales outside our renewal process. 
Services revenue decreased 3% in constant currency and 9% as reported. We expect lower services bookings in fiscal 2015 to be a headwind to fiscal 2016 revenue. Over the long term, we expect Services revenue to decline as we design our products to be easier to install and leverage partners for more service engagements. 
Current revenue backlog was down 3%. Current revenue backlog was impacted by headwinds from a large system integrator expected to be renewed later in fiscal 2016 and lower fiscal 2015 services bookings. As I've said before, consistent year-over-year growth and current revenue backlog is one of the indicators of future revenue growth. Current revenue backlog will likely grow when we demonstrate multiple quarters of new sales growth, while maintaining a low 90% renewal yield. 
Q1 non-GAAP operating margin was 41% and GAAP operating margin was 31%. Segment operating margin in the quarter were 62% from Mainframe Solutions, 14% for Enterprise Solutions and 10% for Services. Q1 non-GAAP tax rate was 29% and our GAAP tax rate was 30%. Q1 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.64, up 9% year-over-year. Q1 GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.47, up 15%. 
Our Q1 CFFO was $188 million, up 38%. Single installment cash payments were $37 million and down year-over-year. We ended Q1 with approximately $1.4 billion in net cash. 
During the first quarter, we repurchased 50 million in shares and paid $110 million in dividend. We have $735 million remaining in our original 1 billion share repurchase program. Subsequent to Q1, we drew down $400 million from our $1 billion revolver in conjunction with the close of our acquisition of Rally. 
Now turning to guidance. Guidance is based upon exchange rates in the last day of the preceding quarter, which was June 30, 2015. This includes a partial hedge of operating income. This guidance also includes acquisition of Rally software, which closed earlier this month and assumes no incremental material acquisitions. We expect currency to have a negative impact in our full year fiscal 2016 revenue of approximately 4% at June 30's rates. 
Total revenue is expected to be down 1% to flat in constant currency compared to our previous guidance of down 2% and constant currency. This translates to reported revenue of $4.04 billion to $4.11 billion. We expect a full year GAAP operating margin of 28% compared to our prior expectation of 30% and full year non-GAAP operating margin of 38% compared to our prior expectation of 39%. As previously disclosed, this 1 point decrease in our full year non-GAAP operating margin reflects the Rally acquisition. We expect the majority of this impact to be realized in our fiscal Q2. 
We expect Q2 margins to be negatively impacted by foreign exchange headwinds. And recall, our fiscal Q4 margin was negatively impacted by our Q4 fiscal 2015 severance actions. 
Underlining this guidance, we expect our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates to be between 28% and 29%, consistent with our prior expectations. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to grow 2% to 5%, unchanged from our previous guidance. This translates to reported non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.37 to $2.44. GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to grow 6% to 10% compared to our prior expectation of 12% to 17% growth. This translates to reported GAAP diluted earnings per share up $1.72 to $1.80. 
At the end of the year, we expect approximately 432 million shares outstanding and a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 436 million shares. Cash flow from operations is expected to increase 2% at 7% in constant currency, consistent with our prior expectation. This translates to reported cash flow from operations of $0.98 million to $1.03 billion.

We've been consistent for the last 2 years that we have spent between $300 million and $500 million on acquisition, but our #1 focus is organic development. So if you take a look at this particular quarter, we've had an opportunity to accentuate both of those strategies, doing Rally, which is a big acquisition, at $480-plus million and bring on 2 extraordinarily well-respected technologists, Otto Berkes and Ayman Sayed, shows  that we're plauying both offense and defense here. We want to bring in Rally because we see some really deep synergistic opportunities for us, both on the PPM space and on the DevOps space, coupled with the fact that we see almost every customer driving themselves into the Application Economy. The way they're doing that is by building the software and the way they're building software is through Agile. So we see that as a very unique asset that fits very well with our strategy. And when you take a look at the 2 tuck-ins we brought, both of those tuck-ins are going to need a fair amount of organic engineering in order to get them to scale for the kinds of customers that we sell to as well as the kinds of opportunities to expand a little bit more than the standard deviation outside the core of some of the product that we're looking at. In order to do that, you have to have some very experienced technologists, both on the product side and on the pure technology side, to make sure that you're building on the right platform and truly driving product management. And when I take a look at the combination of Otto and Ayman, I think that puts us in the upper class of the ability to do organic development from a leadership perspective. Does that help answer your question?"

So if there's anything specifically going on, whether it's a certain product that are doing better than others? And then just on how that coincides, because it seems like there was a decline in Enterprise Solutions' upfront revenue. And I would think that the named and growth accounts, given that they're sort of separate outside the renewal cycle, would actually positively impact that trend, and so any additional color will be super helpful."

First of all, it's not any one thing. First, I got to get my hats off to the sales force. We have moved into this year, we said we weren't going to change sales account, we weren't going to go change sales leaders and we weren't going to change the way that we wanted them to sell in the segmentation. So when we walked into this year, we had an experienced sales force on selling to people that they know, understanding how they  buy. And I think that was very important. Secondly, from a product perspective, we have a number of products that are selling very well in the market. I referenced in my call, APM up 20%; API management, we are the #1 player in that space according to industry analysts as well as by financial performance. And then we had a very nice quarter with UIM. So those products sell very well to customers that are not necessarily in the Fortune 50, Fortune 100 and customers that we don't have big relationships with. They are a great entry to those accounts, and I think the combination of both product and our sales force did a really nice job getting into those accounts. The other thing I would remind you off, Stefan, we spent a lot of time, energy and money on marketing. And how do you go find the right people to sell our products, too, and understand what their buying perspectives are? And I think that, that put a lot of air cover and helped make the sales force more productive. The other thing on with the respect to why the upfront revenue didn't happen, I would put into 2 categories and I'll get Rich to comment on it. First of all, our SaaS revenue is increasing. So if you're selling SaaS, you're definitely going to be recognizing that revenue ratably. And then a lot of deals we sold, primarily in APM, those deals went ratably as well. Rich, maybe you have a little bit color on that?"

If you want to be a modern sales -- if you want to be a modern sales force, a modern sales force generates about 80% of their leads, follow their methodology all day, everyday and does the strategic account planning. When I look across the globe at our sales force, we have pockets of brilliance. We have work to do to help people understand that this is important, and for us, to truly penetrate the kind of customers we want. We have to have a full sales force operating at that level of proficiency, and I think there's some work to be done they are. Secondly, on the product side, we have a number of products that are selling well into both the named and growth accounts as well as back into our platinum accounts. What we need to do is have more products, and I think that's what we look at when we've done some of these tuck-in acquisitions. We accentuate our full portfolio.  Purchasing Rally, I think it's going to be a multiyear investment, where there's lots of tangents of where we can take that particular product when you think about analytics with respect to how that works on the Life Cycle portfolio management. And then lastly, some of the products that we have that are -- we had for a long time, big releases are coming out that we're going to be announcing at CA World. So I feel that we finally have some of our product mojo working. We're putting up new products that people want to buy and that are very competitive in the marketplace.

So the mid-90s, if you back that out and the tax rate of the ELAs, but to your point, there are -- it's a light leg quarter, though, fro traditionally in Q1 to light quarter. So that does distort your model, but there was a lot of yield out of that. That being said, we had a similar thing, if you recall, maybe 2 years back.

But DevOps is really a fragmented business, which I think is storming and forming as we move forward. When you take a look at the whole notion of service virtualization, the ability to create synthetic vesting and the whole option of continuous delivery. I think when we look at Agile and you take a look at how we're going to use Rally, that accentuates our position in DevOps, because now we can go directly from product and portfolio management directly into how you build software into driving how you test software, both virtually and through synthetic testing methods, and then driving the whole concept of continuous improvement. Now when you take a look at all that, there's still more things that need to be built in the context with DevOps, and the driving factor is this is speed. As companies move into the Application Economy and their primary deployment mechanism is mobile devices, the trying to build net new apps is decreasing at a pace that I don't think anybody has really understood or taken into an account. And as we start thinking about that problem set, it gives us a lot of opportunity to continue to build on our portfolio. Now when we're talking about competitive competitors, we see most of our competition coming from point competitors that can't stitch together a full DevOps strategy and a full DevOps mission. And we have a whole division built in on that because we think that we're still in early days and there's a lot of innovation that still needs to be built to make that as seamless as possible. Is that helpful?"

If you just take a look at the quarter most recently reported by IBM, they had a pretty significant increase in MIPS. So the platform onto itself is being more used today than it ever was, and that's good for us. The customers that find the mainframe to be a stable, great transaction processor is not fading in any way, shape or form. The number of MIPS that were shipped just last quarter by IBM, I think, exceeded just about everybody's expectations. And we will be a net beneficiary of that phenomenon. As far as how the market goes, we think the market is shrinking, at 1% or 2%. And where we usually make gains is when there's any kind of consolidations going on. We're tended to be one of 2 stable providers that are still investing in pure R&D into the mainframe, but we come across as a very stable and committed vendor and partner to that platform, which may be you're if you're looking at that business, you have something that you want to add?"

And Michael, there's no change in the very, very low end. Those guys continue to drift away at 1% or 2% a year. At the very, very high end, those guys are growing their MIPS double digits and that offsets that low and disappearing.

I know it's a big reporting night and every was really busy, but I'd like to end it with just making sure everyone understands a lot of the positive momentum that we're seeing in the company. The key things that really stand out for me is we've had a growth in the ES new sales. As a matter of fact, we had double-digit growth in the named and growth space and all geographies. The growth in new sales outside of the renewal process exceeded my expectations for the quarter, which is also a big qualitative measure that I look at. We continue to run the business in what I think is a very smart way and very efficient way, with margin of expansion of 1 percentage point. We had great CFFO growth and we continue to see the EMEA team doing a really good job and getting revenue returning to growth. 
Looking forward, I'm super excited about the strategic acquisition of Rally. This improves our revenue guidance by 1 to 2 points. But also I think long term, there's a lot more in the Rally acquisition with respect to the platform that they've built and our ability to take advantage of that platform. We have a strong renewal portfolio in the back half of FY '16 and we continue to see great metrics on our CFFO growth.

We had an encouraging first quarter, driven by improved sales execution, strong operating margin performance and continued progress towards achieving our long-term goals. While our overall first quarter total",1771,"Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. We had an encouraging first quarter, driven by improved sales execution, strong operating margin performance and continued progress towards achieving our long-term goals. While our overall first quarter total new sales were down mid-single digits year-over-year, Enterprise Solutions new sales were up low single digits over the year. This was offset by mainframe new sales, which were down in the high teens.
The decline in mainframe new sales was in line with our expectations. Mainframe capacity was negatively impacted by both a decline in composition of our Q1 renewal portfolio as well as a renewal with a large North American financial institution that required less capacity following a merger that occurred multiple years ago. That said, our outlook for the Mainframe business remains unchanged as we continue to expect mainframe revenue to be down low single digits over the medium term, which we believe is in line with the mainframe market.
Non-GAAP operating margin was 41% in the quarter, as we remain focused on efficient execution and financial discipline. Although I am pleased with the efficiency of the business and encouraged by the improvement in Enterprise new sales, we still have work to do to drive the kind of growth that our company has the potential to achieve. Our recent results only partly capture the traction we are experiencing in the field and the strong market opportunity in front of the company.
The disruption of traditional business models is clearly accelerating as enterprises across the globe are embracing the Application Economy to drive innovation. CA's solutions enable enterprises to capitalize on the opportunities created by this Application Economy, where software is the competitive differentiator and application development is the driver of innovation. Let me provide you with more insight into the progress we're making towards our strategy to deliver differentiated solutions, improve sales execution and increase our velocity.
First, in product development, we have stated that in order to be a leader in the next generation of software, innovation must be the lifeblood of our company. The recent hiring of Otto Berkes as our new Chief Technology Officer signals our intent to accelerate organic innovation and enrich CA's long-term technology vision. Otto's experience as Chief Technology Officer at HBO and his 18-year tenure at Microsoft, where he was one of the 4 original innovators of Xbox, exemplifies the talent we are attracting that will be critical in helping us achieve our longer-term product development goals.
I am also very pleased that Ayman Sayed will be joining CA as the Chief Product Officer on August 10. Ayman comes to us from Cisco, where he was the Senior Vice President of Network Operating Systems Technology Group, leading the development of network operating software on which nearly every Cisco networking product runs. Ayman is a very accomplished executive, who oversaw the vision and engineering direction for Cisco's software strategy. He has experience with Agile software development and pioneered the Internet of Things innovation at Cisco. At CA, he will work closely with Otto to create the best-in-class products. Their teamwork and focus will drive organic technology and product development, which continues to be our priority, and help CA's customers gain advantage in the Application Economy.
To complement our organic roadmap, we recently enhanced our internal development capabilities with 3 transactions. We characterize 2 of the deals as technology tuck-ins that expand our capabilities in Security and DevOps. The acquisition of Rally, which closed a few weeks ago, represents a more significant investment. By adding Rally's award-winning cloud-based Agile development platform and its transformation consultants and coaches to the fold, CA becomes an industry leader in the fast-growing Agile Application Life-Cycle Management software market. Importantly, this acquisition also adds product and service capabilities that are highly complementary to our award-winning PPM solution and strengthens CA's existing DevOps leadership.
With less than 5% customer overlap in our platinum accounts, Rally's best-of-breed technology and unmatched scalability provides ample opportunity to cross-sell into these strategically important accounts as well as cross-sell our solutions into their install base. I am confident that Rally is a natural, strategic fit for CA. Our products and go-to-market methods align well, and equally as important, Rally's culture and focus on delivering high-quality solutions mirrors ours.
To maintain the current momentum, the Rally organization and its leadership team will continue to report to Tim Miller in his new position as General Manager and, over time, will be fully integrated into CA. Later during the call, Rich will discuss Rally's impact to our fiscal 2016 guidance.
Our management cloud solutions experienced success in the quarter, and our solutions continue to be recognized for their leadership in the space. For example, in the quarter, CA PPM was designated as a leader in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for IT Product (sic) [Project] and Portfolio Management software. In addition, during Q1, CA PPM had several high-profile wins such as a competitive replacement with Delta Airlines that is leveraging our technology to automate the vast number of complex business processes across a multitude of different internal organizations. Equally impressive was a win with Macy's, which required enterprise-wide PPM to provide a common system of record and process for all business and IT projects. Overall, I'm encouraged by the improved execution during the quarter, and I look forward to updating you on the integration of Rally and our product roadmaps through this fiscal year.
Turning to DevOps. The new release of CA APM 10 and CA UIM 8.3 feature compelling, new user interfaces and analytics to facilitate collaboration in dynamic environments. Specifically, these new integrated solutions dramatically improve the ease of use for IT operation teams by providing the speed and scale organizations need to rapidly deploy new applications, monitor dynamic environments and continuously optimize application quality to ensure superb customer experiences.
Let me briefly highlight our continued APM success. I am pleased to report that APM's positive momentum has continued in fiscal 2016. In the quarter, the product posted impressive new sales growth of approximately 20%. Our fiscal Q1 release of APM 10 was a highlight, and it brings to market new capabilities that accelerate customers' DevOps initiatives. Key patent pending functionality added to APM 10 include: A completely redesigned user interface that enables first-level production support personnel to resolve production problems much more effectively; analytics technology designed to reduce the skill level required for troubleshooting; unique timeline functionality that quickly correlates performance issues with past app changes. This is differentiated technology that enables DevOps teams to receive recommended fixes in real-time, a must-have in the highly dynamic world of cloud and microservices.
I am very excited about our continued success in APM and the launch of APM 10. Importantly, customers and the broader market share my enthusiasm. For example, just a few weeks ago, CA APM was featured as the #1 APM product by Dow Jones Newswire, based on the number of customer reviews on crowd-sourced review site, IT Central.
Our security pillar demonstrated consistent execution during the quarter. The need for comprehensive security solutions continues to strengthen worldwide. With the frequency and severity of breaches continuing to impact enterprises across the globe, companies are looking to software firms like CA to provide guidance on how to protect their users and data.
Leveraging our position within security and application delivery, our API management solutions continue to gain mind share. During the quarter, CA was positioned in the Leaders Quadrant of the Gartner Magic Quadrant for Application Services Governance for our API management product. APIs allow customers to modernize existing architectures and connect to hybrid cloud applications and mobile devices, while unlocking the value of data. We are a leader in this fast-growing opportunity as we can provide API management solutions at scale and security levels needed for the massive amounts of data traversing these newly-created digital platforms. For example, after an extensive evaluation of the top vendors in the API management market, a leader in the peer-to-peer lending FinTech space, chose CA's API management for ease of use, flexibility and security profile. We see many API management opportunities like this emerging in the marketplace.
Now let's turn to the second piece of our strategy -- sales execution. During Q1, we saw continuing evidence that our decision to separate platinum accounts from our named and growth accounts and to specialize sales by product discipline, is yielding results. The highlight for the quarter, from a sales perspective, was the accelerated new sales growth from our named and growth sales teams. Importantly, participation within these combined customer accounts was broad as every geography grew double digits during Q1. Worldwide, these more seasoned sales teams increased deal counts, improved pipeline conversion rates and improved win rates on a year-over-year basis. Additionally, inside sales demonstrated an impressive performance as the team substantially increased its participation in closing business during the quarter. This is important and exciting progress for our company. It is a key indicator of the value of our products, and consistent performance from these customer accounts is critical to the success of our strategy.
Finally, let me address velocity. While Q1 represents progress towards our long-term goals, we still need to move faster in some areas. Our focus on brand awareness and demand generation are vital to improving CA's velocity.
Let me briefly highlight a recent success our marketing team has experienced. During the quarter, our digital marketing team won the highest accolade in demand generation marketing, Marketo’s Revvie. Winning this award represents our marketing team's use of next-generation technology to push the status quo and help CA break away from the competition.
Before I conclude, let me be the first to invite you to CA World 2015 at Mandalay Bay, Las Vegas. CA World '15 is bringing the brightest minds in the Application Economy together. Building off our success from last year, this year's event will showcase several new organically developed solutions that will help our customers develop and manage apps and modern IT infrastructures with confidence in the Application Economy. I hope you will join me in Las Vegas on November 16 through November 20.
On balance, our first quarter results and qualitative indicators reinforce my confidence that our improvement in product quality is resonating with customers. In fact, our global Net Promoter Score improved in all geographies and increased more than 10 points year-over-year. During fiscal 2016, we will build upon our progress by focusing on innovation, execution and speed to compete and win in the Application Economy.
With that, I will turn the call over to Rich to review our first quarter financials and full year guidance. Thank you."

Before we get started with the quarter review, let me remind you that all comparisons are year-over-year and in constant currency unless otherwise indicated. This afternoon, I'm going to focus my comments on the key business drivers and p",1060,"Thank you, Mike. Before we get started with the quarter review, let me remind you that all comparisons are year-over-year and in constant currency unless otherwise indicated. This afternoon, I'm going to focus my comments on the key business drivers and performance indicators for the quarter. The balance of our financial details can be found in our supplemental and press release.
As many of you are aware, the dollar continues to strengthen against most major currencies, which negatively impacts both our results and guidance. Our Q1 total revenue was $977 million and was down 3%. Enterprise Solutions declined 2%, and Mainframe Solutions and Services were each down 3%. Q1 renewals were down in the mid-single digits and down in low teens as reported.
As we have previously stated, the year-over-year change in our renewal bookings can vary on a quarterly basis due to the timing of large transactions. Q1 total new product and capacity sales were down in the mid-single digits and approximately 10% as reported. This is due mainly to headwinds from the renewal portfolio. Renewal yield for the quarter was in the mid-80% range. The lower-than-historical average renewal yield was the result of a large renewal with a North American financial institution that required less capacity following a merger that occurred multiple years back. Excluding this one transaction, our renewal yield was in the mid-90% range.
We continue to expect fiscal 2016 renewals to be up mid-teens year-over-year as compared to fiscal 2015 and up low single digits year-over-year, excluding a large system integrator renewal that is expected to close in fiscal 2016. As reported, we expect fiscal 2016 renewals to be up approximately 10% year-over-year as compared to fiscal 2015, including a large system integrator renewal that is expected to close in fiscal 2016.
Turning to the geographies. We experienced an improvement in new sales in Latin America in spite of the macro headwinds in the region. However, sales in EMEA and North America were down, reflecting both decline and composition of the renewal portfolio in Q1.
In our Mainframe segment, Q1 Mainframe new sales, including new product and capacity, were down high teens in constant currency and down in the mid-20% range as reported. Overall, we continue to expect our Mainframe revenue to be down low single digits over the medium term, which we believe is in line with the mainframe market.
Q1 Enterprise Solutions new product sales were up low single digits in constant currency and down mid-single digits as reported. The improvement in Enterprise Solutions new product sales was mainly a result of improvement in sales outside our renewal process.
Services revenue decreased 3% in constant currency and 9% as reported. We expect lower services booking in fiscal 2015 to be a headwind to fiscal 2016 revenue. Over the long term, we expect Services revenue to decline as we design our products to be easier to install and leverage partners for more service engagements.
Current revenue backlog was down 3%. Current revenue backlog was impacted by headwinds from a large system integrator expected to be renewed later in fiscal 2016 and lower fiscal 2015 services bookings. As I've said before, consistent year-over-year growth and current revenue backlog is one of the indicators of future revenue growth. Current revenue backlog will likely grow when we demonstrate multiple quarters of new sales growth, while maintaining a low 90% renewal yield.
Q1 non-GAAP operating margin was 41%, and GAAP operating margin was 31%. Segment operating margin in the quarter were 62% for Mainframe Solutions, 14% for Enterprise Solutions and 10% for Services. Q1 non-GAAP tax rate was 29%, and our GAAP tax rate was 30%. Q1 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.64, up 9% year-over-year. Q1 GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.47, up 15%.
Our Q1 CFFO was $188 million, up 38%. Single installment cash payments were $37 million and down year-over-year. We ended Q1 with approximately $1.4 billion in net cash.
During the first quarter, we repurchased 50 million in shares and paid $110 million in dividend. We have $735 million remaining in our original $1 billion share repurchase program. Subsequent to Q1, we drew down $400 million from our $1 billion revolver in conjunction with the close of our acquisition of Rally.
Now turning to guidance. Guidance is based upon exchange rates on the last day of the preceding quarter, which was June 30, 2015. This includes a partial hedge of operating income. This guidance also includes the acquisition of Rally software, which closed earlier this month, and assumes no incremental material acquisitions. We expect currency to have a negative impact on our full year fiscal 2016 revenue of approximately 4% at June 30 rates.
Total revenue is expected to be down 1% to flat in constant currency compared to our previous guidance of down 2% in constant currency. This translates to reported revenue of $4.04 billion to $4.11 billion. We expect a full year GAAP operating margin of 28% compared to our prior expectation of 30% and full year non-GAAP operating margin of 38% compared to our prior expectation of 39%. As previously disclosed, this 1-point decrease in our full year non-GAAP operating margin reflects the Rally acquisition. We expect the majority of this impact to be realized in our fiscal Q2.
We expect Q2 margins to be negatively impacted by foreign exchange headwinds. And recall, our fiscal Q4 margin was negatively impacted by our Q4 fiscal 2015 severance actions.
Underlining this guidance, we expect our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates to be between 28% and 29%, consistent with our prior expectations. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to grow 2% to 5%, unchanged from our previous guidance. This translates to reported non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.37 to $2.44. GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to grow 6% to 10% compared to our prior expectation of 12% to 17% growth. This translates to reported GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.72 to $1.80.
At the end of the year, we expect approximately 432 million shares outstanding and a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 436 million shares. Cash flow from operations is expected to increase 2% to 7% in constant currency, consistent with our prior expectations. This translates to reported cash flow from operations of $0.98 billion to $1.03 billion.
And now we will take your questions."

We've been consistent for the last 2 years that we've spent between $300 million and $500 million on acquisitions. But our #1 focus is organic development. So if you take a look at this particular quarter, we've had an opportunity to accentuate both of those strategies. Doing Rally, which is a big acquisition, at $480-plus million, and bring on 2 extraordinarily well-respected technologists in Otto Berkes and Ayman Sayed, shows  that we're playing both offense and defense here. We want to bring in Rally because we see some really deep synergistic opportunities for us, both on the PPM space and on the DevOps space, coupled with the fact that we see almost every customer driving themselves into the Application Economy. And the way they're doing that is by building software and the way they're building software is through Agile. So we see that as a very unique asset that fits very well within our strategy. And then when you take a look at the 2 tuck-ins we brought, both of those tuck-ins are going to need a fair amount of organic engineering in order to get them to scale for the kinds of customers that we sell to as well as the kinds of opportunities to expand a little bit more than a standard deviation outside the core of some of the products that we're looking at. And in order to do that, you have to have some very experienced technologists, both on the product side and on the pure technology side, to make sure that you're building on the right platforms and truly driving product management. And when I take a look at the combination of Otto and Ayman, I think that puts us in the upper class of ability to do organic development from a leadership perspective. Does that help answer your question?"

So if there's anything specifically going on, whether it's certain products that are doing better than others? And then on just how that coincides, because it seems like there was a decline in Enterprise Solutions' upfront revenue. And I would think that the named and growth accounts, given that they're sort of separate outside of the renewal cycle, would actually positively impact that trend, and so any additional color would be super helpful."

First of all, it's not any one thing. First, I got to get my hats off to the sales force. We have moved into this year, where we said we weren't going to change sales accounts; we weren't going to go change sales leaders; and we weren't going to change the way that we wanted them to sell in the segmentation. So when we walked into this year, we had an experienced sales force selling to people that they know, understanding how they buy, and I think that was very important. Secondly, from a product perspective, we have a number of products that are selling very well in the market. I referenced in my call, APM up 20%; API management, we are the #1 player in that space according to industry analysts as well as by financial performance; and then we had a very nice quarter with UIM. So those products sell very well to customers that are not necessarily in the Fortune 50, Fortune 100 and customers that we don't have big relationships with. They are great entry into those accounts. And I think the combination of both products and our sales force did a really nice job getting into those accounts. The other thing I would remind you of, Stefan, we spent a lot of time, energy and money on marketing. And how do you go find the right people to sell our products to and understand what their buying perspectives are? And I think that, that put a lot of air cover and helped make the sales force more productive. The other thing on -- with respect to why the upfront revenue didn't happen, I would put it into 2 categories, and I'll get Rich to comment on it. First of all, our SaaS revenue is increasing. So if you're selling SaaS, you're definitely going to be recognizing that revenue ratably. And then a lot of deals we sold, primarily in APM, those deals went ratably as well. Rich, maybe you have a little bit color on that?"

Number 1, I was happy with the sales force, but I still think there's room for improvement. If you want to be a modern sales force, a modern sales force generates about 80% of their leads, follows their methodology all day, everyday and does strategic account planning. When I look across the globe at our sales force, we have pockets of brilliance; we have work to do to help people understand that this is important, and for us, to truly penetrate the kind of customers we want, we have to have the whole sales force operating at that level of proficiency, and I think there's some work to be done there. Secondly, on the product side, we have a number of products that are selling well into both the named and growth accounts as well as back into our platinum accounts. What we need to do is have more products. And I think that's what we look at when we've done some of these tuck-in acquisitions to accentuate our portfolio. Purchasing Rally, I think it's going to be a multiyear investment, where there's lots of tangents and where we can take that particular product when you think about analytics with respect to how that works on the Life-Cycle portfolio management. And then lastly, some of the products that we have that are -- we'd had for a long time, big releases are coming out in -- that we're going to be announcing at CA World. So I feel that we finally have some of our product mojo working. We're putting up new products that people want to buy and that are very competitive in the marketplace. But I think that it's wise for you to ask a question, because I don't think you should rest on that. I think there's a lot more to be done with respect to the markets that we participate in and the constant push of the entire company to build products that really matter.

I think we're in the very early stages of that. I think we're in the medium-term stages with our flagship Security products. The latest version of that has been out for about a year, and it was a significant change from the previous version. And as we start adding to the existing version right now, I think that's going to be a lot easier, and the upgrades are going to be an awful lot easier.

This was a transaction that they had asked us to do it even earlier in previous years and we had said no. They had excess MIPS after working through their consolidations. They actually consolidated 100% of the renewal yield on all their ES products, so it was really just overcapacity on MIPS. What it did though, and it goes back to the first question of the first caller, it did little bit distort though. We actually had a very good quarter. So the mid-90s, if you back that out and the attach rate of the ELAs. But to your point, there are -- it's a light quarter, though, from -- traditionally, Q1 is a light quarter. So that does distort your model, but there wasn't a lot of yield out of that. That being said, we had a similar thing, if you recall, maybe 2 years back. And sure enough, later on, they came back and had to buy incremental MIPS. So when they choose to not have the excess capacity, they actually have to pay us more dollars per MIPS. So in the long run, we work it out that it's better for us. We do try to encourage them to keep that model, but sometimes, their own internal pressures cause them to make some shortsighted decisions, and we let them do that."

The DevOps is really a fragmented business, which I think is storming and forming as we move forward. When you take a look at the whole notion of service virtualization, the ability to create synthetic testing and the whole option of continuous delivery, I think when you look at Agile and you take a look at how we're going to use Rally, that accentuates our position in DevOps, because now we can go directly from product and portfolio management directly into how you build software into driving how you test software, both virtually and through synthetic testing methods, and then driving the whole concept of continuous improvement. Now when you take a look at all that, there's still more things that need to be built in the context with DevOps, and the driving factor of this is speed. As companies move into the Application Economy and their primary deployment mechanism is mobile devices, the time to build net new apps is decreasing at a pace that I don't think anybody has really understood or taken into an account. And as we start thinking about that problem set, it gives us a lot of opportunity to continue to build on our portfolio. Now when we're talking about competitive -- competitors, we see most of our competition coming from point competitors that can't stitch together a full DevOps strategy and a full DevOps mission. And we have a whole division built in on that because we think that we're still in the early days and there's a lot of innovation that still needs to be built to make that as seamless as possible. Is that helpful?"

I'll give you a couple of pieces of information and let -- I'll let Rich walk you through how that flows through the financials. If you just take a look at the quarter, as most recently reported by IBM, they had a pretty significant increase in MIPS. So the platform unto itself is being more used today than it ever was and that's good for us. The customers that find the mainframe to be a stable, great transaction processor is not fading in any way, shape or form. The number of MIPS that were shipped just last quarter by IBM, I think, exceeded just about everybody's expectations, and we will be a net beneficiary of that phenomenon. As far as how the market goes, we think that the market is shrinking still at 1% or 2%. And where we usually make gains is when there's any kind of consolidation going on. We're tended to be one of 2 stable providers that are still investing in pure R&D into the mainframe. But we come across as a very stable and committed vendor and partner to that platform.

And at the very, very low end, those guys continue to drift away at 1% or 2% a year. At the very, very high end, those guys are growing their MIPS double digits, and that offsets that low and disappearing. So I don't see anything really changing other than the fact that there is more of a blur between what is -- what you call mainframe and what's just up in the cloud.

The growth in new sales outside of the renewal process was -- exceeded my expectations for the quarter, which is also a big qualitative metric that I look at. We continue to run the business in what I think is a very smart way and a very efficient way, with a margin of expansion of 1 percentage point. We had great CFFO growth, and we continue to see the EMEA team doing a really good job and getting revenue returning to growth.
Looking forward, I'm super excited about the strategic acquisition of Rally. This improves our revenue guidance by 1 to 2 points. But I also think long term, there's a lot more in the Rally acquisition with respect to the platform that they've built and our ability to take advantage of that platform.

We had an encouraging first quarter, driven by improved sales execution, strong operating margin performance and continued progress towards achieving our long-term goals. While our overall first quarter total",1770,"Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. We had an encouraging first quarter, driven by improved sales execution, strong operating margin performance and continued progress towards achieving our long-term goals. While our overall first quarter total new sales were down mid-single digits year-over-year, Enterprise Solutions new sales were up low single digits over the year. This was offset by mainframe new sales, which were down in the high teens.
The decline in mainframe new sales was in line with our expectations. Mainframe capacity was negatively impacted by both a decline in composition of our Q1 renewal portfolio as well as a renewal with a large North American financial institution that required less capacity following a merger that occurred multiple years ago. That said, our outlook for the Mainframe business remains unchanged as we continue to expect mainframe revenue to be down low single digits over the medium term, which we believe is in line with the mainframe market.
Non-GAAP operating margin was 41% in the quarter, as we remain focused on efficient execution and financial discipline. Although I am pleased with the efficiency of the business and encouraged by the improvement in Enterprise new sales, we still have work to do to drive the kind of growth that our company has the potential to achieve. Our recent results only partly capture the traction we are experiencing in the field and the strong market opportunity in front of the company.
The disruption of traditional business models is clearly accelerating as enterprises across the globe are embracing the Application Economy to drive innovation. CA's solutions enable enterprises to capitalize on the opportunities created by this Application Economy, where software is the competitive differentiator and application development is the driver of innovation. Let me provide you with more insight into the progress we're making towards our strategy to deliver differentiated solutions, improve sales execution and increase our velocity.
First, in product development, we have stated that in order to be a leader in the next generation of software, innovation must be the lifeblood of our company. The recent hiring of Otto Berkes as our new Chief Technology Officer signals our intent to accelerate organic innovation and enrich CA's long-term technology vision. Otto's experience as Chief Technology Officer at HBO and his 18-year tenure at Microsoft, where he was one of the 4 original innovators of Xbox, exemplifies the talent we are attracting that will be critical in helping us achieve our longer-term product development goals.
I am also very pleased that Ayman Sayed will be joining CA as the Chief Product Officer on August 10. Ayman comes to us from Cisco, where he was the Senior Vice President of Network Operating Systems Technology Group, leading the development of network operating software on which nearly every Cisco networking product runs. Ayman is a very accomplished executive, who oversaw the vision and engineering direction for Cisco's software strategy. He has experience with Agile software development and pioneered the Internet of Things innovation at Cisco. At CA, he will work closely with Otto to create the best-in-class products. Their teamwork and focus will drive organic technology and product development, which continues to be our priority, and help CA's customers gain advantage in the Application Economy.
To complement our organic roadmap, we recently enhanced our internal development capabilities with 3 transactions. We characterize 2 of the deals as technology tuck-ins that expand our capabilities in Security and DevOps. The acquisition of Rally, which closed a few weeks ago, represents a more significant investment. By adding Rally's award-winning cloud-based Agile development platform and its transformation consultants and coaches to the fold, CA becomes an industry leader in the fast-growing Agile Application Life-Cycle Management software market. Importantly, this acquisition also adds product and service capabilities that are highly complementary to our award-winning PPM solution and strengthens CA's existing DevOps leadership.
With less than 5% customer overlap in our platinum accounts, Rally's best-of-breed technology and unmatched scalability provides ample opportunity to cross-sell into these strategically important accounts as well as cross-sell our solutions into their install base. I am confident that Rally is a natural, strategic fit for CA. Our products and go-to-market methods align well, and equally as important, Rally's culture and focus on delivering high-quality solutions mirrors ours.
To maintain the current momentum, the Rally organization and its leadership team will continue to report to Tim Miller in his new position as General Manager and, over time, will be fully integrated into CA. Later during the call, Rich will discuss Rally's impact to our fiscal 2016 guidance.
Our management cloud solutions experienced success in the quarter, and our solutions continue to be recognized for their leadership in the space. For example, in the quarter, CA PPM was designated as a leader in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for IT Product (sic) [Project] and Portfolio Management software. In addition, during Q1, CA PPM had several high-profile wins such as a competitive replacement with Delta Airlines that is leveraging our technology to automate the vast number of complex business processes across a multitude of different internal organizations. Equally impressive was a win with Macy's, which required enterprise-wide PPM to provide a common system of record and process for all business and IT projects. Overall, I'm encouraged by the improved execution during the quarter, and I look forward to updating you on the integration of Rally and our product roadmaps through this fiscal year.
Turning to DevOps. The new release of CA APM 10 and CA UIM 8.3 feature compelling, new user interfaces and analytics to facilitate collaboration in dynamic environments. Specifically, these new integrated solutions dramatically improve the ease of use for IT operation teams by providing the speed and scale organizations need to rapidly deploy new applications, monitor dynamic environments and continuously optimize application quality to ensure superb customer experiences.
Let me briefly highlight our continued APM success. I am pleased to report that APM's positive momentum has continued in fiscal 2016. In the quarter, the product posted impressive new sales growth of approximately 20%. Our fiscal Q1 release of APM 10 was a highlight, and it brings to market new capabilities that accelerate customers' DevOps initiatives. Key patent pending functionality added to APM 10 include: A completely redesigned user interface that enables first-level production support personnel to resolve production problems much more effectively; analytics technology designed to reduce the skill level required for troubleshooting; unique timeline functionality that quickly correlates performance issues with past app changes. This is differentiated technology that enables DevOps teams to receive recommended fixes in real-time, a must-have in the highly dynamic world of cloud and microservices.
I am very excited about our continued success in APM and the launch of APM 10. Importantly, customers and the broader market share my enthusiasm. For example, just a few weeks ago, CA APM was featured as the #1 APM product by Dow Jones Newswire, based on the number of customer reviews on crowd-sourced review site, IT Central.
Our security pillar demonstrated consistent execution during the quarter. The need for comprehensive security solutions continues to strengthen worldwide. With the frequency and severity of breaches continuing to impact enterprises across the globe, companies are looking to software firms like CA to provide guidance on how to protect their users and data.
Leveraging our position within security and application delivery, our API management solutions continue to gain mind share. During the quarter, CA was positioned in the Leaders Quadrant of the Gartner Magic Quadrant for Application Services Governance for our API management product. APIs allow customers to modernize existing architectures and connect to hybrid cloud applications and mobile devices, while unlocking the value of data. We are a leader in this fast-growing opportunity as we can provide API management solutions at scale and security levels needed for the massive amounts of data traversing these newly-created digital platforms. For example, after an extensive evaluation of the top vendors in the API management market, a leader in the peer-to-peer lending FinTech space chose CA's API management for ease of use, flexibility and security profile. We see many API management opportunities like this emerging in the marketplace.
Now let's turn to the second piece of our strategy -- sales execution. During Q1, we saw continuing evidence that our decision to separate platinum accounts from our named and growth accounts and to specialize sales by product discipline, is yielding results. The highlight for the quarter, from a sales perspective, was the accelerated new sales growth from our named and growth sales teams. Importantly, participation within these combined customer accounts was broad as every geography grew double digits during Q1. Worldwide, these more seasoned sales teams increased deal counts, improved pipeline conversion rates and improved win rates on a year-over-year basis. Additionally, inside sales demonstrated impressive performance as the team substantially increased its participation in closing business during the quarter. This is important and exciting progress for our company. It is a key indicator of the value of our products, and consistent performance from these customer accounts is critical to the success of our strategy.
Finally, let me address velocity. While Q1 represents progress towards our long-term goals, we still need to move faster in some areas. Our focus on brand awareness and demand generation are vital to improving CA's velocity.
Let me briefly highlight a recent success our marketing team has experienced. During the quarter, our digital marketing team won the highest accolade in demand generation marketing, Marketo’s Revvie. Winning this award represents our marketing team's use of next-generation technology to push the status quo and help CA break away from the competition.
Before I conclude, let me be the first to invite you to CA World 2015 at Mandalay Bay, Las Vegas. CA World '15 is bringing the brightest minds in the Application Economy together. Building off our success from last year, this year's event will showcase several new organically developed solutions that will help our customers develop and manage apps and modern IT infrastructures with confidence in the Application Economy. I hope you will join me in Las Vegas on November 16 through November 20.
On balance, our first quarter results and qualitative indicators reinforce my confidence that our improvement in product quality is resonating with customers. In fact, our global Net Promoter Score improved in all geographies and increased more than 10 points year-over-year. During fiscal 2016, we will build upon our progress by focusing on innovation, execution and speed to compete and win in the Application Economy.
With that, I will turn the call over to Rich to review our first quarter financials and full year guidance. Thank you."

Before we get started with the quarter review, let me remind you that all comparisons are year-over-year and in constant currency unless otherwise indicated. This afternoon, I'm going to focus my comments on the key business drivers and p",1060,"Thank you, Mike. Before we get started with the quarter review, let me remind you that all comparisons are year-over-year and in constant currency unless otherwise indicated. This afternoon, I'm going to focus my comments on the key business drivers and performance indicators for the quarter. The balance of our financial details can be found in our supplemental and press release.
As many of you are aware, the dollar continues to strengthen against most major currencies, which negatively impacts both our results and guidance. Our Q1 total revenue was $977 million and was down 3%. Enterprise Solutions declined 2%, and Mainframe Solutions and Services were each down 3%. Q1 renewals were down in the mid-single digits and down in low teens as reported.
As we have previously stated, the year-over-year change in our renewal bookings can vary on a quarterly basis due to the timing of large transactions. Q1 total new product and capacity sales were down in the mid-single digits and approximately 10% as reported. This is due mainly to headwinds from the renewal portfolio. Renewal yield for the quarter was in the mid-80% range. The lower-than-historical average renewal yield was the result of a large renewal with a North American financial institution that required less capacity following a merger that occurred multiple years back. Excluding this one transaction, our renewal yield was in the mid-90% range.
We continue to expect fiscal 2016 renewals to be up mid-teens year-over-year as compared to fiscal 2015 and up low single digits year-over-year, excluding a large system integrator renewal that is expected to close in fiscal 2016. As reported, we expect fiscal 2016 renewals to be up approximately 10% year-over-year as compared to fiscal 2015, including a large system integrator renewal that is expected to close in fiscal 2016.
Turning to the geographies. We experienced an improvement in new sales in Latin America in spite of the macro headwinds in the region. However, sales in EMEA and North America were down, reflecting both decline and composition of the renewal portfolio in Q1.
In our Mainframe segment, Q1 Mainframe new sales, including new product and capacity, were down high teens in constant currency and down in the mid-20% range as reported. Overall, we continue to expect our Mainframe revenue to be down low single digits over the medium term, which we believe is in line with the mainframe market.
Q1 Enterprise Solutions new product sales were up low single digits in constant currency and down mid-single digits as reported. The improvement in Enterprise Solutions new product sales was mainly a result of improvement in sales outside our renewal process.
Services revenue decreased 3% in constant currency and 9% as reported. We expect lower services booking in fiscal 2015 to be a headwind to fiscal 2016 revenue. Over the long term, we expect Services revenue to decline as we design our products to be easier to install and leverage partners for more service engagements.
Current revenue backlog was down 3%. Current revenue backlog was impacted by headwinds from a large system integrator expected to be renewed later in fiscal 2016 and lower fiscal 2015 services bookings. As I've said before, consistent year-over-year growth and current revenue backlog is one of the indicators of future revenue growth. Current revenue backlog will likely grow when we demonstrate multiple quarters of new sales growth, while maintaining a low 90% renewal yield.
Q1 non-GAAP operating margin was 41%, and GAAP operating margin was 31%. Segment operating margin in the quarter were 62% for Mainframe Solutions, 14% for Enterprise Solutions and 10% for Services. Q1 non-GAAP tax rate was 29%, and our GAAP tax rate was 30%. Q1 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.64, up 9% year-over-year. Q1 GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.47, up 15%.
Our Q1 CFFO was $188 million, up 38%. Single installment cash payments were $37 million and down year-over-year. We ended Q1 with approximately $1.4 billion in net cash.
During the first quarter, we repurchased 50 million in shares and paid $110 million in dividend. We have $735 million remaining in our original $1 billion share repurchase program. Subsequent to Q1, we drew down $400 million from our $1 billion revolver in conjunction with the close of our acquisition of Rally.
Now turning to guidance. Guidance is based upon exchange rates on the last day of the preceding quarter, which was June 30, 2015. This includes a partial hedge of operating income. This guidance also includes the acquisition of Rally software, which closed earlier this month, and assumes no incremental material acquisitions. We expect currency to have a negative impact on our full year fiscal 2016 revenue of approximately 4% at June 30 rates.
Total revenue is expected to be down 1% to flat in constant currency compared to our previous guidance of down 2% in constant currency. This translates to reported revenue of $4.04 billion to $4.11 billion. We expect a full year GAAP operating margin of 28% compared to our prior expectation of 30% and full year non-GAAP operating margin of 38% compared to our prior expectation of 39%. As previously disclosed, this 1-point decrease in our full year non-GAAP operating margin reflects the Rally acquisition. We expect the majority of this impact to be realized in our fiscal Q2.
We expect Q2 margins to be negatively impacted by foreign exchange headwinds. And recall, our fiscal Q4 margin was negatively impacted by our Q4 fiscal 2015 severance actions.
Underlying this guidance, we expect our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates to be between 28% and 29%, consistent with our prior expectations. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to grow 2% to 5%, unchanged from our previous guidance. This translates to reported non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.37 to $2.44. GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to grow 6% to 10% compared to our prior expectation of 12% to 17% growth. This translates to reported GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.72 to $1.80.
At the end of the year, we expect approximately 432 million shares outstanding and a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 436 million shares. Cash flow from operations is expected to increase 2% to 7% in constant currency, consistent with our prior expectations. This translates to reported cash flow from operations of $0.98 billion to $1.03 billion.
And now we will take your questions."

We've been consistent for the last 2 years that we've spent between $300 million and $500 million on acquisitions. But our #1 focus is organic development. So if you take a look at this particular quarter, we've had an opportunity to accentuate both of those strategies. Doing Rally, which is a big acquisition, at $480-plus million, and bring on 2 extraordinarily well-respected technologists in Otto Berkes and Ayman Sayed, shows that we're playing both offense and defense here. We want to bring in Rally because we see some really deep synergistic opportunities for us, both on the PPM space and on the DevOps space, coupled with the fact that we see almost every customer driving themselves into the Application Economy. And the way they're doing that is by building software and the way they're building software is through Agile. So we see that as a very unique asset that fits very well within our strategy. And then when you take a look at the 2 tuck-ins we brought, both of those tuck-ins are going to need a fair amount of organic engineering in order to get them to scale for the kinds of customers that we sell to as well as the kinds of opportunities to expand a little bit more than a standard deviation outside the core of some of the products that we're looking at. And in order to do that, you have to have some very experienced technologists, both on the product side and on the pure technology side, to make sure that you're building on the right platforms and truly driving product management. And when I take a look at the combination of Otto and Ayman, I think that puts us in the upper class of ability to do organic development from a leadership perspective. Does that help answer your question?"

So if there's anything specifically going on, whether it's certain products that are doing better than others? And then on just how that coincides, because it seems like there was a decline in Enterprise Solutions' upfront revenue. And I would think that the named and growth accounts, given that they're sort of separate outside of the renewal cycle, would actually positively impact that trend, and so any additional color would be super helpful."

First of all, it's not any one thing. First, I got to give my hats off to the sales force. We have moved into this year, where we said we weren't going to change sales accounts; we weren't going to go change sales leaders; and we weren't going to change the way that we wanted them to sell in the segmentation. So when we walked into this year, we had an experienced sales force selling to people that they know, understanding how they buy, and I think that was very important. Secondly, from a product perspective, we have a number of products that are selling very well in the market. I referenced in my call, APM up 20%; API management, we are the #1 player in that space according to industry analysts as well as by financial performance; and then we had a very nice quarter with UIM. So those products sell very well to customers that are not necessarily in the Fortune 50, Fortune 100 and customers that we don't have big relationships with. They are great entry into those accounts. And I think the combination of both products and our sales force did a really nice job getting into those accounts. The other thing I would remind you of, Stefan, we spent a lot of time, energy and money on marketing. And how do you go find the right people to sell our products to and understand what their buying perspectives are? And I think that, that put a lot of air cover and helped make the sales force more productive. The other thing on -- with respect to why the upfront revenue didn't happen, I would put it into 2 categories, and I'll get Rich to comment on it. First of all, our SaaS revenue is increasing. So if you're selling SaaS, you're definitely going to be recognizing that revenue ratably. And then a lot of the deals we sold, primarily in APM, those deals went ratably as well. Rich, maybe you have a little bit color on that?"

Number 1, I was happy with the sales force, but I still think there's room for improvement. If you want to be a modern sales force, a modern sales force generates about 80% of their leads, follows their methodology all day, every day and does strategic account planning. When I look across the globe at our sales force, we have pockets of brilliance; we have work to do to help people understand that this is important, and for us, to truly penetrate the kind of customers we want, we have to have the whole sales force operating at that level of proficiency, and I think there's some work to be done there. Secondly, on the product side, we have a number of products that are selling well into both the named and growth accounts as well as back into our platinum accounts. What we need to do is have more products. And I think that's what we look at when we've done some of these tuck-in acquisitions to accentuate our portfolio. Purchasing Rally, I think it's going to be a multiyear investment, where there's lots of tangents and where we can take that particular product when you think about analytics with respect to how that works on the Life-Cycle portfolio management. And then lastly, some of the products that we have that are -- we'd had for a long time, big releases are coming out in -- that we're going to be announcing at CA World. So I feel that we finally have some of our product mojo working. We're putting up net new products that people want to buy and that are very competitive in the marketplace. But I think that it's wise for you to ask a question, because I don't think you should rest on that. I think there's a lot more to be done with respect to the markets that we participate in and the constant push of the entire company to build products that really matter.

I think we're in the very early stages of that. I think we're in the medium-term stages with our flagship Security products. The latest version of that has been out for about a year, and it was a significant change from the previous version. And as we start adding to the existing version rate now, I think that's going to be a lot easier, and the upgrades are going to be an awful lot easier. So definitely some room to grow there for sure.

This was a transaction that they had asked us to do it even earlier in previous years and we had said no. They had excess MIPS after working through their consolidations. They actually consolidated 100% of the renewal yield on all their ES products, so it was really just overcapacity on MIPS. What it did though, and it goes back to the first question of the first caller, it did little bit distort though. We actually had a very good quarter. So the mid-90s, if you back that out and the attach rate of the ELAs. But to your point, there are -- it's a light quarter, though, from -- traditionally, Q1's a light quarter. So that does distort your model, but there wasn't a lot of yield out of that. And that being said, we had a similar thing, if you recall, maybe 2 years back. And sure enough, later on, they came back and had to buy incremental MIPS. So when they choose to not have the excess capacity, they actually have to pay us more dollars per MIPS. So in the long run, we work it out that it's better for us. We do try to encourage them to keep that model, but sometimes their own internal pressures cause them to make some shortsighted decisions, and we let them do that."

The DevOps is really a fragmented business, which I think is storming and forming as we move forward. When you take a look at the whole notion of service virtualization, the ability to create synthetic testing and the whole option of continuous delivery, I think when you look at Agile and you take a look at how we're going to use Rally, that accentuates our position in DevOps, because now we can go directly from product and portfolio management directly into how you build software into driving how you test software, both virtually and through synthetic testing methods, and then driving the whole concept of continuous improvement. Now when you take a look at all that, there's still more things that need to be built in the context with DevOps, and the driving factor of this is speed. As companies move into the Application Economy and their primary deployment mechanism is mobile devices, the time to build net new apps is decreasing at a pace that I don't think anybody has really understood or taken into an account. And as we start thinking about that problem set, it gives us a lot of opportunity to continue to build on our portfolio. Now when we're talking about competitive -- competitors, we see most of our competition coming from point competitors that can't stitch together a full DevOps strategy and a full DevOps mission. And we have a whole division built in on that because we think that we're still in the early days and there's a lot of innovation that still needs to be built to make that as seamless as possible. Is that helpful?"

I'll give you a couple of pieces of information and let -- I'll let Rich walk you through how that flows through the financials. If you just take a look at the quarter, as most recently reported by IBM, they had a pretty significant increase in MIPS. So the platform unto itself is being more used today than it ever was and that's good for us. The customers that find the mainframe to be a stable, great transaction processor is not fading in any way, shape or form. The number of MIPS that were shipped just last quarter by IBM, I think, exceeded just about everybody's expectations, and we will be a net beneficiary of that phenomenon. As far as how the market goes, we think that the market is shrinking still at 1% or 2%. And where we usually make gains is when there's any kind of consolidation going on. We're tended to be one of 2 stable providers that are still investing in pure R&D into the mainframe. But we come across as a very stable and committed vendor and partner to that platform.

At the very, very high end, those guys are growing their MIPS double digits, and that offsets that low end disappearing.

We had great CFFO growth, and we continue to see the EMEA team doing a really good job and getting revenue returning to growth.
Looking forward, I'm super excited about the strategic acquisition of Rally. This improves our revenue guidance by 1 to 2 points.

I'm pleased to report that new sales were very strong in the second quarter. In fact, new sales delivered solid year-over-year growth across our Enterprise Solutions and Mainframe businesses. Our performance in th",1962,"Good afternoon. Thank you for joining us. I'm pleased to report that new sales were very strong in the second quarter. In fact, new sales delivered solid year-over-year growth across our Enterprise Solutions and Mainframe businesses. Our performance in the second quarter reflects the continued improvements we are making in both our product and our sales execution. In particular, I'm excited about new sales, an indicator of the great traction our solutions are experiencing. Our overall second quarter total new sales were up more than 40% year-over-year. In the quarter, a great portion of our new sales bookings were recognized ratably compared to our historical trends. 
Enterprise Solutions new sales increased in the high 20s year-over-year. Mainframe new sales more than doubled year-over-year. In the second quarter, we closed the large system integrator renewal that was initially expected to transact in the second half of our fiscal year. The accelerated time to close this renewal was at their request and is a reflection of CA's strategic importance to the system integrator and its customers. We are very pleased with the outcome of this large renewal, which had a strong yield and a healthy new sales attach rate. 
Our renewal yield in the quarter was in the high 90s. This is the best it's been in recent history. This is a testament to our pricing discipline and the ability of our sales teams to execute deals that realize the value of our solutions. 
In today's Application Economy, a lot of mission critical data still resides in the Mainframe. This is particularly true of the big players, the Fortune 500. As such, it should not be a surprise that there will be quarters in which capacity buys are particularly strong as was the case in Q2. Excluding the large system integrator, our renewal yield would have been in the low 90s. Excluding the large system integrator renewal, total new sales increased in the mid-twenties range, and Enterprise Solutions new sales increased in the mid-teens year-over-year. 
Non-GAAP operating margin was 36% in the quarter, which was consistent with our expectation and commentary on our fiscal Q1 earnings call. Recall that the full percentage point impact on operating margin guidance for FY '16 was expected to be realized in our fiscal Q2. This is due to the expenses related to the Rally acquisition and realignment costs. 
Our second quarter results were clearly a big step in the right direction, but there is still work to be done. While we are on track for the second half of our fiscal year, it is important to note that we expect it to be heavily weighted towards the fourth quarter. That said, I am increasingly confident that our results will reflect our work to deliver innovative solutions that truly solve customer's problems. Put simply, CA enables enterprises to capitalize the opportunities created by the Application Economy. In fact, once again, Gartner has rated CA Technologies with an overall positive rating in its latest August 2015 vendor rating report. 
We remain focused on product quality and execution. Our Chief Product Officer and Chief Technology Officer are working in lockstep to ensure continuous improvement on our near and midterm product execution while driving us towards our longer-term Horizon 2, Horizon 3 technology leadership opportunities. Our strategy continues to stress organic innovation complemented by targeted, strategic investments that are within 1 standard deviation of our core. A great example of this is our acquisition of Rally, a leader in the fast-growing Agile Application Life-Cycle Management software market, which closed on July 8. The rationale for this acquisition was threefold: First, Rally's products and services are highly complementary to our award-winning PPM solutions and strengthens CA's DevOps leadership; two, there is ample opportunity to cross sell, given the limited customer overlap; and third, the opportunity to accelerate Agile methodology internally as CA to drive improving velocity of our high-quality solutions. 
3.5 months into the acquisition, I am very pleased to report that Rally is performing well. In many ways, it is doing better than our expectations. For example, total paid seats under contract at the end of Q2 grew in the high 20% range year-over-year. We define a paid seat as a seat with a subscription or support contract. Q2 saw a particularly large upgrade order from a global leader in networking routers and switches. This customer exemplifies Rally's successful lend and expand strategy. Rally is able to prove strategic value in a small initial engagement and then grow exponentially within the customer. We are encouraged by the opportunity to reseat to further engage our customers around Agile. 
In terms of integration, just last month, we G8 our press release of a bidirectionally integrated, combined Rally and CA PPM solution. This allows customers to combine planning and execution, track progress in real time and eliminate the need for point-to-point integrations. It creates a closed loop system that vastly accelerates and improves the decision-making process. This level of integration is something with which point solution providers simply cannot compete. The broad value proposition that we offer in Rally combined with CA PPM and DevOps tools like service virtualization and release automation enable organizational transformation rather than small, disparate design teams functioning in silos. In fact, we often do not compete against point solutions in head-to-head evaluations. Rather, our solutions are deployed as a result of an enterprise decision to scale Agile methodologies across a number, sometimes hundreds, of development groups. Combined with CA's global enterprise engagement and support model, this puts us in a different class of solution providers. 
Now I'd like to highlight a few areas within Enterprise Solutions in which we are seeing very good progress. Our award-winning Clarity PPM platform, which has been one of the cornerstones of our Enterprise Solutions business, grew new sales over 70% [ph] year-over-year as reported. With the release of 14.2 in April and 14.3 last month, customers can now glean powerful management insights from their data, enabling them to view their product portfolios and investments across all platforms, including tablets and mobile. We are becoming increasingly confident in our ability to outpace the market. We believe we have the right product at the right time with a more seasoned sales force executing multiple 6-figure deals across geographies. We are particularly pleased with a major win at a large Canadian bank that was originally an on-premise customer using Clarity PPM for financial reporting. This transaction dramatically expands CA's engagement as it migrates to our on-demand platform and standardizes its financial reporting, project management and time tracking. This win displaced both the customer's internal systems resources as well as CA's competitors. 
Within DevOps, API management continues to grow at a rapid clip, with new sales up in the high 30s year-over-year as reported. We are a leader in this secular growth space. We are in a unique position to provide API management solutions at scale with the requisite Security features. CA's API management products enable customers to manage and protect the ever-growing volumes of data traversing across rapidly expanding digital platforms. Our solutions are recognized by both industry pundits and customers. Our leadership in this space is evidenced by a major win at a large U.S.-based auto manufacturer. This engagement represents an enterprise-wide expansion of our relationship and includes Mainframe, API management and DevOps. Importantly, it also establishes an initial footprint for CA into its finance division. We also secured a win at an American media company that provides local weather forecasts globally. This win was a competitive displacement, where CA's API management was chosen due to its superior performance and scalability. 
UIM, which is foundational to our DevOps portfolio, is a good example of Agile methodology deployment within CA. In fact, UIM was the first group within CA to adopt Rally and was its internal lighthouse sponsor. The resulting improvements with regard to product quality and velocity are notable. In the quarter, UIM had a major win with a large cloud infrastructure as a service company who chose CA's UIM tool over its parent company's alternative offering. Another notable deal was a competitive win at a leading athletic apparel company that is embracing the Application Economy to transform into a lifestyle brand with a leading digital health platform. CA was chosen over a number of competitors for our ability to offer an enterprise-wide global solutions and services view. Next month, at CA World in Las Vegas, you can expect to see net new product launches, some of which reflect our unique opportunity to bridge between distributed, cloud and Mainframe. You will see our heightened emphasis on Agile and better appreciate how CA is in a unique position to benefit as large enterprise data center management strategies evolve to hybrid cloud environments. 
Given CA's rich heritage as a trusted vendor to large enterprises running mission critical workloads and providing support around the globe, we have a coveted seat at the table. This point is particularly salient when it comes to the fragmented Security space. Our Security business had a very strong second quarter with new sales up over 60% year-over-year as reported. Results were positively impacted by the large system integrator renewal, where CA's Security footprint has expanded considerably. Even outside of this large renewal, we closed multiple 6-figure transactions across a number of verticals including health care, automotive, technology and government. 
In addition to the technology and expanded product portfolio breadth our recent acquisitions provide, they are also improving our visibility with customers who are increasingly viewing CA as a large committed vendor with staying power and is critically important, yet still incredibly fragmented space. We are very excited about our most recent acquisition, Xceedium, which extends our PIM or Privileged Identity Management offering. Xceedium positions us well in the rapidly growing network Security market as large enterprises have become increasingly aware and less tolerant of dangerous and often very public interorganizational security breaches. In fact, it appears to have also created a halo effect, lifting sales of existing PIM products as customers embrace our PIM roadmap. 
Now turning to sales execution. I am pleased to report that our decision to separate platinum accounts from named and growth accounts, and to specialize sales by product discipline, continues to yield positive results. Globally, in the second quarter, our sales teams improved win rates, decreased average sales cycles, improved pipeline conversion rates and increased average deal sizes. This speaks to the team's improving efficiency and continued focus on accelerating velocity. In fact, for the second consecutive quarter, our combined named and growth sales teams delivered strong broad-based results. 
While 2 quarters do not make a trend, we do expect the second half of the year to be weighted towards the fourth quarter. I am convinced that our sales execution strategy is on the right track. I invite you to come and see the progress we're making in terms of sales execution, product development and marketing strategy next month in Las Vegas. Please join us at CA World to see our product innovation first hand and hear why customers are embracing CA solutions to differentiate and accelerate their products and processes in order to thrive in the emerging Application Economy. Our financial analyst track will take place on November 18 at the Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas. We hope to see you there. 
In aggregate, I am pleased with our second quarter results, particularly with regard to new sales, which were flexed to success to our solutions are seeing in the market. That said, we recognize there is still work to do in order to drive the kind of growth that CA has the potential to achieve. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Rich to review our second quarter financials and full year guidance. Thank you."
262913,312841788,879098,"CA, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 21, 2015",2015-10-21,"Earnings Calls","CA, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Mike. Before we get started with the quarter review, let me remind you that all comparisons are year-over-year and in constant currency unless otherwise indicated. This afternoon, I'm going to focus my comment on the key business drivers and pe",1719,"Thank you, Mike. Before we get started with the quarter review, let me remind you that all comparisons are year-over-year and in constant currency unless otherwise indicated. This afternoon, I'm going to focus my comment on the key business drivers and performance indicators for the quarter. The balance of our financial details can be found in our supplemental and press release. As many of you are aware, overall, the dollar continues to strengthen, which negatively impacts our results and our guidance. Our Q2 total revenue was $1.05 billion and was down 1%. The increasing mix of new sales growing ratable compared to upfront, which we experienced in Q1, and again in Q2, has impacted reported quarterly revenue by approximately 1 point per quarter. If this trend persists, it will continue to be a headwind towards reported revenue. 
Enterprise Solutions increased 3%, and Mainframe Solutions and Services were each down 3%. Q2 renewals were more than doubled year-over-year, both in constant currency and as reported. Excluding the range system integrator transaction, Q2 renewals would have been up in the low teens and in the high single digits as reported. As we have previously stated, the year-over-year change in our renewal bookings can vary on a quarterly basis due to the timing of large transactions. 
Q2 total new product and capacity sales were up nearly 50% and over 40% as reported. This was due in part to a large system integrator renewal previously mentioned and the contribution from acquisitions, with Rally as the most meaningful. As Mike indicated, excluding the large system integrator renewal, total new sales increase in the mid-twenties and high teens as reported, and Enterprise Solutions new sales increased in the mid-teens year-over-year, high single digits as reported. 
Excluding the large system integrator renewal and excluding acquisitions, total organic new sales were up in the high teens in constant currency and low teens as reported. As Mike mentioned, Rally's total paid seats under contract increased in the high 20% range year-over-year. We disclosed this metric because we thought it would be helpful to show how well this acquisition is progressing. However, we do not intend to provide Rally's seat growth metric indefinitely. This is because in vary large transactions, such as the 1 signed in the second quarter as well as those we believe can be executed over time with our platinum accounts, paid seat growth may not be an accurate proxy for expected revenue growth. 
Renewal yield for the quarter was in the high 90% range. This is the highest it's been in recent history and was driven by the large system integrator. This renewal had a positive impact across our Mainframe and Enterprise Solutions business. Excluding this 1 transaction, our renewal yield was in the low 90s, the large system integrator renewed for a duration longer than our forecast. As such, we now expect fiscal 2016 renewals to be up at the mid-twenties year-over-year as compared to fiscal 2015, and up approximately 20% as reported. Excluding the large system integrator renewal, we expect fiscal 2016 renewals to be up in the low single digits and down in the low single digits as reported. 
Turning to geographies. New sales were particularly strong in North America, driven by the large system integrator renewal. Sales were also strong in EMEA and Latin America. However, new sales were down in APJ due to the timing renewals and generally weaker pipeline in the region. Within our segments, Q2 Mainframe sales, including new product and capacity, more than doubled year-over-year, both in constant currency and as reported. Overall, we continue to expect Mainframe revenue to be down in the low single digits over the medium term, which we believe is in line with the Mainframe market. Q2 Enterprise Solutions new product sales were up in the high 20s in constant currency and up approximately 20% as reported. Enterprise Solutions new sales, excluding the large system integrator transaction, would have increased in the mid-teens year-over-year and up high second digits as reported. New sales attached to renewals, including the large system integrator, contributions from our recent acquisitions and solid performance in named and growth customers, drove the improvement in Enterprise Solutions new product sales. 
Services revenue decreased 3% in constant currency and 9% as reported. We expect lower services bookings in fiscal 2015 to be a headwind to fiscal 2016 revenue. Over the long term, we expect Services revenue to decline as we design our products to be easier to install and as we leverage partners. 
Total revenue backlog improved to up 2% in constant currency or down 3% as reported. Current revenue backlog improved to down 2% in constant currency or down 7% as reported. As many of you know, current revenue backlog is impacted by the timing of large deals in our renewal portfolio, as contracts move closer towards their renewals, revenue backlog declines. In other words, backlog is heavily influenced by time. Given the timing of deals in our renewal portfolio, we expect current revenue backlog to tick down in the coming quarters. As I said before, consistent year-over-year growth and current revenue backlog is one of the indicators of future revenue growth. Current revenue backlog will likely grow when we demonstrate multiple quarters of new sales growth, while maintaining a low 90% renewal yield. 
Q2 non-GAAP operating margin was 36% and GAAP operating margin was 26%. Segment operating margins in the quarter were 62% for Mainframe Solutions, 3% for Enterprise Solutions and 5% for services. Enterprise Solutions margins were negatively impacted by acquisitions and other related expenses, some of which we do not view as ongoing. 
Our Q2 non-GAAP tax rate was 28% and our GAAP tax rate was 30%. Q2 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.56, down 6% year-over-year. Q2 GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.39, down 13%. Our Q2 CFFO was $43 million, down 32% year-over-year or down 35% as reported. CFFO declined year-over-year due to the combination of foreign exchange headwinds and lower single installment cash payments. Single installment cash payments were $105 million and down year-over-year. 
We ended Q2 with approximately $660 million in net cash. During the quarter, we repurchased $65 million in shares and paid $110 million in dividends. We have $670 million remaining in our original $1 billion share repurchase program. During the quarter, we issued $400 million 5-year notes at 3.6%. We used the proceeds to pay down the revolver, accessed in conjunction with the closure of our acquisition of Rally. Subsequent to the close of Q2, we opportunistically took out a 6.5-year, $300 million senior term loan facility at LIBOR plus 150 points. The use of proceeds is for general corporate purposes and to provide increased flexibility to execute on allocation strategy. As you can see, the terms are attractive and the tenor fits well with our maturity profile. Our balance sheet a strong, and remain committed to maintaining our investment-grade rating. 
Now turning to guidance. Guidance is based on the exchange rates on the last of the preceding quarter, which was September 30, 2015. This includes a partial hedge of operating income. The guidance also assumes no material acquisitions. We expect currency to have a negative impact to our full-year fiscal 2016 revenue of approximately 5% at September 30 rates. As Mike mentioned, we expect the second half of our fiscal year to be heavily weighted towards the fourth quarter. In other words, as we look to the back half of our fiscal year, we expect our results to be better in our fiscal fourth quarter than in our fiscal third quarter. Our expectations for a softer third quarter is the result of the expected timing of named and growth deals in the pipeline. As previously mentioned, we also expect that trend in mix whereby an increasing portion of deals are going ratable rather than upfront to continue in Q3. The impact of this is for revenue to be recognized over the course of time as opposed to in the current period. However, associated expenses are recognized in the current period, which negatively impacts near-term margins. Also, with regards to operating expenses, please note that CA World takes place in November, so the expenses of our biggest event of the year will hit in third quarter. 
For the year, the increased mix of ratable relative to upfront we experienced in both Q1 and Q2 has created a headwind to our reported revenue. As I mentioned earlier, this shift has resulted in downward pressure of approximately a point of reported quarterly revenue in each of the past 2 [ph] quarters. We expect this shift towards ratable revenue to occur again in the third quarter. As such, we'd like to provide headlights into our current view of the full year. We currently expect total revenue to be at the low end of our guidance of down 1% to flat in constant currency. This translates to reported revenue of around $4.0 billion to $4.04 billion. Please note that negative impact of foreign currency in our reported revenue outlook is around $40 million. 
We expect the full year GAAP operating margin of 28% and a full year non-GAAP operating margins of 38%, consistent with our prior expectations. Similar to our expectations for revenue, we believe operating margins will be negatively impacted by the increasing mix towards ratable revenue rather than upfront deals. Underlying this guidance, we expect our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate to be between 28% and 29%, consistent with our prior expectations. Non-GAAP diluted is expected to come and between 2% to 5%, consistent with our prior expectations. This translates to reported non-GAAP diluted of $2.34 to $2.40. The negative impact of foreign currency on earnings per share is around $0.03. 
GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to grow 7% to 11%. Prior guidance was an increase of 6% to 10%. This translates to reported GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.70 to $1.76. At the end of the year, we expect approximately 431 million shares outstanding and a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 436 million shares. Cash flow from operations is expected to increase 2% to 7% in constant currency, consistent with our prior expectations. This translates to reported cash flow from operations of $0.97 billion to $1.02 billion.

But as far as work goes, we still have work to be done. I'm still not completely satisfied where we are with the products. I want to do more organic innovation. We're launching a number of net new products at CA World so that's a great step in the right direction. I'm really happy with some of the thinking that's coming from the Rally team, this whole concept of Agile. I mean, my whole management team go through Agile training, my direct reports. And next week , I'm having the whole senior leadership team, which is the top 11 executives in the company, go through Agile training. This is something that I think is going to not only improve our product but change some of the ways we think and act, and that gets into the culture. I really do think we change the culture, the company where we're getting into, a culture of innovation, accountability, predictability and performance and moving away from a culture of entitlement and complacency. Between the number of net new people we've hired, the people that existed in the company and really get it and some of the great people we been able to bring it from acquisitions, I think we've got more than a critical mass of people that really understand how a modern software needs to operate and just how competitive it is to perform in this market. So when you have a competitive team that really gets it and starting to see our ability to win, win rates went up this quarter second quarter in a row, I'm feeling that we're definitely moving forward.

First of all, if you take a look over the last year, the majority of the large scale public tax has been the lack of identity management with respect to machine, where a user has either control of root and gets to other machines and imposes their user identity on those other machines, or even inadvertently open up ports on a machine that allows hackers to get into it. This is a very important piece of technology. We had a very comprehensive PIM solution. Xceedium just adds to that PIM solution. So this was added up to an already existing portfolio, and what we have, which I think is differentiating the market, is we have a much broader solution that covers more used cases with respect to Privileged Identity Management. There are a number of different competitors in this space. I think it's a big market. I think there's room for multiple players to be successful. I think the differentiating factor for us is that we are not a small company. We have global breadth and depth. We are continuously to invest larger sums of capital into the solution. And secondly, we have adjacencies in around the PIM solution. So when the customer comes to us, or taking a more holistic look at protecting their infrastructure."

We're a huge open-source user and we view that as a catalyst for our business. At the end of the day, you have to remember that the heritage of this company has always been in managing heterogeneous platforms, and we're probably one of the largest manager of open-source heterogenous platforms out there.

I know we've been managing multiple versions of Apache for years with our APM solution, which saw open-source. When you take a look at the UIM product, the UIM product supports almost all the popular open-source Linux platforms, including Red Hat, Susie, Send OX and Open Susie. and I think that as we see more innovation coming out of open-source, folding that into our platform in both APM and UIM, I think that makes once again a differentiator. We're the only ones that have the wherewithal to invest in multiple platforms as they come out instead of waiting for them to be thrown into a legacy systems or for an open-source project to start to manage multiple heterogeneous systems. We just haven't seen a lot of traction in the open-source community to do that. I think that, that's a unique place where we can fill the void."

I'm pleased to report that new sales were very strong in the second quarter. In fact, new sales delivered solid year-over-year growth across our Enterprise Solutions and Mainframe businesses. Our performance in th",1957,"Good afternoon. Thank you for joining us. I'm pleased to report that new sales were very strong in the second quarter. In fact, new sales delivered solid year-over-year growth across our Enterprise Solutions and Mainframe businesses. Our performance in the second quarter reflects the continued improvements we are making in both our products and our sales execution. In particular, I'm excited about new sales, an indicator of the great traction our solutions are experiencing. Our overall second quarter total new sales were up more than 40% year-over-year. In the quarter, a great portion of our new sales bookings were recognized ratably compared to our historical trends.
Enterprise Solutions new sales increased in the high 20s year-over-year. Mainframe new sales more than doubled year-over-year. In the second quarter, we closed a large system integrator renewal that was initially expected to transact in the second half of our fiscal year. The accelerated time to close this renewal was at their request and is a reflection of CA's strategic importance to the system integrator and its customers. We are very pleased with the outcome of this large renewal, which had a strong yield and a healthy new sales attach rate.
Our renewal yield in the quarter was in the high 90s. This is the best it's been in recent history. This is a testament to our pricing discipline and the ability of our sales teams to execute deals that realize the value of our solutions.
In today's Application Economy, a lot of mission critical data still resides in the Mainframe. This is particularly true of the big players, the Fortune 500. As such, it should not be a surprise that there will be quarters in which capacity buys are particularly strong as was the case in Q2. Excluding the large system integrator, our renewal yield would have been in the low 90s. Excluding the large system integrator renewal, total new sales increased in the mid-20s range, and Enterprise Solutions new sales increased in the mid-teens year-over-year.
Non-GAAP operating margin was 36% in the quarter, which was consistent with our expectation and commentary on our fiscal Q1 earnings call. Recall that the full percentage point impact on operating margin guidance for FY '16 was expected to be realized in our fiscal Q2. This is due to the expenses related to the Rally acquisition and realignment costs.
Our second quarter results were clearly a big step in the right direction, but there is still work to be done. While we are on track for the second half of our fiscal year, it is important to note that we expect it to be heavily weighted towards the fourth quarter. That said, I am increasingly confident that our results will reflect our work to deliver innovative solutions that truly solve customer's problems. Put simply, CA enables enterprises to capitalize the opportunities created by the Application Economy. In fact, once again, Gartner has rated CA Technologies with an overall positive rating in its latest August 2015 Vendor Rating report.
We remain focused on product quality and execution. Our Chief Product Officer and Chief Technology Officer are working in lockstep to ensure continuous improvement on our near and midterm product execution while driving us towards our longer-term Horizon 2, Horizon 3 technology leadership opportunities. Our strategy continues to stress organic innovation complemented by targeted strategic investments that are within 1 standard deviation of our core. A great example of this is our acquisition of Rally, a leader in the fast-growing Agile Application Life-Cycle Management software market, which closed on July 8. The rationale for this acquisition was threefold: First, Rally's products and services are highly complementary to our award-winning PPM solutions and strengthens CA's DevOps leadership; two, there is ample opportunity to cross sell, given the limited customer overlap; and third, the opportunity to accelerate Agile methodology internally at CA to drive improving velocity of our high-quality solutions.
3.5 months into the acquisition, I am very pleased to report that Rally is performing well. In many ways, it is doing better than our expectations. For example, total paid seats under contract at the end of Q2 grew in the high 20% range year-over-year. We define a paid seat as a seat with a subscription or support contract. Q2 saw a particularly large upgrade order from a global leader in networking routers and switches. This customer exemplifies Rally's successful land and expand strategy. Rally is able to prove strategic value in a small initial engagement and then grow exponentially within the customer. We are encouraged by the opportunity we see to further engage our customers around Agile.
In terms of integration, just last month, with G8, our first release of a bidirectionally integrated, combined Rally and CA PPM solution. This allows customers to combine planning and execution, track progress in real time and eliminate the need for point-to-point integrations. It creates a closed-loop system that vastly accelerates and improves the decision-making process. This level of integration is something with which point solution providers simply cannot compete. The broad value proposition that we offer in Rally combined with CA PPM and DevOps tools like service virtualization and release automation enable organizational transformation rather than small, disparate design teams functioning in silos. In fact, we often do not compete against point solutions in head-to-head evaluations. Rather, our solutions are deployed as a result of an enterprise decision to scale Agile methodologies across a number, sometimes hundreds, of development groups. Combined with CA's global enterprise engagement and support model, this puts us in a different class of solution providers.
Now, I'd like to highlight a few areas within Enterprise Solutions in which we are seeing very good progress. Our award-winning Clarity PPM platform, which has been one of the cornerstones of our Enterprise Solutions business, grew new sales over 70% year-over-year as reported. With the release of 14.2 in April and 14.3 last month, customers can now glean powerful management insights from their data, enabling them to view their product portfolios, investments across all platforms, including tablets and mobile. We are becoming increasingly confident in our ability to outpace the market. We believe we have the right products at the right time with a more seasoned sales force executing multiple 6-figure deals across geographies. We are particularly pleased with a major win at a large Canadian bank that was originally an on-premise customer using Clarity PPM for financial reporting. This transaction dramatically expands CA's engagement as it migrates to our on-demand platform and standardizes its financial reporting, product management and time tracking. This win displays both the customer's internal systems resources as well as CA's competitors.
Within DevOps, API management continues to grow at a rapid clip, with new sales up in the high 30s year-over-year as reported. We are a leader in the secular growth space. We are in a unique position to provide API management solutions at scale with the requisite Security features. CA's API management products enable customers to manage and protect the ever-growing volumes of data traversing across rapidly expanding digital platforms. Our solutions are recognized by both industry pundits and customers. Our leadership in this space is evidenced by a major win at a large U.S.-based auto manufacturer. This engagement represents an enterprise-wide expansion of our relationship and includes Mainframe, API management and DevOps. Importantly, it also establishes an initial footprint for CA into its finance division. We also secured a win at an American media company that provides local weather forecasts globally. This win was a competitive displacement, where CA API management was chosen due to its superior performance and scalability.
UIM, which is foundational to our DevOps portfolio, is a great example of Agile methodology deployment within CA. In fact, UIM was the first group within CA to adopt Rally and was its internal lighthouse sponsor. The resulting improvements with regard to product quality and velocity are notable. In the quarter, UIM had a major win with a large cloud infrastructure as a service company, who chose CA's UIM tool over its parent company's alternative offering. Another notable deal was a competitive win at a leading athletic apparel company that is embracing the Application Economy to transform into a lifestyle brand with a leading digital health platform. CA was chosen over a number of competitors for our ability to offer an enterprise-wide global solution and services view. Next month, at CA World in Las Vegas, you can expect to see net new product launches, some of which reflect our unique opportunity to bridge between distributed, cloud and mainframe. You will see our heightened emphasis on Agile and better appreciate how CA is in a unique position to benefit as large enterprise data center management strategies evolve to hybrid cloud environments. 
Given CA's rich heritage as a trusted vendor to large enterprises running mission critical workloads and providing support around the globe, we have a coveted seat at the table. This point is particularly salient when it comes to the fragment and security space. Our Security business had a very strong second quarter with new sales up over 60% year-over-year as reported. Results were positively impacted by the large system integrator renewal, where CA's Security footprint has expanded considerably. Even outside this large renewal, we closed multiple 6-figure transactions across a number of verticals including health care, automotive, technology and government.
In addition to the technology and expanded product portfolio breadth our recent acquisitions provide, they are also improving our visibility with customers who are increasingly viewing CA as a large committed vendor with staying power and is critically important, yet still incredibly fragmented space. We are very excited about our most recent acquisition, Xceedium, which extends our PIM or Privileged Identity Management offering. Xceedium positions us well in the rapidly growing network Security market as large enterprises have become increasingly aware and less tolerant of dangerous and often very public interorganizational security breaches. In fact, it appears to have also created a halo effect, lifting sales of existing PIM products as customers embrace our PIM roadmap.
Now turning to sales execution. I am pleased to report that our decision to separate platinum accounts from named and growth accounts, and to specialize sales by product discipline, continues to yield positive results. Globally, in the second quarter, our sales teams improved win rates, decreased average sales cycles, improved pipeline conversion rates and increased average deal sizes. This speaks to the team's improving efficiency and continued focus on accelerating velocity. In fact, for the second consecutive quarter, our combined named and growth sales teams delivered strong broad-based results.
While 2 quarters do not make a trend, we do expect the second half of the year to be weighted towards the fourth quarter. I am convinced that our sales execution strategy is on the right track. I invite you to come and see the progress we're making in terms of sales execution, product development and marketing strategy next month in Las Vegas. Please join us at CA World to see our product innovation firsthand and hear why customers are embracing CA solutions to differentiate and accelerate their products and processes in order to thrive in the emerging Application Economy. Our financial analyst track will take place on November 18 at the Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas. We hope to see you there. 
In aggregate, I am pleased with our second quarter results, particularly with regard to new sales, which reflects the success of our solutions are seeing in the market. That said, we recognize there is still work to do in order to drive the kind of growth that CA has a potential to achieve.
With that, I will turn the call over to Rich to review our second quarter financials and full year guidance. Thank you."
262913,312841788,879222,"CA, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 21, 2015",2015-10-21,"Earnings Calls","CA, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Mike. Before we get started with the quarter review, let me remind you that all comparisons are year-over-year and in constant currency unless otherwise indicated. This afternoon, I'm going to focus my comments on the key business drivers and p",1729,"Thank you, Mike. Before we get started with the quarter review, let me remind you that all comparisons are year-over-year and in constant currency unless otherwise indicated. This afternoon, I'm going to focus my comments on the key business drivers and performance indicators for the quarter. The balance of our financial details can be found in our supplemental and press release. As many of you are aware, overall, the dollar continues to strengthen, which negatively impacts our results and our guidance. Our Q2 total revenue was $1,005,000,000 and was down 1%. The increasing mix of new sales growing ratable compared to upfront, which we experienced in Q1, and again in Q2, has impacted reported quarterly revenue by approximately 1 point per quarter. If this trend persists, it will continue to be a headwind towards reported revenue.
Enterprise Solutions increased 3%, and Mainframe Solutions and Services were each down 3%. Q2 renewals were more than doubled year-over-year, both in constant currency and as reported. Excluding the large system integrator transaction, Q2 renewals would have been up in the low teens and in the high single digits as reported. As we have previously stated, the year-over-year change in our renewal bookings can vary on a quarterly basis due to the timing of large transactions.
Q2 total new product and capacity sales were up nearly 50% and over 40% as reported. This was due in part to a large system integrator renewal previously mentioned and the contribution from acquisitions, with Rally as the most meaningful. As Mike indicated, excluding the large system integrator renewal, total new sales increased in the mid-20s and high teens as reported, and Enterprise Solutions new sales increased in the mid-teens year-over-year, high single digits as reported.
Excluding the large system integrator renewal and excluding acquisitions, total organic new sales were up in the high teens in constant currency and low teens as reported. As Mike mentioned, Rally's total paid seats under contract increased in the high 20% range year-over-year. We disclosed this metric because we thought it would be helpful to show how well this acquisition is progressing. However, we do not intend to provide Rally's seat growth metric indefinitely. This is because in very large transactions, such as the 1 signed in the second quarter as well as those we believe can be executed over time with our platinum accounts, paid seat growth may not be an accurate proxy for expected revenue growth.
Renewal yield for the quarter was in the high 90% range. This is the highest it's been in recent history and was driven by the large system integrator. This renewal had a positive impact across our Mainframe and Enterprise Solutions business. Excluding this 1 transaction, our renewal yield was in the low 90s. The large system integrator renewed for a duration longer than our forecast. As such, we now expect fiscal 2016 renewals to be up at the mid-20s year-over-year as compared to fiscal 2015, and up approximately 20% as reported. Excluding the large system integrator renewal, we expect fiscal 2016 renewals to be up in the low single digits and down in the low single digits as reported.
Turning to geographies. New sales were particularly strong in North America, driven by the large system integrator renewal. New sales were also strong in EMEA and Latin America. However, new sales were down in APJ due to the timing renewals and generally weaker pipeline in the region. Within our segments, Q2 Mainframe new sales, including new product and capacity, more than doubled year-over-year both in constant currency and as reported. Overall, we continue to expect Mainframe revenue to be down in the low single digits over the medium term, which we believe is in line with the Mainframe market. Q2 Enterprise Solutions new product sales were up in the high 20s in constant currency and up approximately 20% as reported. Enterprise Solutions new sales, excluding the large system integrator transaction, would have increased in the mid-teens year-over-year and up high single digits as reported. New sales attached to renewals, including the large system integrator, contributions from our recent acquisition and solid performance in named and growth customers drove the improvement in Enterprise Solutions new product sales.
Services revenue decreased 3% in constant currency and 9% as reported. We expect lower services booking in the fiscal 2015 to be a headwind to fiscal 2016 revenue. Over the long term, we expect Services revenue to decline as we design our products to be easier to install and as we leverage partners.
Total revenue backlog improved to up 2% in constant currency or down 3% as reported. Current revenue backlog improved to down 2% in constant currency or down 7% as reported. As many of you know, current revenue backlog is impacted by the timing of large deals in our renewal portfolio. As contracts move closer towards their renewals, revenue backlog declines. In other words, backlog is heavily influenced by time. Given the timing of deals in our renewal portfolio, we expect current revenue backlog to tick down in the coming quarters. As I said before, consistent year-over-year growth and current revenue backlog is one of the indicators of future revenue growth. Current revenue backlog will likely grow when we demonstrate multiple quarters of new sales growth, while maintaining a low 90% renewal yield.
Q2 non-GAAP operating margin was 36% and GAAP operating margin was 26%. Segment operating margins in the quarter were 62% for Mainframe Solutions, 3% for Enterprise Solutions and 5% for services. Enterprise Solutions margins were negatively impacted by acquisitions and other related expenses, some of which we do not view as ongoing.
Our Q2 non-GAAP tax rate was 28% and our GAAP tax rate was 30%. Q2 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.56, down 6% year-over-year. Q2 GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.39, down 13%. Our Q2 CFFO was $43 million, down 32% year-over-year or down 35% as reported. CFFO declined year-over-year due to the combination of foreign exchange headwinds and lower single installment cash payments. Single installment cash payments were $105 million and down year-over-year.
We ended Q2 with approximately $660 million in net cash. During the quarter, we repurchased $65 million in shares and paid $110 million in dividends. We have $670 million remaining in our original $1 billion share repurchase program. During the quarter, we issued $400 million 5-year notes at 3.6%. We used the proceeds to pay down the revolver, accessed in conjunction with the closure of our acquisition of Rally. Subsequent to the close of Q2, we opportunistically took the 6.5-year $300 million senior term loan facility at LIBOR plus 150 points. The use of proceeds is for general corporate purposes and to provide increased flexibility to execute our capital allocation strategy. As you can see, the terms are attractive and the tenor fits well with our maturity profile. Our balance sheet is strong and, we remain committed to maintaining our investment-grade rating.
Now turning to guidance. Guidance is based on exchange rates on the last day of the preceding quarter, which was September 30, 2015. This includes a partial hedge of operating income. The guidance also assumes no material acquisitions. We expect currency to have a negative impact to our full year fiscal 2016 revenue of approximately 5% at September 30 rates. As Mike mentioned, we expect the second half of our fiscal year to be heavily weighted towards the fourth quarter. In other words, as we look to the back half of our fiscal year, we expect our results to be better in our fiscal fourth quarter than in our fiscal third quarter. Our expectations for a softer third quarter is the result of the expected timing of named and growth deals in the pipeline. As previously mentioned, we also expect the trend in mix whereby the increasing portion of deals are going ratable rather than upfront to continue in Q3. The impact of this is for revenue to be recognized over the course of time as opposed to in the current period. However, associated expenses are recognized in the current period, which negatively impacts near-term margins. Also, with regards to operating expenses, please note that CA World takes place in November, so the expenses of our biggest event of the year will hit in the third quarter.
For the year, the increased mix of ratable relative to upfront we experienced in both Q1 and Q2 has created a headwind to our reported revenue. As I mentioned earlier, this shift has resulted in downward pressure of approximately a point of reported quarterly revenue in each of the past 2 quarters. We expect this shift towards ratable revenue to occur again in the third quarter. As such, we'd like to provide headlights into our current view of the full year. We currently expect total revenue to be at the low end of our guidance or down 1% to flat in constant currency. This translates to reported revenue of around $4.0 billion to $4.04 billion. Please note that negative impact of foreign currency on our reported revenue outlook is around $40 million.
We expect the full year GAAP operating margin of 28% and a full year non-GAAP operating margin of 38%, consistent with our prior expectations. Similar to our expectations for revenue, we believe operating margins will be negatively impacted by the increasing mix towards ratable revenue rather than upfront deals. Underlying this guidance, we expect our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate to be between 28% and 29%, consistent with our prior expectations. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to come in between 2% to 5%, consistent with our prior expectations. This translates to reported non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.34 to $2.40. The negative impact of foreign currency on earnings per share is around $0.03.
GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to grow 7% to 11%. Prior guidance was an increase of 6% to 10%. This translates to reported GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.70 to $1.76. At the end of the year, we expect approximately 431 million shares outstanding and a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 436 million shares. Cash flow from operations is expected to increase 2% to 7% in constant currency, consistent with our prior expectations. This translates to reported cash flow from operations of $0.97 billion to $1.02 billion.

I was pretty happy with that. But as far as work goes, we still have work to be done. I am still not completely satisfied where we are with the products. I want to do more organic innovation. We're launching a number of net new products at CA World so that's a great step in the right direction. I'm really happy with some of the thinking that's coming from the Rally team, this whole concept of Agile. I mean, my whole management team go through Agile training, my direct reports. And next week , I'm having whole senior leadership team, which is the top 100 executives in the company, go through Agile training. This is something that I think is going to not only improve our products, but change some of the ways we think and act, and that gets into the culture. I really do think we've changed the culture of the company where we're getting into a culture of innovation, accountability, predictability and performance and moving away from a culture of entitlement and complacency. Between the number of net new people we've hired, the people that existed in the company and really get it and some of the great people we've been able to bring in from acquisitions. I think we've got more than a critical mass of people that really understand how a modern software needs to operate and just how competitive it is to perform in this market. So when you have a competitive team that really gets it and starting to see our ability to win, win rates went up this quarter second quarter in a row, I'm feeling that we're definitely moving forward.

So in general that was -- all the metrics were very strong as you can see, high renewal yield, high new both capacity, which is a Mainframe statement and new ES sales."

First of all, if you take a look over the last year, the majority of the large scale public hacks have been the lack of identity management with respect to machines, where a user has either control of root and gets to other machines and imposes their user identity on those other machines, or even inadvertently opens up ports on a machine that allows hackers to get into it. This is a very important piece of technology. We had a very comprehensive PIM solution. Xceedium just adds to that PIM solution. So this was additive to an already existing portfolio. And what we have, which I think is differentiating the market, we have a much broader solution that covers more use cases with respect to Privileged Identity Management. There are a number of different competitors in this space. I think it's a big market. I think there's room for multiple players to be successful. I think the differentiating factor for us is that we are not a small company. We have global breadth and depth. We are continuously to invest large sums of capital into the solution. And secondly, we have adjacencies in and around the PIM solution. So when a customer come to us, we're taking a more holistic look at protecting their infrastructure."

We saw that again in Q2, not the Q -- that 2 quarters make a consistent line for Q3 and Q4, but we are giving headlights that if that trend continues, it will drive the revenue in near-term year to the lower end of our guidance to the degree they flip back to their historical rate of attached versus not attached. You would be closer to the other end of guidance. All that revenue, though, is we'll capture. Now, we're just talking about the timing of when that revenue will actually be on the P&L.

We're a huge open-source user and we view that as a catalyst for our business. At the end of the day, you have to remember that the heritage of this company has always been in managing heterogeneous platforms, and we're probably one of the largest manager of open-source heterogenous platforms out there. If you just take a look at our APM solution, APM 10.1 was  launched just last week, and what we added into that release was both support a cloud foundry and docker to very powerful open-source systems that are getting extraordinarily quick traction in the market. I know we've been managing multiple versions of Apache for years with our APM solution, which saw open-source. When you take a look at the UIM product, the UIM product supports almost all the popular open-source Linux platforms, including Red Hat, SuSE, CentOS and openSUSE. And I think that as we see more innovation coming out of open-source, folding that into our platform on both APM and UIM, I think that makes once again a differentiator. We're the only one that have the wherewithal to invest in multiple platforms as they come out instead of waiting for them to be thrown into either legacy systems or for an open-source project to start to manage multiple heterogeneous systems. We just haven't seen a lot of traction in the open-source community to do that. I think that, that's a unique place where we can fill the void."

I'm pleased to report that new sales were very strong in the second quarter. In fact, new sales delivered solid year-over-year growth across our Enterprise Solutions and Mainframe businesses. Our performance in th",1950,"Good afternoon. Thank you for joining us. I'm pleased to report that new sales were very strong in the second quarter. In fact, new sales delivered solid year-over-year growth across our Enterprise Solutions and Mainframe businesses. Our performance in the second quarter reflects the continued improvements we are making in both our products and sales execution. In particular, I'm excited about new sales, an indicator of the great traction our solutions are experiencing. Our overall second quarter total new sales were up more than 40% year-over-year. In the quarter, a great portion of our new sales bookings were recognized ratably compared to our historical trends.
Enterprise Solutions new sales increased in the high 20s year-over-year. Mainframe new sales more than doubled year-over-year. In the second quarter, we closed a large system integrator renewal that was initially expected to transact in the second half of our fiscal year. The accelerated time to close this renewal was at their request and is a reflection of CA's strategic importance to the system integrator and its customers. We are very pleased with the outcome of this large renewal, which had a strong yield and a healthy new sales attach rate.
Our renewal yield in the quarter was in the high 90s. This is the best it's been in recent history. This is a testament to our pricing discipline and the ability of our sales teams to execute deals that realize the value of our solutions.
In today's Application Economy, a lot of mission critical data still resides in the Mainframe. This is particularly true of the big players, the Fortune 500. As such, it should not be a surprise that there will be quarters in which capacity buys are particularly strong, as was the case in Q2. Excluding the large system integrator, our renewal yield would have been in the low 90s. Excluding the large system integrator renewal, total new sales increased in the mid-20s range, and Enterprise Solutions new sales increased in the mid-teens year-over-year.
Non-GAAP operating margin was 36% in the quarter, which was consistent with our expectation and commentary on our fiscal Q1 earnings call. Recall that the full percentage point impact on operating margin guidance for FY '16 was expected to be realized in our fiscal Q2. This is due to the expenses related to the Rally acquisition and realignment costs.
Our second quarter results were clearly a big step in the right direction, but there is still work to be done. While we are on track for the second half of our fiscal year, it is important to note that we expect it to be heavily weighted towards the fourth quarter. That said, I am increasingly confident that our results will reflect our work to deliver innovative solutions that truly solve customers' problems. Put simply, CA enables enterprises to capitalize the opportunities created by the Application Economy. In fact, once again, Gartner has rated CA Technologies with an overall positive rating in its latest August 2015 Vendor Rating report.
We remain focused on product quality and execution. Our Chief Product Officer and Chief Technology Officer are working in lockstep to ensure continuous improvement on our near and midterm product execution while driving us towards our longer-term Horizon 2, Horizon 3 technology leadership opportunities. Our strategy continues to stress organic innovation complemented by targeted strategic investments that are within 1 standard deviation of our core. 
A great example of this is our acquisition of Rally, a leader in the fast-growing Agile Application Life-Cycle Management software market, which closed on July 8. The rationale for this acquisition was threefold: First, Rally's products and services are highly complementary to our award-winning PPM solutions and strengthens CA's DevOps leadership; two, there is ample opportunity to cross sell, given the limited customer overlap; and third, the opportunity to accelerate Agile methodology internally at CA to drive improving velocity of our high-quality solutions.
3.5 months into the acquisition, I am very pleased to report that Rally is performing well. In many ways, it is doing better than our expectations. For example, total paid seats under contract at the end of Q2 grew in the high 20% range year-over-year. We define a paid seat as a seat with a subscription or support contract. Q2 saw a particularly large upgrade order from a global leader in networking routers and switches. This customer exemplifies Rally's successful land-and-expand strategy. Rally is able to prove strategic value in a small initial engagement and then grow exponentially within the customer. We are encouraged by the opportunities we see to further engage our customers around Agile.
In terms of integration, just last month, with GA-ed, our first release of a bidirectionally integrated, combined Rally and CA PPM solution. This allows customers to combine planning and execution, track progress in real time and eliminate the need for point-to-point integrations. It creates a closed-loop system that vastly accelerates and improves the decision-making process. 
This level of integration is something with which point solution providers simply cannot compete. The broad value proposition that we offer in Rally combined with CA PPM and DevOps tools like service virtualization and release automation enable organizational transformation rather than small, disparate design teams functioning in silos. In fact, we often do not compete against point solutions in head-to-head evaluations. Rather, our solutions are deployed as a result of an enterprise decision to scale Agile methodologies across a number, sometimes hundreds, of development groups. Combined with CA's global enterprise engagement and support model, this puts us in a different class of solution providers.
Now, I'd like to highlight a few areas within Enterprise Solutions in which we are seeing very good progress. Our award-winning Clarity PPM platform, which has been one of the cornerstones of our Enterprise Solutions business, grew new sales over 70% year-over-year as reported. With the release of 14.2 in April and 14.3 last month, customers can now glean powerful management insights from their data, enabling them to view their product portfolios and investments across all platforms, including tablets and mobile. We are becoming increasingly confident in our ability to outpace the market. We believe we have the right products at the right time with a more seasoned sales force executing multiple 6-figure deals across geographies. 
We are particularly pleased with a major win at a large Canadian bank that was originally an on-premise customer using Clarity PPM for financial reporting. This transaction dramatically expands CA's engagement as it migrates to our on-demand platform and standardizes its financial reporting, product management and time tracking. This win displays both the customer's internal systems resources, as well as CA's competitors.
Within DevOps, API management continues to grow at a rapid clip, with new sales up in the high 30s year-over-year as reported. We are a leader in the secular growth space. We are in a unique position to provide API management solutions at scale with the requisite security features. CA's API management products enable customers to manage and protect the ever-growing volumes of data traversing across rapidly expanding digital platforms. Our solutions are recognized by both industry pundits and customers. 
Our leadership in this space is evidenced by a major win at a large U.S.-based auto manufacturer. This engagement represents an enterprise-wide expansion of our relationship and includes Mainframe, API management and DevOps. Importantly, it also establishes an initial footprint for CA into its finance division. We also secured a win at an American media company that provides local weather forecasts globally. This win was a competitive displacement, where CA API management was chosen due to its superior performance and scalability.
UIM, which is foundational to our DevOps portfolio, is a great example of Agile methodology deployment within CA. In fact, UIM was the first group within CA to adopt Rally and was its internal lighthouse sponsor. The resulting improvements with regard to product quality and velocity are notable. In the quarter, UIM had a major win with a large cloud Infrastructure-as-a-Service company, who chose CA's UIM tool over its parent company's alternative offering. Another notable deal was a competitive win at a leading athletic apparel company that is embracing the Application Economy to transform into a lifestyle brand with a leading digital health platform. CA was chosen over a number of competitors for our ability to offer an enterprise-wide global solution and services view. 
Next month, at CA World in Las Vegas, you can expect to see net new product launches, some of which reflect our unique opportunity to bridge between distributed cloud and mainframe. You will see our heightened emphasis on Agile and better appreciate how CA is in a unique position to benefit as large enterprise data center management strategies evolve to hybrid cloud environments. 
Given CA's rich heritage as a trusted vendor to large enterprises running mission-critical workloads and providing support around the globe, we have a coveted seat at the table. This point is particularly salient when it comes to the fragmented security space. 
Our Security business had a very strong second quarter, with new sales up over 60% year-over-year as reported. Results were positively impacted by the large system integrator renewal, where CA's Security footprint has expanded considerably. Even outside this large renewal, we closed multiple 6-figure transactions across a number of verticals, including health care, automotive, technology and government.
In addition to the technology and expanded product portfolio breadth our recent acquisitions provide, they are also improving our visibility with customers who are increasingly viewing CA as a large committed vendor with staying power in this critically important, yet still incredibly fragmented space. 
We are very excited about our most recent acquisition, Xceedium, which extends our PIM or Privileged Identity Management offering. Xceedium positions us well in the rapidly growing network Security market as large enterprises have become increasingly aware and less tolerant of dangerous and often very public intra-organizational security breaches. In fact, it appears to have also created a halo effect, lifting sales of existing PIM products as customers embrace our PIM road map.
Now, turning to sales execution. I am pleased to report that our decision to separate platinum accounts from named and growth accounts, and to specialize sales by product discipline continues to yield positive results. Globally, in the second quarter, our sales teams improved win rates, decreased average sales cycles, improved pipeline conversion rates and increased average deal sizes. This speaks to the team's improving efficiency and continued focus on accelerating velocity. In fact, for the second consecutive quarter, our combined named and growth sales teams delivered strong broad-based results.
While 2 quarters do not make a trend, we do expect the second half of the year to be weighted towards the fourth quarter. I am convinced that our sales execution strategy is on the right track. 
I invite you to come and see the progress we're making in terms of sales execution, product development and marketing strategy next month in Las Vegas. Please join us at CA World to see our product innovation firsthand and hear why customers are embracing CA solutions to differentiate and accelerate their products and processes in order to thrive in the emerging Application Economy. Our financial analyst track will take place on November 18 at the Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas. We hope to see you there. 
In aggregate, I am pleased with our second quarter results, particularly with regard to new sales, which reflects the success our solutions are seeing in the market. That said, we recognize there is still work to do in order to drive the kind of growth that CA has the potential to achieve.
With that, I will turn the call over to Rich to review our second quarter financials and full year guidance. Thank you."
262913,312841788,879257,"CA, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 21, 2015",2015-10-21,"Earnings Calls","CA, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Mike. Before we get started with the quarter review, let me remind you that all comparisons are year-over-year and in constant currency unless otherwise indicated. This afternoon, I'm going to focus my comments on the key business drivers and p",1728,"Thank you, Mike. Before we get started with the quarter review, let me remind you that all comparisons are year-over-year and in constant currency unless otherwise indicated. This afternoon, I'm going to focus my comments on the key business drivers and performance indicators for the quarter. The balance of our financial details can be found in our supplemental and press release. 
As many of you are aware, overall, the dollar continues to strengthen, which negatively impacts our results and our guidance. Our Q2 total revenue was $1,005,000,000 and was down 1%. The increasing mix of new sales going ratable compared to upfront, which we experienced in Q1 and again in Q2, has impacted reported quarterly revenue by approximately 1 point per quarter. If this trend persists, it will continue to be a headwind towards reported revenue.
Enterprise Solutions increased 3%, and Mainframe Solutions and Services were each down 3%. 
Q2 renewals more than doubled year-over-year, both in constant currency and as reported. Excluding the large system integrator transaction, Q2 renewals would have been up in the low teens and in the high single digits as reported. As we have previously stated, the year-over-year change in our renewal bookings can vary on a quarterly basis due to the timing of large transactions.
Q2 total new product and capacity sales were up nearly 50% and over 40% as reported. This was due in part to a large system integrator renewal previously mentioned and the contribution from acquisitions, with Rally as the most meaningful. As Mike indicated, excluding the large system integrator renewal, total new sales increased in the mid-20s and high teens as reported, and Enterprise Solutions' new sales increased in the mid-teens year-over-year, high single digits as reported.
Excluding the large system integrator renewal and excluding acquisitions, total organic new sales were up in the high teens in constant currency and low teens as reported. As Mike mentioned, Rally's total paid seats under contract increased in the high 20% range year-over-year. We disclose this metric because we thought it would be helpful to show how well this acquisition is progressing. However, we do not intend to provide Rally's seat growth metric indefinitely. This is because in very large transactions, such as the 1 signed in the second quarter, as well as those we believe can be executed over time with our platinum accounts, paid seat growth may not be an accurate proxy for expected revenue growth.
Renewal yield for the quarter was in the high 90% range. This is the highest it's been in recent history and was driven by the large system integrator. This renewal had a positive impact across our Mainframe and Enterprise Solutions business. Excluding this 1 transaction, our renewal yield was in the low 90s. 
The large system integrator renewed for a duration longer than our forecast. As such, we now expect fiscal 2016 renewals to be up in the mid-20s year-over-year as compared to fiscal 2015, and up approximately 20% as reported. Excluding the large system integrator renewal, we expect fiscal 2016 renewals to be up in the low single digits and down in the low single digits as reported.
Turning to geographies. New sales were particularly strong in North America, driven by the large system integrator renewal. New sales were also strong in EMEA and Latin America. However, new sales were down in APJ due to the timing of renewals and generally weaker pipeline in the region. 
Within our segments, Q2 Mainframe new sales, including new product and capacity, more than doubled year-over-year, both in constant currency and as reported. Overall, we continue to expect Mainframe revenue to be down in the low single digits over the medium term, which we believe is in line with the Mainframe market. 
Q2 Enterprise Solutions' new product sales were up in the high 20s in constant currency and up approximately 20% as reported. Enterprise Solutions' new sales, excluding the large system integrator transaction, would have increased in the mid-teens year-over-year and up high single digits as reported. New sales attached to renewals, including the large system integrator, contributions from our recent acquisition and solid performance in named and growth customers drove the improvement in Enterprise Solutions' new product sales.
Services revenue decreased 3% in constant currency and 9% as reported. We expect lower services booking in fiscal 2015 to be a headwind to fiscal 2016 revenue. Over the long term, we expect Services revenue to decline as we design our products to be easier to install and as we leverage partners.
Total revenue backlog improved to up 2% in constant currency or down 3% as reported. Current revenue backlog improved to down 2% in constant currency or down 7% as reported. As many of you know, current revenue backlog is impacted by the timing of large deals in our renewal portfolio. As contracts move closer towards their renewals, revenue backlog declines. In other words, backlog is heavily influenced by time. Given the timing of deals in our renewal portfolio, we expect current revenue backlog to tick down in the coming quarters. 
As I said before, consistent year-over-year growth and current revenue backlog is one of the indicators of future revenue growth. Current revenue backlog will likely grow when we demonstrate multiple quarters of new sales growth, while maintaining a low 90% renewal yield.
Q2 non-GAAP operating margin was 36% and GAAP operating margin was 26%. Segment operating margins in the quarter were 62% for Mainframe Solutions, 3% for Enterprise Solutions and 5% for Services. Enterprise Solutions' margins were negatively impacted by acquisitions and other related expenses, some of which we do not view as ongoing.
Our Q2 non-GAAP tax rate was 28% and our GAAP tax rate was 30%. 
Q2 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.56, down 6% year-over-year. Q2 GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.39, down 13%. 
Our Q2 CFFO was $43 million, down 32% year-over-year or down 35% as reported. CFFO declined year-over-year due to the combination of foreign exchange headwinds and lower single installment cash payments. Single installment cash payments were $105 million and down year-over-year.
We ended Q2 with approximately $660 million in net cash. During the quarter, we repurchased $65 million in shares and paid $110 million in dividends. We have $670 million remaining in our original $1 billion share repurchase program. 
During the quarter, we issued $400 million 5-year notes at 3.6%. We used the proceeds to pay down the revolver accessed in conjunction with the closure of our acquisition of Rally. 
Subsequent to the close of Q2, we opportunistically took a 6.5-year $300 million senior term loan facility at LIBOR plus 150 points. The use of proceeds is for general corporate purposes and to provide increased flexibility to execute our capital allocation strategy. As you can see, the terms are attractive and the tenor fits well with our maturity profile. Our balance sheet is strong and we remain committed to maintaining our investment-grade rating.
Now, turning to guidance. Guidance is based on exchange rates on the last day of the preceding quarter, which was September 30, 2015. This includes a partial hedge of operating income. The guidance also assumes no material acquisitions. We expect currency to have a negative impact to our full year fiscal 2016 revenue of approximately 5% at September 30 rates. 
As Mike mentioned, we expect the second half of our fiscal year to be heavily weighted towards the fourth quarter. In other words, as we look to the back half of our fiscal year, we expect our results to be better in the fiscal fourth quarter than in our fiscal third quarter. Our expectations for a softer third quarter is the result of the expected timing of named and growth deals in the pipeline. 
As previously mentioned, we also expect the trend in mix whereby the increasing portion of deals are going ratable rather than upfront to continue in Q3. The impact of this is for revenue to be recognized over the course of time as opposed to in the current period. However, associated expenses are recognized in the current period, which negatively impacts near-term margins. 
Also, with regards to operating expenses, please note that CA World takes place in November, so the expenses of our biggest event of the year will hit in the third quarter.
For the year, the increased mix of ratable relative to upfront we experienced in both Q1 and Q2 has created a headwind to our reported revenue. As I mentioned earlier, this shift has resulted in downward pressure of approximately a point of reported quarterly revenue in each of the past 2 quarters. 
We expect this shift towards ratable revenue to occur again in the third quarter. As such, we'd like to provide headlights into our current view of the full year. We currently expect total revenue to be at the low end of our guidance or down 1% to flat in constant currency. This translates to reported revenue of around $4.0 billion to $4.04 billion. Please note that negative impact of foreign currency on our reported revenue outlook is around $40 million.
We expect a full year GAAP operating margin of 28% and a full year non-GAAP operating margin of 38%, consistent with our prior expectations. Similar to our expectations for revenue, we believe operating margins will be negatively impacted by the increasing mix towards ratable revenue rather than upfront deals. 
Underlying this guidance, we expect our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate to be between 28% and 29%, consistent with our prior expectations. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to come in between 2% and 5%, consistent with our prior expectations. This translates to reported non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.34 to $2.40. The negative impact of foreign currency on earnings per share is around $0.03.
GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to grow 7% to 11%. Prior guidance was an increase of 6% to 10%. This translates to reported GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.70 to $1.76. 
At the end of the year, we expect approximately 431 million shares outstanding and a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 436 million shares. 
Cash flow from operations is expected to increase 2% to 7% in constant currency, consistent with our prior expectations. This translates to reported cash flow from operations of $0.97 billion to $1.02 billion.
And now we'll take your questions."

But as far as work goes, we still have work to be done. I am still not completely satisfied where we are with the products. I want to do more organic innovation. We're launching a number of net new products at CA World, so that's a great step in the right direction. I'm really happy with some of the thinking that's coming from the Rally team, this whole concept of Agile. I made my whole management team go through Agile training, my direct reports. And next week , I'm having the whole senior leadership team, which is the top 100 executives in the company, go through Agile training. This is something that I think is going to not only improve our products, but change some of the ways we think and act, and that gets into the culture. I really do think we've changed the culture of the company where we're getting into a culture of innovation, accountability, predictability and performance, and moving away from a culture of entitlement and complacency. Between the number of net new people we've hired, the people that existed in the company and really get it and some of the great people we've been able to bring in from acquisitions, I think we've got more than a critical mass of people that really understand how a modern software needs to operate and just how competitive it is to perform in this market. So when you have a competitive team that really gets it and we're starting to see our ability to win, win rates went up this quarter second quarter in a row, I'm feeling that we're definitely moving forward.

We planned for less and they actually came in longer between the 2 companies and I'll let Mike comment on.

And as we've been seeing, Services over time will continue to go down, the buy design as we build our products that need less and less services. So that drags about almost half of that current point down. And the second part is really just as you look at the timing of renewals. So you look at the back half has more than the front and then you start to reach into next year. And so that's just more timing as we see them come out. To your point, over time, we believe and if we continue to have sustained improvement, we will be able to offset both of those. And so as we close the gap from prior quarters, we have a few more quarters before that will turn positive."

First of all, if you take a look over the last year, the majority of the large-scale public hacks have been the lack of identity management with respect to machines, where a user has either control of root and gets to other machines and imposes their user identity on those other machines, or even inadvertently opens up ports on a machine that allows hackers to get into it. This is a very important piece of technology. We have a very comprehensive PIM solution. Xceedium just adds to that PIM solution. So this was additive to an already existing portfolio. And what we have, which I think is differentiating the market, is we have much broader solution that covers more use cases with respect to Privileged Identity Management. There are a number of different competitors in this space. I think it's a big market. I think there's room for multiple players to be successful. I think the differentiating factor for us is that we are not a small company. We have global breadth and depth. We are continuously to invest large sums of capital into this solution. And secondly, we have adjacencies in and around the PIM solution so that when a customer comes to us, we're taking a more holistic look at protecting their infrastructure."

We saw a large part of our portfolio perform well and it was fairly balanced. We had another strong quarter out of Europe, and we had a strong quarter out of North America. We had a strong quarter out of Latin America despite Brazil so it was the rest of Latin America. So really, the only geo that was a little soft was APJ. So it was a very good ES quarter.

We saw that again in Q2, not the Q -- that 2 quarters make a consistent line for Q3 and Q4, but we were giving headlights that if that trend continues, it will drive the revenue in near-term year to the lower end of our guidance. To the degree they flip back to their historical rate of attached versus not attached, you would be closer to the other end of guidance. All that revenue, though, is we'll capture. Now, we're just talking about the timing of when that revenue will actually be on the P&L. So all in all, we've had a very strong first half.

We're a huge open-source user and we view that as a catalyst for our business. At the end of the day, you have to remember that the heritage of this company has always been in managing heterogeneous platforms, and we're probably one of the largest manager of open-source heterogeneous platforms out there. If you just take a look at our APM solution, APM 10.1 was  launched just last week, and what we added into that release was both support a cloud foundry and docker; 2 very powerful open-source systems that are getting extraordinarily quick traction in the market. I know we've been managing multiple versions of Apache for years with our APM solution, which is all open-source. When you take a look at the UIM product, the UIM product supports almost all the popular open-source Linux platforms, including Red Hat, SuSE, CentOS and openSUSE. And I think that as we see more innovation coming out of open-source, folding that into our platform on both APM and UIM, I think that makes once again a differentiator. We're the only ones that have the wherewithal to invest in multiple platforms as they come out instead of waiting for them to be thrown into either legacy systems or for an open-source project to start to manage multiple heterogeneous systems. We just haven't seen a lot of traction in the open-source community to do that. I think that that's a unique place where we can fill a void."

I'm pleased to report that new sales were very strong in the second quarter. In fact, new sales delivered solid year-over-year growth across our Enterprise Solutions and Mainframe businesses. Our performance in th",1950,"Good afternoon. Thank you for joining us. I'm pleased to report that new sales were very strong in the second quarter. In fact, new sales delivered solid year-over-year growth across our Enterprise Solutions and Mainframe businesses. Our performance in the second quarter reflects the continued improvements we are making in both our products and sales execution. In particular, I'm excited about new sales, an indicator of the great traction our solutions are experiencing. Our overall second quarter total new sales were up more than 40% year-over-year. In the quarter, a great portion of our new sales bookings were recognized ratably compared to our historical trends.
Enterprise Solutions new sales increased in the high 20s year-over-year. Mainframe new sales more than doubled year-over-year. In the second quarter, we closed a large system integrator renewal that was initially expected to transact in the second half of our fiscal year. The accelerated time to close this renewal was at their request and is a reflection of CA's strategic importance to the system integrator and its customers. We are very pleased with the outcome of this large renewal, which had a strong yield and a healthy new sales attach rate.
Our renewal yield in the quarter was in the high 90s. This is the best it's been in recent history. This is a testament to our pricing discipline and the ability of our sales teams to execute deals that realize the value of our solutions.
In today's Application Economy, a lot of mission critical data still resides in the Mainframe. This is particularly true of the big players, the Fortune 500. As such, it should not be a surprise that there will be quarters in which capacity buys are particularly strong, as was the case in Q2. Excluding the large system integrator, our renewal yield would have been in the low 90s. Excluding the large system integrator renewal, total new sales increased in the mid-20s range, and Enterprise Solutions new sales increased in the mid-teens year-over-year.
Non-GAAP operating margin was 36% in the quarter, which was consistent with our expectation and commentary on our fiscal Q1 earnings call. Recall that the full percentage point impact on operating margin guidance for FY '16 was expected to be realized in our fiscal Q2. This is due to the expenses related to the Rally acquisition and realignment costs.
Our second quarter results were clearly a big step in the right direction, but there is still work to be done. While we are on track for the second half of our fiscal year, it is important to note that we expect it to be heavily weighted towards the fourth quarter. That said, I am increasingly confident that our results will reflect our work to deliver innovative solutions that truly solve customers' problems. Put simply, CA enables enterprises to capitalize the opportunities created by the Application Economy. In fact, once again, Gartner has rated CA Technologies with an overall positive rating in its latest August 2015 Vendor Rating report.
We remain focused on product quality and execution. Our Chief Product Officer and Chief Technology Officer are working in lockstep to ensure continuous improvement on our near and midterm product execution while driving us towards our longer-term Horizon 2, Horizon 3 technology leadership opportunities. Our strategy continues to stress organic innovation complemented by targeted strategic investments that are within 1 standard deviation of our core. 
A great example of this is our acquisition of Rally, a leader in the fast-growing Agile Application Life-Cycle Management software market, which closed on July 8. The rationale for this acquisition was threefold: First, Rally's products and services are highly complementary to our award-winning PPM solutions and strengthens CA's DevOps leadership; two, there is ample opportunity to cross sell, given the limited customer overlap; and third, the opportunity to accelerate Agile methodology internally at CA to drive improving velocity of our high-quality solutions.
3.5 months into the acquisition, I am very pleased to report that Rally is performing well. In many ways, it is doing better than our expectations. For example, total paid seats under contract at the end of Q2 grew in the high 20% range year-over-year. We define a paid seat as a seat with a subscription or support contract. Q2 saw a particularly large upgrade order from a global leader in networking routers and switches. This customer exemplifies Rally's successful land-and-expand strategy. Rally is able to prove strategic value in a small initial engagement and then grow exponentially within the customer. We are encouraged by the opportunities we see to further engage our customers around Agile.
In terms of integration, just last month, with GA-ed, our first release of a bidirectionally integrated, combined Rally and CA PPM solution. This allows customers to combine planning and execution, track progress in real time and eliminate the need for point-to-point integrations. It creates a closed-loop system that vastly accelerates and improves the decision-making process. 
This level of integration is something with which point solution providers simply cannot compete. The broad value proposition that we offer in Rally combined with CA PPM and DevOps tools like service virtualization and release automation enable organizational transformation rather than small, disparate design teams functioning in silos. In fact, we often do not compete against point solutions in head-to-head evaluations. Rather, our solutions are deployed as a result of an enterprise decision to scale Agile methodologies across a number, sometimes hundreds, of development groups. Combined with CA's global enterprise engagement and support model, this puts us in a different class of solution providers.
Now, I'd like to highlight a few areas within Enterprise Solutions in which we are seeing very good progress. Our award-winning Clarity PPM platform, which has been one of the cornerstones of our Enterprise Solutions business, grew new sales over 70% year-over-year as reported. With the release of 14.2 in April and 14.3 last month, customers can now glean powerful management insights from their data, enabling them to view their product portfolios and investments across all platforms, including tablets and mobile. We are becoming increasingly confident in our ability to outpace the market. We believe we have the right products at the right time with a more seasoned sales force executing multiple 6-figure deals across geographies. 
We are particularly pleased with a major win at a large Canadian bank that was originally an on-premise customer using Clarity PPM for financial reporting. This transaction dramatically expands CA's engagement as it migrates to our on-demand platform and standardizes its financial reporting, product management and time tracking. This win displays both the customer's internal systems resources, as well as CA's competitors.
Within DevOps, API management continues to grow at a rapid clip, with new sales up in the high 30s year-over-year as reported. We are a leader in the secular growth space. We are in a unique position to provide API management solutions at scale with the requisite security features. CA's API management products enable customers to manage and protect the ever-growing volumes of data traversing across rapidly expanding digital platforms. Our solutions are recognized by both industry pundits and customers. 
Our leadership in this space is evidenced by a major win at a large U.S.-based auto manufacturer. This engagement represents an enterprise-wide expansion of our relationship and includes Mainframe, API management and DevOps. Importantly, it also establishes an initial footprint for CA into its finance division. We also secured a win at an American media company that provides local weather forecasts globally. This win was a competitive displacement, where CA API management was chosen due to its superior performance and scalability.
UIM, which is foundational to our DevOps portfolio, is a great example of Agile methodology deployment within CA. In fact, UIM was the first group within CA to adopt Rally and was its internal lighthouse sponsor. The resulting improvements with regard to product quality and velocity are notable. In the quarter, UIM had a major win with a large cloud Infrastructure-as-a-Service company, who chose CA's UIM tool over its parent company's alternative offering. Another notable deal was a competitive win at a leading athletic apparel company that is embracing the Application Economy to transform into a lifestyle brand with a leading digital health platform. CA was chosen over a number of competitors for our ability to offer an enterprise-wide global solution and services view. 
Next month, at CA World in Las Vegas, you can expect to see net new product launches, some of which reflect our unique opportunity to bridge between distributed cloud and mainframe. You will see our heightened emphasis on Agile and better appreciate how CA is in a unique position to benefit as large enterprise data center management strategies evolve to hybrid cloud environments. 
Given CA's rich heritage as a trusted vendor to large enterprises running mission-critical workloads and providing support around the globe, we have a coveted seat at the table. This point is particularly salient when it comes to the fragmented security space. 
Our Security business had a very strong second quarter, with new sales up over 60% year-over-year as reported. Results were positively impacted by the large system integrator renewal, where CA's Security footprint has expanded considerably. Even outside this large renewal, we closed multiple 6-figure transactions across a number of verticals, including health care, automotive, technology and government.
In addition to the technology and expanded product portfolio breadth our recent acquisitions provide, they are also improving our visibility with customers who are increasingly viewing CA as a large committed vendor with staying power in this critically important, yet still incredibly fragmented space. 
We are very excited about our most recent acquisition, Xceedium, which extends our PIM or Privileged Identity Management offering. Xceedium positions us well in the rapidly growing network Security market as large enterprises have become increasingly aware and less tolerant of dangerous and often very public intra-organizational security breaches. In fact, it appears to have also created a halo effect, lifting sales of existing PIM products as customers embrace our PIM road map.
Now, turning to sales execution. I am pleased to report that our decision to separate platinum accounts from named and growth accounts, and to specialize sales by product discipline continues to yield positive results. Globally, in the second quarter, our sales teams improved win rates, decreased average sales cycles, improved pipeline conversion rates and increased average deal sizes. This speaks to the team's improving efficiency and continued focus on accelerating velocity. In fact, for the second consecutive quarter, our combined named and growth sales teams delivered strong broad-based results.
While 2 quarters do not make a trend, we do expect the second half of the year to be weighted towards the fourth quarter. I am convinced that our sales execution strategy is on the right track. 
I invite you to come and see the progress we're making in terms of sales execution, product development and marketing strategy next month in Las Vegas. Please join us at CA World to see our product innovation firsthand and hear why customers are embracing CA solutions to differentiate and accelerate their products and processes in order to thrive in the emerging Application Economy. Our financial analyst track will take place on November 18 at the Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas. We hope to see you there. 
In aggregate, I am pleased with our second quarter results, particularly with regard to new sales, which reflects the success our solutions are seeing in the market. That said, we recognize there is still work to do in order to drive the kind of growth that CA has the potential to achieve.
With that, I will turn the call over to Rich to review our second quarter financials and full year guidance. Thank you."
262913,312841788,879263,"CA, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 21, 2015",2015-10-21,"Earnings Calls","CA, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Mike. Before we get started with the quarter review, let me remind you that all comparisons are year-over-year and in constant currency unless otherwise indicated. This afternoon, I'm going to focus my comments on the key business drivers and p",1728,"Thank you, Mike. Before we get started with the quarter review, let me remind you that all comparisons are year-over-year and in constant currency unless otherwise indicated. This afternoon, I'm going to focus my comments on the key business drivers and performance indicators for the quarter. The balance of our financial details can be found in our supplemental and press release. 
As many of you are aware, overall, the dollar continues to strengthen, which negatively impacts our results and our guidance. Our Q2 total revenue was $1,005,000,000 and was down 1%. The increasing mix of new sales going ratable compared to upfront, which we experienced in Q1 and again in Q2, has impacted reported quarterly revenue by approximately 1 point per quarter. If this trend persists, it will continue to be a headwind towards reported revenue.
Enterprise Solutions increased 3%, and Mainframe Solutions and Services were each down 3%. 
Q2 renewals more than doubled year-over-year, both in constant currency and as reported. Excluding the large system integrator transaction, Q2 renewals would have been up in the low teens and in the high single digits as reported. As we have previously stated, the year-over-year change in our renewal bookings can vary on a quarterly basis due to the timing of large transactions.
Q2 total new product and capacity sales were up nearly 50% and over 40% as reported. This was due in part to a large system integrator renewal previously mentioned and the contribution from acquisitions, with Rally as the most meaningful. As Mike indicated, excluding the large system integrator renewal, total new sales increased in the mid-20s and high teens as reported, and Enterprise Solutions' new sales increased in the mid-teens year-over-year, high single digits as reported.
Excluding the large system integrator renewal and excluding acquisitions, total organic new sales were up in the high teens in constant currency and low teens as reported. As Mike mentioned, Rally's total paid seats under contract increased in the high 20% range year-over-year. We disclose this metric because we thought it would be helpful to show how well this acquisition is progressing. However, we do not intend to provide Rally's seat growth metric indefinitely. This is because in very large transactions, such as the 1 signed in the second quarter, as well as those we believe can be executed over time with our platinum accounts, paid seat growth may not be an accurate proxy for expected revenue growth.
Renewal yield for the quarter was in the high 90% range. This is the highest it's been in recent history and was driven by the large system integrator. This renewal had a positive impact across our Mainframe and Enterprise Solutions business. Excluding this 1 transaction, our renewal yield was in the low 90s. 
The large system integrator renewed for a duration longer than our forecast. As such, we now expect fiscal 2016 renewals to be up in the mid-20s year-over-year as compared to fiscal 2015, and up approximately 20% as reported. Excluding the large system integrator renewal, we expect fiscal 2016 renewals to be up in the low single digits and down in the low single digits as reported.
Turning to geographies. New sales were particularly strong in North America, driven by the large system integrator renewal. New sales were also strong in EMEA and Latin America. However, new sales were down in APJ due to the timing of renewals and generally weaker pipeline in the region. 
Within our segments, Q2 Mainframe new sales, including new product and capacity, more than doubled year-over-year, both in constant currency and as reported. Overall, we continue to expect Mainframe revenue to be down in the low single digits over the medium term, which we believe is in line with the Mainframe market. 
Q2 Enterprise Solutions' new product sales were up in the high 20s in constant currency and up approximately 20% as reported. Enterprise Solutions' new sales, excluding the large system integrator transaction, would have increased in the mid-teens year-over-year and up high single digits as reported. New sales attached to renewals, including the large system integrator, contributions from our recent acquisition and solid performance in named and growth customers drove the improvement in Enterprise Solutions' new product sales.
Services revenue decreased 3% in constant currency and 9% as reported. We expect lower services booking in fiscal 2015 to be a headwind to fiscal 2016 revenue. Over the long term, we expect Services revenue to decline as we design our products to be easier to install and as we leverage partners.
Total revenue backlog improved to up 2% in constant currency or down 3% as reported. Current revenue backlog improved to down 2% in constant currency or down 7% as reported. As many of you know, current revenue backlog is impacted by the timing of large deals in our renewal portfolio. As contracts move closer towards their renewals, revenue backlog declines. In other words, backlog is heavily influenced by time. Given the timing of deals in our renewal portfolio, we expect current revenue backlog to tick down in the coming quarters. 
As I said before, consistent year-over-year growth and current revenue backlog is one of the indicators of future revenue growth. Current revenue backlog will likely grow when we demonstrate multiple quarters of new sales growth, while maintaining a low 90% renewal yield.
Q2 non-GAAP operating margin was 36% and GAAP operating margin was 26%. Segment operating margins in the quarter were 62% for Mainframe Solutions, 3% for Enterprise Solutions and 5% for Services. Enterprise Solutions' margins were negatively impacted by acquisitions and other related expenses, some of which we do not view as ongoing.
Our Q2 non-GAAP tax rate was 28% and our GAAP tax rate was 30%. 
Q2 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.56, down 6% year-over-year. Q2 GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.39, down 13%. 
Our Q2 CFFO was $43 million, down 32% year-over-year or down 35% as reported. CFFO declined year-over-year due to the combination of foreign exchange headwinds and lower single installment cash payments. Single installment cash payments were $105 million and down year-over-year.
We ended Q2 with approximately $660 million in net cash. During the quarter, we repurchased $65 million in shares and paid $110 million in dividends. We have $670 million remaining in our original $1 billion share repurchase program. 
During the quarter, we issued $400 million 5-year notes at 3.6%. We used the proceeds to pay down the revolver accessed in conjunction with the closure of our acquisition of Rally. 
Subsequent to the close of Q2, we opportunistically took a 6.5-year $300 million senior term loan facility at LIBOR plus 150 points. The use of proceeds is for general corporate purposes and to provide increased flexibility to execute our capital allocation strategy. As you can see, the terms are attractive and the tenor fits well with our maturity profile. Our balance sheet is strong and we remain committed to maintaining our investment-grade rating.
Now, turning to guidance. Guidance is based on exchange rates on the last day of the preceding quarter, which was September 30, 2015. This includes a partial hedge of operating income. The guidance also assumes no material acquisitions. We expect currency to have a negative impact to our full year fiscal 2016 revenue of approximately 5% at September 30 rates. 
As Mike mentioned, we expect the second half of our fiscal year to be heavily weighted towards the fourth quarter. In other words, as we look to the back half of our fiscal year, we expect our results to be better in the fiscal fourth quarter than in our fiscal third quarter. Our expectations for a softer third quarter is the result of the expected timing of named and growth deals in the pipeline. 
As previously mentioned, we also expect the trend in mix whereby the increasing portion of deals are going ratable rather than upfront to continue in Q3. The impact of this is for revenue to be recognized over the course of time as opposed to in the current period. However, associated expenses are recognized in the current period, which negatively impacts near-term margins. 
Also, with regards to operating expenses, please note that CA World takes place in November, so the expenses of our biggest event of the year will hit in the third quarter.
For the year, the increased mix of ratable relative to upfront we experienced in both Q1 and Q2 has created a headwind to our reported revenue. As I mentioned earlier, this shift has resulted in downward pressure of approximately a point of reported quarterly revenue in each of the past 2 quarters. 
We expect this shift towards ratable revenue to occur again in the third quarter. As such, we'd like to provide headlights into our current view of the full year. We currently expect total revenue to be at the low end of our guidance or down 1% to flat in constant currency. This translates to reported revenue of around $4.0 billion to $4.04 billion. Please note that negative impact of foreign currency on our reported revenue outlook is around $40 million.
We expect a full year GAAP operating margin of 28% and a full year non-GAAP operating margin of 38%, consistent with our prior expectations. Similar to our expectations for revenue, we believe operating margins will be negatively impacted by the increasing mix towards ratable revenue rather than upfront deals. 
Underlying this guidance, we expect our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate to be between 28% and 29%, consistent with our prior expectations. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to come in between 2% and 5%, consistent with our prior expectations. This translates to reported non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.34 to $2.40. The negative impact of foreign currency on earnings per share is around $0.03.
GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to grow 7% to 11%. Prior guidance was an increase of 6% to 10%. This translates to reported GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.70 to $1.76. 
At the end of the year, we expect approximately 431 million shares outstanding and a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 436 million shares. 
Cash flow from operations is expected to increase 2% to 7% in constant currency, consistent with our prior expectations. This translates to reported cash flow from operations of $0.97 billion to $1.02 billion.
And now we'll take your questions."

But as far as work goes, we still have work to be done. I am still not completely satisfied where we are with the products. I want to do more organic innovation. We're launching a number of net new products at CA World, so that's a great step in the right direction. I'm really happy with some of the thinking that's coming from the Rally team, this whole concept of Agile. I made my whole management team go through Agile training, my direct reports. And next week , I'm having the whole senior leadership team, which is the top 100 executives in the company, go through Agile training. This is something that I think is going to not only improve our products, but change some of the ways we think and act, and that gets into the culture. I really do think we've changed the culture of the company where we're getting into a culture of innovation, accountability, predictability and performance, and moving away from a culture of entitlement and complacency. Between the number of net new people we've hired, the people that existed in the company and really get it and some of the great people we've been able to bring in from acquisitions, I think we've got more than a critical mass of people that really understand how a modern software needs to operate and just how competitive it is to perform in this market. So when you have a competitive team that really gets it and we're starting to see our ability to win, win rates went up this quarter second quarter in a row, I'm feeling that we're definitely moving forward.

We planned for less and they actually came in longer between the 2 companies and I'll let Mike comment on.

But this quarter, we got that renewal, but your current revenue backlog growth rate is still negative. What needs to happen for it to turn positive? Because that is the leading indicator for revenue growth, right?"

Inside of that, you have a little over half a point of our Services backlog, which is always going to be current. And as we've been seeing, Services over time will continue to go down, the buy design as we build our products that need less and less services. So that drags about almost half of that current point down. And the second part is really just as you look at the timing of renewals. So you look at the back half has more than the front and then you start to reach into next year. And so that's just more timing as we see them come out. To your point, over time, we believe and if we continue to have sustained improvement, we will be able to offset both of those. And so as we close the gap from prior quarters, we have a few more quarters before that will turn positive."

First of all, if you take a look over the last year, the majority of the large-scale public hacks have been the lack of identity management with respect to machines, where a user has either control of root and gets to other machines and imposes their user identity on those other machines, or even inadvertently opens up ports on a machine that allows hackers to get into it. This is a very important piece of technology. We have a very comprehensive PIM solution. Xceedium just adds to that PIM solution. So this was additive to an already existing portfolio. And what we have, which I think is differentiating the market, is we have much broader solution that covers more use cases with respect to Privileged Identity Management. There are a number of different competitors in this space. I think it's a big market. I think there's room for multiple players to be successful. I think the differentiating factor for us is that we are not a small company. We have global breadth and depth. We are continuously to invest large sums of capital into this solution. And secondly, we have adjacencies in and around the PIM solution so that when a customer comes to us, we're taking a more holistic look at protecting their infrastructure."

We saw that again in Q2, not the Q -- that 2 quarters make a consistent line for Q3 and Q4, but we were giving headlights that if that trend continues, it will drive the revenue in near-term year to the lower end of our guidance. To the degree they flip back to their historical rate of attached versus not attached, you would be closer to the other end of guidance. All that revenue, though, is we'll capture. Now, we're just talking about the timing of when that revenue will actually be on the P&L. So all in all, we've had a very strong first half.

We're a huge open-source user and we view that as a catalyst for our business. At the end of the day, you have to remember that the heritage of this company has always been in managing heterogeneous platforms, and we're probably one of the largest manager of open-source heterogeneous platforms out there. If you just take a look at our APM solution, APM 10.1 was  launched just last week, and what we added into that release was both support a cloud foundry and docker; 2 very powerful open-source systems that are getting extraordinarily quick traction in the market. I know we've been managing multiple versions of Apache for years with our APM solution, which is all open-source. When you take a look at the UIM product, the UIM product supports almost all the popular open-source Linux platforms, including Red Hat, SUSE, CentOS and openSUSE. And I think that as we see more innovation coming out of open-source, folding that into our platform on both APM and UIM, I think that makes once again a differentiator. We're the only ones that have the wherewithal to invest in multiple platforms as they come out instead of waiting for them to be thrown into either legacy systems or for an open-source project to start to manage multiple heterogeneous systems. We just haven't seen a lot of traction in the open-source community to do that. I think that that's a unique place where we can fill a void."

I'm pleased to report that new sales were very strong in the second quarter. In fact, new sales delivered solid year-over-year growth across our Enterprise Solutions and Mainframe businesses. Our performance in th",1950,"Good afternoon. Thank you for joining us. I'm pleased to report that new sales were very strong in the second quarter. In fact, new sales delivered solid year-over-year growth across our Enterprise Solutions and Mainframe businesses. Our performance in the second quarter reflects the continued improvements we are making in both our products and sales execution. In particular, I'm excited about new sales, an indicator of the great traction our solutions are experiencing. Our overall second quarter total new sales were up more than 40% year-over-year. In the quarter, a great portion of our new sales bookings were recognized ratably compared to our historical trends.
Enterprise Solutions new sales increased in the high 20s year-over-year. Mainframe new sales more than doubled year-over-year. In the second quarter, we closed a large system integrator renewal that was initially expected to transact in the second half of our fiscal year. The accelerated time to close this renewal was at their request and is a reflection of CA's strategic importance to the system integrator and its customers. We are very pleased with the outcome of this large renewal, which had a strong yield and a healthy new sales attach rate.
Our renewal yield in the quarter was in the high 90s. This is the best it's been in recent history. This is a testament to our pricing discipline and the ability of our sales teams to execute deals that realize the value of our solutions.
In today's Application Economy, a lot of mission critical data still resides in the Mainframe. This is particularly true of the big players, the Fortune 500. As such, it should not be a surprise that there will be quarters in which capacity buys are particularly strong, as was the case in Q2. Excluding the large system integrator, our renewal yield would have been in the low 90s. Excluding the large system integrator renewal, total new sales increased in the mid-20s range, and Enterprise Solutions new sales increased in the mid-teens year-over-year.
Non-GAAP operating margin was 36% in the quarter, which was consistent with our expectation and commentary on our fiscal Q1 earnings call. Recall that the full percentage point impact on operating margin guidance for FY '16 was expected to be realized in our fiscal Q2. This is due to the expenses related to the Rally acquisition and realignment costs.
Our second quarter results were clearly a big step in the right direction, but there is still work to be done. While we are on track for the second half of our fiscal year, it is important to note that we expect it to be heavily weighted towards the fourth quarter. That said, I am increasingly confident that our results will reflect our work to deliver innovative solutions that truly solve customers' problems. Put simply, CA enables enterprises to capitalize the opportunities created by the Application Economy. In fact, once again, Gartner has rated CA Technologies with an overall positive rating in its latest August 2015 Vendor Rating report.
We remain focused on product quality and execution. Our Chief Product Officer and Chief Technology Officer are working in lockstep to ensure continuous improvement on our near and midterm product execution while driving us towards our longer-term Horizon 2, Horizon 3 technology leadership opportunities. Our strategy continues to stress organic innovation complemented by targeted strategic investments that are within 1 standard deviation of our core. 
A great example of this is our acquisition of Rally, a leader in the fast-growing Agile Application Life-Cycle Management software market, which closed on July 8. The rationale for this acquisition was threefold: First, Rally's products and services are highly complementary to our award-winning PPM solutions and strengthens CA's DevOps leadership; two, there is ample opportunity to cross sell, given the limited customer overlap; and third, the opportunity to accelerate Agile methodology internally at CA to drive improving velocity of our high-quality solutions.
3.5 months into the acquisition, I am very pleased to report that Rally is performing well. In many ways, it is doing better than our expectations. For example, total paid seats under contract at the end of Q2 grew in the high 20% range year-over-year. We define a paid seat as a seat with a subscription or support contract. Q2 saw a particularly large upgrade order from a global leader in networking routers and switches. This customer exemplifies Rally's successful land-and-expand strategy. Rally is able to prove strategic value in a small initial engagement and then grow exponentially within the customer. We are encouraged by the opportunities we see to further engage our customers around Agile.
In terms of integration, just last month, with GA-ed, our first release of a bidirectionally integrated, combined Rally and CA PPM solution. This allows customers to combine planning and execution, track progress in real time and eliminate the need for point-to-point integrations. It creates a closed-loop system that vastly accelerates and improves the decision-making process. 
This level of integration is something with which point solution providers simply cannot compete. The broad value proposition that we offer in Rally combined with CA PPM and DevOps tools like service virtualization and release automation enable organizational transformation rather than small, disparate design teams functioning in silos. In fact, we often do not compete against point solutions in head-to-head evaluations. Rather, our solutions are deployed as a result of an enterprise decision to scale Agile methodologies across a number, sometimes hundreds, of development groups. Combined with CA's global enterprise engagement and support model, this puts us in a different class of solution providers.
Now, I'd like to highlight a few areas within Enterprise Solutions in which we are seeing very good progress. Our award-winning Clarity PPM platform, which has been one of the cornerstones of our Enterprise Solutions business, grew new sales over 70% year-over-year as reported. With the release of 14.2 in April and 14.3 last month, customers can now glean powerful management insights from their data, enabling them to view their product portfolios and investments across all platforms, including tablets and mobile. We are becoming increasingly confident in our ability to outpace the market. We believe we have the right products at the right time with a more seasoned sales force executing multiple 6-figure deals across geographies. 
We are particularly pleased with a major win at a large Canadian bank that was originally an on-premise customer using Clarity PPM for financial reporting. This transaction dramatically expands CA's engagement as it migrates to our on-demand platform and standardizes its financial reporting, product management and time tracking. This win displays both the customer's internal systems resources, as well as CA's competitors.
Within DevOps, API management continues to grow at a rapid clip, with new sales up in the high 30s year-over-year as reported. We are a leader in the secular growth space. We are in a unique position to provide API management solutions at scale with the requisite security features. CA's API management products enable customers to manage and protect the ever-growing volumes of data traversing across rapidly expanding digital platforms. Our solutions are recognized by both industry pundits and customers. 
Our leadership in this space is evidenced by a major win at a large U.S.-based auto manufacturer. This engagement represents an enterprise-wide expansion of our relationship and includes Mainframe, API management and DevOps. Importantly, it also establishes an initial footprint for CA into its finance division. We also secured a win at an American media company that provides local weather forecasts globally. This win was a competitive displacement, where CA API management was chosen due to its superior performance and scalability.
UIM, which is foundational to our DevOps portfolio, is a great example of Agile methodology deployment within CA. In fact, UIM was the first group within CA to adopt Rally and was its internal lighthouse sponsor. The resulting improvements with regard to product quality and velocity are notable. In the quarter, UIM had a major win with a large cloud Infrastructure-as-a-Service company, who chose CA's UIM tool over its parent company's alternative offering. Another notable deal was a competitive win at a leading athletic apparel company that is embracing the Application Economy to transform into a lifestyle brand with a leading digital health platform. CA was chosen over a number of competitors for our ability to offer an enterprise-wide global solution and services view. 
Next month, at CA World in Las Vegas, you can expect to see net new product launches, some of which reflect our unique opportunity to bridge between distributed cloud and mainframe. You will see our heightened emphasis on Agile and better appreciate how CA is in a unique position to benefit as large enterprise data center management strategies evolve to hybrid cloud environments. 
Given CA's rich heritage as a trusted vendor to large enterprises running mission-critical workloads and providing support around the globe, we have a coveted seat at the table. This point is particularly salient when it comes to the fragmented security space. 
Our Security business had a very strong second quarter, with new sales up over 60% year-over-year as reported. Results were positively impacted by the large system integrator renewal, where CA's Security footprint has expanded considerably. Even outside this large renewal, we closed multiple 6-figure transactions across a number of verticals, including health care, automotive, technology and government.
In addition to the technology and expanded product portfolio breadth our recent acquisitions provide, they are also improving our visibility with customers who are increasingly viewing CA as a large committed vendor with staying power in this critically important, yet still incredibly fragmented space. 
We are very excited about our most recent acquisition, Xceedium, which extends our PIM or Privileged Identity Management offering. Xceedium positions us well in the rapidly growing network Security market as large enterprises have become increasingly aware and less tolerant of dangerous and often very public intra-organizational security breaches. In fact, it appears to have also created a halo effect, lifting sales of existing PIM products as customers embrace our PIM road map.
Now, turning to sales execution. I am pleased to report that our decision to separate platinum accounts from named and growth accounts, and to specialize sales by product discipline continues to yield positive results. Globally, in the second quarter, our sales teams improved win rates, decreased average sales cycles, improved pipeline conversion rates and increased average deal sizes. This speaks to the team's improving efficiency and continued focus on accelerating velocity. In fact, for the second consecutive quarter, our combined named and growth sales teams delivered strong broad-based results.
While 2 quarters do not make a trend, we do expect the second half of the year to be weighted towards the fourth quarter. I am convinced that our sales execution strategy is on the right track. 
I invite you to come and see the progress we're making in terms of sales execution, product development and marketing strategy next month in Las Vegas. Please join us at CA World to see our product innovation firsthand and hear why customers are embracing CA solutions to differentiate and accelerate their products and processes in order to thrive in the emerging Application Economy. Our financial analyst track will take place on November 18 at the Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas. We hope to see you there. 
In aggregate, I am pleased with our second quarter results, particularly with regard to new sales, which reflects the success our solutions are seeing in the market. That said, we recognize there is still work to do in order to drive the kind of growth that CA has the potential to achieve.
With that, I will turn the call over to Rich to review our second quarter financials and full year guidance. Thank you."
262913,312841788,880687,"CA, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 21, 2015",2015-10-21,"Earnings Calls","CA, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Mike. Before we get started with the quarter review, let me remind you that all comparisons are year-over-year and in constant currency unless otherwise indicated. This afternoon, I'm going to focus my comments on the key business drivers and p",1728,"Thank you, Mike. Before we get started with the quarter review, let me remind you that all comparisons are year-over-year and in constant currency unless otherwise indicated. This afternoon, I'm going to focus my comments on the key business drivers and performance indicators for the quarter. The balance of our financial details can be found in our supplemental and press release. 
As many of you are aware, overall, the dollar continues to strengthen, which negatively impacts our results and our guidance. Our Q2 total revenue was $1,005,000,000 and was down 1%. The increasing mix of new sales going ratable compared to upfront, which we experienced in Q1 and again in Q2, has impacted reported quarterly revenue by approximately 1 point per quarter. If this trend persists, it will continue to be a headwind towards reported revenue.
Enterprise Solutions increased 3%, and Mainframe Solutions and Services were each down 3%. 
Q2 renewals more than doubled year-over-year, both in constant currency and as reported. Excluding the large system integrator transaction, Q2 renewals would have been up in the low teens and in the high single digits as reported. As we have previously stated, the year-over-year change in our renewal bookings can vary on a quarterly basis due to the timing of large transactions.
Q2 total new product and capacity sales were up nearly 50% and over 40% as reported. This was due in part to a large system integrator renewal previously mentioned and the contribution from acquisitions, with Rally as the most meaningful. As Mike indicated, excluding the large system integrator renewal, total new sales increased in the mid-20s and high teens as reported, and Enterprise Solutions' new sales increased in the mid-teens year-over-year, high single digits as reported.
Excluding the large system integrator renewal and excluding acquisitions, total organic new sales were up in the high teens in constant currency and low teens as reported. As Mike mentioned, Rally's total paid seats under contract increased in the high 20% range year-over-year. We disclose this metric because we thought it would be helpful to show how well this acquisition is progressing. However, we do not intend to provide Rally's seat growth metric indefinitely. This is because in very large transactions, such as the 1 signed in the second quarter, as well as those we believe can be executed over time with our platinum accounts, paid seat growth may not be an accurate proxy for expected revenue growth.
Renewal yield for the quarter was in the high 90% range. This is the highest it's been in recent history and was driven by the large system integrator. This renewal had a positive impact across our Mainframe and Enterprise Solutions business. Excluding this 1 transaction, our renewal yield was in the low 90s. 
The large system integrator renewed for a duration longer than our forecast. As such, we now expect fiscal 2016 renewals to be up in the mid-20s year-over-year as compared to fiscal 2015, and up approximately 20% as reported. Excluding the large system integrator renewal, we expect fiscal 2016 renewals to be up in the low single digits and down in the low single digits as reported.
Turning to geographies. New sales were particularly strong in North America, driven by the large system integrator renewal. New sales were also strong in EMEA and Latin America. However, new sales were down in APJ due to the timing of renewals and generally weaker pipeline in the region. 
Within our segments, Q2 Mainframe new sales, including new product and capacity, more than doubled year-over-year, both in constant currency and as reported. Overall, we continue to expect Mainframe revenue to be down in the low single digits over the medium term, which we believe is in line with the Mainframe market. 
Q2 Enterprise Solutions' new product sales were up in the high 20s in constant currency and up approximately 20% as reported. Enterprise Solutions' new sales, excluding the large system integrator transaction, would have increased in the mid-teens year-over-year and up high single digits as reported. New sales attached to renewals, including the large system integrator, contributions from our recent acquisition and solid performance in named and growth customers drove the improvement in Enterprise Solutions' new product sales.
Services revenue decreased 3% in constant currency and 9% as reported. We expect lower services booking in fiscal 2015 to be a headwind to fiscal 2016 revenue. Over the long term, we expect Services revenue to decline as we design our products to be easier to install and as we leverage partners.
Total revenue backlog improved to up 2% in constant currency or down 3% as reported. Current revenue backlog improved to down 2% in constant currency or down 7% as reported. As many of you know, current revenue backlog is impacted by the timing of large deals in our renewal portfolio. As contracts move closer towards their renewals, revenue backlog declines. In other words, backlog is heavily influenced by time. Given the timing of deals in our renewal portfolio, we expect current revenue backlog to tick down in the coming quarters. 
As I said before, consistent year-over-year growth and current revenue backlog is one of the indicators of future revenue growth. Current revenue backlog will likely grow when we demonstrate multiple quarters of new sales growth, while maintaining a low 90% renewal yield.
Q2 non-GAAP operating margin was 36% and GAAP operating margin was 26%. Segment operating margins in the quarter were 62% for Mainframe Solutions, 3% for Enterprise Solutions and 5% for Services. Enterprise Solutions' margins were negatively impacted by acquisitions and other related expenses, some of which we do not view as ongoing.
Our Q2 non-GAAP tax rate was 28% and our GAAP tax rate was 30%. 
Q2 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.56, down 6% year-over-year. Q2 GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.39, down 13%. 
Our Q2 CFFO was $43 million, down 32% year-over-year or down 35% as reported. CFFO declined year-over-year due to the combination of foreign exchange headwinds and lower single installment cash payments. Single installment cash payments were $105 million and down year-over-year.
We ended Q2 with approximately $660 million in net cash. During the quarter, we repurchased $65 million in shares and paid $110 million in dividends. We have $670 million remaining in our original $1 billion share repurchase program. 
During the quarter, we issued $400 million 5-year notes at 3.6%. We used the proceeds to pay down the revolver accessed in conjunction with the closure of our acquisition of Rally. 
Subsequent to the close of Q2, we opportunistically took a 6.5-year $300 million senior term loan facility at LIBOR plus 150 points. The use of proceeds is for general corporate purposes and to provide increased flexibility to execute our capital allocation strategy. As you can see, the terms are attractive and the tenor fits well with our maturity profile. Our balance sheet is strong and we remain committed to maintaining our investment-grade rating.
Now, turning to guidance. Guidance is based on exchange rates on the last day of the preceding quarter, which was September 30, 2015. This includes a partial hedge of operating income. The guidance also assumes no material acquisitions. We expect currency to have a negative impact to our full year fiscal 2016 revenue of approximately 5% at September 30 rates. 
As Mike mentioned, we expect the second half of our fiscal year to be heavily weighted towards the fourth quarter. In other words, as we look to the back half of our fiscal year, we expect our results to be better in the fiscal fourth quarter than in our fiscal third quarter. Our expectations for a softer third quarter is the result of the expected timing of named and growth deals in the pipeline. 
As previously mentioned, we also expect the trend in mix whereby the increasing portion of deals are going ratable rather than upfront to continue in Q3. The impact of this is for revenue to be recognized over the course of time as opposed to in the current period. However, associated expenses are recognized in the current period, which negatively impacts near-term margins. 
Also, with regards to operating expenses, please note that CA World takes place in November, so the expenses of our biggest event of the year will hit in the third quarter.
For the year, the increased mix of ratable relative to upfront we experienced in both Q1 and Q2 has created a headwind to our reported revenue. As I mentioned earlier, this shift has resulted in downward pressure of approximately a point of reported quarterly revenue in each of the past 2 quarters. 
We expect this shift towards ratable revenue to occur again in the third quarter. As such, we'd like to provide headlights into our current view of the full year. We currently expect total revenue to be at the low end of our guidance or down 1% to flat in constant currency. This translates to reported revenue of around $4.0 billion to $4.04 billion. Please note that negative impact of foreign currency on our reported revenue outlook is around $40 million.
We expect a full year GAAP operating margin of 28% and a full year non-GAAP operating margin of 38%, consistent with our prior expectations. Similar to our expectations for revenue, we believe operating margins will be negatively impacted by the increasing mix towards ratable revenue rather than upfront deals. 
Underlying this guidance, we expect our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate to be between 28% and 29%, consistent with our prior expectations. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to come in between 2% and 5%, consistent with our prior expectations. This translates to reported non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.34 to $2.40. The negative impact of foreign currency on earnings per share is around $0.03.
GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to grow 7% to 11%. Prior guidance was an increase of 6% to 10%. This translates to reported GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.70 to $1.76. 
At the end of the year, we expect approximately 431 million shares outstanding and a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 436 million shares. 
Cash flow from operations is expected to increase 2% to 7% in constant currency, consistent with our prior expectations. This translates to reported cash flow from operations of $0.97 billion to $1.02 billion.
And now we'll take your questions."

But as far as work goes, we still have work to be done. I am still not completely satisfied where we are with the products. I want to do more organic innovation. We're launching a number of net new products at CA World, so that's a great step in the right direction. I'm really happy with some of the thinking that's coming from the Rally team, this whole concept of Agile. I made my whole management team go through Agile training, my direct reports. And next week , I'm having the whole senior leadership team, which is the top 100 executives in the company, go through Agile training. This is something that I think is going to not only improve our products, but change some of the ways we think and act, and that gets into the culture. I really do think we've changed the culture of the company where we're getting into a culture of innovation, accountability, predictability and performance, and moving away from a culture of entitlement and complacency. Between the number of net new people we've hired, the people that existed in the company and really get it and some of the great people we've been able to bring in from acquisitions, I think we've got more than a critical mass of people that really understand how a modern software needs to operate and just how competitive it is to perform in this market. So when you have a competitive team that really gets it and we're starting to see our ability to win, win rates went up this quarter second quarter in a row, I'm feeling that we're definitely moving forward.

So we have a lot of focus that we put on products and the sales force really understands how to articulate that value. So I'm feeling more optimistic that we are into a upward trajectory. Now, on the Mainframe side, as Rich talked about, we're going to see some lumpiness based on some of the renewals that we go through which is just natural to our model."

Inside of that, you have a little over half a point of our Services backlog, which is always going to be current. And as we've been seeing, Services over time will continue to go down, the buy design as we build our products that need less and less services. So that drags about almost half of that current point down. And the second part is really just as you look at the timing of renewals. So you look at the back half has more than the front and then you start to reach into next year. And so that's just more timing as we see them come out. To your point, over time, we believe and if we continue to have sustained improvement, we will be able to offset both of those. And so as we close the gap from prior quarters, we have a few more quarters before that will turn positive."

First of all, if you take a look over the last year, the majority of the large-scale public hacks have been the lack of identity management with respect to machines, where a user has either control of root and gets to other machines and imposes their user identity on those other machines, or even inadvertently opens up ports on a machine that allows hackers to get into it. This is a very important piece of technology. We have a very comprehensive PIM solution. Xceedium just adds to that PIM solution. So this was additive to an already existing portfolio. And what we have, which I think is differentiating the market, is we have much broader solution that covers more use cases with respect to Privileged Identity Management. There are a number of different competitors in this space. I think it's a big market. I think there's room for multiple players to be successful. I think the differentiating factor for us is that we are not a small company. We have global breadth and depth. We are continuously to invest large sums of capital into this solution. And secondly, we have adjacencies in and around the PIM solution so that when a customer comes to us, we're taking a more holistic look at protecting their infrastructure."

So around the horn, we actually did pretty well, which is what Mike was trying to talk about earlier. This was more than just the system integrator having a strong influence on the quarter. We saw a large part of our portfolio perform well and it was fairly balanced. We had another strong quarter out of Europe, and we had a strong quarter out of North America. We had a strong quarter out of Latin America despite Brazil so it was the rest of Latin America. So really, the only geo that was a little soft was APJ. So it was a very good ES quarter.

So as you see that go out over time, there will be some benefit in the out quarters. It's just muted because of that. When you look at the rest of the portfolio and how well we perform, what we were trying to say is what we saw in Q1 was a slight trend of about 1% of our ES business went ratable more than our historical. We saw that again in Q2, not the Q -- that 2 quarters make a consistent line for Q3 and Q4, but we were giving headlights that if that trend continues, it will drive the revenue in near-term year to the lower end of our guidance. To the degree they flip back to their historical rate of attached versus not attached, you would be closer to the other end of guidance. All that revenue, though, is we'll capture. Now, we're just talking about the timing of when that revenue will actually be on the P&L. So all in all, we've had a very strong first half. Now, we're talking about when that revenue will show up on the P&L. What we're seeing is it's starting to move more towards the out years."

We're a huge open-source user and we view that as a catalyst for our business. At the end of the day, you have to remember that the heritage of this company has always been in managing heterogeneous platforms, and we're probably one of the largest manager of open-source heterogeneous platforms out there. If you just take a look at our APM solution, APM 10.1 was  launched just last week, and what we added into that release was both support a cloud foundry and docker; 2 very powerful open-source systems that are getting extraordinarily quick traction in the market. I know we've been managing multiple versions of Apache for years with our APM solution, which is all open-source. When you take a look at the UIM product, the UIM product supports almost all the popular open-source Linux platforms, including Red Hat, SUSE, CentOS and openSUSE. And I think that as we see more innovation coming out of open-source, folding that into our platform on both APM and UIM, I think that makes once again a differentiator. We're the only ones that have the wherewithal to invest in multiple platforms as they come out instead of waiting for them to be thrown into either legacy systems or for an open-source project to start to manage multiple heterogeneous systems. We just haven't seen a lot of traction in the open-source community to do that. I think that that's a unique place where we can fill a void."
