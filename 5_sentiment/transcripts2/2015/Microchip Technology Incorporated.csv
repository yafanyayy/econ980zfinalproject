During the course of this conference call, we will be making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements",1325,"Good afternoon, everyone. During the course of this conference call, we will be making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to our press releases as of today, as well as our recent filings with the SEC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip's business and results of operations. 
In attendance with me today are Steve Sanghi, Microchip's President and CEO; and Ganesh Moorthy, Microchip's COO. I will comment on our third quarter fiscal year 2015 financial performance, and Steve and Ganesh will then give their comments on the results and discuss the current business environment, as well as our guidance. We will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions. 
I want to remind you that we are including information in our press release on this conference call on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.microchip.com, which we believe you will find useful when comparing GAAP and non-GAAP results. 
I will now go through some of the operating results, including net sales, gross margin and operating expenses. I will be referring to these results on a non-GAAP basis prior to the effects of our acquisition activities and share-based compensation. Non-GAAP net sales in the December quarter were $535.8 million and were down 1.9% sequentially from non-GAAP net sales of $546.2 million in the immediately preceding quarter. The December quarter revenue exceeded the high-end of our updated guidance for the quarter. Revenue by product line was $345.5 million for microcontrollers, $125.5 million for analog, $33.2 million for memory, $22.9 million for licensing and $8.7 million of other. Revenue by geography was $104.9 million in the Americas, $105.9 million in Europe and $325 million in Asia. I'll remind you that we recognize revenue based on where we ship our products to, which tends to skew some of the revenue towards Asia where a lot of contract manufacturing takes place. 
On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were 58.2% in the December quarter, at the high-end of our guidance range. Non-GAAP operating expenses were 26.6% of sales, well below the bottom end of our guidance range. Non-GAAP operating income was 31.6% of sales and net income was $143.3 million. This resulted in earnings of $0.64 per diluted share, which was at the high-end of our updated guidance. 
GAAP net sales in the December quarter were $528.7 million and were $7.1 million lower than non-GAAP net sales, as we changed the contractual relationships with the ISSC Distribution Network to a sell-through revenue recognition model. On a GAAP basis, gross margins, including share-based compensation and acquisition-related expenses, were $57.1 million in the December -- 57.1% in the December quarter. GAAP gross margins included the impact of $2.3 million of share-based compensation, $4.2 million of charges associated with the sell-through of written up inventory from our acquisitions of Supertex and ISSC, and $3.2 million of gross profit on the revenue recognition change previously mentioned. Total operating expenses were $204 million or 38.6% of sales and include acquisition intangible amortization of $47.6 million, share-based compensation of $12.5 million, $0.5 million of acquisition-related expenses and special charges of $1 million. GAAP net income was $86.1 million or $0.39 per diluted share. GAAP net income includes nonrecurring favorable tax events of $3.9 million, including a benefit from the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit. 
In the December quarter, the non-GAAP tax rate was 10.3% and the GAAP tax rate was 1.6%. The GAAP tax rate was favorably impacted by the $3.9 million of nonrecurring tax events that I mentioned before. Our tax rate is impacted by the mix of geographical profits, withholding taxes associated with our licensing business and the tax effect of various nonrecurring items. Excluding any nonrecurring events, we expect our longer-term forward-looking non-GAAP effective tax rate to be about 10.5% to 11%. 
To summarize the after-tax impact that the non-GAAP adjustments had on Microchip's earnings per share in the December quarter, acquisition-related items were twenty two point three cents, share-based compensation was about $0.05, nonrecurring favorable tax events were about one point eight cents, the difference in GAAP and non-GAAP, noncontrolling interest in ISSC was a favorable point eight cents, and a noncash interest expense was about point seven cents. The dividend declared today of thirty five point seven cents per share will be paid on March 9, 2015, to shareholders of record on February 23, 2015. The cash payment associated with this dividend will be approximately $72 million. This quarter's dividend will be our 50th consecutive quarter of making a dividend payment. We have never made reductions in our dividend and in fact, this quarter's increase marks the 44th occasion we have increased the dividend payment, and accumulative dividends paid amount to over $2.4 billion. This program continues to be an important component of how we return value to our shareholders. And during the time period that Microchip has paid dividends, we have also purchased back 1.4 billion of our stock, including the stock buyback that we had, will be issued our convertible debt back in fiscal year 2008. Our cash return to shareholders since the inception of our dividend program is over $3.8 billion. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. Consolidated inventory at December 31, 2014, was $276.1 million or 111 days compared to 109 days at the end of the September quarter, excluding any purchase accounting adjustments. 100% of the written up inventory from our acquisitions is now out of our inventory balance. Inventory at our distributors increased by 2 days in the December quarter and are at 36 days. I want to remind you that our distribution revenue throughout the world is recognized on a sell-through basis. We intend to grow the days of inventory on our balance sheet in the March quarter as we continue to focus on improving lead times for our customers. 
The cash generation in the December quarter, excluding the purchase of additional shares of ISSC, our dividend payment, changes in marketable equity securities and changes in borrowing levels under revolving line of credit, was $145.7 million. As of December 31, the consolidated cash and total investment position was $2.23 billion, and our borrowings under our revolving line of credit were $981.3 million. Excluding dividend payments and our acquisition activities, we expect our total cash and investment position to grow by approximately $140 million to $160 million in the March quarter. Capital spending was approximately $36.6 million for the December quarter. We expect about $40 million in capital spending in the March quarter and overall capital expenditures for fiscal year 2015 to be about $160 million, as we are adding capital to support the growth of our production capabilities for our fast-growing new products and technologies and to bring in-house more of the assembly and test operations that are currently outsourced. 
Depreciation expense in the December quarter was $24.7 million. As discussed earlier, the contractual terms of our relationships with the ISSC distributors changed during the December quarter resulting in about $7 million of lower GAAP versus non-GAAP revenue. There is another $4 million of product in the ISSC distribution channel related to products sold to these distributors by ISSC under their prior contracts. This will result in GAAP revenue being about $4 million less than non-GAAP revenue in the March quarter. At the end of the March quarter, this transition to a sell-through model will be completed for ISSC and there will be no further differences between GAAP and non-GAAP revenue recognition related to this change. 
I will now ask Ganesh to give his comments on the performance of the business in the December quarter and provide an update on the integration activities related to the ISSC acquisition. Ganesh?"

Let's take a closer look at the performance of each of our product lines, starting with microcontrollers. Our microcontroller revenue was up 10.3% in the December quarter from a year-ago quarter. For calendar",654,"Thank you, Eric, and good afternoon, everyone. Let's take a closer look at the performance of each of our product lines, starting with microcontrollers. Our microcontroller revenue was up 10.3% in the December quarter from a year-ago quarter. For calendar year 2014, our microcontroller business was up 13.8% and set an all-time record. Also for calendar year 2014, each of our 3 microcontroller segments, 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit, set revenue records. Microcontrollers represented 64.5% of Microchip's overall revenue in the December quarter. 
You may recall that we told you last quarter that our 16 and 32-bit combined microcontroller business was in the range of $400 million to $500 million annualized. Since then, we have received substantial feedback through prospective employees and industry sources that our competitors were very surprised to learn about the size of our 16-bit and 32-bit microcontroller business. And we're actively seeking a more information as to where we were running. It appears our competitors had assumed that our business were still embryonic and were surprised by the magnitude of the revenue range we provided. We believe that our self mode in keeping the actual size of business confidential has helped us in gaining substantial momentum in these product lines. With our competitors now apparently scurrying around trying to triangulate on which markets and applications we're achieving our success, we have decided that we are not going to help their efforts. Going forward, we will no longer be breaking out the growth rate of the individual microcontroller segments. As you've seen from our disclosures, the size of each of our 8, 16 and 32-bit businesses is quite substantial. We did break out the growth rates for several quarters when it was important to communicate a sense for the rate of growth of the 16-bit and 32-bit businesses while there were smaller businesses. Henceforth, consistent with the practice of most of our competitors, we will only be reporting overall microcontroller revenue and growth rate. So for one last time for your records, our 16-bit microcontroller business was up 27.7% in calendar year 2014, and our 32-bit microcontroller business was up 41.3% in calendar year 2014. Based on the growth we've experienced in calendar year 2014 in all 3 microcontroller segments, we believe we're continuing to gain significant microcontroller market share and we expect the calendar year 2014 market share rankings will bear that when they are published later this year. 
Now let's move to our analog products. Our analog business was up 15.3% from a year-ago quarter. In calendar year 2014, our analog business was up 15.7% and also set an all-time record. This business continues to have strong design momentum in a broad range of applications and represented 23.4% of Microchip's overall revenue in the December quarter, the highest percentage that it has ever been. We continue to develop and introduce a wide range of innovative and proprietary new products to fuel the future growth of our analog business. 
Moving to our memory business, which is comprised of our memory products, as well as our SuperFlash Memory products, this business was up 2% over a year-ago quarter. In calendar year 2014, our memory business was down 1.5%. We continue to run our memory business in a disciplined fashion that maintains consistently high profitability, enables our licensing business and serves our microcontroller customers to complete their solutions. Our memory business represented 6.2% of Microchip's overall revenue in the December quarter. 
Finally, ISSC was integrated into our business systems as planned on November 1. At the end of December, we owned 91.1% of the ISSC shares. And on December 25, we delisted ISSC from the Taiwan Stock Exchange. We expect to acquire the remaining shares of ISSC in the first half of 2015 and complete the merger process during that time. 
Let me now pass it to Steve for some general comments about our business, as well as our guidance going forward. Steve?"

Today, I would first like to reflect on the results of the fiscal third quarter of 2015 and the calendar year 2014. Then, I will comment on the progress of some of our acquisitions, and then provide guidance for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2015. 
We are very pleased with our execution in the December quarter. Our original revenue guidance for December quarter at the midpoint was down 4.5% sequentially. In early December, we revised our guidance upwards to be down 3.5% sequentially at the midpoint. Our actual results were down 1.9% [ph] sequentially, which was better than seasonal. 
Looking at the calendar year 2014, it was our first year to cross the $2 billion revenue mark. Calendar year '14 revenue came in at $2.107 billion, up 12.8% from calendar year '13. While of our strategic product as of microcontrollers and analog posted strong performance in calendar year 2014. The December quarter was also our 97th consecutive profitable quarter. 
I want to thank all the employees of Microchip for their contribution in this remarkable achievement of 97 consecutive profitable quarters. 
Now in the last conference call, we told you that we will be shutting down production in Supertex, San Jose Fab, as well as test facility in Hong Kong. There is excellent progress on both fronts. The last wafer starts in synergy fab have already been made and the fab will close in the March/April timeframe. The transfer of Hong Kong test to our high-value and Thailand facility is also on schedule for this quarter. As we said before, we believe that closure of the San Jose Fab and the Hong Kong test facility will add about $0.05 to $0.07 of accretion on an annual basis after the older last time buy inventory has been shipped out. 
Now I will provide guidance for the fiscal third quarter of 2015. As we said in the last conference call, we completed the small correction in the September quarter, and then the December quarter turned out to be better than seasonal. March quarter is historically a very strong quarter in Europe and a weak quarter in Asia due to lunar new year holidays. The quarter is usually up low single-digit percentage sequentially. We expect this March quarter to be seasonal and normal and expect the revenue to be up 1% to 3% sequentially. On a non-GAAP basis, we expect our gross margin to be between 58.2% and 58.4% of sales. We expect operating expenses to be between 26.2% and 26.6% of sales. We expect operating profit to be between 31.6% and 32.2% of sales. We expect non-GAAP EPS to be between $0.65 and $0.67 per share. 
Now I also promised to you that we will review our business units, geographical data, direct customers and distributors with a fine tooth comb to make sure that our miss in September quarter was not driven by anything that has changed competitively that we may have missed. I'm happy to report that we have completed a total review and our miss in September quarter was nothing more than a quick correction in softening that we saw led by China. Beyond that, there was no other corrective action on our part. As you have now seen 2 quarters of data from the industry, you can see that our cumulative performance of 2 quarters, September and December, is in the top half of our MCU in analog peer group and our 2% sequential growth guidance at the midpoint for the March quarter should further alleviate any of your concerns. Overall, our 2014 performance demonstrates Microchip has continued to gain market share in microcontrollers and analog. 
In closing, as I take stock of our business, I have never been more confident of our market position and our future prospects with the investments we have made in our continuing to make for the long-term success of Microchip.

The intelligence in microcontroller, analogs, sensors, all of the connectivity protocols, the Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, RX, ZigBee and everything else. And we think we have increasing presence in this fast growing market. The broadest adoption of smart phones and tablets is accelerating the demand for more things to be connected. And Microchip is incredibly well-placed by having all the components needed, like I mentioned, microcontroller, analog, memory, sensors, as well as all the RF, Wi-Fi Bluetooth and other building blocks. We have already mix suite of phone resolutions to go with various connectivities. And we have a set of partners who can provide the cloud solutions and storage needed for people to be able to ping the data after clouds. So I think we have really all the stuff needed.

And after your it, let's say you merge it together and you pursue the platform that you acquired, which would lower the revenue that you would have otherwise gained if you hadn't acquired them because you have similar products. So after about a quarter or so, which is really is important for the street to know what's the core growth and what's the acquired growth, if you continue to carry it in any fashion, a year out, 9 months out, a year out, then you're really doing the service because our job is really to make the best assessments of where we put the effort, where the sales force sells it, where the field application engineers spends time, what is the best solution to present to our customer.

Their products become slightly cheaper. Although, a lot of the Japanese production has also moved to foundries and they have closed there a lot of their fabs and they're buying from similar foundries in Asia like we are buying, I know their SMB have been moved out after the earthquake. So the effect of yen is really much more muted than it ever was. The impact of really the lower cost, if there is any, is really much, much slower and it takes long time because we had a design in lever whatever it is design in our proprietary products that so really cannot change. So though portion really will be on new designs and somebody from Japan be more competitive. And I think that's really, there's a lot of hurdle people have in this IP related installed base, there is development tools, there is legacy of products, software the people have designed in. So especially in our business, there impact is really fairly small. It takes a very long time. It would be much more drastic in the memory business where you can really substitute one product for the other product to model. But in the microcontroller analog design business, I think it's very negligible impact. But there is a second impact, which is really positive when you measure the market share. The market share dollar is reported by Gartner, IE or anybody else's in dollars. And the majority of the sales of the Japanese completed in Japan, they produce, they sell in yen. So when you take the year-end sale and you convert them to dollars, it will be much smaller. That impact is immediate. So when you calculate market share, market share in dollar terms on a percentage basis you're going to grow right away. And the other impact you're talking about is very long-term, very slow and may not happening in the come to that."

During the course of this conference call, we will be making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to our press releases of today as well as our recent filings with the SEC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip's business and results of operations. 
In attendance with me today are Steve Sanghi, Microchip's President and CEO; and Ganesh Moorthy, Microchip's COO. I will comment on our third quarter fiscal year 2015 financial performance, and Steve and Ganesh will then give their comments on the results and discuss the current business environment as well as our guidance. We will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions.
I want to remind you that we are including information in our press release and this conference call on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.microchip.com, which we believe you will find useful when comparing GAAP and non-GAAP results. 
I will now go through some of the operating results, including net sales, gross margin and operating expenses. I will be referring to these results on a non-GAAP basis prior to the effects of our acquisition activities and share-based compensation.
Non-GAAP net sales in the December quarter were $535.8 million and were down 1.9% sequentially from non-GAAP net sales of $546.2 million in the immediately preceding quarter. The December quarter revenue exceeded the high end of our updated guidance for the quarter. Revenue by product line was $345.5 million for microcontrollers, $125.5 million for analog, $33.2 million for memory, $22.9 million for licensing and $8.7 million of other. Revenue by geography was $104.9 million in the Americas, $105.9 million in Europe and $325 million in Asia. I'll remind you that we recognize revenue based on where we ship our products to, which tends to skew some of the revenue towards Asia where a lot of contract manufacturing takes place. 
On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were 58.2% in the December quarter, at the high end of our guidance range. Non-GAAP operating expenses were 26.6% of sales, well below the bottom end of our guidance range. Non-GAAP operating income was 31.6% of sales, and net income was $143.3 million. This resulted in earnings of $0.64 per diluted share, which was at the high end of our updated guidance. 
GAAP net sales in the December quarter were $528.7 million and were $7.1 million lower than non-GAAP net sales, as we changed the contractual relationships with the ISSC distribution network to a sell-through revenue recognition model. On a GAAP basis, gross margins, including share-based compensation and acquisition-related expenses, were $57.1 million in the December -- 51 -- 57.1% in the December quarter. GAAP gross margins include the impact of $2.3 million of share-based compensation, $4.2 million of charges associated with the sell-through of written-up inventory from our acquisitions of Supertex and ISSC and $3.2 million of gross profit on the revenue recognition change previously mentioned. Total operating expenses were $204 million or 38.6% of sales and include acquisition intangible amortization of $47.6 million, share-based compensation of $12.5 million, $0.5 million of acquisition-related expenses and special charges of $1 million. GAAP net income was $86.1 million or $0.39 per diluted share. GAAP net income includes nonrecurring favorable tax events of $3.9 million, including a benefit from the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit. 
In the December quarter, the non-GAAP tax rate was 10.3% and the GAAP tax rate was 1.6%. The GAAP tax rate was favorably impacted by the $3.9 million of nonrecurring tax events that I mentioned before. Our tax rate is impacted by the mix of geographical profits, withholding taxes associated with our licensing business and the tax effect of various nonrecurring items. Excluding any nonrecurring events, we expect our longer-term forward-looking non-GAAP effective tax rate to be about 10.5% to 11%. 
To summarize the after-tax impact that the non-GAAP adjustments had on Microchip's earnings per share in the December quarter, acquisition-related items were $0.223, share-based compensation was about $0.05, nonrecurring favorable tax events were about $0.018, the difference in GAAP and non-GAAP noncontrolling interest in ISSC was a favorable $0.008, and a noncash interest expense was about $0.007. The dividend declared today of $0.357 per share will be paid on March 9, 2015, to shareholders of record on February 23, 2015. The cash payments associated with this dividend will be approximately $72 million. This quarter's dividend will be our 50th consecutive quarter of making a dividend payment. We have never made reductions in our dividend, and in fact, this quarter's increase marks the 44th occasion we have increased the dividend payment, and our accumulative dividends paid amount to over $2.4 billion. This program continues to be an important component of how we return value to our shareholders. And during the time period that Microchip has paid dividends, we have also purchased back $1.4 billion of our stock, including the stock buyback that we had when we issued our convertible debt back in fiscal year 2008. Our cash return to shareholders since the inception of our dividend program is over $3.8 billion. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. Consolidated inventory at December 31, 2014, was $276.1 million or 111 days compared to 109 days at the end of the September quarter, excluding any purchase accounting adjustments. 100% of the written-up inventory from our acquisitions is now out of our inventory balance. Inventory at our distributors increased by 2 days in the December quarter and are at 36 days. I want to remind you that our distribution revenue throughout the world is recognized on a sell-through basis. We intend to grow the days of inventory on our balance sheet in the March quarter as we continue to focus on improving lead times for our customers. 
The cash generation in the December quarter, excluding the purchase of additional shares of ISSC, our dividend payment, changes in marketable equity securities and changes in borrowing levels under our revolving line of credit, was $145.7 million. As of December 31, the consolidated cash and total investment position was $2.23 billion, and our borrowings under our revolving line of credit were $981.3 million. Excluding dividend payments and our acquisition activities, we expect our total cash and investment position to grow by approximately $140 million to $160 million in the March quarter. Capital spending was approximately $36.6 million for the December quarter. We expect about $40 million in capital spending in the March quarter and overall capital expenditures for fiscal year 2015 to be about $160 million as we are adding capital to support the growth of our production capabilities for our fast-growing new products and technologies and to bring in-house more of the assembly and test operations that are currently outsourced. 
Depreciation expense in the December quarter was $24.7 million. As discussed earlier, the contractual terms of our relationships with the ISSC distributors changed during the December quarter, resulting in about $7 million of lower GAAP versus non-GAAP revenue. There is another $4 million of product in the ISSC distribution channel related to products sold to these distributors by ISSC under their prior contracts. This will result in GAAP revenue being about $4 million less than non-GAAP revenue in the March quarter. At the end of the March quarter, this transition to a sell-through model will be completed for ISSC, and there will be no further differences between GAAP and non-GAAP revenue recognition related to this change. 
I will now ask Ganesh to give his comments on the performance of the business in the December quarter and provide an update on the integration activities related to the ISSC acquisition. Ganesh?"

Let's take a closer look at the performance of each of our product lines, starting with microcontrollers. Our microcontroller revenue was up 10.3% in the December quarter from a year-ago quarter. For calendar",657,"Thank you, Eric, and good afternoon, everyone. Let's take a closer look at the performance of each of our product lines, starting with microcontrollers. Our microcontroller revenue was up 10.3% in the December quarter from a year-ago quarter. For calendar year 2014, our microcontroller business was up 13.8% and set an all-time record. Also for calendar year 2014, each of our 3 microcontroller segments, 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit, set revenue records. Microcontrollers represented 64.5% of Microchip's overall revenue in the December quarter. 
You may recall that we told you last quarter that our 16- and 32-bit combined microcontroller business was in the range of $400 million to $500 million annualized. Since then, we have received substantial feedback through prospective employees and industry sources that our competitors were very surprised to learn about the size of our 16-bit and 32-bit microcontroller business. And we're actively seeking more information as to where we were winning. It appears our competitors had assumed that our business was still embryonic and were surprised by the magnitude of the revenue range we provided. We believe that our stealth mode in keeping the actual size of business confidential has helped us in gaining substantial momentum in these product lines. With our competitors now apparently scurrying around trying to triangulate on which markets and applications we're achieving our success, we have decided that we are not going to help their effort. Going forward, we will no longer be breaking out the growth rate of the individual microcontroller segments. As you have seen from our disclosures, the size of each of our 8-, 16- and 32-bit businesses is quite substantial. We did break out the growth rates for several quarters when it was important to communicate a sense for the rate of growth of the 16-bit and 32-bit businesses while there were smaller businesses. Henceforth, consistent with the practice of most of our competitors, we will only be reporting overall microcontroller revenue and growth rate. So for one last time for your records, our 16-bit microcontroller business was up 27.7% in calendar year 2014, and our 32-bit microcontroller business was up 41.3% in calendar year 2014. Based on the growth we've experienced in calendar year 2014 in all 3 microcontroller segments, we believe we're continuing to gain significant microcontroller market share, and we expect the calendar year 2014 market share rankings will bear that out when they are published later this year. 
Now let's move to our analog products. Our analog business was up 15.3% from the year-ago quarter. In calendar year 2014, our analog business was up 15.7% and also set an all-time record. This business continues to have strong design momentum in a broad range of applications and represented 23.4% of Microchip's overall revenue in the December quarter, the highest percentage that it has ever been. We continue to develop and introduce a wide range of innovative and proprietary new products to fuel the future growth of our analog business. 
Moving to our memory business, which is comprised of our Serial E-squared memory products as well as our SuperFlash Memory products. This business was up 2% over a year-ago quarter. In calendar year 2014, our memory business was down 1.5%. We continue to run our memory business in a disciplined fashion that maintains consistently high profitability, enables our licensing business and serves our microcontroller customers to complete their solutions. Our memory business represented 6.2% of Microchip's overall revenue in the December quarter. 
Finally, ISSC was integrated into our business systems as planned on November 1. At the end of December, we owned 91.1% of the ISSC shares, and on December 25, we delisted ISSC from the Taiwan Stock Exchange. We expect to acquire the remaining shares of ISSC in the first half of 2015 and complete the merger process during that time. 
Let me now pass it to Steve for some general comments about our business as well as our guidance going forward. Steve?"

Today, I would first like to reflect on the results of the fiscal third quarter of 2015 and calendar year 2014. Then, I will comment on the progress of some of our acquisitions and then provide guidance for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2015. 
We are very pleased with our execution in the December quarter. Our original revenue guidance for December quarter at the midpoint was down 4.5% sequentially. In early December, we revised that guidance upwards to be down 3.5% sequentially at the midpoint. Our actual results were down 1.9% sequentially, which was better than seasonal. 
Looking at the calendar year 2014, it was our first year to cross the $2 billion revenue mark. Calendar year '14 revenue came in at $2.107 billion, up 12.8% from calendar year '13. All of our strategic product lines of microcontrollers and analog posted strong performance in calendar year 2014. The December quarter was also our 97th consecutive profitable quarter. 
I want to thank all the employees of Microchip for their contribution in this remarkable achievement of 97 consecutive profitable quarters. 
Now in the last conference call, we told you that we will be shutting down production in Supertex San Jose fab as well as test facility in Hong Kong. There is excellent progress on both fronts. The last wafer starts in San Jose fab have already been made and the fab will close in the March/April time frame. The transfer of Hong Kong test to our high-volume Thailand facility is also on schedule for this quarter. As we said before, we believe that closure of the San Jose fab and the Hong Kong test facility will add about $0.05 to $0.07 of accretion on an annual basis after the older last-time buy inventory has been shipped out. 
Now I will provide guidance for the fiscal third quarter of 2015. As we said in the last conference call, we completed the small correction in the September quarter, and then the December quarter turned out to be better than seasonal. March quarter is historically a very strong quarter in Europe and a weak quarter in Asia due to Lunar New Year holidays. The quarter is usually up low single-digit percentage sequentially. We expect this March quarter to be seasonally normal and expect the revenue to be up 1% to 3% sequentially. On a non-GAAP basis, we expect our gross margin to be between 58.2% and 58.4% of sales. We expect operating expenses to be between 26.2% and 26.6% of sales. We expect operating profit to be between 31.6% and 32.2% of sales. We expect non-GAAP EPS to be between $0.65 and $0.67 per share. 
Now I also promised to you that we will review our business units, geographical data, direct customers and distributors with a fine-tooth comb to make sure that our miss in September quarter was not driven by anything that has changed competitively that we may have missed. I'm happy to report that we have completed a total review and our miss in September quarter was nothing more than a quick correction and softening that we saw led by China. Beyond that, there was no other corrective action on our part. As you have now seen 2 quarters of data from the industry, you can see that our cumulative performance of 2 quarters, September and December, is in the top half of our MCU and analog peer group, and our 2% sequential growth guidance at the midpoint for the March quarter should further alleviate any of your concerns. Overall, our 2014 performance demonstrates Microchip has continued to gain market share in microcontrollers and analog. 
In closing, as I take stock of our business, I have never been more confident of our market position and our future prospects with the investments we have made and are continuing to make for the long-term success of Microchip.

Different companies have different definitions. Some include the entire microcontroller, analog, sensor and the entire chain of products that go with it, along with the Wi-Fi solution, and some not.

We have all the pieces needed, the intelligence in microcontroller, analog, smart memory, sensors, all of the connectivity protocols, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, RF, ZigBee and everything else. And we think we have increasing presence in this fast-growing market. The broadest adoption of smartphones and tablets is accelerating the demand for more things to be connected, and Microchip is incredibly well placed by having all the components needed, like I mentioned, microcontroller, analog, memory, sensors as well as all the RF, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and other building blocks. We have ready-mix suite of phoneware solutions to go with various connectivities. And we have a set of partners who can provide the cloud solutions and storage needed for people to be able to ping the data off the cloud. So I think we have really all the stuff needed. We have very substantial revenue in the IoT market. Depending on how you describe it, it could be many hundreds of millions of dollars, and there's a significant growth in the segment. Beyond that, I wish somebody were to define exactly what IoT is."

When we buy a company, part of the thing is then, on a combined basis, to make intelligent selection about where Microchip's effort should go, which piece of the business is better positioned to go forward, an example could be when you acquire a company, you have some that kind of effort going on inside. And then you acquire a company which has a similar effort which is farther along. And after you acquire it, let's say you merge it together and you pursue the platform that you acquired, which would lower the revenue that you would have otherwise gained if you hadn't acquired them because you have similar products. So after about a quarter or so, which is really is important for The Street to know what's the core growth and what's the acquired growth, if you continue to carry it in any fashion a year out -- 9 months out, a year out, then you're really doing disservice because our job is to really to make the best assessments of where we put the effort, where the sales force sells it, where the field application engineer spends time, what is the best solution to present to our customer.

A lot of their assembly and test has been moved out after the earthquake. So the effect of yen is really much more muted than it ever was. The impact of really the lower cost, if there is any, is really much, much slower and it takes a long time because, really, it's at a designing level. Whatever is designed in our proprietary products, customers really cannot change. So the question really will be on new designs, can somebody from Japan be more competitive? And I think that's really -- there is a lot of hurdle people have. There's IP. There is installed base. There is development tools. There is legacy of products, software the people have designed in. So especially in our business, that impact is really fairly small and takes a very long time. It would be much more drastic in a memory business where you can really substitute one product for the other product to model. But in a microcontroller, analog designing business, I think it's very negligible impact. But there is a second impact, which is really positive when you measure the market share. The market share dollar, as reported by Gartner or SIA or anybody else, is in dollars. And the majority of the sales of the Japanese companies is in Japan. They produce there, they sell there, they sell in yen. So when you take the yen sale and you convert them to dollars, it's going to be much smaller. That impact is immediate. So when you calculate market share, market share in dollar terms on a percentage basis is going to grow right away. And the other impact you're talking about is very long term, very slow and may or may not happen and we have a lot of time to come to that."

So then you have a problem in choosing, a, microcontroller. And if you choose a very large, higher-superset microcontroller, then you make it expensive for everybody else. So the best answer to serve 1,000 customers is not always integrated, but the best answer to serve one large customer is always an integrated SoC. So those have strategy implications."

During the course of this conference call, we will be making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to our press releases of today as well as our recent filings with the SEC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip's business and results of operations. 
In attendance with me today are Steve Sanghi, Microchip's President and CEO; and Ganesh Moorthy, Microchip's COO. I will comment on our third quarter fiscal year 2015 financial performance, and Steve and Ganesh will then give their comments on the results and discuss the current business environment as well as our guidance. We will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions.
I want to remind you that we are including information in our press release and this conference call on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.microchip.com, which we believe you will find useful when comparing GAAP and non-GAAP results. 
I will now go through some of the operating results, including net sales, gross margin and operating expenses. I will be referring to these results on a non-GAAP basis prior to the effects of our acquisition activities and share-based compensation.
Non-GAAP net sales in the December quarter were $535.8 million and were down 1.9% sequentially from non-GAAP net sales of $546.2 million in the immediately preceding quarter. The December quarter revenue exceeded the high end of our updated guidance for the quarter. Revenue by product line was $345.5 million for microcontrollers, $125.5 million for analog, $33.2 million for memory, $22.9 million for licensing and $8.7 million of other. Revenue by geography was $104.9 million in the Americas, $105.9 million in Europe and $325 million in Asia. I'll remind you that we recognize revenue based on where we ship our products to, which tends to skew some of the revenue towards Asia where a lot of contract manufacturing takes place. 
On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were 58.2% in the December quarter, at the high end of our guidance range. Non-GAAP operating expenses were 26.6% of sales, well below the bottom end of our guidance range. Non-GAAP operating income was 31.6% of sales, and net income was $143.3 million. This resulted in earnings of $0.64 per diluted share, which was at the high end of our updated guidance. 
GAAP net sales in the December quarter were $528.7 million and were $7.1 million lower than non-GAAP net sales, as we changed the contractual relationships with the ISSC distribution network to a sell-through revenue recognition model. On a GAAP basis, gross margins, including share-based compensation and acquisition-related expenses, were $57.1 million in the December -- 51 -- 57.1% in the December quarter. GAAP gross margins include the impact of $2.3 million of share-based compensation, $4.2 million of charges associated with the sell-through of written-up inventory from our acquisitions of Supertex and ISSC and $3.2 million of gross profit on the revenue recognition change previously mentioned. Total operating expenses were $204 million or 38.6% of sales and include acquisition intangible amortization of $47.6 million, share-based compensation of $12.5 million, $0.5 million of acquisition-related expenses and special charges of $1 million. GAAP net income was $86.1 million or $0.39 per diluted share. GAAP net income includes nonrecurring favorable tax events of $3.9 million, including a benefit from the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit. 
In the December quarter, the non-GAAP tax rate was 10.3% and the GAAP tax rate was 1.6%. The GAAP tax rate was favorably impacted by the $3.9 million of nonrecurring tax events that I mentioned before. Our tax rate is impacted by the mix of geographical profits, withholding taxes associated with our licensing business and the tax effect of various nonrecurring items. Excluding any nonrecurring events, we expect our longer-term forward-looking non-GAAP effective tax rate to be about 10.5% to 11%. 
To summarize the after-tax impact that the non-GAAP adjustments had on Microchip's earnings per share in the December quarter, acquisition-related items were $0.223, share-based compensation was about $0.05, nonrecurring favorable tax events were about $0.018, the difference in GAAP and non-GAAP noncontrolling interest in ISSC was a favorable $0.008, and a noncash interest expense was about $0.007. The dividend declared today of $0.357 per share will be paid on March 9, 2015, to shareholders of record on February 23, 2015. The cash payments associated with this dividend will be approximately $72 million. This quarter's dividend will be our 50th consecutive quarter of making a dividend payment. We have never made reductions in our dividend, and in fact, this quarter's increase marks the 44th occasion we have increased the dividend payment, and our cumulative dividends paid amount to over $2.4 billion. This program continues to be an important component of how we return value to our shareholders. And during the time period that Microchip has paid dividends, we have also purchased back $1.4 billion of our stock, including the stock buyback that we had when we issued our convertible debt back in fiscal year 2008. Our cash return to shareholders since the inception of our dividend program is over $3.8 billion. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. Consolidated inventory at December 31, 2014, was $276.1 million or 111 days compared to 109 days at the end of the September quarter, excluding any purchase accounting adjustments. 100% of the written-up inventory from our acquisitions is now out of our inventory balance. Inventory at our distributors increased by 2 days in the December quarter and are at 36 days. I want to remind you that our distribution revenue throughout the world is recognized on a sell-through basis. We intend to grow the days of inventory on our balance sheet in the March quarter as we continue to focus on improving lead times for our customers. 
The cash generation in the December quarter, excluding the purchase of additional shares of ISSC, our dividend payment, changes in marketable equity securities and changes in borrowing levels under our revolving line of credit, was $145.7 million. As of December 31, the consolidated cash and total investment position was $2.23 billion, and our borrowings under our revolving line of credit were $981.3 million. Excluding dividend payments and our acquisition activities, we expect our total cash and investment position to grow by approximately $140 million to $160 million in the March quarter. Capital spending was approximately $36.6 million for the December quarter. We expect about $40 million in capital spending in the March quarter and overall capital expenditures for fiscal year 2015 to be about $160 million as we are adding capital to support the growth of our production capabilities for our fast-growing new products and technologies and to bring in-house more of the assembly and test operations that are currently outsourced. 
Depreciation expense in the December quarter was $24.7 million. As discussed earlier, the contractual terms of our relationships with the ISSC distributors changed during the December quarter, resulting in about $7 million of lower GAAP versus non-GAAP revenue. There is another $4 million of product in the ISSC distribution channel related to products sold to these distributors by ISSC under their prior contracts. This will result in GAAP revenue being about $4 million less than non-GAAP revenue in the March quarter. At the end of the March quarter, this transition to a sell-through model will be completed for ISSC, and there will be no further differences between GAAP and non-GAAP revenue recognition related to this change. 
I will now ask Ganesh to give his comments on the performance of the business in the December quarter and provide an update on the integration activities related to the ISSC acquisition. Ganesh?"

Let's take a closer look at the performance of each of our product lines, starting with microcontrollers. Our microcontroller revenue was up 10.3% in the December quarter from a year-ago quarter. For calendar",658,"Thank you, Eric, and good afternoon, everyone. Let's take a closer look at the performance of each of our product lines, starting with microcontrollers. Our microcontroller revenue was up 10.3% in the December quarter from a year-ago quarter. For calendar year 2014, our microcontroller business was up 13.8% and set an all-time record. Also for calendar year 2014, each of our 3 microcontroller segments, 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit, set revenue records. Microcontrollers represented 64.5% of Microchip's overall revenue in the December quarter. 
You may recall that we told you last quarter that our 16- and 32-bit combined microcontroller business was in the range of $400 million to $500 million annualized. Since then, we have received substantial feedback through prospective employees and industry sources that our competitors were very surprised to learn about the size of our 16-bit and 32-bit microcontroller business. And we're actively seeking more information as to where we were winning. It appears our competitors had assumed that our business was still embryonic and were surprised by the magnitude of the revenue range we provided. We believe that our stealth mode in keeping the actual size of business confidential has helped us in gaining substantial momentum in these product lines. With our competitors now apparently scurrying around trying to triangulate on which markets and applications we're achieving our success, we have decided that we are not going to help their effort. Going forward, we will no longer be breaking out the growth rate of the individual microcontroller segments. As you have seen from our disclosures, the size of each of our 8-, 16- and 32-bit businesses is quite substantial. We did break out the growth rates for several quarters when it was important to communicate a sense for the rate of growth of the 16-bit and 32-bit businesses while they were smaller businesses. Henceforth, consistent with the practice of most of our competitors, we will only be reporting overall microcontroller revenue and growth rate. So for one last time for your records, our 16-bit microcontroller business was up 27.7% in calendar year 2014, and our 32-bit microcontroller business was up 41.3% in calendar year 2014. Based on the growth we've experienced in calendar year 2014 in all 3 microcontroller segments, we believe we're continuing to gain significant microcontroller market share, and we expect the calendar year 2014 market share rankings will bear that out when they are published later this year. 
Now let's move to our analog products. Our analog business was up 15.3% from the year-ago quarter. In calendar year 2014, our analog business was up 15.7% and also set an all-time record. This business continues to have strong design win momentum in a broad range of applications and represented 23.4% of Microchip's overall revenue in the December quarter, the highest percentage that it has ever been. We continue to develop and introduce a wide range of innovative and proprietary new products to fuel the future growth of our analog business. 
Moving to our memory business, which is comprised of our Serial E-squared memory products as well as our SuperFlash Memory products. This business was up 2% over a year-ago quarter. In calendar year 2014, our memory business was down 1.5%. We continue to run our memory business in a disciplined fashion that maintains consistently high profitability, enables our licensing business and serves our microcontroller customers to complete their solutions. Our memory business represented 6.2% of Microchip's overall revenue in the December quarter. 
Finally, ISSC was integrated into our business systems as planned on November 1. At the end of December, we owned 91.1% of the ISSC shares, and on December 25, we delisted ISSC from the Taiwan Stock Exchange. We expect to acquire the remaining shares of ISSC in the first half of 2015 and complete the merger process during that time. 
Let me now pass it to Steve for some general comments about our business as well as our guidance going forward. Steve?"

Today, I would first like to reflect on the results of the fiscal third quarter of 2015 and calendar year 2014. Then, I will comment on the progress of some of our acquisitions and then provide guidance for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2015. 
We are very pleased with our execution in the December quarter. Our original revenue guidance for December quarter at the midpoint was down 4.5% sequentially. In early December, we revised that guidance upwards to be down 3.5% sequentially at the midpoint. Our actual results were down 1.9% sequentially, which was better than seasonal. 
Looking at the calendar year 2014, it was our first year to cross the $2 billion revenue mark. Calendar year '14 revenue came in at $2.107 billion, up 12.8% from calendar year '13. All of our strategic product lines of microcontrollers and analog posted strong performance in calendar year 2014. The December quarter was also our 97th consecutive profitable quarter. 
I want to thank all the employees of Microchip for their contribution in this remarkable achievement of 97 consecutive profitable quarters. 
Now in the last conference call, we told you that we will be shutting down production in Supertex's San Jose fab as well as test facility in Hong Kong. There is excellent progress on both fronts. The last wafer starts in San Jose fab have already been made and the fab will close in the March/April time frame. The transfer of Hong Kong test to our high-volume Thailand facility is also on schedule for this quarter. As we said before, we believe that closure of the San Jose fab and the Hong Kong test facility will add about $0.05 to $0.07 of accretion on an annual basis after the older last-time buy inventory has been shipped out. 
Now I will provide guidance for the fiscal third quarter of 2015. As we said in the last conference call, we completed the small correction in the September quarter, and then the December quarter turned out to be better than seasonal. March quarter is historically a very strong quarter in Europe and a weak quarter in Asia due to Lunar New Year holidays. The quarter is usually up low single-digit percentage sequentially. We expect this March quarter to be seasonally normal and expect the revenue to be up 1% to 3% sequentially. On a non-GAAP basis, we expect our gross margin to be between 58.2% and 58.4% of sales. We expect operating expenses to be between 26.2% and 26.6% of sales. We expect operating profit to be between 31.6% and 32.2% of sales. We expect non-GAAP EPS to be between $0.65 and $0.67 per share. 
Now I also promised to you that we will review our business units, geographical data, direct customers and distributors with a fine-tooth comb to make sure that our miss in September quarter was not driven by anything that has changed competitively that we may have missed. I'm happy to report that we have completed a total review and our miss in September quarter was nothing more than a quick correction and softening that we saw led by China. Beyond that, there was no other corrective action on our part. As you have now seen 2 quarters of data from the industry, you can see that our cumulative performance of 2 quarters, September and December, is in the top half of our MCU and analog peer group, and our 2% sequential growth guidance at the midpoint for the March quarter should further alleviate any of your concerns. Overall, our 2014 performance demonstrates Microchip has continued to gain market share in microcontrollers and analog. 
In closing, as I take stock of our business, I have never been more confident of our market position and our future prospects with the investments we have made and are continuing to make for the long-term success of Microchip.

Different companies have different definitions. Some include the entire microcontroller, analog, sensor and the entire chain of products that go with it, along with the Wi-Fi solution, and some not. So I will say in general, we are excited about the opportunity presented by the IoT market. We have all the pieces needed, the intelligence in microcontroller, analog, smart memory, sensors, all of the connectivity protocols, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, RF, ZigBee and everything else. And we think we have increasing presence in this fast-growing market. The broadest adoption of smartphones and tablets is accelerating the demand for more things to be connected, and Microchip is incredibly well placed by having all the components needed, like I mentioned, microcontroller, analog, memory, sensors as well as all the RF, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and other building blocks. We have ready-mix suite of phoneware solutions to go with various connectivities. And we have a set of partners who can provide the cloud solutions and storage needed for people to be able to ping the data off the cloud. So I think we have really all the stuff needed. We have very substantial revenue in the IoT market. Depending on how you describe it, it could be many hundreds of millions of dollars, and there's a significant growth in the segment.

We usually break out the data for a quarter or so, and after that, it's very, very difficult because the businesses get intertwined. When we buy a company, part of the thing is then, on a combined basis, to make intelligent selection about where Microchip's effort should go, which piece of the business is better positioned to go forward, an example could be when you acquire a company, you have some that kind of effort going on inside. And then you acquire a company which has a similar effort which is farther along. And after you acquire it, let's say you merge it together and you pursue the platform that you acquired, which would lower the revenue that you would have otherwise gained if you hadn't acquired them because you have similar products. So after about a quarter or so, which is really is important for The Street to know what's the core growth and what's the acquired growth, if you continue to carry it in any fashion a year out -- 9 months out, a year out, then you're really doing disservice because our job is to really to make the best assessments of where we put the effort, where the sales force sells it, where the field application engineer spends time, what is the best solution to present to our customer.

A lot of their assembly and test has been moved out after the earthquake. So the effect of yen is really much more muted than it ever was. The impact of really the lower cost, if there is any, is really much, much slower and it takes a long time because, really, it's at a designing level. Whatever is designed in our proprietary products, customers really cannot change. So the question really will be on new designs, can somebody from Japan be more competitive? And I think that's really -- there is a lot of hurdle people have. There's IP. There is installed base. There is development tools. There is legacy of products, software the people have designed in. So especially in our business, that impact is really fairly small and takes a very long time. It would be much more drastic in a memory business where you can really substitute one product for the other product to model. But in a microcontroller, analog designing business, I think it's a very negligible impact. But there is a second impact, which is really positive when you measure the market share. The market share dollar, as reported by Gartner or SIA or anybody else, is in dollars. And the majority of the sales of the Japanese companies is in Japan. They produce there, they sell there, they sell in yen. So when you take the yen sale and you convert them to dollars, it's going to be much smaller. That impact is immediate. So when you calculate market share, market share in dollar terms on a percentage basis is going to grow right away. And the other impact you're talking about is very long term, very slow and may or may not happen and we have a lot of time to come to that."

If your strategy is to go get one large $50 million account, whether it's in networking or smartphones or whatever, then that integration is very important. Then you take a microcontroller, take the RF, take everything and you're delivering SoC to that customer. If your strategy is to try to sell that 2,000 accounts, long-tail customers like Microchip does that have substantially higher margin and a better business model longer term, then integration is not always the best answer because everybody wants a different microcontroller and density and speed and bit size and different performance levels and different things in it. So then you have a problem in choosing a microcontroller. And if you choose a very large, higher-superset microcontroller, then you make it expensive for everybody else. So the best answer to serve 1,000 customers is not always integrated, but the best answer to serve one large customer is always an integrated SoC. So those have strategy implications."

In addition to Steve Sanghi, Microchip's President and CEO, Ganesh Moorthy, Microchip's CEO is also participating in this call. 
I will comment on our fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2015 financial performance, and Steve and Ganesh will then give their comments on the results and discuss the current business environment as well as our guidance. We will then we available to respond to specific investor and analysts questions. I want to remind you that we are including information in our press release in this conference call on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. 
We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations on the Investor Relations page of our site at www.microchip.com, which we believe you will find useful when comparing GAAP and non-GAAP results.
I will now go through some of our operating results including net sales, gross margin and operating expenses. I will be referring to these results on a non-GAAP basis prior to the effects of our acquisition activities and share based compensation.
Non-GAAP net sales in the March quarter were a record $547.2 million and very modestly above the midpoint of our guidance, which was $546.6 million and were up 10.9% from the March 2014 quarter. 
Revenue by product line in the March quarter was $353.6 million for Microcontrollers, $127.6 million for analog, $33.2 million for memory, $23.6 million for licensing and $9.2 million of other. Revenue by geography was $106.2 million in the Americas, a record $126 million in Europe and $314.9 million in Asia. 
I remind you that we recognize revenue based on where we ship our products to, which tends to skew some of the revenue towards Asia, where a lot of contract manufacturing takes place.
On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were at the midpoint of our guidance at 58.3% in the March quarter. Non-GAAP operating expenses were 25.9% of sales, well below the bottom end of over guidance range. Non-GAAP operating income was 32.4% of sales and net income was $148.8 million. This resulted in record earnings of $0.68 per diluted share, which was at the high-end of our guidance.
For fiscal 2015 on a non-GAAP basis, net sales were a record $2.161 billion and up 11.9% year-over-year. Gross margins were 58.8%, operating expenses were 26.4% of sales and operating income was 32.4% of sales. 
Net income was a record $593.9 million or $2.66 per diluted share. GAAP net sales in the March quarter were $543.2 million, and as originally guided were $4 million lower than non-GAAP net sales, due to the contractual relationship change we made with the ISSC distribution network to move them to a sell-through revenue recognition model in the December quarter. 
The revenue impact from this change was fully recognized as of the end of March and will not create a GAAP to non-GAAP revenue difference in future quarters. 
On a GAAP basis, gross margins including share based compensation and acquisition related expenses were 57.7% in the March quarter. GAAP gross margins included the impact of $2 million of share base compensation, $1.8 million of gross profit on the ISSC revenue recognition change previously mentioned and $1.5 million in manufacturing shutdown cost associated with the Supertex wafer fab in San Jose. 
Total operating expenses were $203.3 million or 37.4% of sales and include acquisition intangible amortization of $47.1 million. Share based compensation of $13.2 million, $0.7 million of acquisition related expenses and special charges of $0.8 million. 
GAAP other expense includes a $50.6 million loss on the retirements of 50% of our 2,037 convertible bonds and an $18.5 million gain on the sale of proportion of investments that Microchip acquired as part of the SST acquisition back in 2010. 
GAAP net income was $99.4 million or $0.45 per diluted share.
GAAP net income includes nonrecurring favorable tax events of $26.7 million, which were primarily driven by closer of tax audit and expiration of limitations for certain previously established tax reserves. 
For fiscal year 2015, GAAP net sales were a record $2.147 billion. Gross margins were 57.3%. Operating expenses were 37.4% of sales and operating income was 19.8% of sales. 
Net income was -- $369 million or $1.65 per diluted share. 
In the March quarter, the non-GAAP tax rate was 11.4%. The GAAP tax benefit rate was 58.9%. The GAAP tax rate was favorably impacted by the $26.7 million of nonrecurring tax events  that I mentioned before. And the tax impact of certain of the one-time events in the quarter. 
Our tax rate is impacted by the mix of geographical profits with holding taxes associated with our licensing business and the tax effect of various nonrecurring items. 
Excluding any nonrecurring events, we expect our longer-term forward-looking non-GAAP effective tax rate to be about 10.75% to 11.25%.
To summarize the after-tax impact of the non-GAAP adjustments had on Microchip's earnings per share in the March quarter. Acquisition related items were about $0.217, share based compensation was about $0.052, nonrecurring favorable tax events or about $0.121, the favorable difference on the sale of a proportion of investments applied in the SST acquisition was about $0.084, the loss on retirement of our 50% of our 2,037 convertible bonds was about $0.0144. The difference in the GAAP and non-GAAP noncontrolling interest in ISST was a favorable of about $0.05 and noncash interest expense was about $0.019.
The dividend declared today of $35.75 per share will be paid on June 4, 2015 to shareholders of record on May 21, 2015. The cash payments associated with this dividend will be approximately $72.4 million. This quarter's dividend will be our 51 consecutive quarter of making a dividend payment. We have never made reductions in our dividend, and in fact, this quarter's increase marks the 45 occasion we have increased the dividend payment. And our cumulative dividends paid amount to over $2.5 billion. 
This program continues to be an important component of how we return value to our shareholders. During the time period of Microchip's paid dividends, we have also purchased back $1.4 billion of our stock, including the stock that we bought back with the issuance of our convertible debenture back in 2008. Our cash return to shareholders since the inception of our dividend program is of to $3.9 billion.
Moving onto the balance sheet. Consolidated inventory at March 31, 2015 was $279.5 million or 111 days flat to the levels at the end of December quarter. Inventory at our distributors increased by 1-day in the March quarter and are at 37 days. 
I want to remind you that our distribution revenues throughout the world is recognized on a sell-through basis. We intend to grow the dates of inventory on our balance sheet in the June quarter to support our business growth and customer service levels.
The cash generation in the March quarter, excluding the purchase of additional shares of ISSC, our dividend payment, changes in cash from the issuance retirement of our convertible debentures and changes in borrowing levels under revolving line of credit was $155.5 million. 
As of March 31, the consolidated cash and total investment position was $2.34 billion, and our borrowings under our revolving line of credit were $462 million. Excluding dividend payments and our acquisition activities, we expect our total cash and investment position to grow by approximately $160 million to $180 million in the June quarter. 
Capital spending was approximately $29.4 million for the March quarter and $149.5 million for fiscal year 2015. We expect about $40 million in capital spending in the June quarter and overall capital expenditures for fiscal year 2016 to be about $160 million as we are adding-- capital to support the growth of our production capabilities for our fast growing new products and technologies and to bring in house more of the assembly and test operations that we are currently outsourcing.
Depreciation expense in the March quarter was $25 million. I will now ask Ganesh to give his comments on the performance of the business in the March quarter. Ganesh?"

Our Microcontroller revenue was up 8.4% in the March quarter from the year-ago quarter. For fiscal year 2015, our Microcontroller business was up 11.4% over fiscal year 2014. Crossing the $1.4 billion mark for the first time and setting an all-time record. 
Also, for fiscal year 2015, each of our 3 Microcontroller segments, 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit, set revenue records. Microcontrollers represented 64.6% of Microchip's overall revenue in the March quarter.
As we mentioned in our January conference call, for competitive reasons, we will only be providing overall Microcontroller revenue and growth rates and not breakout by segment consistent with the practice of most of our competitors. 
just released their Microcontroller market share report for 2014. We are pleased to report that Microchip has regained a number 1 position for 8-bit Microcontrollers. 4 years ago, it took the merger of 3 Japanese semiconductor giants NEC, Hitachi and Mitsubishi in the form of Renesas to knock us off the number 1 spot for 8-bit Microcontrollers. 
We assured you at that time that we will work relentlessly to gain market share and to rest back the number 1 spot in the coming years. Post their merger, Renesas 8-bit Microcontroller business in 2010 used to be 41% larger than ours. 
In every year since 2010, we have closed the gap versus Renesas. And in 2014, we rested back the leadership position and finished 10.5% larger than Renesas. In the 16-bit microcontroller market, we will again the fastest growing 16-bit Microcontroller supplier among the top 10 suppliers in 2014. Growing at 2x rate of any of the other top 10 suppliers.
While our substantially faster growth rate close the gap versus higher rank suppliers, we remain in the #5 spot in 2014, and expect to continue to gain share and move further up the rankings in the coming years. 
In the 32-bit Microcontroller market, we moved up to the #9 spot in 2014 from the #11 spot in 2013. 
continuing our relentless time up the rankings, since we enter this market a few years ago. Now report us a backward indicator, where we are performing very well. Now to look at a forward looking indicator, in April also, UBM which is the parent company of Times release the result of their annual Embedded Market Study. Once again, Microchip was rated by the embedded system design engineers as their number 1 choice for new designs using 8-bit, and 16-bit Microcontrollers in the performance range that we compete in. And we were #2 choice among 32-bit Microcontrollers. We are humbled and gratified by the overwhelming preference by engineers for our solutions and see this as a positive sign for future growth.
Our overall Microcontroller results as well as each of our 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit results are clearly outperforming the market. With the year-over-year growth rates well above the market, and what we have seen reported by our competitors in their result. These outstanding results in a very competitive market are attribute to the tireless efforts for the worldwide Microchip team. We have gained significant market share and have the new product momentum and customer engagement, we continue to gain even more share, as we build the best-performing Microcontroller franchise in the industry.
Analog products. Our analog business was up 18.7% from the year-ago quarter. In fiscal year 2015, our analog business was up 17.6% over fiscal year 2014, crossing the $0.5 billion mark for the first time and also setting an all-time record. This business continues to have strong design win momentum in a broad range of applications and represented 23.3% of Microchip's overall revenue in the March quarter. 
We continue to develop and introduce a wide range of innovative and proprietary new products to fuel the future growth of our analog business.
Now moving to the memory business, which is comprised of  memory products as well as our SuperFlash Memory produce. This business was up 0.2% versus a year ago quarter. In fiscal year 2015, our memory business was down 1.8%, versus fiscal year 2014. 
We continue to run our memory business in a in a disciplined fashion that maintains consistently high profitability, enables our licensing business and serves our Microcontroller customers to complete their solutions. 
Our memory business represented 6.1% of Microchip's overall revenue in the March quarter.
I have one more topic to cover today. Given the importance of Internet of Things market, some of our investors and analysts have asked for more color about the size of our IoT business. 
First, there is no consistent way in which semiconductor companies report their IoT revenue. As a result, there are some, who report their entire embedded market revenue and the revenue business units focus on embedded market as IoT revenue. 
By that measure, we did close to 100% of Microchip's $2.2 billion of revenue, could be classified as IoT revenue. But it could be as meaningful to investors in terms of its potential as a future growth driver. We have a strict definition for our IoT revenue. In that we only count applications or things that are both smart and connected reflecting with the promise of IoT really is, which is the possibilities that open up by adding connectivity to smart systems. 
Examples of smart and connected applications for Microchip are things like alarm systems, access control systems, thermostats, smoke detectors, exercise machines, asset tracking, wireless audio docks, set-top boxes and another consumer electronic systems, hospital personal locators, patient monitors, automotive telematics, building automation, vending machines, Smart Grid monitoring, wired and wireless networking systems, GPS, navigation tracking system and many, many others, there are too numerous list. 
More applications continue to be added as they get connected. I'm sure, you'll agree that applications like the examples we just provided, which are a combination of smart and connected applications of more real IoT applications. And the products going into them would better categorize our IoT revenue. 
Microchip solutions that enable the IoT market, include low-power microcontrollers, analog, sensors, memories, wired and wireless commination for us. So using our strict definition for IoT revenue, Microchip estimates that our current annual IoT revenue is approximately $275 million and has been growing at a greater than 35% compounded annual growth rate over the last 3 years. 
This revenue is already included in the public reporting segments for Microchip. Let me now pass it to Steve for some general comments about our business as well as our guidance going forward. Steve?"

Today, I would first like to reflect on the results of the fiscal fourth quarter of 2015 and fiscal year 2015, then I will provide guidance for the fiscal first quarter of 2016.
We were very pleased with our execution in the March quarter. We achieved record net sales in the March quarter and slightly ahead of the midpoint of our guidance. 
Our non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.68 were a record and at the high end of our revised estimates. Recall that, we had revised earnings per share higher after taking into account the accretive affect of our financing transactions. 
Looking at the fiscal year 2015. It was another record year for revenue and the first fiscal year cross the $2 billion revenue Mark. For fiscal year 2015, revenue came in at a record $2.16 billion, up 11.9% from fiscal year 2014. 
All of our strategic product lines of Microcontroller and analog posted record revenue performance for fiscal year 2015. The March quarter was also our 98 consecutive profitable quarter. I want to thank all the employees of Microchip for their contribution in this remarkable achievement of 98 consecutive profitable quarters, we're also planning a celebration for 100 consecutive profitable quarter, which is 2 quarters away.
In the last 2 conference call, we told you that we will be shutting down production in Supertex, San Jose fab as well as test facility in Hong Kong. The San Jose fab is now closed with the last wafer outs occurring in early April. The fab building is undergoing restoration to be return back to the landlord. The transfer of the Hong Kong test operations to our high-volume Thailand facility was also completed in February. 
Now I will provide guidance for the fiscal first quarter of 2016.
As we look at the business environment, it is clear that many of our industry peers are seeing weakness across various end markets, including PC an industrial, slowing growth in China market and currency impacts from the strong dollar. Taking all this into account, we believe that our net sales in the June quarter will be between $547 million and $564 million.
On a non-GAAP basis, we expect our gross margin to be between 58.3% and 58.5% of sales. We expect operating expenses to be between 25.75% and 26% of sales. We expect operating profit to be between 32.3% and 32.75% of sales. 
And we expect non-GAAP EPS to be between $0.69 and $0.73 per share. 
Finally, I want to remind you that given all the complications of accounting for the acquisitions, including amortization of intangibles, restructuring charges and inventory write upon acquisition. Microchip will continue to provide guidance and track its results on non-GAAP basis. We believe that non-GAAP results provide more meaningful comparison to prior quarters, and we request that the analysts continue to report the non-GAAP estimates to first call. 
Before we open it up for questions, I want to remind everybody in case somebody joint the conference late, that in this conference call, we'll be only taking questions regarding our earnings and we'll have a second conference call starting at 5:45 p.m. New York time at which we will talk about the Micrel acquisition and take questions related to that acquisition.

We believe seasonality often is miscalculated by the investors, depending on how many years back you go. We have had Supertex acquisition, which closed in April last year. ISSC acquisition last year, and if you 5 years back we closed SST acquisition also in April. 
So when you look at June quarter numbers, sometimes you do with or without acquisitions and many times the breakdown of those numbers is not available 2 or 3 years out. So I believe that seasonality changes a lot with this acquisition. And I think, but the largest reason is you describe yourself, which is industry conditions are soft, just like announced by other peers. That's what we are seeing and beyond that, I'm not going to comment cycle or anything else for the future."

So we don't really have any end market flavor. But Ganesh in his commentary described that IoT business the way we defined it much narrower definition of IoT for applications that are really smart and connected is growing 35% the year. So that's doing very well. But if you take a broader definition of IoT like include all the embedded business and all that, you could almost call 100% of Microchip's business as IoT, which really would not be helpful. So that's really what I've to say there."

So 99%-plus of our business will be in U.S. dollars. So we don't take a hit it on our receivables that way. And when the currencies become weak overseas, it doesn't change our revenue right away, because our prices are in dollars. 
But then it makes the products more expensive for our customers to as your renegotiating the price, the next bit comes in, next order comes in, you negotiating, and then you will see some impact. But doing it in dollars gives us more control, allows us to manage it, split it with the customer or do whatever. But really allows us to manage it rather than having automatic full FX impact to drop down. So I think the way we do it is probably better. And has a delayed effect. It also impacts the business of our customers. If a business of our customers includes lots of product from overseas, which in most cases it does. Then their end product becomes more expensive and they're having more trouble in terms of ramping their own product. So those results are real, some are first tier, some are a second tier, some are even 3 tier.. And it's very hard to figure this out with 90,000 customers worldwide doing business in 100 countries.

So our Microcontroller and analog business is both very well-funded and relatively independently. We're not driving to a model that 3 years out exclusion of our business will be in this division or that division. They are all well-funded and it depends on basically achieving product success and marketplace penetration and they meet in manufacturing, and they meet at the customer base and they meet in application, where in semi application, we got lots of Microcontroller as well as analog products going to a single board. 
So there is a lot of synergy that way. But in terms of making investments, there is not a competition, because we can really take care of both. So it will largely depend on where we have larger success. 
Analog has been growing faster somewhat, because that's where we have done some of the acquisitions, Microcontroller acquisitions a bit more difficult to do, because everybody has a different architecture and you got different issues and trying to get synergy in Microcontroller. So we have been able to acquire capability in analog both organically and through acquisitions. And it has been a smaller business compared to the Microcontroller. 
Microcontroller is $1.5 billion business and analog is about a 1/3 of that, $0.5 billion. So it's been growing faster. But it's not something that we are, if Microcontroller can grow faster with IoT, with other applications, 32-bit is going very fast, 16-bit is going very fast. It did a record. But it does have a $1.5 billion that has to move. And we are #3rd in the overall Microcontroller market, third or fourth depending on which year your take, versus an analog, we are much lower.

Our own inventory than the lower side and we like it higher. 
The distribution inventories in the middle. So when you combine those 2 inventories in that high, if anything there on the low side, despite the weakness, despite the guidance. So based on current numbers, our inventory is still really on the South of the middle. So I don't think that inventory is the problem. We're working very hard in our factories to make more product for our customers, and have expedites and challenges and others with the mix being very complex, having close down Supertex fab, accommodating all those products in our fab. It's manufacturing is challenging. and inventory, high inventory is not a issue right now."

And I think there is a lot more coming in front of us from the industry at large on how to ensure that as IoT fills out for a range of applications, a security part of it continues to be addressed sufficiently.

In addition to Steve Sanghi, Microchip's President and CEO, Ganesh Moorthy, Microchip's COO, is also participating in this call.
I will comment on our fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2015 financial performance, and Steve and Ganesh will then give their comments on the results and discuss the current business environment as well as our guidance. We will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions. I want to remind you that we are including information in our press release and this conference call on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.microchip.com, which we believe you will find useful when comparing GAAP and non-GAAP results.
I will now go through some of our operating results including net sales, gross margin and operating expenses. I will be referring to these results on a non-GAAP basis prior to the effects of our acquisition activities and share-based compensation.
Non-GAAP net sales in the March quarter were a record $547.2 million and were modestly above the midpoint of our guidance, which was $546.6 million, and were up 10.9% from the March 2014 quarter. Revenue by product line in the March quarter was $353.6 million for microcontrollers, $127.6 million for analog, $33.2 million for memory, $23.6 million for licensing and $9.2 million of other. Revenue by geography was $106.2 million in the Americas, a record $126 million in Europe and $314.9 million in Asia. I remind you that we recognize revenue based on where we ship our products to, which tends to skew some of the revenue towards Asia where a lot of contract manufacturing takes place.
On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were at the midpoint of our guidance at 58.3% in the March quarter. Non-GAAP operating expenses were 25.9% of sales, well below the bottom end of our guidance range. Non-GAAP operating income was 32.4% of sales and net income was $148.8 million. This resulted in record earnings of $0.68 per diluted share, which was at the high end of our guidance.
For fiscal 2015, on a non-GAAP basis, net sales were a record $2.161 billion and up 11.9% year-over-year. Gross margins were 58.8%, operating expenses were 26.4% of sales and operating income was 32.4% of sales. Net income was a record $593.9 million or $2.66 per diluted share.
GAAP net sales in the March quarter were $543.2 million, and as originally guided, were $4 million lower than non-GAAP net sales due to the contractual relationship change we made with the ISSC distribution network to move them to a sell-through revenue recognition model in the December quarter. The revenue impact from this change was fully recognized as of the end of March and will not create a GAAP to non-GAAP revenue difference in future quarters.
On a GAAP basis, gross margins including share based compensation and acquisition-related expenses were 57.7% in the March quarter. GAAP gross margins included the impact of $2 million of share-based compensation, $1.8 million of gross profit on the ISSC revenue recognition change previously mentioned and $1.5 million in manufacturing shutdown costs associated with the Supertex wafer fab in San Jose.
Total operating expenses were $203.3 million or 37.4% of sales and include acquisition intangible amortization of $47.1 million, share-based compensation of $13.2 million, $0.7 million of acquisition-related expenses and special charges of $0.8 million. GAAP other expense includes a $50.6 million loss on the retirements of 50% of our 2,037 convertible bonds and an $18.5 million gain on the sale of a portion of investments that Microchip acquired as part of the SST acquisition back in 2010. 
GAAP net income was $99.4 million or $0.45 per diluted share. GAAP net income includes nonrecurring favorable tax events of $26.7 million, which were primarily driven by the closure of a tax audit and the expiration of the statute of limitations for certain previously established tax reserves.
For fiscal year 2015, GAAP net sales were a record $2.147 billion. Gross margins were 57.3%, operating expenses were 37.4% of sales and operating income was 19.8% of sales. Net income was $369 million or $1.65 per diluted share.
In the March quarter, the non-GAAP tax rate was 11.4%. The GAAP tax benefit rate was 58.9%. The GAAP tax rate was favorably impacted by the $26.7 million of nonrecurring tax events that I mentioned before and the tax impact of certain of the one-time events in the quarter. Our tax rate is impacted by the mix of geographical profits, withholding taxes associated with our licensing business and the tax effect of various nonrecurring items. Excluding any nonrecurring events, we expect our longer-term forward-looking non-GAAP effective tax rate to be about 10.75% to 11.25%.
To summarize the after-tax impact that the non-GAAP adjustments had on Microchip's earnings per share in the March quarter, acquisition-related items were about $0.217, share-based compensation was about $0.052, nonrecurring favorable tax events were about $0.121, a favorable difference on the sale of a portion of investments acquired in the SST acquisition was about $0.084, the loss on the retirement of our 50% of our 2,037 convertible bonds was about $0.144, the difference in the GAAP and non-GAAP noncontrolling interest in ISSC was a favorable of about $0.05 and noncash interest expense was about $0.019.
The dividend declared today of $35.75 per share will be paid on June 4, 2015, to shareholders of record on May 21, 2015. The cash payment associated with this dividend will be approximately $72.4 million. This quarter's dividend will be our 51st consecutive quarter of making a dividend payment. We have never made reductions in our dividend and in fact, this quarter's increase marks the 45th occasion we have increased the dividend payment and our cumulative dividends paid amount to over $2.5 billion. This program continues to be an important component of how we return value to our shareholders.
During the time period that Microchip has paid dividends, we have also purchased back $1.4 billion of our stock, including the stock that we bought back with the issuance of our convertible debenture back in 2008. Our cash return to shareholders since the inception of our dividend program is about [ph] $3.9 billion.
Moving on to the balance sheet. Consolidated inventory at March 31, 2015, was $279.5 million or 111 days, flat to the levels at the end of the December quarter. Inventory at our distributors increased by 1 day in the March quarter and are at 37 days. I want to remind you that our distribution revenues throughout the world is recognized on a sell-through basis. We intend to grow the days of inventory on our balance sheet in the June quarter to support our business growth and customer service levels.
The cash generation in the March quarter, excluding the purchase of additional shares of ISSC, our dividend payment, changes in cash from the issuance and retirement of our convertible debentures and changes in borrowing levels under revolving line of credit was $155.5 million. As of March 31, the consolidated cash and total investment position was $2.34 billion, and our borrowings under our revolving line of credit were $462 million. Excluding dividend payments and our acquisition activities, we expect our total cash and investment position to grow by approximately $160 million to $180 million in the June quarter.
Capital spending was approximately $29.4 million for the March quarter and $149.5 million for fiscal year 2015. We expect about $40 million in capital spending in the June quarter and overall capital expenditures for fiscal year 2016 to be about $160 million as we are adding capital to support the growth of our production capabilities for our fast-growing new products and technologies and to bring in-house more of the assembly and test operations that we are currently outsourcing. Depreciation expense in the March quarter was $25 million.
I will now ask Ganesh to give his comments on the performance of the business in the March quarter. Ganesh?"

For fiscal ye",1106,"Thank you, Eric, and good afternoon, everyone. Let's take a closer look at the performance of each of our product lines, starting with microcontrollers.
Our microcontroller revenue was up 8.4% in the March quarter from the year-ago quarter. For fiscal year 2015, our microcontroller business was up 11.4% over fiscal year 2014, crossing the $1.4 billion mark for the first time and setting an all-time record. Also for fiscal year 2015, each of our 3 microcontroller segments, 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit, set revenue records. Microcontrollers represented 64.6% of Microchip's overall revenue in the March quarter. As we mentioned in our January conference call, for competitive reasons, we will only be providing overall microcontroller revenue and growth rates and not break out by segment, consistent with the practice of most of our competitors.
Gartner Dataquest just released their microcontroller market share report for 2014. We are pleased to report that Microchip has regained the #1 position for 8-bit microcontrollers.
Four years ago, it took the merger of 3 Japanese semiconductor giants, NEC, Hitachi and Mitsubishi, in the form of Renesas to knock us off the #1 spot for 8-bit microcontrollers. We assured you at that time that we will work relentlessly to gain market share and to wrest back the #1 spot in the coming years. Post their merger, Renesas' 8-bit microcontroller business in 2010 used to be 41% larger than ours. In every year since 2010, we have closed the gap versus Renesas, and in 2014, we wrested back the leadership position and finished 10.5% larger than Renesas.
In the 16-bit microcontroller market, we were again the fastest-growing 16-bit microcontroller supplier among the top 10 suppliers in 2014, growing at over 2x the rate of any of the other top 10 suppliers. While our substantially faster growth rate closed the gap versus higher-rank suppliers, we remained in the #5 spot in 2014 and expect to continue to gain share and move further up the rankings in the coming years. 
In the 32-bit microcontroller market, we moved up to the #9 spot in 2014 from the #11 spot in 2013, continuing our relentless climb up the rankings since we entered this market a few years ago. Now Gartner Dataquest's report is a backward-looking indicator where we are performing very well.
Now to look at a forward-looking indicator. In April also, UBM Tech, which is the parent company of EE Times, released the results of their annual Embedded Market Study. Once again, Microchip was rated by the embedded system design engineers as their #1 choice for new designs using 8-bit and 16-bit microcontrollers in the performance range that we compete in, and we were the #2 choice among 32-bit microcontrollers. We are humbled and gratified by the overwhelming preference by engineers for our solutions and see this as a positive sign of future growth.
Our overall microcontroller results as well as each of our 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit results are clearly outperforming the market, with year-over-year growth rates well above the market and what we've seen reported by our competitors in their results. These outstanding results in a very competitive market are a tribute to the tireless effort by the worldwide Microchip team. We have gained significant market share and have the new product momentum and customer engagement to continue to gain even more share as we build the best-performing microcontroller franchise in the industry.
Analog products. Our analog business was up 18.7% from the year-ago quarter. In fiscal year 2015, our analog business was up 17.6% over fiscal year 2014, crossing the $0.5 billion mark for the first time and also setting an all-time record. This business continues to have strong design win momentum in a broad range of applications and represented 23.3% of Microchip's overall revenue in the March quarter. We continue to develop and introduce a wide range of innovative and proprietary new products to fuel the future growth of our analog business.
Now moving to the memory business, which is comprised of our Serial E-squared memory products as well as our SuperFlash Memory products. This business was up 0.2% versus the year-ago quarter. In fiscal year 2015, our memory business was down 1.8% versus fiscal year 2014. We continue to run our memory business in a disciplined fashion that maintains consistently high profitability, enables our licensing business and serves our microcontroller customers to complete their solutions. Our memory business represented 6.1% of Microchip's overall revenue in the March quarter.
I have one more topic to cover today. Given the importance of the Internet of Things market, some of our investors and analysts have asked for more color about the size of our IoT business. First, there is no consistent way in which semiconductor companies report their IoT revenue. As a result, there are some who report their entire embedded market revenue or the revenue of business units focused on the embedded market as IoT revenue.
By that measure, pretty close to 100% of Microchip's $2.2 billion of revenue could be classified as IoT revenue, but it would not be as meaningful to investors in terms of its potential as a future growth driver. We have a stricter definition for our IoT revenue in that we only count end applications or things that are both smart and connected reflecting what the promise of IoT really is, which is the possibilities that open up by adding connectivity to smart systems.
Examples of smart and connected applications for Microchip are things like alarm systems, access control systems, thermostats, smoke detectors, exercise machines, asset tracking, wireless audio docks, set-top boxes and other consumer electronic systems, hospital personnel locators, patient monitors, automotive telematics, building automation, vending machines, Smart Grid monitoring, wired and wireless networking systems, GPS navigation tracking systems and many, many others that are too numerous to list. More applications will continue to be added as they get connected. I'm sure you will agree that applications like the examples we just provided, which are a combination of smart and connected applications, are more real IoT applications and the products going into them would better characterize our IoT revenue. Microchip solutions that enable the IoT market include low-power microcontrollers, analog, sensors, memories, wired and wireless communication products.
So using our stricter definition for IoT revenue, Microchip estimates that our current annual IoT revenue is approximately $275 million and has been growing at a greater than 35% compounded annual growth rate over the last 3 years. This revenue is already included in the public reporting segments for Microchip.
Let me now pass it to Steve for some general comments about our business as well as our guidance going forward. Steve?"

Today, I would first like to reflect on the results of the fiscal fourth quarter of 2015 and fiscal year 2015 then I will provide guidance for the fiscal first quarter of 2016.We were very pleased with our execution in the March quart",555,"Thank you, Ganesh. Today, I would first like to reflect on the results of the fiscal fourth quarter of 2015 and fiscal year 2015 then I will provide guidance for the fiscal first quarter of 2016.
We were very pleased with our execution in the March quarter. We achieved record net sales in the March quarter and slightly ahead of the midpoint of our guidance. Our non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.68 was a record and at the high end of our revised estimates. Recall that we had revised our earnings per share higher after taking into account the accretive effect of our financing transactions.
Looking at the fiscal year 2015. It was another record year for revenue and the first fiscal year to cross the $2 billion revenue mark. For fiscal year 2015, revenue came in at a record $2.16 billion, up 11.9% from fiscal year 2014. All of our strategic product lines of microcontroller and analog posted record revenue performance for fiscal year 2015. The March quarter was also our 98th consecutive profitable quarter. I want to thank all the employees of Microchip for their contribution in this remarkable achievement of 98 consecutive profitable quarters. We're also planning a celebration for our 100th consecutive profitable quarter, which is 2 quarters away.
In the last 2 conference call, we told you that we will be shutting down production in Supertex, San Jose fab as well as test facility in Hong Kong. The San Jose fab is now closed with the last wafer outs occurring in early April. The fab building is undergoing restoration to be returned back to the landlord. The transfer of the Hong Kong test operations to our high-volume Thailand facility was also completed in February.
Now I will provide guidance for the fiscal first quarter of 2016. As we look at the business environment, it is clear that many of our industry peers are seeing weakness across various end markets including PC and industrial, slowing growth in China market and currency impacts from the strong dollar. Taking all this into account, we believe that our net sales in the June quarter will be between $547 million and $564 million. On a non-GAAP basis, we expect our gross margin to be between 58.3% and 58.5% of sales. We expect operating expenses to be between 25.75% and 26% of sales. We expect operating profit to be between 32.3% and 32.75% of sales, and we expect non-GAAP EPS to be between $0.69 and $0.73 per share.
Finally, I want to remind you that given all the complications of accounting for the acquisitions including amortization of intangibles, restructuring charges and inventory write-off on acquisitions, Microchip will continue to provide guidance and track its results on non-GAAP basis. We believe that non-GAAP results provide more meaningful comparison to prior quarters, and we request that the analysts continue to report the non-GAAP estimates to first call.
Before we open it up for questions, I want to remind everybody, in case somebody joined the conference late, that in this conference call, we'll be only taking questions regarding our earnings and we'll have a second conference call starting at 5:45 p.m. New York time at which we will talk about the Micrel acquisition and take questions related to that acquisition.

I'm not going to share with you anymore. Basically, I think as far as the seasonality is concerned, a company with a constant stream of acquisitions that we have done, we believe seasonality often is miscalculated by the investors depending on how many years back you go. We have had Supertex acquisition, which closed in April last year; ISSC acquisition last year. If you go 5 years back, we closed SST acquisition also in April. So when you look at the June quarter numbers, sometimes you do with or without acquisitions and many times, the breakdown of those numbers is not available 2 or 3 years out. So I believe that seasonality changes a lot with these acquisitions. And I think -- but the largest reason is you describe yourself, which is industry conditions are soft just like announced by other peers. That's what we are seeing and beyond that, I'm not going to comment on cycle or anything else for the future."

In many time at the customers, we work with multiple divisions. For some of them the business is PCs. For some others the business is industrial. For some other it could be called consumer. So we don't really have any end market flavor. But Ganesh, in his commentary, described that our IoT business, the way we defined it, much narrower definition of IoT for applications that are really smart and connected, is growing 35% a year. So that's doing very well. But if you take a broader definition of IoT like include all the embedded business and all that, you could almost call 100% of Microchip's business as IoT, which really would not be helpful. So that's really what I have to say there."

But we do business worldwide in U.S. dollars, so 99% plus of our business will be in U.S. dollars. So we don't take a hit on our receivables that way, and when the currencies become weak overseas, it doesn't change our revenue right away because our prices are in dollars. But then it makes the products more expensive for our customers. So as you're renegotiating the price, the next bid comes in, next order comes in, you're negotiating and then you will see some impact. But doing it in dollars gives us more control, allows us to manage it, split it with the customer or do whatever, but really allows us to manage it rather than have an automatic [ph] full FX impact to drop down. So I think the way we do it is probably better and has a delayed effect. It also impacts the business of our customers. If a business of our customers includes lots of products from overseas, which in most cases it does, then their end product becomes more expensive and they're having more trouble in terms of ramping their own products. So those results are real. Some are first tier, some are second tier, some are even third tier and it's very hard to figure this out with 90,000 customers worldwide doing business in 100 countries.

So our microcontroller and analog business is both very well funded and relatively independently. We're not driving to a model that 3 years out, exclusion of a business will be this division or that division. They're all well funded and it depends on basically achieving product success and marketplace penetration and they meet in manufacturing and they meet at the customer base and they meet in application. Wherein the same application, we got lots of microcontroller as well as analog products going into a single board. So there is a lot of synergy that way. But in terms of making investments, there's not a competition because we can really take care of both. So it will largely depend on where we have larger success. Analog has been growing faster somewhat because that's where we have done some of the acquisitions. Microcontroller acquisitions are a bit more difficult to do because everybody has a different architecture and you got different issues in trying to get synergy in microcontroller. So we had been able to acquire capability in analog both organically and through acquisitions, and it has been a smaller business compared to the microcontrollers. Microcontroller is a $1.5 billion business and analog is about 1/3 of that, $0.5 billion. So it's been growing faster. But it's not something that we are -- if microcontroller can grow faster with IoT with other applications, 32-bit is going very fast, 16-bit is going very fast, 8-bit did a record, but it does have a $1.5 billion gorilla that has to move. And we are #3rd in the overall microcontroller market, third or fourth depending on which year you take, versus in analog, we are much lower.

Number one, we don't take it as a revenue, so it doesn't really matter as much. But if the distribution inventory becomes too high and then they correct it, we can have a downstream effect than if we have to lower our own inventory. Our own inventory is in the lower side and we like it higher. The distribution inventory is in the middle. So when you combine those 2 inventories in that high, if anything, they're in the low side despite the weakness, despite the guidance. So based on current numbers, our inventory is still really on the south or the middle. So I don't think the inventory is a problem. We're working very hard in our factories to make more product for our customers and have expedites and challenges and others with the mix being very complex, having closed down Supertex fab, accommodating all those products in our fab. It's manufacturing is challenging and inventory -- high inventory is not an issue right now."

But our obvious go-to market is doing as much as what's on the board that constitutes both the smart side of the equation as well as the connectivity side of the equation. And your question on security is a very good one as well. So we know it's a key part of many, many of these applications. We enable that security, in some cases, through hardware that's built into our products in combination with software that we make available as well. And I think there's a lot more coming in front of us from the industry at large on how to ensure that as IoT fills out the range of applications, the security part of it continues to be addressed sufficiently.

In addition to Steve Sanghi, Microchip's President and CEO, Ganesh Moorthy, Microchip's COO, is also participating in this call.
I will comment on our fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2015 financial performance, and Steve and Ganesh will then give their comments on the results and discuss the current business environment as well as our guidance. We will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions. I want to remind you that we are including information in our press release and this conference call on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.microchip.com, which we believe you will find useful when comparing GAAP and non-GAAP results.
I will now go through some of our operating results including net sales, gross margin and operating expenses. I will be referring to these results on a non-GAAP basis prior to the effects of our acquisition activities and share-based compensation.
Non-GAAP net sales in the March quarter were a record $547.2 million and were modestly above the midpoint of our guidance, which was $546.6 million, and were up 10.9% from the March 2014 quarter. Revenue by product line in the March quarter was $353.6 million for microcontrollers, $127.6 million for analog, $33.2 million for memory, $23.6 million for licensing and $9.2 million of other. Revenue by geography was $106.2 million in the Americas, a record $126 million in Europe and $314.9 million in Asia. I remind you that we recognize revenue based on where we ship our products to, which tends to skew some of the revenue towards Asia where a lot of contract manufacturing takes place.
On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were at the midpoint of our guidance at 58.3% in the March quarter. Non-GAAP operating expenses were 25.9% of sales, well below the bottom end of our guidance range. Non-GAAP operating income was 32.4% of sales and net income was $148.8 million. This resulted in record earnings of $0.68 per diluted share, which was at the high end of our guidance.
For fiscal 2015, on a non-GAAP basis, net sales were a record $2.161 billion and up 11.9% year-over-year. Gross margins were 58.8%, operating expenses were 26.4% of sales and operating income was 32.4% of sales. Net income was a record $593.9 million or $2.66 per diluted share.
GAAP net sales in the March quarter were $543.2 million, and as originally guided, were $4 million lower than non-GAAP net sales due to the contractual relationship change we made with the ISSC distribution network to move them to a sell-through revenue recognition model in the December quarter. The revenue impact from this change was fully recognized as of the end of March and will not create a GAAP to non-GAAP revenue difference in future quarters.
On a GAAP basis, gross margins including share based compensation and acquisition-related expenses were 57.7% in the March quarter. GAAP gross margins included the impact of $2 million of share-based compensation, $1.8 million of gross profit on the ISSC revenue recognition change previously mentioned and $1.5 million in manufacturing shutdown costs associated with the Supertex wafer fab in San Jose.
Total operating expenses were $203.3 million or 37.4% of sales and include acquisition intangible amortization of $47.1 million, share-based compensation of $13.2 million, $0.7 million of acquisition-related expenses and special charges of $0.8 million. GAAP other expense includes a $50.6 million loss on the retirements of 50% of our 2,037 convertible bonds and an $18.5 million gain on the sale of a portion of investments that Microchip acquired as part of the SST acquisition back in 2010. 
GAAP net income was $99.4 million or $0.45 per diluted share. GAAP net income includes nonrecurring favorable tax events of $26.7 million, which were primarily driven by the closure of a tax audit and the expiration of the statute of limitations for certain previously established tax reserves.
For fiscal year 2015, GAAP net sales were a record $2.147 billion. Gross margins were 57.3%, operating expenses were 37.4% of sales and operating income was 19.8% of sales. Net income was $369 million or $1.65 per diluted share.
In the March quarter, the non-GAAP tax rate was 11.4%. The GAAP tax benefit rate was 58.9%. The GAAP tax rate was favorably impacted by the $26.7 million of nonrecurring tax events that I mentioned before and the tax impact of certain of the one-time events in the quarter. Our tax rate is impacted by the mix of geographical profits, withholding taxes associated with our licensing business and the tax effect of various nonrecurring items. Excluding any nonrecurring events, we expect our longer-term forward-looking non-GAAP effective tax rate to be about 10.75% to 11.25%.
To summarize the after-tax impact that the non-GAAP adjustments had on Microchip's earnings per share in the March quarter, acquisition-related items were about $0.217, share-based compensation was about $0.052, nonrecurring favorable tax events were about $0.121, a favorable difference on the sale of a portion of investments acquired in the SST acquisition was about $0.084, the loss on the retirement of our 50% of our 2,037 convertible bonds was about $0.144, the difference in the GAAP and non-GAAP noncontrolling interest in ISSC was a favorable of about $0.05 and noncash interest expense was about $0.019.
The dividend declared today of $35.75 per share will be paid on June 4, 2015, to shareholders of record on May 21, 2015. The cash payment associated with this dividend will be approximately $72.4 million. This quarter's dividend will be our 51st consecutive quarter of making a dividend payment. We have never made reductions in our dividend and in fact, this quarter's increase marks the 45th occasion we have increased the dividend payment and our cumulative dividends paid amount to over $2.5 billion. This program continues to be an important component of how we return value to our shareholders.
During the time period that Microchip has paid dividends, we have also purchased back $1.4 billion of our stock, including the stock that we bought back with the issuance of our convertible debenture back in 2008. Our cash return to shareholders since the inception of our dividend program is about [ph] $3.9 billion.
Moving on to the balance sheet. Consolidated inventory at March 31, 2015, was $279.5 million or 111 days, flat to the levels at the end of the December quarter. Inventory at our distributors increased by 1 day in the March quarter and are at 37 days. I want to remind you that our distribution revenues throughout the world is recognized on a sell-through basis. We intend to grow the days of inventory on our balance sheet in the June quarter to support our business growth and customer service levels.
The cash generation in the March quarter, excluding the purchase of additional shares of ISSC, our dividend payment, changes in cash from the issuance and retirement of our convertible debentures and changes in borrowing levels under revolving line of credit was $155.5 million. As of March 31, the consolidated cash and total investment position was $2.34 billion, and our borrowings under our revolving line of credit were $462 million. Excluding dividend payments and our acquisition activities, we expect our total cash and investment position to grow by approximately $160 million to $180 million in the June quarter.
Capital spending was approximately $29.4 million for the March quarter and $149.5 million for fiscal year 2015. We expect about $40 million in capital spending in the June quarter and overall capital expenditures for fiscal year 2016 to be about $160 million as we are adding capital to support the growth of our production capabilities for our fast-growing new products and technologies and to bring in-house more of the assembly and test operations that we are currently outsourcing. Depreciation expense in the March quarter was $25 million.
I will now ask Ganesh to give his comments on the performance of the business in the March quarter. Ganesh?"

For fiscal ye",1106,"Thank you, Eric, and good afternoon, everyone. Let's take a closer look at the performance of each of our product lines, starting with microcontrollers.
Our microcontroller revenue was up 8.4% in the March quarter from the year-ago quarter. For fiscal year 2015, our microcontroller business was up 11.4% over fiscal year 2014, crossing the $1.4 billion mark for the first time and setting an all-time record. Also for fiscal year 2015, each of our 3 microcontroller segments, 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit, set revenue records. Microcontrollers represented 64.6% of Microchip's overall revenue in the March quarter. As we mentioned in our January conference call, for competitive reasons, we will only be providing overall microcontroller revenue and growth rates and not break out by segment, consistent with the practice of most of our competitors.
Gartner Dataquest just released their microcontroller market share report for 2014. We are pleased to report that Microchip has regained the #1 position for 8-bit microcontrollers.
Four years ago, it took the merger of 3 Japanese semiconductor giants, NEC, Hitachi and Mitsubishi, in the form of Renesas to knock us off the #1 spot for 8-bit microcontrollers. We assured you at that time that we will work relentlessly to gain market share and to wrest back the #1 spot in the coming years. Post their merger, Renesas' 8-bit microcontroller business in 2010 used to be 41% larger than ours. In every year since 2010, we have closed the gap versus Renesas, and in 2014, we wrested back the leadership position and finished 10.5% larger than Renesas.
In the 16-bit microcontroller market, we were again the fastest-growing 16-bit microcontroller supplier among the top 10 suppliers in 2014, growing at over 2x the rate of any of the other top 10 suppliers. While our substantially faster growth rate closed the gap versus higher-rank suppliers, we remained in the #5 spot in 2014 and expect to continue to gain share and move further up the rankings in the coming years. 
In the 32-bit microcontroller market, we moved up to the #9 spot in 2014 from the #11 spot in 2013, continuing our relentless climb up the rankings since we entered this market a few years ago. Now Gartner Dataquest's report is a backward-looking indicator where we are performing very well.
Now to look at a forward-looking indicator. In April also, UBM Tech, which is the parent company of EE Times, released the results of their annual Embedded Market Study. Once again, Microchip was rated by the embedded system design engineers as their #1 choice for new designs using 8-bit and 16-bit microcontrollers in the performance range that we compete in, and we were the #2 choice among 32-bit microcontrollers. We are humbled and gratified by the overwhelming preference by engineers for our solutions and see this as a positive sign of future growth.
Our overall microcontroller results as well as each of our 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit results are clearly outperforming the market, with year-over-year growth rates well above the market and what we've seen reported by our competitors in their results. These outstanding results in a very competitive market are a tribute to the tireless effort by the worldwide Microchip team. We have gained significant market share and have the new product momentum and customer engagement to continue to gain even more share as we build the best-performing microcontroller franchise in the industry.
Analog products. Our analog business was up 18.7% from the year-ago quarter. In fiscal year 2015, our analog business was up 17.6% over fiscal year 2014, crossing the $0.5 billion mark for the first time and also setting an all-time record. This business continues to have strong design win momentum in a broad range of applications and represented 23.3% of Microchip's overall revenue in the March quarter. We continue to develop and introduce a wide range of innovative and proprietary new products to fuel the future growth of our analog business.
Now moving to the memory business, which is comprised of our Serial E-squared memory products as well as our SuperFlash Memory products. This business was up 0.2% versus the year-ago quarter. In fiscal year 2015, our memory business was down 1.8% versus fiscal year 2014. We continue to run our memory business in a disciplined fashion that maintains consistently high profitability, enables our licensing business and serves our microcontroller customers to complete their solutions. Our memory business represented 6.1% of Microchip's overall revenue in the March quarter.
I have one more topic to cover today. Given the importance of the Internet of Things market, some of our investors and analysts have asked for more color about the size of our IoT business. First, there is no consistent way in which semiconductor companies report their IoT revenue. As a result, there are some who report their entire embedded market revenue or the revenue of business units focused on the embedded market as IoT revenue.
By that measure, pretty close to 100% of Microchip's $2.2 billion of revenue could be classified as IoT revenue, but it would not be as meaningful to investors in terms of its potential as a future growth driver. We have a stricter definition for our IoT revenue in that we only count end applications or things that are both smart and connected reflecting what the promise of IoT really is, which is the possibilities that open up by adding connectivity to smart systems.
Examples of smart and connected applications for Microchip are things like alarm systems, access control systems, thermostats, smoke detectors, exercise machines, asset tracking, wireless audio docks, set-top boxes and other consumer electronic systems, hospital personnel locators, patient monitors, automotive telematics, building automation, vending machines, Smart Grid monitoring, wired and wireless networking systems, GPS navigation tracking systems and many, many others that are too numerous to list. More applications will continue to be added as they get connected. I'm sure you will agree that applications like the examples we just provided, which are a combination of smart and connected applications, are more real IoT applications and the products going into them would better characterize our IoT revenue. Microchip solutions that enable the IoT market include low-power microcontrollers, analog, sensors, memories, wired and wireless communication products.
So using our stricter definition for IoT revenue, Microchip estimates that our current annual IoT revenue is approximately $275 million and has been growing at a greater than 35% compounded annual growth rate over the last 3 years. This revenue is already included in the public reporting segments for Microchip.
Let me now pass it to Steve for some general comments about our business as well as our guidance going forward. Steve?"

Today, I would first like to reflect on the results of the fiscal fourth quarter of 2015 and fiscal year 2015 then I will provide guidance for the fiscal first quarter of 2016.We were very pleased with our execution in the March quart",555,"Thank you, Ganesh. Today, I would first like to reflect on the results of the fiscal fourth quarter of 2015 and fiscal year 2015 then I will provide guidance for the fiscal first quarter of 2016.
We were very pleased with our execution in the March quarter. We achieved record net sales in the March quarter and slightly ahead of the midpoint of our guidance. Our non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.68 was a record and at the high end of our revised estimates. Recall that we had revised our earnings per share higher after taking into account the accretive effect of our financing transactions.
Looking at the fiscal year 2015. It was another record year for revenue and the first fiscal year to cross the $2 billion revenue mark. For fiscal year 2015, revenue came in at a record $2.16 billion, up 11.9% from fiscal year 2014. All of our strategic product lines of microcontroller and analog posted record revenue performance for fiscal year 2015. The March quarter was also our 98th consecutive profitable quarter. I want to thank all the employees of Microchip for their contribution in this remarkable achievement of 98 consecutive profitable quarters. We're also planning a celebration for our 100th consecutive profitable quarter, which is 2 quarters away.
In the last 2 conference call, we told you that we will be shutting down production in Supertex, San Jose fab as well as test facility in Hong Kong. The San Jose fab is now closed with the last wafer outs occurring in early April. The fab building is undergoing restoration to be returned back to the landlord. The transfer of the Hong Kong test operations to our high-volume Thailand facility was also completed in February.
Now I will provide guidance for the fiscal first quarter of 2016. As we look at the business environment, it is clear that many of our industry peers are seeing weakness across various end markets including PC and industrial, slowing growth in China market and currency impacts from the strong dollar. Taking all this into account, we believe that our net sales in the June quarter will be between $547 million and $564 million. On a non-GAAP basis, we expect our gross margin to be between 58.3% and 58.5% of sales. We expect operating expenses to be between 25.75% and 26% of sales. We expect operating profit to be between 32.3% and 32.75% of sales, and we expect non-GAAP EPS to be between $0.69 and $0.73 per share.
Finally, I want to remind you that given all the complications of accounting for the acquisitions including amortization of intangibles, restructuring charges and inventory write-off on acquisitions, Microchip will continue to provide guidance and track its results on non-GAAP basis. We believe that non-GAAP results provide more meaningful comparison to prior quarters, and we request that the analysts continue to report the non-GAAP estimates to first call.
Before we open it up for questions, I want to remind everybody, in case somebody joined the conference late, that in this conference call, we'll be only taking questions regarding our earnings and we'll have a second conference call starting at 5:45 p.m. New York time at which we will talk about the Micrel acquisition and take questions related to that acquisition.
With this, operator, will you please poll for questions?"

I'm not going to share with you anymore. Basically, I think as far as the seasonality is concerned, a company with a constant stream of acquisitions that we have done, we believe seasonality often is miscalculated by the investors depending on how many years back you go. We have had Supertex acquisition, which closed in April last year; ISSC acquisition last year. If you go 5 years back, we closed SST acquisition also in April. So when you look at the June quarter numbers, sometimes you do with or without acquisitions and many times, the breakdown of those numbers is not available 2 or 3 years out. So I believe that seasonality changes a lot with these acquisitions. And I think -- but the largest reason is you describe yourself, which is industry conditions are soft just like announced by other peers. That's what we are seeing and beyond that, I'm not going to comment on cycle or anything else for the future."

In many time at the customers, we work with multiple divisions. For some of them the business is PCs. For some others the business is industrial. For some other it could be called consumer. So we don't really have any end market flavor. But Ganesh, in his commentary, described that our IoT business, the way we defined it, much narrower definition of IoT for applications that are really smart and connected, is growing 35% a year. So that's doing very well. But if you take a broader definition of IoT like include all the embedded business and all that, you could almost call 100% of Microchip's business as IoT, which really would not be helpful. So that's really what I have to say there."

But we do business worldwide in U.S. dollars, so 99% plus of our business will be in U.S. dollars. So we don't take a hit on our receivables that way, and when the currencies become weak overseas, it doesn't change our revenue right away because our prices are in dollars. But then it makes the products more expensive for our customers. So as you're renegotiating the price, the next bid comes in, next order comes in, you're negotiating and then you will see some impact. But doing it in dollars gives us more control, allows us to manage it, split it with the customer or do whatever, but really allows us to manage it rather than have an automatic [ph] full FX impact to drop down. So I think the way we do it is probably better and has a delayed effect. It also impacts the business of our customers. If a business of our customers includes lots of products from overseas, which in most cases it does, then their end product becomes more expensive and they're having more trouble in terms of ramping their own products. So those results are real. Some are first tier, some are second tier, some are even third tier and it's very hard to figure this out with 90,000 customers worldwide doing business in 100 countries. I don't think we can decipher that."

So our microcontroller and analog business is both very well funded and relatively independently. We're not driving to a model that 3 years out, exclusion of a business will be this division or that division. They're all well funded and it depends on basically achieving product success and marketplace penetration and they meet in manufacturing and they meet at the customer base and they meet in application. Wherein the same application, we got lots of microcontroller as well as analog products going into a single board. So there is a lot of synergy that way. But in terms of making investments, there's not a competition because we can really take care of both. So it will largely depend on where we have larger success. Analog has been growing faster somewhat because that's where we have done some of the acquisitions. Microcontroller acquisitions are a bit more difficult to do because everybody has a different architecture and you got different issues in trying to get synergy in microcontroller. So we had been able to acquire capability in analog both organically and through acquisitions, and it has been a smaller business compared to the microcontrollers. Microcontroller is a $1.5 billion business and analog is about 1/3 of that, $0.5 billion. So it's been growing faster. But it's not something that we are -- if microcontroller can grow faster with IoT with other applications, 32-bit is going very fast, 16-bit is going very fast, 8-bit did a record, but it does have a $1.5 billion gorilla that has to move. And we are #3rd in the overall microcontroller market, third or fourth depending on which year you take, versus in analog, we are much lower. There are much, much larger analog companies that we can take share from for long time."

But if the distribution inventory becomes too high and then they correct it, we can have a downstream effect than if we have to lower our own inventory. Our own inventory is in the lower side and we like it higher. The distribution inventory is in the middle. So when you combine those 2 inventories in that high, if anything, they're in the low side despite the weakness, despite the guidance. So based on current numbers, our inventory is still really on the south or the middle. So I don't think the inventory is a problem. We're working very hard in our factories to make more product for our customers and have expedites and challenges and others with the mix being very complex, having closed down Supertex fab, accommodating all those products in our fab. It's manufacturing is challenging and inventory -- high inventory is not an issue right now."

But our obvious go-to market is doing as much as what's on the board that constitutes both the smart side of the equation as well as the connectivity side of the equation. And your question on security is a very good one as well. So we know it's a key part of many, many of these applications. We enable that security, in some cases, through hardware that's built into our products in combination with software that we make available as well. And I think there's a lot more coming in front of us from the industry at large on how to ensure that as IoT fills out the range of applications, the security part of it continues to be addressed sufficiently.

In addition to Steve Sanghi, Microchip's President and CEO, Ganesh Moorthy, Microchip's COO, is also participating in this call.
I will comment on our fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2015 financial performance, and Steve and Ganesh will then give their comments on the results and discuss the current business environment as well as our guidance. We will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions. I want to remind you that we are including information in our press release and this conference call on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.microchip.com, which we believe you will find useful when comparing GAAP and non-GAAP results.
I will now go through some of our operating results including net sales, gross margin and operating expenses. I will be referring to these results on a non-GAAP basis prior to the effects of our acquisition activities and share-based compensation.
Non-GAAP net sales in the March quarter were a record $547.2 million and were modestly above the midpoint of our guidance, which was $546.6 million, and were up 10.9% from the March 2014 quarter. Revenue by product line in the March quarter was $353.6 million for microcontrollers, $127.6 million for analog, $33.2 million for memory, $23.6 million for licensing and $9.2 million of other. Revenue by geography was $106.2 million in the Americas, a record $126 million in Europe and $314.9 million in Asia. I remind you that we recognize revenue based on where we ship our products to, which tends to skew some of the revenue towards Asia where a lot of contract manufacturing takes place.
On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were at the midpoint of our guidance at 58.3% in the March quarter. Non-GAAP operating expenses were 25.9% of sales, well below the bottom end of our guidance range. Non-GAAP operating income was 32.4% of sales and net income was $148.8 million. This resulted in record earnings of $0.68 per diluted share, which was at the high end of our guidance.
For fiscal 2015, on a non-GAAP basis, net sales were a record $2.161 billion and up 11.9% year-over-year. Gross margins were 58.8%, operating expenses were 26.4% of sales and operating income was 32.4% of sales. Net income was a record $593.9 million or $2.66 per diluted share.
GAAP net sales in the March quarter were $543.2 million, and as originally guided, were $4 million lower than non-GAAP net sales due to the contractual relationship change we made with the ISSC distribution network to move them to a sell-through revenue recognition model in the December quarter. The revenue impact from this change was fully recognized as of the end of March and will not create a GAAP to non-GAAP revenue difference in future quarters.
On a GAAP basis, gross margins including share based compensation and acquisition-related expenses were 57.7% in the March quarter. GAAP gross margins included the impact of $2 million of share-based compensation, $1.8 million of gross profit on the ISSC revenue recognition change previously mentioned and $1.5 million in manufacturing shutdown costs associated with the Supertex wafer fab in San Jose.
Total operating expenses were $203.3 million or 37.4% of sales and include acquisition intangible amortization of $47.1 million, share-based compensation of $13.2 million, $0.7 million of acquisition-related expenses and special charges of $0.8 million. GAAP other expense includes a $50.6 million loss on the retirements of 50% of our 2,037 convertible bonds and an $18.5 million gain on the sale of a portion of investments that Microchip acquired as part of the SST acquisition back in 2010. 
GAAP net income was $99.4 million or $0.45 per diluted share. GAAP net income includes nonrecurring favorable tax events of $26.7 million, which were primarily driven by the closure of a tax audit and the expiration of the statute of limitations for certain previously established tax reserves.
For fiscal year 2015, GAAP net sales were a record $2.147 billion. Gross margins were 57.3%, operating expenses were 37.4% of sales and operating income was 19.8% of sales. Net income was $369 million or $1.65 per diluted share.
In the March quarter, the non-GAAP tax rate was 11.4%. The GAAP tax benefit rate was 58.9%. The GAAP tax rate was favorably impacted by the $26.7 million of nonrecurring tax events that I mentioned before and the tax impact of certain of the one-time events in the quarter. Our tax rate is impacted by the mix of geographical profits, withholding taxes associated with our licensing business and the tax effect of various nonrecurring items. Excluding any nonrecurring events, we expect our longer-term forward-looking non-GAAP effective tax rate to be about 10.75% to 11.25%.
To summarize the after-tax impact that the non-GAAP adjustments had on Microchip's earnings per share in the March quarter, acquisition-related items were about $0.217, share-based compensation was about $0.052, nonrecurring favorable tax events were about $0.121, a favorable difference on the sale of a portion of investments acquired in the SST acquisition was about $0.084, the loss on the retirement of our 50% of our 2,037 convertible bonds was about $0.144, the difference in the GAAP and non-GAAP noncontrolling interest in ISSC was a favorable of about $0.05 and noncash interest expense was about $0.019.
The dividend declared today of $35.75 per share will be paid on June 4, 2015, to shareholders of record on May 21, 2015. The cash payment associated with this dividend will be approximately $72.4 million. This quarter's dividend will be our 51st consecutive quarter of making a dividend payment. We have never made reductions in our dividend and in fact, this quarter's increase marks the 45th occasion we have increased the dividend payment and our cumulative dividends paid amount to over $2.5 billion. This program continues to be an important component of how we return value to our shareholders.
During the time period that Microchip has paid dividends, we have also purchased back $1.4 billion of our stock, including the stock that we bought back with the issuance of our convertible debenture back in 2008. Our cash return to shareholders since the inception of our dividend program is over $3.9 billion.
Moving on to the balance sheet. Consolidated inventory at March 31, 2015, was $279.5 million or 111 days, flat to the levels at the end of the December quarter. Inventory at our distributors increased by 1 day in the March quarter and are at 37 days. I want to remind you that our distribution revenues throughout the world is recognized on a sell-through basis. We intend to grow the days of inventory on our balance sheet in the June quarter to support our business growth and customer service levels.
The cash generation in the March quarter, excluding the purchase of additional shares of ISSC, our dividend payment, changes in cash from the issuance and retirement of our convertible debentures and changes in borrowing levels under revolving line of credit was $155.5 million. As of March 31, the consolidated cash and total investment position was $2.34 billion, and our borrowings under our revolving line of credit were $462 million. Excluding dividend payments and our acquisition activities, we expect our total cash and investment position to grow by approximately $160 million to $180 million in the June quarter.
Capital spending was approximately $29.4 million for the March quarter and $149.5 million for fiscal year 2015. We expect about $40 million in capital spending in the June quarter and overall capital expenditures for fiscal year 2016 to be about $160 million as we are adding capital to support the growth of our production capabilities for our fast-growing new products and technologies and to bring in-house more of the assembly and test operations that we are currently outsourcing. Depreciation expense in the March quarter was $25 million.

For fiscal ye",1106,"Thank you, Eric, and good afternoon, everyone. Let's take a closer look at the performance of each of our product lines, starting with microcontrollers.
Our microcontroller revenue was up 8.4% in the March quarter from the year-ago quarter. For fiscal year 2015, our microcontroller business was up 11.4% over fiscal year 2014, crossing the $1.4 billion mark for the first time and setting an all-time record. Also for fiscal year 2015, each of our 3 microcontroller segments, 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit, set revenue records. Microcontrollers represented 64.6% of Microchip's overall revenue in the March quarter. As we mentioned in our January conference call, for competitive reasons, we will only be providing overall microcontroller revenue and growth rates and not break out by segment, consistent with the practice of most of our competitors.
Gartner Dataquest just released their microcontroller market share report for 2014. We are pleased to report that Microchip has regained the #1 position for 8-bit microcontrollers.
Four years ago, it took the merger of 3 Japanese semiconductor giants, NEC, Hitachi and Mitsubishi, in the form of Renesas to knock us off the #1 spot for 8-bit microcontrollers. We assured you at that time that we would work relentlessly to gain market share and to wrest back the #1 spot in the coming years. Post their merger, Renesas' 8-bit microcontroller business in 2010 used to be 41% larger than ours. In every year since 2010, we have closed the gap versus Renesas, and in 2014, we wrested back the leadership position and finished 10.5% larger than Renesas.
In the 16-bit microcontroller market, we were again the fastest-growing 16-bit microcontroller supplier among the top 10 suppliers in 2014, growing at over 2x the rate of any of the other top 10 suppliers. While our substantially faster growth rate closed the gap versus higher-rank suppliers, we remained in the #5 spot in 2014 and expect to continue to gain share and move further up the rankings in the coming years. 
In the 32-bit microcontroller market, we moved up to the #9 spot in 2014 from the #11 spot in 2013, continuing our relentless climb up the rankings since we entered this market a few years ago. Now, Gartner Dataquest's report is a backward-looking indicator where we are performing very well.
Now to look at a forward-looking indicator. In April also, UBM Tech, which is the parent company of EE Times, released the results of their annual Embedded Market Study. Once again, Microchip was rated by the embedded system design engineers as their #1 choice for new designs using 8-bit and 16-bit microcontrollers in the performance range that we compete in, and we were the #2 choice among 32-bit microcontrollers. We are humbled and gratified by the overwhelming preference by engineers for our solutions and see this as a positive sign of future growth.
Our overall microcontroller results as well as each of our 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit results are clearly outperforming the market, with year-over-year growth rates well above the market and what we've seen reported by our competitors in their results. These outstanding results in a very competitive market are a tribute to the tireless effort by the worldwide Microchip team. We have gained significant market share and have the new product momentum and customer engagement to continue to gain even more share as we build the best-performing microcontroller franchise in the industry.
Analog products. Our analog business was up 18.7% from the year-ago quarter. In fiscal year 2015, our analog business was up 17.6% over fiscal year 2014, crossing the $0.5 billion mark for the first time and also setting an all-time record. This business continues to have strong design win momentum in a broad range of applications and represented 23.3% of Microchip's overall revenue in the March quarter. We continue to develop and introduce a wide range of innovative and proprietary new products to fuel the future growth of our analog business.
Now moving to the memory business, which is comprised of our Serial E-squared memory products as well as our SuperFlash Memory products. This business was up 0.2% versus the year-ago quarter. In fiscal year 2015, our memory business was down 1.8% versus fiscal year 2014. We continue to run our memory business in a disciplined fashion that maintains consistently high profitability, enables our licensing business and serves our microcontroller customers to complete their solutions. Our memory business represented 6.1% of Microchip's overall revenue in the March quarter.
I have one more topic to cover today. Given the importance of the Internet of Things market, some of our investors and analysts have asked for more color about the size of our IoT business. First, there is no consistent way in which semiconductor companies report their IoT revenue. As a result, there are some who report their entire embedded market revenue or the revenue of business units focused on the embedded market as IoT revenue.
By that measure, pretty close to 100% of Microchip's $2.2 billion of revenue could be classified as IoT revenue, but it would not be as meaningful to investors in terms of its potential as a future growth driver. We have a stricter definition for our IoT revenue in that we only count end applications or things that are both smart and connected reflecting what the promise of IoT really is, which is the possibilities that open up by adding connectivity to smart systems.
Examples of smart and connected applications for Microchip are things like alarm systems, access control systems, thermostats, smoke detectors, exercise machines, asset tracking, wireless audio docks, set-top boxes and other consumer electronic systems, hospital personnel locators, patient monitors, automotive telematics, building automation, vending machines, Smart Grid monitoring, wired and wireless networking systems, GPS navigation tracking systems and many, many others that are too numerous to list. More applications will continue to be added as they get connected. I'm sure you will agree that applications like the examples we just provided, which are a combination of smart and connected applications, are more real IoT applications and the products going into them would better characterize our IoT revenue. Microchip solutions that enable the IoT market include low-power microcontrollers, analog, sensors, memories, wired and wireless communication products.
So using our stricter definition for IoT revenue, Microchip estimates that our current annual IoT revenue is approximately $275 million and has been growing at a greater than 35% compounded annual growth rate over the last 3 years. This revenue is already included in the public reporting segments for Microchip.

Today, I would first like to reflect on the results of the fiscal fourth quarter of 2015 and fiscal year 2015 then I will provide guidance for the fiscal first quarter of 2016.
We were very pleased with our execution in the March quarter. We achieved record net sales in the March quarter and slightly ahead of the midpoint of our guidance. Our non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.68 was a record and at the high end of our revised estimates. Recall that we had revised our earnings per share higher after taking into account the accretive effect of our financing transactions.
Looking at the fiscal year 2015. It was another record year for revenue and the first fiscal year to cross the $2 billion revenue mark. For fiscal year 2015, revenue came in at a record $2.16 billion, up 11.9% from fiscal year 2014. All of our strategic product lines of microcontroller and analog posted record revenue performance for fiscal year 2015. The March quarter was also our 98th consecutive profitable quarter. I want to thank all the employees of Microchip for their contribution in this remarkable achievement of 98 consecutive profitable quarters. We're also planning a celebration for our 100th consecutive profitable quarter, which is 2 quarters away.
In the last 2 conference call, we told you that we will be shutting down production in Supertex, San Jose fab as well as test facility in Hong Kong. The San Jose fab is now closed with the last wafer outs occurring in early April. The fab building is undergoing restoration to be returned back to the landlord. The transfer of the Hong Kong test operations to our high-volume Thailand facility was also completed in February.
Now I will provide guidance for the fiscal first quarter of 2016. As we look at the business environment, it is clear that many of our industry peers are seeing weakness across various end markets including PC and industrial, slowing growth in China market and currency impacts from the strong dollar. Taking all this into account, we believe that our net sales in the June quarter will be between $547 million and $564 million. On a non-GAAP basis, we expect our gross margin to be between 58.3% and 58.5% of sales. We expect operating expenses to be between 25.75% and 26% of sales. We expect operating profit to be between 32.3% and 32.75% of sales, and we expect non-GAAP EPS to be between $0.69 and $0.73 per share.
Finally, I want to remind you that given all the complications of accounting for the acquisitions including amortization of intangibles, restructuring charges and inventory write-up on acquisitions, Microchip will continue to provide guidance and track its results on non-GAAP basis. We believe that non-GAAP results provide more meaningful comparison to prior quarters, and we request that the analysts continue to report the non-GAAP estimates to first call.
Before we open it up for questions, I want to remind everybody, in case somebody joined the conference late, that in this conference call, we'll be only taking questions regarding our earnings and we'll have a second conference call starting at 5:45 p.m. New York time, at which we will talk about the Micrel acquisition and take questions related to that acquisition.
With this, operator, will you please poll for questions?"

I'm not going to share with you anymore. Basically, I think as far as the seasonality is concerned, a company with a constant stream of acquisitions that we have done, we believe seasonality often is miscalculated by the investors depending on how many years back you go. We have had Supertex acquisition, which closed in April last year; ISSC acquisition last year. If you go 5 years back, we closed SST acquisition also in April. So when you look at the June quarter numbers, sometimes you do with or without acquisitions and many times, the breakdown of those numbers is not available 2 or 3 years out. So I believe that seasonality changes a lot with these acquisitions. And I think -- but the largest reason is you describe yourself, which is industry conditions are soft, just like announced by other peers. That's what we are seeing and beyond that I'm not going to comment on cycle or anything else for the future."

We serve 90,000-plus customers and a vast majority of them through distribution and many time, at the customers, we work with multiple divisions. For some of them the business is PCs. For some others the business is industrial. For some other it could be called consumer. So we don't really have any end market flavor. But Ganesh, in his commentary, described that our IoT business, the way we defined it, much narrower definition of IoT for applications that are really smart and connected, is growing 35% a year. So that's doing very well. But if you take a broader definition of IoT like include all the embedded business and all that, you could almost call 100% of Microchip's business as IoT, which really would not be helpful. So that's really what I have to say there."

But we do business worldwide in U.S. dollars, so 99% plus of our business will be in U.S. dollars. So we don't take a hit on our receivables that way, and when the currencies become weak overseas, it doesn't change our revenue right away because our prices are in dollars. But then it makes the products more expensive for our customers. So as you're renegotiating the price, the next bid comes in, next order comes in, you're negotiating and then you will see some impact. But doing it in dollars gives us more control, allows us to manage it, split it with the customer or do whatever, but really allows us to manage it rather than have an automatic [ph] full FX impact to drop down. So I think the way we do it is probably better and has a delayed effect. It also impacts the business of our customers. If a business of our customers includes lots of products from overseas, which in most cases it does, then their end product becomes more expensive and they're having more trouble in terms of ramping their own products. So those results are real. Some are first tier, some are second tier, some are even third tier and it's very hard to figure this out with 90,000 customers worldwide doing business in 100 countries and I don't think we can decipher that."

So our microcontroller and analog business is both very well funded and relatively independently. We're not driving to a model that 3 years out, exclusion of a business will be this division or that division. They're all well-funded and it depends on basically achieving product success and marketplace penetration and they meet in manufacturing and they meet at the customer base and they meet in application. Wherein the same application, we got lots of microcontroller as well as analog products going into a single board. So there is a lot of synergy that way. But in terms of making investments, there's not a competition because we can really take care of both. So it will largely depend on where we have larger success. Analog has been growing faster somewhat because that's where we have done some of the acquisitions. Microcontroller acquisitions are a bit more difficult to do because everybody has a different architecture and you got different issues in trying to get synergy in microcontroller. So we had been able to acquire capability in analog both organically and through acquisitions, and it has been a smaller business compared to the microcontrollers. Microcontroller is a $1.5 billion business and analog is about 1/3 of that, $0.5 billion. So it's been growing faster. But it's not something that we are -- if microcontroller can grow faster with IoT with other applications, 32-bit is going very fast, 16-bit is going very fast, 8-bit did a record, but it does have a $1.5 billion gorilla that has to move. And we are #3rd in the overall microcontroller market, third or fourth depending on which year you take, versus in analog, we are much lower.

But if the distribution inventory becomes too high and then they correct it, we can have a downstream effect than if we have to lower our own inventory. Our own inventory is in the lower side and we like it higher. The distribution inventory is in the middle. So when you combine those 2 inventories in that high, if anything, they're in the low side despite the weakness, despite the guidance. So based on current numbers, our inventory is still really on the south or the middle. So I don't think the inventory is a problem. We're working very hard in our factories to make more product for our customers and have expedites and challenges and others with the mix being very complex, having closed down Supertex fab, accommodating all those products in our fab.

We enable that security, in some cases, through hardware that's built into our products in combination with software that we make available as well. And I think there's a lot more coming in front of us from the industry at large on how to ensure that as IoT fills out the range of applications, the security part of it continues to be addressed sufficiently.

In addition to Steve Sanghi, Microchip's President and CEO, Ganesh Moorthy, Microchip's COO, is also participating in this call.
I will comment on our fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2015 financial performance, and Steve and Ganesh will then give their comments on the results and discuss the current business environment as well as our guidance. We will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions. I want to remind you that we are including information in our press release and this conference call on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.microchip.com, which we believe you will find useful when comparing GAAP and non-GAAP results.
I will now go through some of our operating results including net sales, gross margin and operating expenses. I will be referring to these results on a non-GAAP basis prior to the effects of our acquisition activities and share-based compensation.
Non-GAAP net sales in the March quarter were a record $547.2 million and were modestly above the midpoint of our guidance, which was $546.6 million, and were up 10.9% from the March 2014 quarter. Revenue by product line in the March quarter was $353.6 million for microcontrollers, $127.6 million for analog, $33.2 million for memory, $23.6 million for licensing and $9.2 million of other. Revenue by geography was $106.2 million in the Americas, a record $126 million in Europe and $314.9 million in Asia. I remind you that we recognize revenue based on where we ship our products to, which tends to skew some of the revenue towards Asia where a lot of contract manufacturing takes place.
On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were at the midpoint of our guidance at 58.3% in the March quarter. Non-GAAP operating expenses were 25.9% of sales, well below the bottom end of our guidance range. Non-GAAP operating income was 32.4% of sales and net income was $148.8 million. This resulted in record earnings of $0.68 per diluted share, which was at the high end of our guidance.
For fiscal 2015, on a non-GAAP basis, net sales were a record $2.161 billion and up 11.9% year-over-year. Gross margins were 58.8%, operating expenses were 26.4% of sales and operating income was 32.4% of sales. Net income was a record $593.9 million or $2.66 per diluted share.
GAAP net sales in the March quarter were $543.2 million, and as originally guided, were $4 million lower than non-GAAP net sales due to the contractual relationship change we made with the ISSC distribution network to move them to a sell-through revenue recognition model in the December quarter. The revenue impact from this change was fully recognized as of the end of March and will not create a GAAP to non-GAAP revenue difference in future quarters.
On a GAAP basis, gross margins including share based compensation and acquisition-related expenses were 57.7% in the March quarter. GAAP gross margins included the impact of $2 million of share-based compensation, $1.8 million of gross profit on the ISSC revenue recognition change previously mentioned and $1.5 million in manufacturing shutdown costs associated with the Supertex wafer fab in San Jose.
Total operating expenses were $203.3 million or 37.4% of sales and include acquisition intangible amortization of $47.1 million, share-based compensation of $13.2 million, $0.7 million of acquisition-related expenses and special charges of $0.8 million. GAAP other expense includes a $50.6 million loss on the retirements of 50% of our 2,037 convertible bonds and an $18.5 million gain on the sale of a portion of investments that Microchip acquired as part of the SST acquisition back in 2010. 
GAAP net income was $99.4 million or $0.45 per diluted share. GAAP net income includes nonrecurring favorable tax events of $26.7 million, which were primarily driven by the closure of a tax audit and the expiration of the statute of limitations for certain previously established tax reserves.
For fiscal year 2015, GAAP net sales were a record $2.147 billion. Gross margins were 57.3%, operating expenses were 37.4% of sales and operating income was 19.8% of sales. Net income was $369 million or $1.65 per diluted share.
In the March quarter, the non-GAAP tax rate was 11.4%. The GAAP tax benefit rate was 58.9%. The GAAP tax rate was favorably impacted by the $26.7 million of nonrecurring tax events that I mentioned before and the tax impact of certain of the one-time events in the quarter. Our tax rate is impacted by the mix of geographical profits, withholding taxes associated with our licensing business and the tax effect of various nonrecurring items. Excluding any nonrecurring events, we expect our longer-term forward-looking non-GAAP effective tax rate to be about 10.75% to 11.25%.
To summarize the after-tax impact that the non-GAAP adjustments had on Microchip's earnings per share in the March quarter, acquisition-related items were about $0.217, share-based compensation was about $0.052, nonrecurring favorable tax events were about $0.121, a favorable difference on the sale of a portion of investments acquired in the SST acquisition was about $0.084, the loss on the retirement of our 50% of our 2,037 convertible bonds was about $0.144, the difference in the GAAP and non-GAAP noncontrolling interest in ISSC was a favorable of about $0.05 and noncash interest expense was about $0.019.
The dividend declared today of $35.75 per share will be paid on June 4, 2015, to shareholders of record on May 21, 2015. The cash payment associated with this dividend will be approximately $72.4 million. This quarter's dividend will be our 51st consecutive quarter of making a dividend payment. We have never made reductions in our dividend and in fact, this quarter's increase marks the 45th occasion we have increased the dividend payment and our cumulative dividends paid amount to over $2.5 billion. This program continues to be an important component of how we return value to our shareholders.
During the time period that Microchip has paid dividends, we have also purchased back $1.4 billion of our stock, including the stock that we bought back with the issuance of our convertible debenture back in 2008. Our cash return to shareholders since the inception of our dividend program is over $3.9 billion.
Moving on to the balance sheet. Consolidated inventory at March 31, 2015, was $279.5 million or 111 days, flat to the levels at the end of the December quarter. Inventory at our distributors increased by 1 day in the March quarter and are at 37 days. I want to remind you that our distribution revenues throughout the world is recognized on a sell-through basis. We intend to grow the days of inventory on our balance sheet in the June quarter to support our business growth and customer service levels.
The cash generation in the March quarter, excluding the purchase of additional shares of ISSC, our dividend payment, changes in cash from the issuance and retirement of our convertible debentures and changes in borrowing levels under revolving line of credit was $155.5 million. As of March 31, the consolidated cash and total investment position was $2.34 billion, and our borrowings under our revolving line of credit were $462 million. Excluding dividend payments and our acquisition activities, we expect our total cash and investment position to grow by approximately $160 million to $180 million in the June quarter.
Capital spending was approximately $29.4 million for the March quarter and $149.5 million for fiscal year 2015. We expect about $40 million in capital spending in the June quarter and overall capital expenditures for fiscal year 2016 to be about $160 million as we are adding capital to support the growth of our production capabilities for our fast-growing new products and technologies and to bring in-house more of the assembly and test operations that we are currently outsourcing. Depreciation expense in the March quarter was $25 million.

For fiscal ye",1106,"Thank you, Eric, and good afternoon, everyone. Let's take a closer look at the performance of each of our product lines, starting with microcontrollers.
Our microcontroller revenue was up 8.4% in the March quarter from the year-ago quarter. For fiscal year 2015, our microcontroller business was up 11.4% over fiscal year 2014, crossing the $1.4 billion mark for the first time and setting an all-time record. Also for fiscal year 2015, each of our 3 microcontroller segments, 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit, set revenue records. Microcontrollers represented 64.6% of Microchip's overall revenue in the March quarter. As we mentioned in our January conference call, for competitive reasons, we will only be providing overall microcontroller revenue and growth rates and not break out by segment, consistent with the practice of most of our competitors.
Gartner Dataquest just released their microcontroller market share report for 2014. We are pleased to report that Microchip has regained the #1 position for 8-bit microcontrollers.
Four years ago, it took the merger of 3 Japanese semiconductor giants, NEC, Hitachi and Mitsubishi, in the form of Renesas to knock us off the #1 spot for 8-bit microcontrollers. We assured you at that time that we would work relentlessly to gain market share and to wrest back the #1 spot in the coming years. Post their merger, Renesas' 8-bit microcontroller business in 2010 used to be 41% larger than ours. In every year since 2010, we have closed the gap versus Renesas, and in 2014, we wrested back the leadership position and finished 10.5% larger than Renesas.
In the 16-bit microcontroller market, we were again the fastest-growing 16-bit microcontroller supplier among the top 10 suppliers in 2014, growing at over 2x the rate of any of the other top 10 suppliers. While our substantially faster growth rate closed the gap versus higher-rank suppliers, we remained in the #5 spot in 2014 and expect to continue to gain share and move further up the rankings in the coming years. 
In the 32-bit microcontroller market, we moved up to the #9 spot in 2014 from the #11 spot in 2013, continuing our relentless climb up the rankings since we entered this market a few years ago. Now, Gartner Dataquest's report is a backward-looking indicator where we are performing very well.
Now to look at a forward-looking indicator. In April also, UBM Tech, which is the parent company of EE Times, released the results of their annual Embedded Market Study. Once again, Microchip was rated by the embedded system design engineers as their #1 choice for new designs using 8-bit and 16-bit microcontrollers in the performance range that we compete in, and we were the #2 choice among 32-bit microcontrollers. We are humbled and gratified by the overwhelming preference by engineers for our solutions and see this as a positive sign of future growth.
Our overall microcontroller results as well as each of our 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit results are clearly outperforming the market, with year-over-year growth rates well above the market and what we've seen reported by our competitors in their results. These outstanding results in a very competitive market are a tribute to the tireless effort by the worldwide Microchip team. We have gained significant market share and have the new product momentum and customer engagement to continue to gain even more share as we build the best-performing microcontroller franchise in the industry.
Analog products. Our analog business was up 18.7% from the year-ago quarter. In fiscal year 2015, our analog business was up 17.6% over fiscal year 2014, crossing the $0.5 billion mark for the first time and also setting an all-time record. This business continues to have strong design win momentum in a broad range of applications and represented 23.3% of Microchip's overall revenue in the March quarter. We continue to develop and introduce a wide range of innovative and proprietary new products to fuel the future growth of our analog business.
Now moving to the memory business, which is comprised of our Serial E-squared memory products as well as our SuperFlash Memory products. This business was up 0.2% versus the year-ago quarter. In fiscal year 2015, our memory business was down 1.8% versus fiscal year 2014. We continue to run our memory business in a disciplined fashion that maintains consistently high profitability, enables our licensing business and serves our microcontroller customers to complete their solutions. Our memory business represented 6.1% of Microchip's overall revenue in the March quarter.
I have one more topic to cover today. Given the importance of the Internet of Things market, some of our investors and analysts have asked for more color about the size of our IoT business. First, there is no consistent way in which semiconductor companies report their IoT revenue. As a result, there are some who report their entire embedded market revenue or the revenue of business units focused on the embedded market as IoT revenue.
By that measure, pretty close to 100% of Microchip's $2.2 billion of revenue could be classified as IoT revenue, but it would not be as meaningful to investors in terms of its potential as a future growth driver. We have a stricter definition for our IoT revenue in that we only count end applications or things that are both smart and connected reflecting what the promise of IoT really is, which is the possibilities that open up by adding connectivity to smart systems.
Examples of smart and connected applications for Microchip are things like alarm systems, access control systems, thermostats, smoke detectors, exercise machines, asset tracking, wireless audio docks, set-top boxes and other consumer electronic systems, hospital personnel locators, patient monitors, automotive telematics, building automation, vending machines, Smart Grid monitoring, wired and wireless networking systems, GPS navigation tracking systems and many, many others that are too numerous to list. More applications will continue to be added as they get connected. I'm sure you will agree that applications like the examples we just provided, which are a combination of smart and connected applications, are more real IoT applications and the products going into them would better characterize our IoT revenue. Microchip solutions that enable the IoT market include low-power microcontrollers, analog, sensors, memories, wired and wireless communication products.
So using our stricter definition for IoT revenue, Microchip estimates that our current annual IoT revenue is approximately $275 million and has been growing at a greater than 35% compounded annual growth rate over the last 3 years. This revenue is already included in the public reporting segments for Microchip.

Our non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.68 was a record and at the high end of our revised estimates. Recall that we had revised our earnings per share higher after taking into account the accretive effect of our financing transactions.
Looking at the fiscal year 2015. It was another record year for revenue and the first fiscal year to cross the $2 billion revenue mark. For fiscal year 2015, revenue came in at a record $2.16 billion, up 11.9% from fiscal year 2014. All of our strategic product lines of microcontroller and analog posted record revenue performance for fiscal year 2015. The March quarter was also our 98th consecutive profitable quarter. I want to thank all the employees of Microchip for their contribution in this remarkable achievement of 98 consecutive profitable quarters. We're also planning a celebration for our 100th consecutive profitable quarter, which is 2 quarters away.
In the last 2 conference call, we told you that we will be shutting down production in Supertex, San Jose fab as well as test facility in Hong Kong. The San Jose fab is now closed with the last wafer outs occurring in early April. The fab building is undergoing restoration to be returned back to the landlord. The transfer of the Hong Kong test operations to our high-volume Thailand facility was also completed in February.
Now I will provide guidance for the fiscal first quarter of 2016. As we look at the business environment, it is clear that many of our industry peers are seeing weakness across various end markets including PC and industrial, slowing growth in China market and currency impacts from the strong dollar. Taking all this into account, we believe that our net sales in the June quarter will be between $547 million and $564 million. On a non-GAAP basis, we expect our gross margin to be between 58.3% and 58.5% of sales. We expect operating expenses to be between 25.75% and 26% of sales. We expect operating profit to be between 32.3% and 32.75% of sales, and we expect non-GAAP EPS to be between $0.69 and $0.73 per share.
Finally, I want to remind you that given all the complications of accounting for the acquisitions including amortization of intangibles, restructuring charges and inventory write-up on acquisitions, Microchip will continue to provide guidance and track its results on non-GAAP basis. We believe that non-GAAP results provide more meaningful comparison to prior quarters, and we request that the analysts continue to report the non-GAAP estimates to first call.
Before we open it up for questions, I want to remind everybody, in case somebody joined the conference late, that in this conference call, we'll be only taking questions regarding our earnings and we'll have a second conference call starting at 5:45 p.m. New York time, at which we will talk about the Micrel acquisition and take questions related to that acquisition.
With this, operator, will you please poll for questions?"

I'm not going to share with you anymore. Basically, I think as far as the seasonality is concerned, a company with a constant stream of acquisitions that we have done, we believe seasonality often is miscalculated by the investors depending on how many years back you go. We have had Supertex acquisition, which closed in April last year; ISSC acquisition last year. If you go 5 years back, we closed SST acquisition also in April. So when you look at the June quarter numbers, sometimes you do with or without acquisitions and many times, the breakdown of those numbers is not available 2 or 3 years out. So I believe that seasonality changes a lot with these acquisitions. And I think -- but the largest reason is you describe yourself, which is industry conditions are soft, just like announced by other peers. That's what we are seeing and beyond that I'm not going to comment on cycle or anything else for the future."

We serve 90,000-plus customers and a vast majority of them through distribution and many time, at the customers, we work with multiple divisions. For some of them the business is PCs. For some others the business is industrial. For some other it could be called consumer. So we don't really have any end market flavor. But Ganesh, in his commentary, described that our IoT business, the way we defined it, much narrower definition of IoT for applications that are really smart and connected, is growing 35% a year. So that's doing very well. But if you take a broader definition of IoT like include all the embedded business and all that, you could almost call 100% of Microchip's business as IoT, which really would not be helpful. So that's really what I have to say there."

But we do business worldwide in U.S. dollars, so 99% plus of our business will be in U.S. dollars. So we don't take a hit on our receivables that way, and when the currencies become weak overseas, it doesn't change our revenue right away because our prices are in dollars. But then it makes the products more expensive for our customers. So as you're renegotiating the price, the next bid comes in, next order comes in, you're negotiating and then you will see some impact. But doing it in dollars gives us more control, allows us to manage it, split it with the customer or do whatever, but really allows us to manage it rather than have an automatic [ph] full FX impact to drop down. So I think the way we do it is probably better and has a delayed effect. It also impacts the business of our customers. If a business of our customers includes lots of products from overseas, which in most cases it does, then their end product becomes more expensive and they're having more trouble in terms of ramping their own products. So those results are real. Some are first tier, some are second tier, some are even third tier and it's very hard to figure this out with 90,000 customers worldwide doing business in 100 countries and I don't think we can decipher that."

So our microcontroller and analog business is both very well funded and relatively independently. We're not driving to a model that 3 years out, exclusion of a business will be this division or that division. They're all well-funded and it depends on basically achieving product success and marketplace penetration and they meet in manufacturing and they meet at the customer base and they meet in application. Wherein the same application, we got lots of microcontroller as well as analog products going into a single board. So there is a lot of synergy that way. But in terms of making investments, there's not a competition because we can really take care of both. So it will largely depend on where we have larger success. Analog has been growing faster somewhat because that's where we have done some of the acquisitions. Microcontroller acquisitions are a bit more difficult to do because everybody has a different architecture and you got different issues in trying to get synergy in microcontroller. So we had been able to acquire capability in analog both organically and through acquisitions, and it has been a smaller business compared to the microcontrollers. Microcontroller is a $1.5 billion business and analog is about 1/3 of that, $0.5 billion. So it's been growing faster. But it's not something that we are -- if microcontroller can grow faster with IoT with other applications, 32-bit is going very fast, 16-bit is going very fast, 8-bit did a record, but it does have a $1.5 billion gorilla that has to move. And we are #3rd in the overall microcontroller market, third or fourth depending on which year you take, versus in analog, we are much lower. There are much, much larger analog companies that we can take share from for long time."

So when you combine those 2 inventories in that high, if anything, they're in the low side despite the weakness, despite the guidance. So based on current numbers, our inventory is still really on the south or the middle. So I don't think the inventory is a problem. We're working very hard in our factories to make more product for our customers and have expedites and challenges and others with the mix being very complex, having closed down Supertex fab, accommodating all those products in our fab.

But our obvious go-to market is doing as much as what's on the board that constitutes both the smart side of the equation as well as the connectivity side of the equation. And your question on security is a very good one as well. So we know it's a key part of many, many of these applications. We enable that security, in some cases, through hardware that's built into our products in combination with software that we make available as well. And I think there's a lot more coming in front of us from the industry at large on how to ensure that as IoT fills out the range of applications, the security part of it continues to be addressed sufficiently.

During the course of this conference call, we will be making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to our press releases of today as well as our recent filings with the SEC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip's business and results of operations. 
In attendance with me today are Steve Sanghi, Microchip's President and CEO; and Ganesh Moorthy, Microchip's COO. I will comments in our first quarter of fiscal 2016 financial performance, and Steve and Ganesh will then give their comments on the results, discuss the current business environment as well as our guidance and provide an update on the acquisitions of Micrel which was completed today. We will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions. 
I want to remind you that we are including information in our press release in this conference call on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.microchip.com, which we believe you will find useful when comparing GAAP and non-GAAP results. I will now go through some of the operating results including net sales, gross margin and operating expenses. I will be referring to these results on a non-GAAP basis prior to the effects of acquisition activities and share-based compensation.
Net sales in the June quarter were $534 million, below the mid-point of our guidance, which was $555.5 million, and were up 0.5% from non-GAAP net sales of $531.3 million in the June 2014 quarter. Revenue by product line in the June quarter was $348.2 million for microcontrollers, $127.1 million for analog, $31.8 million for memory, $23.3 million for licensing and $3.7 million of other. Revenue by geography was $104.5 million in the Americas, $114.7 million in Europe and $314.7 million in Asia. I remind you that we recognize revenue based on where we ship our products to, which tends to skew some of the revenue towards Asia, where a lot of contract manufacturing takes place. 
On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were 58.3% [indiscernible]. Non-GAAP operating expenses were 25.6% of sales, below the bottom end of our guidance range. Non-GAAP operating income was 32.6% of sales and net income was $148.9 million. This resulted in $0.69 per diluted share, which while at the low end of our guidance was nonetheless a new record. 
On a GAAP basis, gross margin, including share-based compensation and acquisition-related expenses were 57.9% in the June quarter. GAAP gross margins include the impact of $1.7 million of share-based compensation and $0.5 million in manufacturing shutdown costs associated with the Supertex wafer fab in San Jose. 
Total operating expenses were $187.7 million or 35.2% of sales and include acquisition intangible amortization of $34.6 million, share-based compensation of [indiscernible], $2.2 million of acquisition-related expenses and special charges of $1.6 million. 
GAAP other expense includes a $13.8 million gain on the sale of the remainder of an investment that Microchip acquired as part of the SST acquisition back in 2010 and a $2.2 million gain on the sale of another investment. 
GAAP net income was $130.7 million or $0.60 per diluted share. GAAP net income including -- includes nonrecurring favorable tax events of $18.7 million, which was primarily driven by the release of deferred tax liability due to some IP ownership restructuring that occurred in the quarter related to our prior acquisition of ISSC. 
In the June quarter, the non-GAAP tax rate was 11.4% and the GAAP tax benefit rate was 9.1%. The GAAP tax rate was favorably impacted by the $18.7 million of nonrecurring tax events that I mentioned before. Our tax rate is impacted by the mix of geographical profits, withholding taxes associated with our licensing business and the tax effect of various nonrecurring items. Excluding any nonrecurring events, we expect our longer-term forward-looking non-GAAP effective tax rate to be about 11% to 12%. 
To summarize the after-tax impact its non-GAAP adjustments had on Microchip's earnings per share in the June quarter, acquisition-related items were about $0.163, share-based compensation was about $0.049, nonrecurring favorable tax events were about $0.086, a favorable difference on the sale of 2 investments during the quarter was about $0.074 and the difference between GAAP and non-GAAP noncontrolling interest at ISSC was a favorable of about $0.002 and noncash interest expense was about $0.03. 
The dividend declared today of $0.358 per share will be paid on September 25, 2015, the shareholders of record of September 11, 2015. The cash payment associated with this dividend is expected to be about $75.4 million. This quarter's dividend will be our 52nd consecutive quarter of making a dividend payment. We have never made reductions in our dividend. In fact, this quarter's increase marks the 46th occasion we have increased the dividend payment and our cumulative dividends paid amounts to almost $2.6 billion. This program continues to be an important component of how we return value to our shareholders. 
During that time period that Microchip has paid dividends, we have also purchased back $1.4 billion of our stock. Our combined cash return to shareholders since the inception of our dividend program is almost $4 billion. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. Consolidated inventory at June 30, 2015, was $303.7 million or 123 days, up by 12 days to the levels at the end of the March quarter. Inventory at our distributors was at 37 days and was flat to the March quarter levels. I want to remind you that our distribution revenue throughout the world is recognized on a sell-through basis. We have taken actions to moderate our production activities and our foundry wafer purchases in the current quarter to moderate any inventory build. 
The cash generation in the June quarter, excluding the purchase of the remaining shares of ISSC that were outstanding, our dividend payment, the changes in borrowing levels under revolving line of credit, was $143.8 million. As of June 30, the consolidated cash and total investment position was $2.43 billion, and our borrowings under our revolving line of credit were $497 million. Excluding dividend payments and our acquisition activities, we expect total cash and investment position to grow by approximately $100 million to $120 million in the September quarter. 
Capital spending was approximately $33.6 million in the June quarter. We expect about $35 million in capital spending in the September quarter and overall capital expenditures for fiscal year 2016 have been reduced from our previously guided $160 million to $125 million. We are selectively adding capital to support the growth of our production capabilities for our fast-growing new products and technologies and to bring in-house more of the assembly and test operations that are currently outsourced. Depreciation expense in the June quarter was $24.7 million. I will now ask Ganesh to give his comments on the performance of the business in the June quarter. Ganesh?"

Let's take a closer look at the performance of each of our product lines, starting with microcontrollers. Our microcontroller revenue was up 1.3% in the June quarter as compared to the year-ago quarter. We experienced the same broad-based weakness that has been reported by many of our peer group companies. In aggregate, over the last 4 rolling quarters, our microcontroller business was up 8% over the prior 4 rolling quarters. We are continuing to deliver innovative new 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit microcontrollers that we believe will enable us to grow faster than the market and gain further market share. Microcontrollers represented 65.2% of Microchip's overall revenue in the June quarter. 
Moving to our analog business, our analog business was down 0.6% in the June quarter as compared to the year-ago quarter. In this business too, we experienced the broad-based weakness that has been reported may many of our peers. In aggregate, over the last 4 rolling quarters, our analog business was up 11% over the prior 4 rolling quarters. Our analog business represented 23.8% of Microchip's overall revenue in the June quarter. We continue to develop and introduce a wide range of innovative and proprietary new products to fuel the future growth of our analog business. 
Our memory business, which is comprised of our Middle East memory products as well as our SuperFlash Memory products, was down 4.8% in the June quarter as compared to the year-ago quarter. We continue to run our memory business in a disciplined fashion that maintains consistently high profitability, enables our licensing business and serve our microcontroller customers to complete their solutions. Our memory business represented 5.959% of Microchip so overall revenue in the June quarter. 
Now a short update about Micrel and where we are in the integration process. Since the announcement of the acquisition on May 7, we have spent considerable time understanding Micrel's businesses, organization and systems. We have developed detailed integration plans that we have begun to execute today after the transaction closed. As we described in our May 7 conference call, Micrel has 3 product line business units and a small foundry services business. Micrel's linear and power solutions business is a classic highly fragmented analog business. This business, together with the Microchip's standard analog business, perform a strong combined portfolio that will serve a broader base of applications and customers and enable a number of cross-selling opportunities. 
Micrel's LAN solution business consists of our range of Ethernet products, including controllers, switches and physical layers with different speeds. This business will strengthen Microchip's overall Ethernet offering and also enable us to serve a broader set of applications and customers. Micrel's timing solutions business consists of a comprehensive clock and timing portfolio, including frequency control products, clock generation products and clock distribution products. It also includes MEMS technology capability that enables much smaller timing components. This is a brand new field of labor Microchip that we're excited about and see sales synergies with our existing product lines. It also gives us visibility into a range of applications and customers that are new to Microchip who could be customers for our microcontroller, analog and memory products. 
In regards to sales and field applications, we are planning to keep Micrel's sales and applications engineers and we'll cross train them as well as our existing sales force so that we can find revenue synergies through cross-selling opportunities. We also plan to combine the distribution networks of the 2 companies. Some of the distributors for the 2 companies are the same while others are different, and our goal is to achieve expanded distribution capabilities for the products of both companies. In regards to manufacturing, Steve will comment in more detail in his section, along with how we expect to see the accretion results rolling out over time. With that, let me now pass it to Steve for some general comments about our business, the Micrel acquisition as well as the guidance going forward. Steve."

Today, I would like to first comment on the results of the fiscal first quarter of 2016 and then provide guidance for the fiscal second quarter of 2016, including comments on the integration plan for Micrel",1420,"Thank you, Ganesh, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I would like to first comment on the results of the fiscal first quarter of 2016 and then provide guidance for the fiscal second quarter of 2016, including comments on the integration plan for Micrel.
Our June quarter results were shy of our guidance but were consistent with what others in the semiconductor industry have reported. The quarter started out well but the negative effects of a very weak economy in China and challenges in Europe led by a very weak euro caused us to finish the quarter below our guidance in revenue. We were able to keep the non-GAAP gross margin percentage and earnings per share within the guidance albeit at the low end of it. Gross margin of 58.3%, operating expense of 25.6% and operating profit of 32.6% were all very respectable achievements. The June quarter was also our 99th consecutive profitable quarter. I want to thank all the employees of Microchip for their contribution in this remarkable achievement of 99 consecutive profitable quarters. I look forward to the current quarter being 100th consecutive profitable quarter and achievement unmatched in our industry. 
I will now provide guidance for the September quarter, including Micrel revenue. Our guidance is based on the assumption that Europe will continue to be in the doldrums and is made worse so by the summer holidays. And China, which has been the engine of growth in the past, remaining slow. In preparing our guidance, we have done bottoms up analysis region by region, distributor by distributor and by major customers. We have also included Micrel revenue from today, August 3, to the end of the quarter as we understand it. 
We expect our net sales in the September quarter to be between $532 million to $569 million in [indiscernible] $25 million revenue from the sales of Micrel products from today until the end of the quarter. Without counting Micrel, we expect our net sales to be between flat to down 7% sequentially. I want to remind you that the guidance we're providing is our non-GAAP revenue which will include sell-through from the distributors of Micrel. The GAAP revenue will be much lower since GAAP does not account for products sold to distributors that were shipped prior to the acquisition effective date. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be between 57.6% to 57.8% for the combined company, negatively impacted by the lower gross margin of Micrel and sequentially flat without Micrel. We expect the non-GAAP operating expenses to be about 27.7% to 28.9% of sales for the combined company, and we expect the combined company non-GAAP operating profit to be between 28.7% to 30.1% of sales, again negatively impacted by higher expenses and lower operating profit of Micrel. We expect non-GAAP earnings per share to be between $0.58 to $0.66 per share. The non-GAAP earnings per share are impacted by $0.015 dilution coming from the consolidation of Micrel. Now let me provide you more updates on the Micrel acquisition. We closed the acquisition today, and we now begin the hard work of integration to drive shareholder value. The shareholders of Micrel overwhelmingly approved the merger with 98.95% of the Micrel shares that voted in the favor of the merger. As part of the transaction, we will pay an aggregate of approximately $430 million in cash and issue an aggregate of 8,626,795 shares, taking into consideration the equity awards assumed and the cash and investments on Micrel's balance sheet at the closing date, a total enterprise value is in line with the $744 million that we shared with investors when we announced the signing of the definitive agreement back on May 7, 2015. 
Now Ganesh has already covered some of the elements of our integration planning, I will cover 4 areas: First, I will explain to you how the revenue of Micrel will be consolidated into Microchip's SEC revenue reporting; second, I will explain our plans in the IT systems and manufacturing area; third, I will give you guidance on the accretion we expect to get from this acquisition; and finally, I will provide guidance for the long-term financial model for Micrel. 
So let us begin with how the revenue Micrel will be included in the Microchip's revenue reporting. Now Micrel breaks down its revenue into 3 reported product line; linear and powers solutions, LAN solutions and TCG, which is timing and communication. 99% of Micrel revenue will be reported as analog revenue within Microchip. Approximately 1% of Micrel revenue is on product that are built on a microcontroller core. Their, in fact, special-purpose microcontrollers and will be reported within our microcontroller revenue. 
Now I will give you an update on our integration planning in the IT systems area and in the manufacturing area. In the last 3 months, we have studied the business systems of both companies. Micrel is a small company and its business systems are relatively old. We have laid out a plan that will transfer all of Micrel to Microchip's business systems. We estimate that this transition will be completed sometime in the calendar first quarter of 2016. 
Regarding manufacturing, Micrel operates a small 6-inch fab in San Jose that is about 30% utilized at the current time. Micrel also uses outside foundries for some of its products, mostly for the LAN solutions growth. This happen to be the same foundries that Microchip uses for some of our products that are outsourced. We will leave those products remaining in the outside fabs. Our focus will be to deal with 6-inch San Jose fab that is severely underutilized. Microchip will transfer all of Micrel's products from its 6-inch fab to other facilities. A majority of these products will transfer to Microchip's two 8-inch fab, one in Tempe, Arizona and second in Oregon. Some products may be transferred to other outside foundries wherever there is a better process technology match. We believe that this transfer of all the products from Micrel fab to either Microchip fabs or to some foundries will take about 1 to 2 years. After that, San Jose's 6-inch fab will be closed. 
Regarding back-end manufacturing, Micrel subcontracts 100% of its assembly [ph] test. Many of the packages that Micrel uses are different than Microchip's but many are same. Where appropriate, we will apply our expanded purchasing power to lower our supply chain cost. As in the other acquisitions, we will also do a careful network buy analysis on each package and product type. Over time, some of the products and packages may be brought into our assembly and test facility while others will remain at the subcontractors. Microchip will, however, combine the manufacturing systems like wafer ordering, assembly and test management, shipments and warehouses. We expect that all Micrel products will be shipping from Microchip's manufacturing systems by the end of the first calendar quarter of 2016. 
With this, let me now provide guidance for accretion from the acquisition of Micrel. We currently expect the Micrel acquisition to be $0.015 dilutive to a non-GAAP EPS for the partial September quarter. The acquisition just closed today so we need more time to study and provide you further guidance. But with the rate at which we expect the integration to progress, our initial estimate will be that Micrel acquisition will be breakeven throughout December quarter non-GAAP EPS. For longer term, after we how close be San Jose fab, which is about 1 to 2 years from now, we expect Micrel to add about $0.25 of accretion to Microchip's yearly non-GAAP EPS. These numbers are preliminary and depend upon the speed of integration efforts and the health of the underlying economy in general. 
Finally, let me provide guidance for the long-term financial model for Micrel. Our track record has shown that Microchip has been able to improve the business model of each acquisitions, and I will combine the business model has remained virtually unchanged. 
[Audio Gap] if that after San Jose fab is closed and the oldest 6-inch inventory have been depleted, we will improve the financial model of Micrel to be equivalent to that of Microchip. Given all the complications of accounting for the acquisitions including amortization of intangibles, restructuring charges and inventory write-off, Microchip will continue to provide guidance and track its results. On a non-GAAP basis, we believe that non-GAAP results provide more meaningful comparison to prior quarters, and we request that the analyst continue to report the non-GAAP estimates to first [ph] call. With this, operator, will you please poll for questions?"

So let's take it. As the earnings season has progressed, a number of investors and analysts have commented and have asked me how I thought about the current environment in the semiconductor. And if this is something that started in October of last year with our earnings volume at that time. I have not engaged into any conversation with any of the investors and analysts because we were in the quiet time. And I thought if the question was asked, I'll address it here. So here it is. It's really the first question. Why it's really painful to visit that period again, we do believe that the first signs of it slowdown in China were visible at that time. We saw that through thousands of small customers who were experiencing economic headwinds and not buying enough products. This was further enhanced by a very tight credit environment that was what prevented at that time in China. Then after, a warning, the December numbers for most of the semiconductor companies were incurred by an average of about 5%. The company in the supply chain of 1 mobile customer were a notable exception. Then came the March quarter which was seasonal weak we for most companies due to Chinese New Year and also some others blamed it on euro weakness which was indeed a new phenomena. So then came in the June quarter which is traditionally very strong quarter in China, and we saw a broad-based from the industry led by China. And the September quarter guidance have been very weak also driven by China. Now we have semiconductor companies admitting that there was indeed inventory build in China and that the distribution that needs to correct. We knew from the companies that we have acquired and others that we conducted diligence on but did not acquire that there was a broad-based selling driven inventory build in distribution channel, which the prevailing rate of demand could not support. You can only play a selling game for so long. And this time, it cannot truly [indiscernible] a bit longer. But everyone's numbers have been cut significantly. A large number of companies are now selling well below the stock price on October 9 prior to our call. When I said and I quote, ""We believe that another industry correction has begun and that this correction will be seen more broadly across the industry in the near future."" I probably took a quarter longer than it has taken historically likely masked by the supply chain with everyone having some exposure to it. But really an answer to investor and analyst question, I suggest this is pretty much a continuation of the phenomenon that we saw last October."

So essentially, we have taken our analog business and internally in Microchip, split it into 2 portions, 1 is called analog power and interface division and second is called the mix signal and linear decisions but both of equal size. And then the entire Micrel linear and power businesses folding into one of those division into the analog power management business. So we will apply our principles, our metrics of R&D and all that. When I look at R&D as a percentage of sales for analog, Microchip is one of the most efficient in the industry. We don't break out individual R&D, but the amount of R&D we spend to get the margins and revenue and all that, Micrel is one of the worst if you look at the numbers. So we have to move this from worst to best, and we have done that with others. We have done that with SST and SMSC and Supertex. And over and over and over, you've seen that. That's what we have to do here. Then, there is a LAN business year which is about $50 million, $50 million, $60 million and that also we're going to completely forward that Microchip's USB networking division where our land business resides. That, again, will really benefit from our methodologies, our metrics, our management and everything else. And the third business here is the timing business which is a new business for us, and we will keep that design business units but we will report into one of our season general manager so it can also get the mentorship and really moved towards our model."

If we just look at ourselves, we think we give you September quarter guidance already. December is personally a weak quarter and Microchip and also for the industry. Considering this correction happening in the June and September, what would manifest for December, it's kind of hard to see right now. But as we go to the quarter, one could make a case that December quarters should not seasonally be weak because ordinarily, December quarter is followed by a very strong June and September, this time it is not. But I'm not making that prediction today. I'd like to see the quarter. I got to see the booking, the backlog and everything else and talk about it later maybe as we go on the road. The biggest leverage here short term is really improving Micrel's business. And I think there is a fair amount of opportunity for us to do that. And the largest leverage comes from the fab. There is 30% utilization in the fab, and we dramatically lower its cost by transferring product. And the first 5 products will be running at a Microchip fab in about 6 weeks."

And the Tempe facility [indiscernible], we always do that and December and over the holidays. So this time again, we'll have a is shutdown in Tempe facility over the holidays and we're planning to tuck on a few more days do that to correct the inventory.

I think people make these adjustments to the quarter and a better July doesn't necessarily mean a better end of September for us and anybody else because customers can correct that any time in the quarter. Sometimes if you place bookings earlier, so whatever product they need for the quarter, they have commitment from the supplier that they will get the product for their needs. And it is easy for them to cancel or slip it out that I only need it in September, give it to me in October then to have a situation where they don't place order and September quarter comes, they need something and somebody's lead time is more than 40 weeks and they can't get it. So customers simply have very little penalty for getting their queue in line, almost no penalty. So therefore, it's not unusual for the first quarter some time to see stronger bookings only to get corrected later on. And I would not read so much into it for anybody."

So there's a lot of unknowns, a lot of unknowns. That's why we gave this band 1 year or 2 years. My desire is 11 months, but I don't get everything I desire. I think it's going to be somewhere between 1 to 2 years."

Then you're 4 years to figure it out, what are going to do with it. It's going to us or take it to a subcontractor, transfer the equipment, do whatever. So that's what we will do. That's not going to hold up the fab. and Micrel is a small company as a percentage of Microchip's. So even though there will be a strategic transition inventory built on the products were transferring and the product that we are not transferring, the products we are transferring, you how to build some strategic inventory on those 2 because you got to give because number time to qualify 8-inch material while they have 6-inch material available.

During the course of this conference call, we will be making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to our press release as of today as well as our recent filings with the SEC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip's business and results of operations. 
In attendance with me today are: Steve Sanghi, Microchip's President and CEO; and Ganesh Moorthy, Microchip's COO. I will comment on our first quarter of fiscal 2016 financial performance, and Steve and Ganesh will then give their comments on the results, discuss the current business environment as well as our guidance and provide an update on the acquisition of Micrel, which was completed today. We will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions. 
I want to remind you that we are including information in our press release in this conference call on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.microchip.com, which we believe you will find useful when comparing GAAP and non-GAAP results. I will now go through some of the operating results including net sales, gross margin and operating expenses. I will be referring to these results on a non-GAAP basis prior to the effects of acquisition activities and share-based compensation.
Net sales in the June quarter were $534 million, below the mid-point of our guidance, which was $555.5 million, and were up 0.5% from non-GAAP net sales of $531.3 million in the June 2014 quarter. Revenue by product line in the June quarter was $348.2 million for microcontrollers, $127.1 million for analog, $31.8 million for memory, $23.3 million for licensing and $3.7 million of other. Revenue by geography was $104.5 million in the Americas, $114.7 million in Europe and $314.7 million in Asia. I remind you that we recognize revenue based on where we ship our products to, which tends to skew some of the revenue towards Asia, where a lot of contract manufacturing takes place. 
On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were 58.3% of sales. Non-GAAP operating expenses were 25.6% of sales, below the bottom end of our guidance range. Non-GAAP operating income was 32.6% of sales and net income was $148.9 million. This resulted in $0.69 per diluted share, which while it was at the low end of our guidance, was nonetheless a new record. 
On a GAAP basis, gross margins, including share-based compensation and acquisition-related expenses were 57.9% in the June quarter. GAAP gross margins include the impact of $1.7 million of share-based compensation and $0.5 million in manufacturing shutdown costs associated with the Supertex wafer fab in San Jose. 
Total operating expenses were $187.7 million or 35.2% of sales and include acquisition intangible amortization of $34.6 million, share-based compensation of $12.4 million, $2.2 million of acquisition-related expenses and special charges of $1.6 million. 
GAAP other expense includes a $13.8 million gain on the sale of the remainder of an investment that Microchip acquired as part of the SST acquisition back in 2010 and a $2.2 million gain on the sale of another investment. 
GAAP net income was $130.7 million or $0.60 per diluted share. GAAP net income including -- includes nonrecurring favorable tax events of $18.7 million, which was primarily driven by the release of a deferred tax liability due to some IP ownership restructuring that occurred in the quarter related to our prior acquisition of ISSC. 
In the June quarter, the non-GAAP tax rate was 11.4% and the GAAP tax benefit rate was 9.1%. The GAAP tax rate was favorably impacted by the $18.7 million of nonrecurring tax events that I mentioned before. Our tax rate is impacted by the mix of geographical profits, withholding taxes associated with our licensing business and the tax effect of various nonrecurring items. Excluding any nonrecurring events, we expect our longer-term forward-looking non-GAAP effective tax rate to be about 11% to 12%. 
To summarize the after-tax impact that non-GAAP adjustments had on Microchip's earnings per share in the June quarter, acquisition-related items were about $0.163, share-based compensation was about $0.049, nonrecurring favorable tax events were about $0.086, a favorable difference on the sale of 2 investments during the quarter was about $0.074 and the difference in GAAP and non-GAAP noncontrolling interest at ISSC was a favorable of about $0.002 and noncash interest expense was about $0.035.
The dividend declared today of $0.358 per share will be paid on September 25, 2015, to shareholders of record on September 11, 2015. The cash payment associated with this dividend is expected to be about $75.4 million. This quarter's dividend will be our 52nd consecutive quarter of making a dividend payment. We have never made reductions in our dividend. In fact, this quarter's increase marks the 46th occasion we have increased the dividend payment and our cumulative dividends paid amounts to almost $2.6 billion. This program continues to be an important component of how we return value to our shareholders. 
During that time period that Microchip has paid dividends, we have also purchased back $1.4 billion of our stock. Our combined cash return to shareholders since the inception of our dividend program is almost $4 billion. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. Consolidated inventory at June 30, 2015, was $303.7 million or 123 days, up by 12 days to the levels at the end of the March quarter. Inventory at our distributors was at 37 days and was flat to the March quarter levels. I want to remind you that our distribution revenue throughout the world is recognized on a sell-through basis. We have taken actions to moderate our production activities in our foundry wafer purchases in the current quarter to moderate any inventory build. 
The cash generation in the June quarter, excluding the purchase of the remaining shares of ISSC that were outstanding, our dividend payment, the changes in borrowing levels under the revolving line of credit, was $143.8 million. As of June 30, the consolidated cash and total investment position was $2.43 billion, and our borrowings under our revolving line of credit were $497 million. Excluding dividend payments and our acquisition activities, we expect total cash and investment position to grow by approximately $100 million to $120 million in the September quarter. 
Capital spending was approximately $33.6 million in the June quarter. We expect about $35 million in capital spending in the September quarter and overall capital expenditures for fiscal year 2016 have been reduced from our previously guided $160 million to $125 million. We are selectively adding capital to support the growth of our production capabilities for our fast-growing new products and technologies and to bring in-house more of the assembly and test operations that are currently outsourced. Depreciation expense in the June quarter was $24.7 million. I will now ask Ganesh to give his comments on the performance of the business in the June quarter. Ganesh?"

Our memory business, which is comprised of our Serial E-squared memory products, as well as our SuperFlash Memory products, was down 4.8% in the June quarter as compared to the year-ago quarter. We continue to run our memory business in a disciplined fashion that maintains consistently high profitability, enables our licensing business and sly our microcontroller customers to complete their solutions. Our memory business represented 5.95% of Microchip's overall revenue in the June quarter. 
Now a short update about Micrel and where we are in the integration process. Since the announcement of the acquisition on May 7, we have spent considerable time understanding Micrel's businesses, organization and systems. We have developed detailed integration plans that we have begun to execute today after the transaction closed. As we described in our May 7 conference call, Micrel has 3 product line business units and a small foundry services business. Micrel's linear and power solutions business is a classic highly fragmented analog business. This business, together with Microchip's standard analog business, will form a strong combined portfolio that will serve a broader base of applications and customers and enable a number of cross-selling opportunities. 
Micrel's LAN solutions business consists of a range of Ethernet products, including controllers, switches and physical layers for different speeds. This business will strengthen Microchip's overall Ethernet offering and also enable us to serve a broader set of applications and customers. Micrel's timing solutions business consists of a comprehensive clock and timing portfolio, including frequency control products, clock generation products and clock distribution products. It also includes MEMS technology capability that enables much smaller timing components. This is a brand new field of play for Microchip that we're excited about and see sales synergies with our existing product lines. It also gives us visibility into a range of applications and customers that are new to Microchip, who could be customers for our microcontroller, analog and memory products. 
In regards to sales and field applications, we are planning to keep Micrel's sales and applications engineers, and will cross-train them as well as our existing sales force so that we can find revenue synergies through cross-selling opportunities. We also plan to combine the distribution networks of the 2 companies. Some of the distributors for the 2 companies are the same, while others are different, and our goal is to achieve expanded distribution capabilities for the products of both companies. In regards to manufacturing, Steve will comment in more detail in his section, along with how we expect to see the accretion results rolling out over time. With that, let me now pass it to Steve for some general comments about our business, the Micrel acquisition as well as the guidance going forward. Steve?"

Today, I would like to first comment on the results of the fiscal first quarter of 2016 and then provide guidance for the fiscal second quarter of 2016, including comments on the integration plan for Micrel",1422,"Thank you, Ganesh, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I would like to first comment on the results of the fiscal first quarter of 2016 and then provide guidance for the fiscal second quarter of 2016, including comments on the integration plan for Micrel.
Our June quarter results were shy of our guidance, but were consistent with what others in the semiconductor industry have reported. The quarter started out well, but the negative effects of a very weak economy in China and challenges in Europe led by a very weak euro caused us to finish the quarter below our guidance in revenue. We were able to keep the non-GAAP gross margin percentage and earnings per share within the guidance, albeit on the low end of it. Gross margin of 58.3%, operating expense of 25.6% and operating profit of 32.6% were all very respectable achievements. The June quarter was also our 99th consecutive profitable quarter. I want to thank all the employees of Microchip for their contribution in this remarkable achievement of 99 consecutive profitable quarters. I look forward to the current quarter being 100th consecutive profitable quarter, an achievement unmatched in our industry. 
I will now provide guidance for the September quarter, including Micrel revenue. Our guidance is based on the assumption that Europe will continue to be in the doldrums, and is made worse so by the summer holidays. And China, which has been the engine of growth in the past, remaining slow. In preparing our guidance, we have done bottoms up analysis region by region, distributor by distributor and by major customers. We have also included Micrel revenue from today, August 3, to the end of the quarter as we understand it. 
We expect our net sales in the September quarter to be between $532 million to $569 million and $35 million revenue from the sales of Micrel products from today until the end of the quarter. Without counting Micrel, we expect our net sales to be between flat to down 7% sequentially. I want to remind you that the guidance we are providing is for non-GAAP revenue, which will include sell-through from the distributors of Micrel. The GAAP revenue will be much lower since GAAP does not account for products sold to distributors that were shipped prior to the acquisition effective date. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be between 57.6% to 57.8% for the combined company, negatively impacted by the lower gross margin of Micrel and sequentially flat without Micrel. We expect the non-GAAP operating expenses to be about 27.7% to 28.9% of sales for the combined company, and we expect the combined company non-GAAP operating profit to be between 28.7% to 30.1% of sales, again negatively impacted by higher expenses and lower operating profit of Micrel. We expect non-GAAP earnings per share to be between $0.58 to $0.66 per share. The non-GAAP earnings per share are impacted by $0.015 dilution coming from the consolidation of Micrel. Now let me provide you more updates on the Micrel acquisition. We closed the acquisition today, and we now begin the hard work of integration to drive shareholder value. The shareholders of Micrel overwhelmingly approved the merger with 98.95% of the Micrel shares that worked in the favor of the merger. As part of the transaction, we will pay an aggregate of approximately $430 million in cash and issue an aggregate of 8,626,795 shares, taking into consideration the equity awards assumed and the cash and investments on Micrel's balance sheet at the closing date. The total enterprise value is in line with the $744 million that we shared with investors when we announced the signing of the definitive agreement back on May 7, 2015. 
Now Ganesh has already covered some of the elements of our integration planning, I will cover 4 areas: First, I will explain to you how the revenue of Micrel will be consolidated into Microchip's SEC revenue reporting; second, I will explain our plans in the IT systems and manufacturing area; third, I will give you guidance on the accretion we expect to get from this acquisition; and finally, I will provide guidance for the long-term financial model for Micrel. 
So let us begin with how the revenue of Micrel will be included in the Microchip's revenue reporting. Micrel breaks down its revenue into 3 reported product lines: Linear and powers solutions, LAN solutions and TCG, which is timing and communication. 99% of Micrel revenue will be reported as analog revenue within Microchip. Approximately 1% of Micrel revenue is on products that are built on a microcontroller core. They're, in fact, special-purpose microcontrollers and will be reported within our microcontroller revenue. 
Now I will give you an update on our integration planning in the IT systems area and in the manufacturing area. In the last 3 months, we have studied the business systems of both companies. Micrel is a small company and its business systems are relatively old. We have laid out a plan that will transfer all of Micrel to Microchip's business systems. We estimate that this transition will be completed sometime in the calendar first quarter of 2016. 
Regarding manufacturing, Micrel operates a small 6-inch fab in San Jose that is about 30% utilized at the current time. Micrel also uses outside foundries for some of its products, mostly for the LAN solutions group. This happened to be some of the same foundries that Microchip uses for some of our products that are outsourced. We will leave those products running in the outside fabs. Our focus will be to deal with 6-inch San Jose fab that is severely underutilized. Microchip will transfer all of Micrel's products from its 6-inch fab to other facilities. A majority of these products will transfer to Microchip's two 8-inch fabs, one in Tempe, Arizona and the second in Gresham, Oregon. Some products may be transferred to other outside foundries wherever there is a better process technology match. We believe that this transfer of all the products from Micrel fab to either Microchip fabs or to some foundries will take about 1 to 2 years. After that, San Jose's 6-inch fab will be closed. 
Regarding back-end manufacturing, Micrel subcontracts 100% of its assembly and test. Many of the packages that Micrel uses are different than Microchip's, but many are the same. Where appropriate, we will apply our expanded purchasing power to lower our supply chain costs. As in the other acquisitions, we will also do a careful make versus buy analysis on each package and product type. Over time, some of the products and packages may be brought into our assembly and test facility while others will remain at the subcontractors. Microchip will, however, combine the manufacturing systems like wafer ordering, assembly and test management, shipments and warehouses. We expect that all Micrel products will be shipping from Microchip's manufacturing systems by the end of the first calendar quarter of 2016. 
With this, let me now provide guidance for accretion from the acquisition of Micrel. We currently expect the Micrel acquisition to be $0.015 dilutive to a non-GAAP EPS for the partial September quarter. The acquisition just closed today, so we need more time to study and provide you further guidance. But with the rate at which we expect the integration to progress, our initial estimate will be that Micrel acquisition will be breakeven throughout December quarter non-GAAP EPS. For longer term, after we have closed the San Jose fab, which is about 1 to 2 years from now, we expect Micrel to add about $0.25 of accretion to Microchip's yearly non-GAAP EPS. These numbers are preliminary and depend upon the speed of integration efforts and the health of the underlying economy in general. 
Finally, let me provide guidance for the long-term financial model for Micrel. Our track record has shown that Microchip has been able to improve the business model of its acquisitions, and our combined business model has remained virtually unchanged. 
If, that after San Jose fab is closed and the oldest 6-inch inventory have been depleted, we will improve the financial model of Micrel to be equivalent to that of Microchip. Given all the complications of accounting for the acquisitions, including amortization of intangibles, restructuring charges and inventory write-up, Microchip will continue to provide guidance and track its results. On a non-GAAP basis, we believe that non-GAAP results provide more meaningful comparison to prior quarters, and we request that the analysts continue to report the non-GAAP estimates in the first call. With this, operator, will you please poll for questions?"

As the earnings season has progressed, a number of investors and analysts have commented and have asked me how I thought about the current environment in the semiconductor, and if this is something that started in October of last year with our earnings volume at that time. I have not engaged into any conversation with any of the investors and analysts because we were in the quiet time. And I thought if the question was asked, I'll address it here. So here it is, that's really the first question. While it's really painful to visit that period again, we do believe that the first signs of a slowdown in China were visible at that time. We saw that through thousands of small customers who were experiencing economic headwinds, and not buying enough products. This was further enhanced by a very tight credit environment that was what prevalent at that time in China. Then after, a warning, the December quarter numbers for most semiconductor companies were incurred by an average of about 5%. The companies in the supply chain of 1 mobile customer were a notable exception. Then came the March quarter which was seasonally weak for most companies due to Chinese New Year, and also some others blamed it on euro weakness which was indeed a new phenomena. So then came in the June quarter which is traditionally a very strong quarter in China, and we saw a broad-based miss from the industry led by China. And the September quarter guidance has been very weak, also driven by China. Now we have semiconductor companies admitting that there was indeed inventory build in China, and that the distribution that needs to correct. We knew from the companies that we have acquired, and others that we conducted diligence on but did not acquire, that there was a broad-based selling driven inventory build in distribution channel, which the prevailing rate of demand could not support. You can only play a selling game for so long. And this time, it cannot truly, went a bit longer. But now everyone's numbers have been cut significantly. A large number of companies are now selling well below the stock prices on October 9 prior to our call. When I said, and I quote, ""We believe that another industry correction has begun, and that this correction will be seen more broadly across the industry in the near future."" It probably took a quarter longer than it has taken historically, likely masked by the smartphone supply chain, with everyone having some exposure to it. But really, an answer to investor and analyst question, I suggest this is pretty much a continuation of the phenomenon that we saw last October."

So essentially, we have taken our analog business and internally in Microchip, split it into 2 portions, one is called the analog power and interface division and second is called the mix signal and linear division, they're both about equal size. And then the entire Micrel Linear and Power business is folding into one of those divisions, to the analog power management business. So we will apply our principles, our metrics of R&D and all that. When I look at R&D as a percentage of sales for analog, Microchip is one of the most efficient in the industry. We don't break out individual R&D, but the amount of R&D we spend to get the margins and revenue and all that, and Micrel is one of the worst, when you look at the numbers. So we have to move this from worst to best, and we have done that with others. We've done that with SST and SMSC and Supertex. And over and over and over, you have seen that. That's what we have to do here. Then, there is a LAN business here, which is about $50 million, $50 million, $60 million, and that also we're going to completely fold that into Microchip's USB and networking division, where our LAN business resides. That, again, will then really benefit from our methodologies, our metrics, our management and everything else. And the third business here is the timing business, which is a new business for us, and we will keep that as a business unit, but it will report into one of our seasoned general managers, so it can also get the mentorship and really move towards that model."

Considering this correction happening in June and September, what would manifest for December, it's kind of hard to see right now. But as we go through the quarter, one could make a case that December quarters should not seasonally be weak, because ordinarily, December quarter is followed by a very strong June and September, this time it is not. But I'm not making that prediction today. I'd like to see the quarter. I got to see the booking, the backlog, everything else, and talk about it later, maybe as we go on the road. The biggest leverage here, short term is really improving Micrel's business. And I think there is a fair amount of opportunity for us to do that. And the largest leverage comes from the fab.

And that shutdown has been previously scheduled for a year, for this October. And that shutdown usually is about 7 to 8 days. We have to shut the factory, and we reserve for it going into that shutdown and it's a planned shutdown, we have to do it every once in 5 years. We are currently planning to tack on a few more days to it, to bring the inventory down because the factory will be shutdown anyway. And rather than starting and stopping, it'll be best to extend that a little bit. Then the factory in Tempe is a much older facility, and doesn't have as many redundancies built into it. And the Tempe facility [indiscernible] and then, we always do that in December and over the holidays. So this time again, we'll have a shutdown in Tempe facility over the holidays, and we are planning to tack on a few more days to that, to correct the inventory. So you will see our internal inventory rise in the September quarter, but then it corrects because we've got shutdowns in both factories in the December quarter. The normal shutdown, we accrue it over 4 quarters in our balance over the year, but the extra shutdown days, we're going to do -- will charge it to the current quarter, basically, in the quarter it happens, which will be the calendar Q4. So Q4 gross margin would be impacted, I don't know whether Eric is able to dollar either at this point in time, and whether you do a GAAP or non-GAAP, that would be a one-time phenomena."

And I could say the same thing, that this quarter's bookings look better than it was last quarter. There was some strength in the overall numbers. But that's baked into the guidance. And I think, if you look at various people's commentary last quarter, April was good and May was good and then June fell off. So I think people make these adjustments to the quarter and a better July doesn't necessarily mean a better end of September for us or anybody else, because customers can correct that any time in the quarter. Sometimes people place bookings earlier, so whatever product they need for the quarter, they have commitment from the supplier, that they will get the product for their needs. And then it's easy for them to cancel or slip it out, that I only need it in September, give it to me in October, than to have a situation where they don't place the order, and September quarter comes, they need something and somebody's lead time is more than 4 weeks, and they can't get it. So customers simply have very little penalty for getting their queue in line, almost no penalty. So therefore, it's not unusual for the first quarter some time to see stronger bookings, only to get corrected later on. And I would not read so much into it for anybody."

So we're mounting a much larger team, and we're going to transfer the products at more than twice the rate, then actually would transfer the products from Supertex fab into. And the basic difference between whether it's a year or 2 years is, sometimes you have customers, the product from the new fab, products coming out of fab and working first time, [indiscernible] traded. Running into any kind of equipment issues, equipments and fab seem to be different. We believe we can emulate Micrel's process on our equipment, and we have, successful in the first couple of processes we are attempting so far. But at any point in time, you can run into a challenge, and have to then convert a Micrel piece of equipment from 6-inch to 8-inch, or buy a new 1 and have 3, 4, 5 months delay in getting that equipment. So there are a lot of unknowns, a lot of unknowns. That's why we gave this band of 1 year to 2 years. My desire is 11 months, but I don't get everything I desire.

So what we do is, they always, especially in analog, there are lots of products that need 1 fab run every 2 years. And those products don't make sense to even have a masked set, and put the cost transferring it. So usually on those masked sets, we build strategic inventory of 4 years or so. So if the product needs 1 run a year, then you run 4 runs out of the Micrel fab before you shut it down, now you have 4 years of customer demand. Then you have 4 years to figure it out, what you're going to do with it. I build it and I go out there, we'll take it to a subcontractor, transfer the equipment, do whatever. So that's what we will do. That's not going to hold up the fab. And Micrel is a small company as a percentage of Microchip's. So even though there'll be a strategic transition inventory built on the products we are transferring, and on the product we're not transferring, the products we are transferring, you have to build some strategic inventory on those too, because you've got to give the customer time to qualify 8-inch material, while they have 6-inch material available. So you will see that strategic inventory build on our balance sheet. But it's not going to be that large compared to the size of the company and its strategic in nature."

We refer you to our press release as of today as well as our recent filings with the SEC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip's business and results of operations. 
In attendance with me today are: Steve Sanghi, Microchip's President and CEO; and Ganesh Moorthy, Microchip's COO. I will comment on our first quarter of fiscal 2016 financial performance, and Steve and Ganesh will then give their comments on the results, discuss the current business environment as well as our guidance and provide an update on the acquisition of Micrel, which was completed today. We will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions. 
I want to remind you that we are including information in our press release and this conference call on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.microchip.com, which we believe you will find useful when comparing GAAP and non-GAAP results. I will now go through some of the operating results, including net sales, gross margin and operating expenses. I will be referring to these results on a non-GAAP basis prior to the effects of acquisition activities and share-based compensation.
Net sales in the June quarter were $534 million, below the midpoint of our guidance, which was $555.5 million, and were up 0.5% from non-GAAP net sales of $531.3 million in the June 2014 quarter. Revenue by product line in the June quarter was $348.2 million for microcontrollers, $127.1 million for analog, $31.8 million for memory, $23.3 million for licensing and $3.7 million of other. Revenue by geography was $104.5 million in the Americas, $114.7 million in Europe and $314.7 million in Asia. I remind you that we recognize revenue based on where we ship our products to, which tends to skew some of the revenue towards Asia, where a lot of contract manufacturing takes place. 
On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were 58.3% of sales. Non-GAAP operating expenses were 25.6% of sales, below the bottom end of our guidance range. Non-GAAP operating income was 32.6% of sales and net income was $148.9 million. This resulted in $0.69 per diluted share, which while it was at the low end of our guidance, was nonetheless a new record. 
On a GAAP basis, gross margins, including share-based compensation and acquisition-related expenses, were 57.9% in the June quarter. GAAP gross margins include the impact of $1.7 million of share-based compensation and $0.5 million in manufacturing shutdown costs associated with the Supertex wafer fab in San Jose. 
Total operating expenses were $187.7 million or 35.2% of sales and include acquisition intangible amortization of $34.6 million, share-based compensation of $12.4 million, $2.2 million of acquisition-related expenses and special charges of $1.6 million. 
GAAP other expense includes a $13.8 million gain on the sale of the remainder of an investment that Microchip acquired as part of the SST acquisition back in 2010, and a $2.2 million gain on the sale of another investment. 
GAAP net income was $130.7 million or $0.60 per diluted share. GAAP net income including -- includes nonrecurring favorable tax events of $18.7 million, which was primarily driven by the release of a deferred tax liability due to some IP ownership restructuring that occurred in the quarter related to our prior acquisition of ISSC. 
In the June quarter, the non-GAAP tax rate was 11.4% and the GAAP tax benefit rate was 9.1%. The GAAP tax rate was favorably impacted by the $18.7 million of nonrecurring tax events that I mentioned before. Our tax rate is impacted by the mix of geographical profits, withholding taxes associated with our licensing business and the tax effect of various nonrecurring items. Excluding any nonrecurring events, we expect our longer-term forward-looking non-GAAP effective tax rate to be about 11% to 12%. 
To summarize the after-tax impact that non-GAAP adjustments had on Microchip's earnings per share in the June quarter, acquisition-related items were about $0.163, share-based compensation was about $0.049, nonrecurring favorable tax events were about $0.086, a favorable difference on the sale of 2 investments during the quarter was about $0.074 and the difference in GAAP and non-GAAP noncontrolling interest at ISSC was a favorable of about $0.002 and noncash interest expense was about $0.035.
The dividend declared today of $0.358 per share will be paid on September 25, 2015, to shareholders of record on September 11, 2015. The cash payment associated with this dividend is expected to be about $75.4 million. This quarter's dividend will be our 52nd consecutive quarter of making a dividend payment. We have never made reductions in our dividend. In fact, this quarter's increase marks the 46th occasion we have increased the dividend payment, and our cumulative dividends paid amounts to almost $2.6 billion. This program continues to be an important component of how we return value to our shareholders. 
During the time period that Microchip has paid dividends, we have also purchased back $1.4 billion of our stock. Our combined cash return to shareholders since the inception of our dividend program is almost $4 billion. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. Consolidated inventory at June 30, 2015, was $303.7 million or 123 days, up by 12 days to the levels at the end of the March quarter. Inventory at our distributors was at 37 days and was flat to the March quarter levels. I want to remind you that our distribution revenue throughout the world is recognized on a sell-through basis. We have taken actions to moderate our production activities and our foundry wafer purchases in the current quarter to moderate any inventory build. 
The cash generation in the June quarter, excluding the purchase of the remaining shares of ISSC that were outstanding, our dividend payment, the changes in borrowing levels under the revolving line of credit, was $143.8 million. As of June 30, the consolidated cash and total investment position was $2.43 billion, and our borrowings under our revolving line of credit were $497 million. Excluding dividend payments and our acquisition activities, we expect total cash and investment position to grow by approximately $100 million to $120 million in the September quarter. 
Capital spending was approximately $33.6 million in the June quarter. We expect about $35 million in capital spending in the September quarter, and overall capital expenditures for fiscal year 2016 have been reduced from our previously guided $160 million to $125 million. We are selectively adding capital to support the growth of our production capabilities for our fast-growing new products and technologies and to bring in-house more of the assembly and test operations that are currently outsourced. Depreciation expense in the June quarter was $24.7 million. I will now ask Ganesh to give his comments on the performance of the business in the June quarter. Ganesh?"

Let's take a closer look at the performance of each of our product lines, starting with microcontrollers. Our microcontroller revenue was up 1.3% in the June quarter as compared to the year-ago quarter. We experienced the same broad-based weakness that has been reported by many of our peer group companies. In aggregate, over the last 4 rolling quarters, our microcontroller business was up 8% over the prior 4 rolling quarters. We are continuing to deliver innovative new 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit microcontrollers that we believe will enable us to grow faster than the market and gain further market share. Microcontrollers represented 65.2% of Microchip's overall revenue in the June quarter. 
Moving to our analog business, our analog business was down 0.6% in the June quarter as compared to the year-ago quarter. In this business too, we experienced the broad-based weakness that has been reported by many of our peers. In aggregate, over the last 4 rolling quarters, our analog business was up 11% over the prior 4 rolling quarters. Our analog business represented 23.8% of Microchip's overall revenue in the June quarter. We continue to develop and introduce a wide range of innovative and proprietary new products to fuel the future growth of our analog business. 
Our memory business, which is comprised of our Serial E-squared memory products as well as our SuperFlash Memory products, was down 4.8% in the June quarter as compared to the year-ago quarter. We continue to run our memory business in a disciplined fashion that maintains consistently high profitability, enables our licensing business and [indiscernible] our microcontroller customers to complete their solutions. Our memory business represented 5.95% of Microchip's overall revenue in the June quarter. 
Now a short update about Micrel and where we are in the integration process. Since the announcement of the acquisition on May 7, we have spent considerable time understanding Micrel's businesses, organization and systems. We have developed detailed integration plans that we have begun to execute today, after the transaction closed. As we described in our May 7 conference call, Micrel has 3 product line business units and a small foundry services business. Micrel's linear and power solutions business is a classic highly fragmented analog business. This business, together with Microchip's standard analog business, will form a strong combined portfolio that will serve a broader base of applications and customers and enable a number of cross-selling opportunities. 
Micrel's LAN solutions business consists of a range of Ethernet products, including controllers, switches and physical layers for different speeds. This business will strengthen Microchip's overall Ethernet offering and also enable us to serve a broader set of applications and customers. Micrel's timing solutions business consists of a comprehensive clock and timing portfolio, including frequency control products, clock generation products and clock distribution products. It also includes MEMS technology capability that enables much smaller timing components. This is a brand new field of play for Microchip that we're excited about and see sales synergies with our existing product lines. It also gives us visibility into a range of applications and customers that are new to Microchip, who could be customers for our microcontroller, analog and memory products. 
In regards to sales and field applications, we are planning to keep Micrel's sales and applications engineers, and will cross-train them as well as our existing sales force so that we can find revenue synergies through cross-selling opportunities. We also plan to combine the distribution networks of the 2 companies. Some of the distributors for the 2 companies are the same, while others are different, and our goal is to achieve expanded distribution capabilities for the products of both companies. In regards to manufacturing, Steve will comment in more detail in his section, along with how we expect to see the accretion results rolling out over time. With that, let me now pass it to Steve for some general comments about our business, the Micrel acquisition, as well as the guidance going forward. Steve?"

Today, I would like to first comment on the results of the fiscal first quarter of 2016 and then provide guidance for the fiscal second quarter of 2016, including comments on the integration plan for Micrel",1415,"Thank you, Ganesh, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I would like to first comment on the results of the fiscal first quarter of 2016 and then provide guidance for the fiscal second quarter of 2016, including comments on the integration plan for Micrel.
Our June quarter results were shy of our guidance, but were consistent with what others in the semiconductor industry have reported. The quarter started out well, but the negative effects of a very weak economy in China and challenges in Europe, led by a very weak euro, caused us to finish the quarter below our guidance in revenue. We were able to keep the non-GAAP gross margin percentage and earnings per share within the guidance, albeit on the low end of it. Gross margin of 58.3%, operating expense of 25.6% and operating profit of 32.6% were all very respectable achievements. The June quarter was also our 99th consecutive profitable quarter. I want to thank all the employees of Microchip for their contribution in this remarkable achievement of 99 consecutive profitable quarters. I look forward to the current quarter being our 100th consecutive profitable quarter, an achievement unmatched in our industry. 
I will now provide guidance for the September quarter, including Micrel revenue. Our guidance is based on the assumption that Europe will continue to be in the doldrums, and is made worse so by the summer holidays; and China, which has been the engine of growth in the past, remaining slow. In preparing our guidance, we have done bottoms-up analysis region-by-region, distributor-by-distributor and by major customers. We have also included Micrel revenue from today, August 3, to the end of the quarter as we understand it. 
We expect our net sales in the September quarter to be between $532 million to $569 million, and includes $35 million revenue from the sales of Micrel products from today until the end of the quarter. Without counting Micrel, we expect our net sales to be between flat to down 7% sequentially. I want to remind you that the guidance we are providing is for non-GAAP revenue, which will include sell-through from the distributors of Micrel. The GAAP revenue will be much lower since GAAP does not account for products sold through distributors that were shipped prior to the acquisition effective date. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be between 57.6% to 57.8% for the combined company, negatively impacted by the lower gross margin of Micrel and sequentially flat without Micrel. We expect the non-GAAP operating expenses to be about 27.7% to 28.9% of sales for the combined company, and we expect the combined company non-GAAP operating profit to be between 28.7% to 30.1% of sales, again negatively impacted by higher expenses and lower operating profit of Micrel. We expect non-GAAP earnings per share to be between $0.58 to $0.66 per share. The non-GAAP earnings per share are impacted by $0.015 dilution coming from the consolidation of Micrel. Now let me provide you more updates on the Micrel acquisition. We closed the acquisition today, and we now begin the hard work of integration to drive shareholder value. The shareholders of Micrel overwhelmingly approved the merger, with 98.95% of the Micrel shares that voted in the favor of the merger. As part of the transaction, we will pay an aggregate of approximately $430 million in cash and issue an aggregate of 8,626,795 shares. Taking into consideration the equity awards assumed and the cash and investments on Micrel's balance sheet at the closing date, the total enterprise value is in line with the $744 million that we shared with investors when we announced the signing of the definitive agreement back on May 7, 2015. 
Now Ganesh has already covered some of the elements of our integration planning, I will cover 4 areas: First, I will explain to you how the revenue of Micrel will be consolidated into Microchip's SEC revenue reporting; second, I will explain our plans in the IT systems and manufacturing area; third, I will give you guidance on the accretion we expect to get from this acquisition; and finally, I will provide guidance for the long-term financial model for Micrel. 
So let us begin with how the revenue of Micrel will be included in the Microchip's revenue reporting. Micrel breaks down its revenue into 3 reported product lines: Linear and Power Solutions, LAN Solutions, and TCG, which is timing and communication. 99% of Micrel revenue will be reported as analog revenue within Microchip. Approximately 1% of Micrel revenue is on products that are built on a microcontroller core. They're, in fact, special-purpose microcontrollers and will be reported within our microcontroller revenue. 
Now I will give you an update on our integration planning in the IT systems area and in the manufacturing area. In the last 3 months, we have studied the business systems of both companies. Micrel is a small company and its business systems are relatively old. We have laid out a plan that will transfer all of Micrel to Microchip's business systems. We estimate that this transition will be completed sometime in the calendar first quarter of 2016. 
Regarding manufacturing, Micrel operates a small 6-inch fab in San Jose that is about 30% utilized at the current time. Micrel also uses outside foundries for some of its products, mostly for the LAN solutions group. These happen to be some of the same foundries that Microchip uses for some of our products that are outsourced. We will leave those products running in the outside fabs. Our focus will be to deal with the 6-inch San Jose fab that is severely underutilized. Microchip will transfer all of Micrel's products from its 6-inch fab to other facilities. A majority of these products will transfer to Microchip's two 8-inch fabs: one in Tempe, Arizona and the second in Gresham, Oregon. Some products may be transferred to other outside foundries wherever there is a better process technology match. We believe that this transfer of all the products from Micrel fab to either Microchip fabs or to some foundries will take about 1 to 2 years. After that, San Jose's 6-inch fab will be closed. 
Regarding back-end manufacturing, Micrel subcontracts 100% of its assembly and test. Many of the packages that Micrel uses are different than Microchip's, but many are the same. Where appropriate, we will apply our expanded purchasing power to lower our supply chain costs. As in the other acquisitions, we will also do a careful make-versus-buy analysis on each package and product type. Over time, some of the products and packages may be brought into our assembly-and-test facility while others will remain at the subcontractors. Microchip will, however, combine the manufacturing systems like wafer ordering, assembly and test management, shipments and warehouses. We expect that all Micrel products will be shipping from Microchip's manufacturing systems by the end of the first calendar quarter of 2016. 
With this, let me now provide guidance for accretion from the acquisition of Micrel. We currently expect the Micrel acquisition to be $0.015 dilutive to our non-GAAP EPS for the partial September quarter. The acquisition just closed today, so we need more time to study and provide you further guidance. But with the rate at which we expect the integration to progress, our initial estimate will be that Micrel acquisition will be breakeven throughout December quarter non-GAAP EPS. For longer term, after we have closed the San Jose fab, which is about 1 to 2 years from now, we expect Micrel to add about $0.25 of accretion to Microchip's yearly non-GAAP EPS. These numbers are preliminary and depend upon the speed of integration efforts and the health of the underlying economy in general. 
Finally, let me provide guidance for the long-term financial model for Micrel. Our track record has shown that Microchip has been able to improve the business model of its acquisitions, and our combined business model has remained virtually unchanged. 
If, that after San Jose fab is closed and the older 6-inch inventory has been depleted, we will improve the financial model of Micrel to be equivalent to that of Microchip. Given all the complications of accounting for the acquisitions, including amortization of intangibles, restructuring charges and inventory write-up, Microchip will continue to provide guidance and track its results. On a non-GAAP basis, we believe that non-GAAP results provide more meaningful comparison to prior quarters, and we request that the analysts continue to report the non-GAAP estimates to First Call. With this, operator, will you please poll for questions?"

As the earnings season has progressed, a number of investors and analysts have commented and have asked me how I thought about the current environment in the semiconductor, and if this is something that started in October of last year with our earnings volume at that time. I have not engaged into any conversation with any of the investors and analysts because we were in the quiet time. And I thought if the question was asked, I'll address it here. So here it is, that's really the first question. While it's really painful to visit that period again, we do believe that the first signs of a slowdown in China were visible at that time. We saw that through thousands of small customers who were experiencing economic headwinds and not buying enough products. This was further enhanced by a very tight credit environment that was prevalent at that time in China. Then after a warning, the December quarter numbers for most semiconductor companies were curbed by an average of about 5%. The companies in the supply chain of 1 mobile customer were a notable exception. Then came the March quarter, which was seasonally weak for most companies due to Chinese New Year, and also some others blamed it on euro weakness, which was indeed a new phenomena. So then came the June quarter, which is traditionally a very strong quarter in China, and we saw a broad-based miss from the industry, led by China. And the September quarter guidance has been very weak, also driven by China. Now we have semiconductor companies admitting that there was indeed inventory build in China and in the distribution that needs to correct. We knew from the companies that we have acquired, and others that we conducted diligence on but did not acquire, that there was a broad-based sell-in-driven inventory build in distribution channel, which the prevailing rate of demand could not support. You can only play a sell-in game for so long. And this time, it kind of truly went a bit longer. But now everyone's numbers have been cut significantly. A large number of companies are now selling well below the stock prices on October 9, prior to our call. When I said, and I quote, ""We believe that another industry correction has begun, and that this correction will be seen more broadly across the industry in the near future."" It probably took a quarter longer than it has taken historically, likely masked by the smartphone supply chain, with everyone having some exposure to it. But really, in answer to investor and analyst question, I suggest this is pretty much a continuation of the phenomenon that we saw last October."

So essentially, we have taken our analog business and internally in Microchip, split it into 2 portions, one is called the analog power and interface division and second is called the mixed signal and linear division, they're both about equal size. And then the entire Micrel Linear and Power business is folding into one of those divisions within the analog power management business. So we will apply our principles, our metrics of R&D and all that. When I look at R&D as a percentage of sales for analog, Microchip is one of the most efficient in the industry. We don't break out individual R&D, but the amount of R&D we spend to get the margins and revenue and all that, and Micrel is one of the worst, when you look at the numbers. So we have to move this from worst to best, and we have done that with others. We've done that with SST and SMSC and Supertex. And over and over and over, you have seen that. That's what we have to do here. Then there is a LAN business here, which is about $50 million, $50 million, $60 million, and that also we're going to completely fold that into Microchip's USB and networking division, where our LAN business resides. That, again, will then really benefit from our methodologies, our metrics, our management and everything else. And the third business here is the timing business, which is a new business for us, and we will keep that as a business unit, but it will report into one of our seasoned general managers, so it can also get the mentorship and really move towards that model."

Considering this correction happening in June and September, what would manifest for December, it's kind of hard to see right now. But as we go through the quarter, one could make a case that December quarters should not seasonally be weak, because ordinarily, December quarter is followed by a very strong June and September, this time it is not. But I'm not making that prediction today. I'd have to see the quarter. I have to see the booking, the backlog, everything else, and talk about it later, maybe as we go on the road. The biggest leverage here, short term, is really improving Micrel's business. And I think there is a fair amount of opportunity for us to do that. And the largest leverage comes from the fab. There is 30% utilization in the fab, and we dramatically lower its cost by transferring product. And the first 5 products will be running out of Microchip's fab in about 6 weeks."

First of all, the Gresham factory in Oregon is a newer factory, and in a newer factory, we need a -- once every 5 years, we need a major shutdown to repair things that can be repaired while the factory's running. And that shutdown has been previously scheduled for a year, for this October. And that shutdown usually is about 7 to 8 days. We have to shut the factory, and we reserve for it going into that shutdown and it's a planned shutdown, we have to do it every once in 5 years. We are currently planning to tack on a few more days to it to bring the inventory down because the factory will be shutdown anyway. And rather than starting and stopping, it'll be best to extend that a little bit. Then the factory in Tempe is a much older facility and doesn't have as many redundancies built into it. And the Tempe facility [indiscernible] and we always do that in December, over the holidays. So this time again, we'll have a shutdown in Tempe facility over the holidays, and we are planning to tack on a few more days to that to correct the inventory. So you will see our internal inventory rise in the September quarter, but then it corrects because we've got shutdowns in both factories in the December quarter. The normal shutdown, we accrue it over 4 quarters in our balance over the year, but the extra shutdown days, we're going to do -- will charge it to the current quarter, basically, in the quarter it happens, which will be the calendar Q4. So Q4 gross margin would be impacted. I don't know whether Eric is able to dollarize it at this point in time, and whether you do a GAAP or non-GAAP, that would be a one-time phenomena."

And I think, if you look at various people's commentary last quarter, April was good and May was good and then June fell off. So I think people make these adjustments through the quarter, and a better July doesn't necessarily mean a better end of September for us or anybody else, because customers can correct that any time in the quarter. Sometimes people place bookings earlier, so whatever product they need for the quarter, they have commitment from the supplier that they will get the product for their needs. And then it's easy for them to cancel or slip it out, that I only need it in September, give it to me in October, than to have a situation where they don't place the order, and September quarter comes, they need something and somebody's lead time is more than 4 weeks, and they can't get it. So customers simply have very little penalty for getting their queue in line, almost no penalty. So therefore, it's not unusual for the first quarter sometime to see stronger bookings, only to get corrected later on. And I would not read so much into it for anybody."

Then you have 4 years to figure it out, what you're going to do with it. Do I build it through our fab, or take it to a subcontractor, transfer the equipment, do whatever. So that's what we will do. That's not going to hold up the fab. And Micrel is a small company as a percentage of Microchip's. So even though there'll be a strategic transition inventory built on the products we are transferring, and on the product we're not transferring, the products we are transferring, you have to build some strategic inventory on those too, because you've got to give the customer time to qualify 8-inch material while they have 6-inch material available.

During the course of this conference call, we will be making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. 
We wish to caution you that such statements are at predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to our press release as of today as well as our recent filings with the SEC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip's business and results of operations.
In attendance with me today are: Steve Sanghi, Microchip's President and CEO; and Ganesh Moorthy, Microchip's COO. 
I will comment on our second quarter fiscal 2016 financial performance, and Steve and Ganesh will then give their comments on the results, discuss the current business environment as well as our guidance and provide an update on the integration activities acquisition of Micrel, which was closed on today. We will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions.
I want to remind you that we are including information in our press release and this conference call on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.microchip.com, which we believe you will find useful when comparing GAAP and non-GAAP results.
I will now go through some of the operating results, including net sales, gross margin and operating expenses. 
I will be referring to these results on a non-GAAP basis prior to the effects of our acquisition activities and share-based compensation.
Non-GAAP net sales in the September quarter were above the midpoint of our upwardly revised guidance at a record $559.4 million, including $39.5 million of non-GAAP net sales from Micrel and were up 4.8% sequentially from net sales of $534 million in the immediately preceding quarter. 
Non-GAAP net sales were $18 million higher than GAAP net sales, as GAAP does not recognize revenue on the sell-through of product setting in the distribution channel on the day acquisition occurs. 
Revenue by product line in the September quarter was $334.3 million for microcontrollers, a $165.3 million for analog, $30.2 million for memory, $23.2 million for licensing and $6.5 million of other. 
Revenue by geography was $107.5 million in the Americas, a $114.7 million in Europe and $337.2 million in Asia. 
I remind you that we recognize revenue based on where we ship our products to, which tends to skew some of the revenue towards Asia, where a lot of contract manufacturing takes place.
On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were 57.9% in the September quarter and above the high-end of our guidance. 
Non-GAAP operating expenses were 27.5% of sales near the bottom end of our guidance range and non-GAAP operating income was 30.4% of sales, which was about the high-end of our guidance. 
Non-GAAP net income was a $142.9 million, resulting in $0.66 per diluted share, which was at the high-end upwardly revised guidance and $0.03 above the midpoint. 
On a GAAP basis, net sales were $541.4 million and gross margins including share base compensation and acquisition related expenses were 55.6% in the September quarter. 
GAAP gross margins include the impact of $2.4 million of share base compensation, $11.5 million of gross margin impact from the distributor revenue adjustment that I mentioned earlier, and $9.1 million acquired inventory valuation cost and acquisition related restructuring costs.
Total operating expenses were $226 million or 41.7% of sales and include acquisition intangible amortization of $43.8 million, share-based compensation of $20.6 million, $1.1 million of acquisition related expenses and special charges of $6.6 million. 
GAAP net income was $64.9 million or $0.30 per diluted share. We had GAAP nonrecurring unfavorable tax events in the quarter of $6 million, which were primarily driven by reporting a valuation allowance against some state tax credits.
In the September quarter, non-GAAP tax rate was 11.5% and the GAAP tax benefit rate was 20.3%. 
The GAAP tax rate was favorably impacted by the impact of some of the micro acquisition purchase accounting adjustments. Our tax rate is impacted by the mix of your graphical profits, withholding taxes associated with our licensing business and the tax effect of various nonrecurring items. 
Excluding any nonrecurring events, we expect our longer-term forward-looking non-GAAP effective tax rate to be between 11% and 12%.
To summarize the after-tax impact of the non-GAAP adjusted had on Microchip's earnings per share in the September quarter, acquisition related items were about $0.229, share base compensation was about $0.067. Nonrecurring unfavorable tax events or were about $0.028, and noncash interest expense was about $0.036. The dividend declared today of $35.85 per share will be paid on December 4, 2015, to shareholders of record on November 20th, 2015. 
The cash payment associated with this dividend is expected to be about $72.9 million. This quarter's dividend will be our 53 consecutive quarter of making a dividend payment. 
We have never made reductions in our dividend and in fact, this quarter's increase marks the 47th occasion, we have increased the dividend payment, and our cumulative dividends paid are $2.66 billion. 
This program continues to be an important component of how we return value to our shareholders. During the same time period that Microchip has paid dividends, we have also purchase back $1.4 billion of our stock. Excluding the issuance of subsequent buyback of the shares Micrel acquisition. Our combined cash return to shareholders since inception of our dividend program is over $4 billion. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. Consolidated inventory at September 30, 2015 was $363.8 million and includes $37.2 million of fair value markup on Micrel's inventory required by GAAP purchase accounting. Excluding the purchase accounting, Microchip had 125 days of inventory at September 30, 2015, which is up by 2 days from the levels at the end of the June quarter.
[Audio Gap]
35 days, which is down 2 days from the June quarter levels. I want to remind you that historically, Microchip's distribution revenue throughout the world has been recognized on a sell-through basis. 
Micrel has distributors at a recognizing revenue on a selling basis. Microchip is changing the contractual relationships with these distributors during the December quarter, which will result in sell-through revenue recognition in the future. 
Our non-GAAP revenue guidance provided in our release today is based on sell-through revenue recognition for the Micrel distributors for the entire December quarter in order to provide investors with a view of true end market demand for our product. 
There will be a difference in GAAP revenue recognition as any inventory in the distribution channel at today's of the conversion to sell-through accounting will not be recognized as revenue for GAAP accounting purposes.
The cash generation in the September quarter excluding our acquisition activities, our dividend payment and changes in borrowing levels under our revolving line of credit was $150 million. 
As of September 30, the consolidated cash and total investment position was $2.586 billion, and our borrowings under our revolving line of credit were $1.296 billion. 
Excluding dividend payments and our acquisition activities, we expect our total cash and investment position to grow by approximately $110 million to $120 million in the December quarter. 
Capital spending was approximately $29.9 million in the September quarter. We expect about $30 million in capital spending in the December quarter, and overall capital expenditures for fiscal year 2016 to be about $125 million. 
We are selectively adding capital to support the growth of our production capabilities for our fast-growing new products and technologies and to bring in house more of the assembly and test operations that are currently outsource.
Depreciation expense in the September quarter was $26.2 million. Over the past several years, Microchip's dividends paid to it's shareholders have been treated as return of capital as Microchip did not have earnings and profits in the United States. 
Due to the Micrel acquisition, Microchip will have earnings and profits in the United States in fiscal year 2016, as we restructure their business into Microchip's corporate structure, which produces a lower tax rate by moving Micrel's foreign intellectual property rates offshore. Through this transaction, we expect to bring back about $250 million of offshore cash to the U.S., and we don't anticipate paying any cash taxes on that amount as we can use net operating losses to offset that income.
We do not have an exact calculation of how much of the dividend payments will be classified as taxable dividends versus return of capital. But our initial estimates are that between 80% and 90% of the calendar year 2015 dividend will be taxable with dividend to our shareholders. We will provide a more accurate estimate of the taxable portion of the dividend in early January. 
This is a one-time event associated with the Micrel acquisition, but it could occur again in the future, if an acquisition with a similar fact pattern to Micrel occurred. 
I will now ask Ganesh to give us comments on the performance of the business in the September quarter. Ganesh?"

Since this is the first time we are including results for Micrel. Before I jump into the product line details, let me remind you how we will be reporting Micrel's results as part of our public reporting segme",665,"Thank you, Eric, and good afternoon, everyone. Since this is the first time we are including results for Micrel. Before I jump into the product line details, let me remind you how we will be reporting Micrel's results as part of our public reporting segments. 
As Eric has already mentioned, what's included in our reporting is a partial quarter of Micrel September quarter results, starting from the close date of August 3. 
Of the Micrel revenue approximately 3% was derivced from foundry services, where Micrel manufactured custom products designed by customers. This revenue is included in our public reporting segment called other. 
The remaining 97% of Micrel's revenue was derived from products developed by Micrel. Of this revenue, over 99.5% of Micrel's revenue this quarter is part of our analog reporting segment, and less than have percent of Micrel's revenue this quarter is part of our Microcontroller reporting segment. 
With that clarification, now let's take a closer look at the performance of each of our product lines starting with Microcontrollers.
Our Microcontroller revenue was down 4% in the September quarter as compared to the June quarter. We experience a same broad-based weakness that has been reported by many of our peer group companies. 
In aggregate, over the last 4 rolling quarters, our Microcontroller business was up 2.7% over the prior 4 rolling quarters. 
We are continuing to deliver innovative new 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit microcontrollers that we believe will enable us to grow faster than the market and gain further market share. Microcontrollers represented 59.7% of Microchip's overall revenue in the September quarter, down a little from last quarter as Micrel's revenue contributed predominantly to our analog reporting segment. 
Moving to analog. Our analog business excluding Micrel results was about flat in the September quarter as compared to the June quarter. And was up 3.6% as compared to the year-ago quarter. 
In this business too, we experienced a broad-based weakness that has been reported by many of our peers. In aggregate, over the last 4 rolling quarters, our analog business was up 8.6% over the prior 4 rolling quarters. 
Our analog business including Micrel results was up 30.1% in the September quarter as compared to the June quarter and was up 34.8% as compared to the year-ago quarter. 
Including Micrel, our analog business represented 29.5% of Microchip's overall revenue in the September quarter. We continue to develop and introduce a wide range of innovative and proprietary new products to fuel the future growth of our analog business, complemented by the products added to our portfolio through acquisitions.
Moving to our memory business, which is comprised of say the lease quite memory products as well as our SuperFlash memory product. This business was down 4.8% in the September quarter as compared to the June quarter. 
We continue to run our memory business in a disciplined fashion that maintains consistently high profitability, enables our licensing business and serves our Microcontroller customers to complete their solutions. Our memory business represented 5.4% of Microchip's overall revenue in the September quarter.
Now a short update about Micrel and where we are in the integration process. Micrel's analog Power business and ethernet business have been completely integrated into Microchip's businesses that focus on the same segments. 
Micrel's timing and the communications business remains a stand-alone business that is part of our analog reporting segment. This is a brand-new field of play for Microchip that we are excited about and fee sales synergies with our existing product lines. It also gives visibility into a range of publications and customers are new to Microchip, who could be customer for Microcontroller analog and memory products. The sales in manufacturing integration continues to go well against our plan. Steve will comment in more detail in his section along with how we expect to see the acquisition results ruling out over time. Let me now pass it to Steve for some general comments about our business, the Micrel acquisition as well as guidance going forward. Steve?"

Today, I would like to first comment on the result of fiscal second quarter of 2016, and then provide guidance for the fiscal third quarter of 2016, including comments on the progress of integration for Mic",1251,"Thank you, Ganesh, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I would like to first comment on the result of fiscal second quarter of 2016, and then provide guidance for the fiscal third quarter of 2016, including comments on the progress of integration for Micrel.
Our September quarter results were better than our upwardly revised guidance. The revenue, gross margin percentage, operating expense percentage and operating profit percentage were all better than the midpoint of our guidance. 
Overall, we executed the quarter extremely well and mixed very difficult industry conditions and ended the quarter with an all-time record net sales. 
We also achieved the top end of our upwardly revised non-GAAP earnings per share guidance and beat the midpoint by $0.03 per share. 
The June quarter was also our 100 consecutive profitable quarter. I want to thank all the employees of Microchip for their dedication and contribution in this remarkable achievement of 100 consecutive profitable quarters. 
An achievement unmatched in an industry. I also want to thank our 90,000-plus customers worldwide for their trust they place in us in selecting our  Solutions as well as our shareholders, particularly our long-term shareholders, who have steadfastly supported us as we build one of the best semiconductor franchises in the industry. I will now provide guidance for the December quarter, including Micrel revenue.
December quarter is seasonally our weakest quarter of the year, investors should be careful in calculating the seasonality, because in 2012, we completed the acquisition of SMSC on August 2, and in 2014, we completed the acquisition of ISSC on July 18. Therefore, December quarter for those here reflected full quarter of revenue from acquisitions, while September quarter included partial quarters, and hence has seasonality for the December quarter. 
The exact calculation of seasonality without the affect of these 2 acquisitions for the past 5 years is minus 3.03%.
We believe that industry conditions continue to be very weak. At the same time, we began this inventory correction earlier than most companies and believe that we are nearing the end of it. We expect our net sales in the December quarter, excluding Micrel to be down between 2% and 6%, we expect Micrel sales for the full December quarter to be between $51 million and $54 million. Adding Micrel sales, we expect the headline total net sales for Microchip for December quarter to be between $539.7 million and $563.5 million, which are between up 0.7% to down 3.5% sequentially. 
As we are nearing the end of this correction, we expect the March 2016 quarter to be sequentially up by low single-digit.
I want to remind you that the guidance we are providing is for non-GAAP revenue, which will include sell-through from the distributors of Micrel. 
The GAAP revenue will be lower since GAAP does not account for products sold through distributors that was shipped prior to the acquisition effective date. 
In the current quarter, we will also be converting many of Micrel distributors from selling revenue recognition to a sell-through revenue recognition to be consistent with that of Microchip. 
We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be between 57.7% to 57.9%, slightly negatively impacted by the full quarter of lower gross margin of Micrel. 
We expect the non-GAAP operating expenses to be between 28.6% and 29.3% of sales, and we expect the non-GAAP operating profit to be between 28.4% and 29.3% of sales, again, negatively impacted by the full quarter of higher expenses and lower operating profit of Micrel. We expect non-GAAP earnings per share to be between $0.58 to $0.64 per share. 
Now let me provide you with more updates on Micrel acquisition and integration. First of all, taking advantage of market volatility, Microchip repurchase the entire 8.626 million shares in the Micrel acquisition from the open market. This purchase was made at a net price of $42.17 per share, which is lower than the $42.888 at which we issued shares in the Micrel acquisition. 
Since then, the stock prices are up about $6.80 per share. So we made an excellent decision and it substantially improves accretion from the Micrel acquisition. Ganesh has already covered some of the elements of our integration planning. 
I will cover few other areas. After studying the business systems of both companies, we had laid out a plan that will transfer all of Micrel to Microchip's business systems. On #1, 2015, just last week, late last week, we transferred all of Micrel's business to Microchip's IT business and financial systems. 
Current quarter's financial close will be on both systems, but for the next quarter, we will have the whole company on only Microchip's IT business and financial system. Regarding manufacturing, Micrel operates a small 6 inch flat in San Jose, California that is about 30% neutralize. We have begun transferring all of them Micrel products flat to Microchip's to 8 inch facilities in Tempe, Arizona and Oregon. 
We currently anticipate that we will complete the transfer and close Micrel's fab in about 1 year from the acquisition date of August 3.
Regarding back end manufacturing. Micrel subcontracts were 1 100% of it's assembly and test, many of the packages that Micrel uses are than different than Microchip, but many as same. As in the other acquisitions, we are doing a careful make versus by analysis on each package and product type. We have already decided to begin transferring some products from outside subcontractors to Microchip's Thailand facility. We will be transferring many more products over time. But keeping in mind that completing the closure of San Jose fab is a highest priority. Microchip is also combining the manufacturing system, wafer ordering, assembly and test management shipments and warehouses all these items are at various stages of integration and should all be completed by the end of first calendar quarter of 2016.
Regarding salesforce. In the current quarter, we are combining salesforces and distribution of both companies, we expect that this will provide an expanded distribution channel for Micrel's products. 
With this, let me now provide guidance for accretion from the acquisition of Micrel. 
Micrel acquisition was about $0.0.7 accretive in the September quarter. We expect Micrel acquisition to be about $0.1.1 accretive to the December quarter non-GAAP EPS. 
This accretion will continue to increase every quarter, reaching approximately $0.25 annual run rate by the end of calendar year 2016. 
These numbers depend upon the speed of integration efforts and the health of the underlying in general. Finally, let me provide guidance for the long-term financial model for Micrel. 
Our track record as shown that Microchip have been able to improve the business model of its acquisitions, and. Our combined business model has remained virtually unchanged. As an example, in case of Supertex acquisition, which we closed on April 1, 2014. The gross margin last quarter was over 60% and the operating profit was over 30%. 
At the same time -- at the time of the acquisition, Supertex gross margin was 47% and operating margin was only 9.3%.
We believe that after San Jose fab of Micrel is close, and the older 6-inch inventory has been depleted, we will improve the financial model of Micrel also to be equivalent To that of 
[Audio Gap]
Acquisition, including amortization of intangibles, restructuring charges and inventory write-offs, Microchip will continue to provide guidance results on non-GAAP basis. We believe that non-GAAP results provide more meaningful comparison to prior quarters and we request the analyst continue to report their non-GAAP estimates to first call. With this, operator, will you please pull for questions?"

So Supertex acquisition is now about 18 months. So I think, probably another 6 months or more to go, and we should start to see some growth coming from this new design wins on Supertex.

Now all that environment is currently dialed in our guidance. Question is does it get any worse than that. Is there another shoe to drop driven by anything. That we don't know, that kind of view we don't have. This is based on what we are able to see today."

During the course of this conference call, we will be making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. 
We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to our press release as of today as well as our recent filings with the SEC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip's business and results of operations.
In attendance with me today are: Steve Sanghi, Microchip's President and CEO; and Ganesh Moorthy, Microchip's COO. 
I will comment on our second quarter fiscal 2016 financial performance, and Steve and Ganesh will then give their comments on the results, discuss the current business environment as well as our guidance and provide an update on the integration activities associated with Micrel acquisition, which closed on August 3. We will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions.
I want to remind you that we are including information in our press release and this conference call on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on the Investor Relation page of our website at www.microchip.com, which we believe you will find useful when comparing GAAP and non-GAAP results.
I will now go through some of the operating results, including net sales, gross margin and operating expenses. I will be referring to these results on a non-GAAP basis prior to the effects of our acquisition activities and share-based compensation.
Non-GAAP net sales in the September quarter were above the midpoint of our upwardly revised guidance at a record $559.4 million, including $39.5 million of non-GAAP net sales from Micrel and were up 4.8% sequentially from net sales of $534 million in the immediately preceding quarter. 
Non-GAAP net sales were $18 million higher than GAAP net sales, as GAAP does not recognize revenue on the sell-through of product setting in the distribution channel on the date an acquisition occurs. 
Revenue by product line in the September quarter was $334.3 million for microcontrollers, a $165.3 million for analog, $30.2 million for memory, $23.2 million for licensing and $6.5 million of other. 
Revenue by geography was $107.5 million in the Americas, a $114.7 million in Europe and $337.2 million in Asia. 
I remind you that we recognize revenue based on where we ship our products to, which tends to skew some of the revenue towards Asia, where a lot of contract manufacturing takes place.
On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were 57.9% in the September quarter and above the high end of our guidance. Non-GAAP operating expenses were 27.5% of sales near the bottom end of our guidance range, and non-GAAP operating income was 30.4% of sales, which was above the high end of our guidance. 
Non-GAAP net income was a $142.9 million, resulting in $0.66 per diluted share, which was at the high end of our upwardly revised guidance and $0.03 above the midpoint. 
On a GAAP basis, net sales were $541.4 million. And gross margins, including share-based compensation and acquisition-related expenses, were 55.6% in the September quarter. 
GAAP gross margins include the impact of $2.4 million of share-based compensation, $11.5 million of gross margin impact from the distributor revenue adjustment that I mentioned earlier, and $9.1 million in acquired inventory valuation cost and acquisition-related restructuring cost.
Total operating expenses were $226 million or 41.7% of sales and include acquisition intangible amortization of $43.8 million, share-based compensation of $20.6 million, $1.1 million of acquisition-related expenses and special charges of $6.6 million. 
GAAP net income was $64.9 million or $0.30 per diluted share. We had GAAP nonrecurring unfavorable tax events in the quarter of $6 million, which were primarily driven by reporting a valuation allowance against some state tax credits.
In the September quarter, the non-GAAP tax rate was 11.5%, and the GAAP tax benefit rate was 20.3%.
The GAAP tax rate was favorably impacted by the impact of some of the micro acquisition purchase accounting adjustments. Our tax rate is impacted by the mix of geographical profits, withholding taxes associated with our licensing business and the tax effect of various nonrecurring items. Excluding any nonrecurring events, we expect our longer-term forward-looking non-GAAP effective tax rate to be between 11% and 12%.
To summarize the after-tax impact that the non-GAAP adjustments had on Microchip's earnings per share in the September quarter. Acquisition-related items were about $0.229, share-based compensation was about $0.067. Nonrecurring unfavorable tax events were about $0.028, and noncash interest expense was about $0.036.
The dividend declared today of $0.3585 per share will be paid on December 4, 2015, to shareholders of record on November 20, 2015. The cash payments associated with this dividend is expected to be about $72.9 million. This quarter's dividend will be our 53rd consecutive quarter of making a dividend payment. We have never made reductions in our dividend, and in fact, this quarter's increase marks the 47th occasion we have increased the dividend payment. And our cumulative dividends paid are $2.66 billion. 
This program continues to be an important component of how we return value to our shareholders. During the same time period that Microchip has paid dividends, we have also purchased back $1.4 billion of our stock excluding the issuance and subsequent buyback of the shares in the Micrel acquisition. Our combined cash returned to shareholders since the inception of our dividend program was over $4 billion. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. Consolidated inventory at September 30, 2015, was $363.8 million and includes $37.2 million of fair value markup on Micrel's inventory required by GAAP purchase accounting. Excluding the purchase accounting adjustments, Microchip had 125 days of inventory at September 30, 2015, which is up by 2 days from the levels at the end of the June quarter. Excluding the purchase accounting adjustments, the inventory at our distributors is at 35 days, which is down 2 days from the June quarter levels. I want to remind you that historically, Microchip's distribution revenue throughout the world has been recognized on a sell-through basis. 
Micrel has some distributors that are recognizing revenue on a selling basis. Microchip is changing the contractual relationships with these distributors during the December quarter, which will result in sell-through revenue recognition in the future. 
Our non-GAAP revenue guidance provided in our release today is based on sell-through revenue recognition for the Micrel distributors for the entire December quarter in order to provide investors with a view of true end-market demand for our products. 
There will be a difference in GAAP revenue recognition as any inventory in the distribution channel at the date [ph] of the conversion to sell-through accounting will not be recognized as revenue for GAAP accounting purposes.
The cash generation in the September quarter excluding our acquisition activities, our dividend payment and changes in borrowing levels under our revolving line of credit was $150 million. 
As of September 30, the consolidated cash and total investment position was $2.586 billion, and our borrowings under our revolving line of credit were $1.296 billion. 
Excluding dividend payments and our acquisition activities, we expect our total cash and investment position to grow by approximately $110 million to $120 million in the December quarter. 
Capital spending was approximately $29.9 million in the September quarter. We expect about $30 million in capital spending in the December quarter, and overall capital expenditures for fiscal year 2016 to be about $125 million. 
We are selectively adding capital to support the growth of our production capabilities for our fast-growing new products and technologies and to bring in-house more of the assembly and test operations that are currently outsourced. Depreciation expense in the September quarter was $26.2 million.
Over the past several years, Microchip's dividends paid to its shareholders had been treated as return of capital as Microchip did not have earnings and profits in the United States.
Due to the Micrel acquisition, Microchip will have earnings and profits in the United States in fiscal year 2016, as we restructure their business into Microchip's corporate structure, which produces a lower tax rate by moving Micrel's foreign intellectual property rights offshore.
Through this transaction, we expect to bring back about $250 million of offshore cash to the U.S., and we don't anticipate paying any cash taxes on that amount as we can use net operating losses to offset that income.
We do not have an exact calculation of how much of the dividend payments will be classified as taxable dividends versus return of capital. But our initial estimates are that between 80% and 90% of the calendar year 2015 dividend will be taxable with dividend to our shareholders. We will provide a more accurate estimate of the taxable portion of the dividend in early January. 
This is a onetime event associated with the Micrel acquisition, but it could occur again in the future, if an acquisition with a similar tax [ph] pattern to Micrel occurr. 
I will now ask Ganesh to give his comments on the performance of the business in the September quarter. Ganesh?"
31500,315249354,892857,"Microchip Technology Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2015",2015-11-04,"Earnings Calls","Microchip Technology Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Eric, and good afternoon, everyone. Since this is the first time we are including results for Micrel, before I jump into the product line details, let me remind you how we will be reporting Micrel's results as part of our public reporting segme",667,"Thank you, Eric, and good afternoon, everyone. Since this is the first time we are including results for Micrel, before I jump into the product line details, let me remind you how we will be reporting Micrel's results as part of our public reporting segments. 
As Eric has already mentioned, what's included in our reporting is a partial quarter of Micrel's September quarter results, starting from the close date of August 3. 
Of the Micrel revenue, approximately 3% was derived from foundry services, where Micrel manufactured custom products designed by customers. This revenue is included in our public reporting segment called other. The remaining 97% of Micrel's revenue was derived from products developed by Micrel.
Of this revenue, over 99.5% of Micrel's revenue this quarter is part of our analog reporting segment, while less than 0.5% of Micrel's revenue this quarter is part of our microcontroller reporting segment. 
With that clarification, now let's take a closer look at the performance of each of our product lines starting with microcontrollers.
Our microcontroller revenue was down 4% in the September quarter as compared to the June quarter. We experienced the same broad-based weakness that has been reported by many of our peer group companies. In aggregate, over the last 4 rolling quarters, our microcontroller business was up 2.7% over the prior 4 rolling quarters. 
We are continuing to deliver innovative new 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit microcontrollers that we believe will enable us to grow faster than the market and gain further market share. Microcontrollers represented 59.7% of Microchip's overall revenue in the September quarter, down a little from last quarter as Micrel's revenue contributed predominantly to our analog reporting segment. 
Moving to analog. Our analog business excluding Micrel results was about flat in the September quarter as compared to the June quarter and was up 3.6% as compared to the year ago quarter. 
In this business too, we experienced a broad-based weakness that has been reported by many of our peers. In aggregate, over the last 4 rolling quarters, our analog business was up 8.6% over the prior 4 rolling quarters. 
Our analog business including Micrel results was up 30.1% in the September quarter as compared to the June quarter and was up 34.8% as compared to the year ago quarter. 
Including Micrel, our analog business represented 29.5% of Microchip's overall revenue in the September quarter. We continue to develop and introduce a wide range of innovative and proprietary new products to fuel the future growth of our analog business, complemented by the products added to our portfolio through acquisitions.
Moving to our memory business, which is comprised of our Serial E-squared memory products as well as our SuperFlash Memory products, this business was down 4.8% in the September quarter as compared to the June quarter. 
We continue to run our memory business in a disciplined fashion that maintains consistently high profitability, enables our licensing business and serves our microcontroller customers to complete their solution. Our memory business represented 5.4% of Microchip's overall revenue in the September quarter.
Now a short update about Micrel and where we are in the integration process. Micrel's analog power business and Ethernet business have been completely integrated into Microchip's businesses that focus on the same segments. 
Micrel's timing and communications business remains a stand-alone business that is part of our analog reporting segment. This is a brand-new field of play for Microchip that we're excited about and see sales synergies with our existing product lines. It also gives us visibility into a range of applications and customers that are new to Microchip, who could be customers for our microcontroller, analog and memory products.
The sales in manufacturing integration continues to go well against our plan. Steve will comment in more detail in his section along with how we expect to see the acquisition results rolling out over time.
Let me now pass it to Steve for some general comments about our business, the Micrel acquisition as well as our guidance going forward. Steve?"
31500,315249354,892857,"Microchip Technology Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2015",2015-11-04,"Earnings Calls","Microchip Technology Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Ganesh, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I would like to first comment on the results of fiscal second quarter of 2016 and then provide guidance for the fiscal third quarter of 2016, including comments on the progress of integration for Mic",1266,"Thank you, Ganesh, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I would like to first comment on the results of fiscal second quarter of 2016 and then provide guidance for the fiscal third quarter of 2016, including comments on the progress of integration for Micrel.
Our September quarter results were better than our upwardly revised guidance. The revenue, gross margin percentage, operating expense percentage and operating profit percentage were all better than the midpoint of our guidance.
Overall, we executed the quarter extremely well amidst very difficult industry conditions and ended the quarter with an all-time record net sales.  We also achieved the top end of our upwardly revised non-GAAP earnings per share guidance and beat the midpoint by $0.03 per share. 
The June quarter was also our 100th consecutive profitable quarter. I want to thank all the employees of Microchip for their dedication and contribution in this remarkable achievement of 100 consecutive profitable quarters, an achievement unmatched in our industry.
I also want to thank our 90,000-plus customers worldwide for the trust they place in us in selecting our solutions as well as our shareholders, particularly our long-term shareholders, who have steadfastly supported us as we build one of the best semiconductor franchises in the industry.
I will now provide guidance for the December quarter, including Micrel revenue. December quarter is seasonally our weakest quarter of the year. Investors should be careful in calculating the seasonality because in 2012, we completed the acquisition of SMSC on August 2, and in 2014, we completed the acquisition of ISSC on July 18. Therefore, December quarter for those years reflected full quarter of revenue from acquisitions, while September quarter included partial quarters, and hence distorted seasonality for the December quarter. The exact calculation of seasonality without the effect of these 2 acquisitions for the past 5 years is minus 3.03%.
We believe that industry conditions continue to be very weak. At the same time, we began this inventory correction earlier than most companies and believe that we are nearing the end of it. We expect our net sales in the December quarter, excluding Micrel to be down between 2% and 6% sequentially.
We expect Micrel sales for the full December quarter to be between $51 million and $54 million. Adding Micrel sales, we expect the headline total net sales for Microchip for December quarter to be between $539.7 million and $563.5 million, which are between up 0.7% to down 3.5% sequentially. As we are nearing the end of this correction, we expect the March 2016 quarter to be sequentially up by low single-digit.
I want to remind you that the guidance we are providing is for non-GAAP revenue, which will include sell-through from the distributors of Micrel. The GAAP revenue will be lower since GAAP does not account for products sold through distributors that was shipped prior to the acquisition effective date. 
In the current quarter, we will also be converting many of Micrel distributors from selling revenue recognition to a sell-through revenue recognition to be consistent with that of Microchip. 
We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be between 57.7% to 57.9%, slightly negatively impacted by the full quarter of lower gross margin of Micrel. We expect the non-GAAP operating expenses to be between 28.6% and 29.3% of sales, and we expect the non-GAAP operating profit to be between 28.4% and 29.3% of sales, again, negatively impacted by the full quarter of higher expenses and lower operating profit of Micrel. We expect non-GAAP earnings per share to be between $0.58 to $0.64 per share. 
Now let me provide you with more updates on Micrel acquisition and integration. First of all, taking advantage of market volatility, Microchip repurchased the entire 8.626 million shares issued in the Micrel acquisition from the open market. This purchase was made at a net price of $42.17 per share, which is lower than the $42.888 price at which we issued shares in the Micrel acquisition. Since then, the stock price is up about $6.80 per share. So we made an excellent decision, and it substantially improves accretion from the Micrel acquisition.
Ganesh has already covered some of the elements of our integration planning. I will cover a few other areas. After studying the business systems of both companies, we had laid out a plan that will transfer all of Micrel to Microchip's business systems. On November 1, 2015, just last week, late last week, we transferred all of Micrel's business to Microchip's IT business and financial systems. 
Current quarter's financial close will be on both systems, but for the next quarter, we will have the whole company on only Microchip's IT business and financial system.
Regarding manufacturing, Micrel operates a small 6-inch fab in San Jose, California, that is about 30% utilized. We have begun transferring all of the Micrel products from its 6-inch fab to Microchip's to 8-inch facilities in Tempe, Arizona, and Gresham, Oregon. We currently anticipate that we will complete the transfer and close Micrel's fab in about 1 year from the acquisition date of August 3.
Regarding back-end manufacturing. Micrel subcontracts 100% of its assembly and test. Many of the packages that Micrel uses are than different than Microchip's, but many as same. As in the other acquisitions, we are doing a careful make-versus-buy analysis on each package and product type. We have already decided to begin transferring some products from outside subcontractors to Microchip's Thailand facility. We will be transferring many more products over time, but keeping in mind that completing the closure of San Jose fab is our highest priority.
Microchip is also combining the manufacturing systems, wafer ordering, assembly and test management, shipments and warehouses. All these items are at various stages of integration and should all be completed by the end of first calendar quarter of 2016.
Regarding sales force. In the current quarter, we are combining sales forces and distribution of both companies. We expect that this will provide an expanded distribution channel for Micrel's products. 
With this, let me now provide guidance for accretion from the acquisition of Micrel. Micrel acquisition was about $0.007 accretive in the September quarter. We expect Micrel acquisition to be about $0.011 accretive to the December quarter non-GAAP EPS.
This accretion will continue to increase every quarter, reaching approximately $0.25 annual run rate by the end of calendar year 2016. These numbers depend upon the speed of integration efforts and the health of the underlying economy in general.
Finally, let me provide guidance for the long-term financial model for Micrel. Our track record has shown that Microchip has been able to improve the business model of its acquisitions, and our combined business model has remained virtually unchanged. As an example, in case of Supertex acquisition, which we closed on April 1, 2014, the gross margin last quarter was over 60% and the operating profit was over 30%. 
At the same time -- at the time of the acquisition, Supertex gross margin was 47% and operating margin was only 9.3%. We believe that after San Jose fab of Micrel is closed and the oldest 6-inch inventory has been depleted, we will improve the financial model of Micrel also to be equivalent to that of Microchip.
Given all the complications of accounting for the acquisitions, including amortization of intangibles, restructuring charges and inventory write-up, Microchip will continue to provide guidance and track its results on non-GAAP basis. We believe that non-GAAP results provide more meaningful comparison to prior quarters, and we request that the analysts continue to report their non-GAAP estimates to First Call.
With this, operator, will you please poll for questions?"

I mean, as far as China is concerned, I mean, we actually called it first. We were seeing substantial issues in China at thousands of small customers who pulled their horns very, very quickly because when the small customers make a mistake just once, the end result is they go out of business while the large companies have substantial cushion and can carry inventories and correct them over time and can cash flow and buy through distributors and contract manufacturers can return products and do all those things. And many of the small customers, when they make a mistake, there is no second chance. So that's why, our visibility to thousands and thousands of small customers have always taught us over the years and over the decades actually that we get a glimpse of what's coming ahead in the business first, and which is what we had told you. So yes, the problems materialized in China as we expected. Now as you look at the next quarter, yes, it's the year of the Chinese New Year -- the quarter of the Chinese New Year, and we will expect our business in China and Asia to be sequentially down.

During the course of this conference call, we will be making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. 
We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to our press release as of today as well as our recent filings with the SEC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip's business and results of operations.
In attendance with me today are: Steve Sanghi, Microchip's President and CEO; and Ganesh Moorthy, Microchip's COO. 
I will comment on our second quarter fiscal 2016 financial performance, and Steve and Ganesh will then give their comments on the results, discuss the current business environment as well as our guidance and provide an update on the integration activities associated with Micrel acquisition, which closed on August 3. We will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions.
I want to remind you that we are including information in our press release and this conference call on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on the Investor Relation page of our website at www.microchip.com, which we believe you will find useful when comparing GAAP and non-GAAP results.
I will now go through some of the operating results, including net sales, gross margin and operating expenses. I will be referring to these results on a non-GAAP basis prior to the effect of our acquisition activities and share-based compensation.
Non-GAAP net sales in the September quarter were above the midpoint of our upwardly revised guidance at a record $559.4 million, including $39.5 million of non-GAAP net sales from Micrel and were up 4.8% sequentially from net sales of $534 million in the immediately preceding quarter. 
Non-GAAP net sales were $18 million higher than GAAP net sales, as GAAP does not recognize revenue on the sell-through of product setting in the distribution channel on the date an acquisition occurs. 
Revenue by product line in the September quarter was $334.3 million for microcontrollers, a $165.3 million for analog, $30.2 million for memory, $23.2 million for licensing and $6.5 million of other. 
Revenue by geography was $107.5 million in the Americas, $114.7 million in Europe and $337.2 million in Asia. 
I remind you that we recognize revenue based on where we ship our products to, which tends to skew some of the revenue towards Asia where a lot of contract manufacturing takes place.
On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were 57.9% in the September quarter and above the high end of our guidance. Non-GAAP operating expenses were 27.5% of sales near the bottom end of our guidance range, and non-GAAP operating income was 30.4% of sales, which was above the high end of our guidance. 
Non-GAAP net income was a $142.9 million, resulting in $0.66 per diluted share, which was at the high end of our upwardly revised guidance and $0.03 above the midpoint. 
On a GAAP basis, net sales were $541.4 million and gross margins, including share-based compensation and acquisition-related expenses, were 55.6% in the September quarter. 
GAAP gross margins include the impact of $2.4 million of share-based compensation, $11.5 million of gross margin impact from the distributor revenue adjustment that I mentioned earlier, and $9.1 million in acquired inventory valuation cost and acquisition-related restructuring cost.
Total operating expenses were $226 million or 41.7% of sales and include acquisition intangible amortization of $43.8 million, share-based compensation of $20.6 million, $1.1 million of acquisition-related expenses and special charges of $6.6 million. 
GAAP net income was $64.9 million or $0.30 per diluted share. We had GAAP nonrecurring unfavorable tax events in the quarter of $6 million, which were primarily driven by reporting a valuation allowance against some state tax credits.
In the September quarter, the non-GAAP tax rate was 11.5%, and the GAAP tax benefit rate was 20.3%.
The GAAP tax rate was favorably impacted by the impact of some of the micro acquisition purchase accounting adjustments. Our tax rate is impacted by the mix of geographical profits, withholding taxes associated with our licensing business and the tax effect of various nonrecurring items. Excluding any nonrecurring events, we expect our longer-term forward-looking non-GAAP effective tax rate to be between 11% and 12%.
To summarize the after-tax impact that the non-GAAP adjustments had on Microchip's earnings per share in the September quarter. Acquisition-related items were about $0.229, share-based compensation was about $0.067. Nonrecurring unfavorable tax events were about $0.028, and noncash interest expense was about $0.036.
The dividend declared today of $0.3585 per share will be paid on December 4, 2015 to shareholders of record on November 20, 2015. The cash payments associated with this dividend is expected to be about $72.9 million. This quarter's dividend will be our 53rd consecutive quarter of making a dividend payment. We have never made reductions in our dividend, and in fact, this quarter's increase marks the 47th occasion we have increased the dividend payment. And our cumulative dividends paid are $2.66 billion. 
This program continues to be an important component of how we return value to our shareholders. During the same time period that Microchip has paid dividends, we have also purchased back $1.4 billion of our stock, excluding the issuance and subsequent buyback of the shares in the Micrel acquisition. Our combined cash returned to shareholders since the inception of our dividend program was over $4 billion. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. Consolidated inventory at September 30, 2015, was $363.8 million and includes $37.2 million of fair value markup on Micrel's inventory required by GAAP purchase accounting. Excluding the purchase accounting adjustments, Microchip had 125 days of inventory at September 30, 2015, which is up by 2 days from the levels at the end of the June quarter. Excluding the purchase accounting adjustments, the inventory at our distributors is at 35 days, which is down 2 days from the June quarter levels. I want to remind you that historically, Microchip's distribution revenue throughout the world has been recognized on a sell-through basis. 
Micrel has some distributors that are recognizing revenue on a selling basis. Microchip is changing the contractual relationships with these distributors during the December quarter, which will result in sell-through revenue recognition in the future. 
Our non-GAAP revenue guidance provided in our release today is based on sell-through revenue recognition for the Micrel distributors for the entire December quarter in order to provide investors with a view of true end-market demand for our products. 
There will be a difference in GAAP revenue recognition as any inventory in the distribution channel at the date [ph] of the conversion to sell-through accounting will not be recognized as revenue for GAAP accounting purposes.
The cash generation in the September quarter excluding our acquisition activities, our dividend payment and changes in borrowing levels under our revolving line of credit was $150 million. 
As of September 30, the consolidated cash and total investment position was $2.586 billion, and our borrowings under our revolving line of credit were $1.296 billion. 
Excluding dividend payments and our acquisition activities, we expect our total cash and investment position to grow by approximately $110 million to $120 million in the December quarter. 
Capital spending was approximately $29.9 million in the September quarter. We expect about $30 million in capital spending in the December quarter, and overall capital expenditures for fiscal year 2016 to be about $125 million. 
We are selectively adding capital to support the growth of our production capabilities for our fast-growing new products and technologies and to bring in-house more of the assembly and test operations that are currently outsourced. Depreciation expense in the September quarter was $26.2 million.
Over the past several years, Microchip's dividends paid to its shareholders had been treated as return of capital as Microchip did not have earnings and profits in the United States.
Due to the Micrel acquisition, Microchip will have earnings and profits in the United States in fiscal year 2016, as we restructure their business into Microchip's corporate structure, which produces a lower tax rate by moving Micrel's foreign intellectual property rights offshore.
Through this transaction, we expect to bring back about $250 million of offshore cash to the U.S., and we don't anticipate paying any cash taxes on that amount as we can use net operating losses to offset that income.
We do not have an exact calculation of how much of the dividend payments will be classified as taxable dividends versus return of capital, but our initial estimates are that between 80% and 90% of the calendar year 2015 dividend will be taxable as dividends to our shareholders. We will provide a more accurate estimate of the taxable portion of the dividend in early January. 
This is a onetime event associated with the Micrel acquisition, but it could occur again in the future, if an acquisition with a similar tax [ph] pattern to Micrel occurred. 
I will now ask Ganesh to give his comments on the performance of the business in the September quarter. Ganesh?"

Since this is the first time we are including results for Micrel, before I jump into the product line details, let me remind you how we will be reporting Micrel's results as part of our public reporting segments. 
As Eric has already mentioned, what's included in our reporting is a partial quarter of Micrel's September quarter results, starting from the close date of August 3. 
Of the Micrel revenue, approximately 3% was derived from foundry services, where Micrel manufactured custom products designed by customers. This revenue is included in our public reporting segment called other. The remaining 97% of Micrel's revenue was derived from products developed by Micrel.
Of this revenue, over 99.5% of Micrel's revenue this quarter is part of our analog reporting segment, while less than 0.5% of Micrel's revenue this quarter is part of our microcontroller reporting segment. 
With that clarification, now let's take a closer look at the performance of each of our product lines starting with microcontrollers.
Our microcontroller revenue was down 4% in the September quarter as compared to the June quarter. We experienced the same broad-based weakness that has been reported by many of our peer group companies. In aggregate, over the last 4 rolling quarters, our microcontroller business was up 2.7% over the prior 4 rolling quarters. 
We are continuing to deliver innovative new 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit microcontrollers that we believe will enable us to grow faster than the market and gain further market share. Microcontrollers represented 59.7% of Microchip's overall revenue in the September quarter, down a little from last quarter as Micrel's revenue contributed predominantly to our analog reporting segment. 
Moving to analog. Our analog business excluding Micrel results was about flat in the September quarter as compared to the June quarter and was up 3.6% as compared to the year ago quarter. 
In this business too, we experienced a broad-based weakness that has been reported by many of our peers. In aggregate, over the last 4 rolling quarters, our analog business was up 8.6% over the prior 4 rolling quarters. 
Our analog business including Micrel results was up 30.1% in the September quarter as compared to the June quarter and was up 34.8% as compared to the year ago quarter. 
Including Micrel, our analog business represented 29.5% of Microchip's overall revenue in the September quarter. We continue to develop and introduce a wide range of innovative and proprietary new products to fuel the future growth of our analog business, complemented by the products added to our portfolio through acquisitions.
Moving to our memory business, which is comprised of our Serial E-squared memory products as well as our SuperFlash Memory products, this business was down 4.8% in the September quarter as compared to the June quarter. 
We continue to run our memory business in a disciplined fashion that maintains consistently high profitability, enables our licensing business and serves our microcontroller customers to complete their solution. Our memory business represented 5.4% of Microchip's overall revenue in the September quarter.
Now a short update about Micrel and where we are in the integration process. Micrel's analog power business and Ethernet business have been completely integrated into Microchip's businesses that focus on the same segments. 
Micrel's timing and communications business remains a stand-alone business that is part of our analog reporting segment. This is a brand-new field of play for Microchip that we're excited about and see sales synergies with our existing product lines. It also gives us visibility into a range of applications and customers that are new to Microchip, who could be customers for our microcontroller, analog and memory products.
The sales in manufacturing integration continues to go well against our plan. Steve will comment in more detail in his section along with how we expect to see the acquisition results rolling out over time.
Let me now pass it to Steve for some general comments about our business, the Micrel acquisition as well as our guidance going forward. Steve?"
31500,315249354,892900,"Microchip Technology Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2015",2015-11-04,"Earnings Calls","Microchip Technology Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Ganesh, and good afternoon, everyone.

Today, I would like to first comment on the results of fiscal second quarter of 2016 and then provide guidance for the fiscal third quarter of 2016, including comments on the progress of integration for Micrel.
Our September quarter results were better than our upwardly revised guidance. The revenue, gross margin percentage, operating expense percentage and operating profit percentage were all better than the midpoint of our guidance.
Overall, we executed the quarter extremely well amidst very difficult industry conditions and ended the quarter with an all-time record net sales. We also achieved the top end of our upwardly revised non-GAAP earnings per share guidance and beat the midpoint by $0.03 per share. 
The June quarter was also our 100th consecutive profitable quarter. I want to thank all the employees of Microchip for their dedication and contribution in this remarkable achievement of 100 consecutive profitable quarters, an achievement unmatched in our industry.
I also want to thank our 90,000-plus customers worldwide for the trust they place in us in selecting our solutions as well as our shareholders, particularly our long-term shareholders who have steadfastly supported us as we build one of the best semiconductor franchises in the industry.
I will now provide guidance for the December quarter, including Micrel revenue. December quarter is seasonally our weakest quarter of the year. Investors should be careful in calculating the seasonality because in 2012, we completed the acquisition of SMSC on August 2, and in 2014, we completed the acquisition of ISSC on July 18. Therefore, December quarter for those years reflected full quarter of revenue from acquisitions, while September quarter included partial quarters, and hence distorted seasonality for the December quarter. The exact calculation of seasonality without the effect of these 2 acquisitions for the past 5 years is minus 3.03%.
We believe that industry conditions continue to be very weak. At the same time, we began this inventory correction earlier than most companies and believe that we are nearing the end of it. We expect our net sales in the December quarter, excluding Micrel to be down between 2% and 6% sequentially.
We expect Micrel sales for the full December quarter to be between $51 million and $54 million. Adding Micrel sales, we expect the headline total net sales for Microchip for December quarter to be between $539.7 million and $563.5 million, which are between up 0.7% to down 3.5% sequentially. As we are nearing the end of this correction, we expect the March 2016 quarter to be sequentially up by low single-digit.
I want to remind you that the guidance we are providing is for non-GAAP revenue, which will include sell-through from the distributors of Micrel. The GAAP revenue will be lower since GAAP does not account for products sold to distributors that was shipped prior to the acquisition effective date. 
In the current quarter, we will also be converting many of Micrel distributors from selling revenue recognition to a sell-through revenue recognition to be consistent with that of Microchip. 
We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be between 57.7% to 57.9%, slightly negatively impacted by the full quarter of lower gross margin of Micrel. We expect the non-GAAP operating expenses to be between 28.6% and 29.3% of sales, and we expect the non-GAAP operating profit to be between 28.4% and 29.3% of sales, again, negatively impacted by the full quarter of higher expenses and lower operating profit of Micrel. We expect non-GAAP earnings per share to be between $0.58 to $0.64 per share. 
Now let me provide you with more updates on Micrel acquisition and integration. First of all, taking advantage of market volatility, Microchip repurchased the entire 8.626 million shares issued in the Micrel acquisition from the open market. This purchase was made at a net price of $42.17 per share, which is lower than the $42.888 price at which we issued shares in the Micrel acquisition. Since then, the stock price is up about $6.80 per share. So we made an excellent decision, and it substantially improves accretion from the Micrel acquisition.
Ganesh has already covered some of the elements of our integration planning. I will cover a few other areas. After studying the business systems of both companies, we had laid out a plan that will transfer all of Micrel to Microchip's business systems. On November 1, 2015, just last week, late last week, we transferred all of Micrel's business to Microchip's IT business and financial systems. 
Current quarter's financial close will be on both systems, but for the next quarter, we will have the whole company on only Microchip's IT business and financial system.
Regarding manufacturing, Micrel operates a small 6-inch fab in San Jose, California, that is about 30% utilized. We have begun transferring all of the Micrel products from its 6-inch fab to Microchip's to 8-inch facilities in Tempe, Arizona, and Gresham, Oregon. We currently anticipate that we will complete the transfer and close Micrel's fab in about 1 year from the acquisition date of August 3.
Regarding back-end manufacturing. Micrel subcontracts 100% of its assembly and test. Many of the packages that Micrel uses are than different than Microchip's, but many are same. As in the other acquisitions, we are doing a careful make-versus-buy analysis on each package and product type. We have already decided to begin transferring some products from outside subcontractors to Microchip's Thailand facility. We will be transferring many more products over time, but keeping in mind that completing the closure of San Jose fab is our highest priority.
Microchip is also combining the manufacturing systems, wafer ordering, assembly and test management, shipments and warehouses. All these items are at various stages of integration and should all be completed by the end of first calendar quarter of 2016.
Regarding sales force. In the current quarter, we are combining sales forces and distribution of both companies. We expect that this will provide an expanded distribution channel for Micrel's products. 
With this, let me now provide guidance for accretion from the acquisition of Micrel. Micrel acquisition was about $0.007 accretive in the September quarter. We expect Micrel acquisition to be about $0.011 accretive to the December quarter non-GAAP EPS.
This accretion will continue to increase every quarter, reaching approximately $0.25 annual run rate by the end of calendar year 2016. These numbers depend upon the speed of integration efforts and the health of the underlying economy in general.
Finally, let me provide guidance for the long-term financial model for Micrel. Our track record has shown that Microchip has been able to improve the business model of its acquisitions, and our combined business model has remained virtually unchanged. As an example, in case of Supertex acquisition, which we closed on April 1, 2014, the gross margin last quarter was over 60% and the operating profit was over 30%. 
At the same time -- at the time of the acquisition, Supertex gross margin was 47% and operating margin was only 9.3%. We believe that after San Jose fab of Micrel is closed and the older 6-inch inventory has been depleted, we will improve the financial model of Micrel also to be equivalent to that of Microchip.
Given all the complications of accounting for the acquisitions, including amortization of intangibles, restructuring charges and inventory write-up, Microchip will continue to provide guidance and track its results on non-GAAP basis. We believe that non-GAAP results provide more meaningful comparison to prior quarters, and we request that the analysts continue to report their non-GAAP estimates to First Call.
With this, operator, will you please poll for questions?"

I mean, as far as China is concerned, I mean, we actually called it first. We were seeing substantial issues in China at thousands of small customers who pulled their horns very, very quickly because when the small customers make a mistake just once, the end result is they go out of business while the large companies have substantial cushion and can carry inventories and correct them over time and can cash flow and buy through distributors and contract manufacturers can return products and do all those things. And many of the small customers, when they make a mistake, there is no second chance. So that's why our visibility to thousands and thousands of small customers have always taught us over the years, and over the decades actually that we get a glimpse of what's coming ahead in the business first, in which is what we had told you. So yes, the problems materialized in China as we expected. Now as you look at the next quarter, yes, it's the year of the Chinese New Year -- the quarter of the Chinese New Year, and we will expect our business in China and Asia to be sequentially down. But we make up for that elsewhere with a very, very strong Europe and good America. And many times, our March quarter is sequentially up and we expect this trend, too."

During the course of this conference call, we will be making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. 
We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to our press release as of today as well as our recent filings with the SEC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip's business and results of operations.
In attendance with me today are: Steve Sanghi, Microchip's President and CEO; and Ganesh Moorthy, Microchip's COO. 
I will comment on our second quarter fiscal 2016 financial performance, and Steve and Ganesh will then give their comments on the results, discuss the current business environment as well as our guidance and provide an update on the integration activities associated with Micrel acquisition, which closed on August 3. We will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions.
I want to remind you that we are including information in our press release and this conference call on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on the Investor Relation page of our website at www.microchip.com, which we believe you will find useful when comparing GAAP and non-GAAP results.
I will now go through some of the operating results, including net sales, gross margin and operating expenses. I will be referring to these results on a non-GAAP basis prior to the effect of our acquisition activities and share-based compensation.
Non-GAAP net sales in the September quarter were above the midpoint of our upwardly revised guidance at a record $559.4 million, including $39.5 million of non-GAAP net sales from Micrel and were up 4.8% sequentially from net sales of $534 million in the immediately preceding quarter. 
Non-GAAP net sales were $18 million higher than GAAP net sales, as GAAP does not recognize revenue on the sell-through of product setting in the distribution channel on the date an acquisition occurs. 
Revenue by product line in the September quarter was $334.3 million for microcontrollers, a $165.3 million for analog, $30.2 million for memory, $23.2 million for licensing and $6.5 million of other. 
Revenue by geography was $107.5 million in the Americas, $114.7 million in Europe and $337.2 million in Asia. 
I remind you that we recognize revenue based on where we ship our products to, which tends to skew some of the revenue towards Asia where a lot of contract manufacturing takes place.
On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were 57.9% in the September quarter and above the high end of our guidance. Non-GAAP operating expenses were 27.5% of sales near the bottom end of our guidance range, and non-GAAP operating income was 30.4% of sales, which was above the high end of our guidance. 
Non-GAAP net income was a $142.9 million, resulting in $0.66 per diluted share, which was at the high end of our upwardly revised guidance and $0.03 above the midpoint. 
On a GAAP basis, net sales were $541.4 million and gross margins, including share-based compensation and acquisition-related expenses, were 55.6% in the September quarter. 
GAAP gross margins include the impact of $2.4 million of share-based compensation, $11.5 million of gross margin impact from the distributor revenue adjustment that I mentioned earlier, and $9.1 million in acquired inventory valuation cost and acquisition-related restructuring cost.
Total operating expenses were $226 million or 41.7% of sales and include acquisition intangible amortization of $43.8 million, share-based compensation of $20.6 million, $1.1 million of acquisition-related expenses and special charges of $6.6 million. 
GAAP net income was $64.9 million or $0.30 per diluted share. We had GAAP nonrecurring unfavorable tax events in the quarter of $6 million, which were primarily driven by reporting a valuation allowance against some state tax credits.
In the September quarter, the non-GAAP tax rate was 11.5%, and the GAAP tax benefit rate was 20.3%.
The GAAP tax rate was favorably impacted by the impact of some of the micro acquisition purchase accounting adjustments. Our tax rate is impacted by the mix of geographical profits, withholding taxes associated with our licensing business and the tax effect of various nonrecurring items. Excluding any nonrecurring events, we expect our longer-term forward-looking non-GAAP effective tax rate to be between 11% and 12%.
To summarize the after-tax impact that the non-GAAP adjustments had on Microchip's earnings per share in the September quarter. Acquisition-related items were about $0.229, share-based compensation was about $0.067. Nonrecurring unfavorable tax events were about $0.028, and noncash interest expense was about $0.036.
The dividend declared today of $0.3585 per share will be paid on December 4, 2015 to shareholders of record on November 20, 2015. The cash payments associated with this dividend is expected to be about $72.9 million. This quarter's dividend will be our 53rd consecutive quarter of making a dividend payment. We have never made reductions in our dividend, and in fact, this quarter's increase marks the 47th occasion we have increased the dividend payment. And our cumulative dividends paid are $2.66 billion. 
This program continues to be an important component of how we return value to our shareholders. During the same time period that Microchip has paid dividends, we have also purchased back $1.4 billion of our stock, excluding the issuance and subsequent buyback of the shares in the Micrel acquisition. Our combined cash returned to shareholders since the inception of our dividend program was over $4 billion. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. Consolidated inventory at September 30, 2015, was $363.8 million and includes $37.2 million of fair value markup on Micrel's inventory required by GAAP purchase accounting. Excluding the purchase accounting adjustments, Microchip had 125 days of inventory at September 30, 2015, which is up by 2 days from the levels at the end of the June quarter. Excluding the purchase accounting adjustments, the inventory at our distributors is at 35 days, which is down 2 days from the June quarter levels. I want to remind you that historically, Microchip's distribution revenue throughout the world has been recognized on a sell-through basis. 
Micrel has some distributors that are recognizing revenue on a selling basis. Microchip is changing the contractual relationships with these distributors during the December quarter, which will result in sell-through revenue recognition in the future. 
Our non-GAAP revenue guidance provided in our release today is based on sell-through revenue recognition for the Micrel distributors for the entire December quarter in order to provide investors with a view of true end-market demand for our products. 
There will be a difference in GAAP revenue recognition as any inventory in the distribution channel at the date [ph] of the conversion to sell-through accounting will not be recognized as revenue for GAAP accounting purposes.
The cash generation in the September quarter excluding our acquisition activities, our dividend payment and changes in borrowing levels under our revolving line of credit was $150 million. 
As of September 30, the consolidated cash and total investment position was $2.586 billion, and our borrowings under our revolving line of credit were $1.296 billion. 
Excluding dividend payments and our acquisition activities, we expect our total cash and investment position to grow by approximately $110 million to $120 million in the December quarter. 
Capital spending was approximately $29.9 million in the September quarter. We expect about $30 million in capital spending in the December quarter, and overall capital expenditures for fiscal year 2016 to be about $125 million. 
We are selectively adding capital to support the growth of our production capabilities for our fast-growing new products and technologies and to bring in-house more of the assembly and test operations that are currently outsourced. Depreciation expense in the September quarter was $26.2 million.
Over the past several years, Microchip's dividends paid to its shareholders had been treated as return of capital as Microchip did not have earnings and profits in the United States.
Due to the Micrel acquisition, Microchip will have earnings and profits in the United States in fiscal year 2016, as we restructure their business into Microchip's corporate structure, which produces a lower tax rate by moving Micrel's foreign intellectual property rights offshore.
Through this transaction, we expect to bring back about $250 million of offshore cash to the U.S., and we don't anticipate paying any cash taxes on that amount as we can use net operating losses to offset that income.
We do not have an exact calculation of how much of the dividend payments will be classified as taxable dividends versus return of capital, but our initial estimates are that between 80% and 90% of the calendar year 2015 dividend will be taxable as dividends to our shareholders. We will provide a more accurate estimate of the taxable portion of the dividend in early January. 
This is a onetime event associated with the Micrel acquisition, but it could occur again in the future, if an acquisition with a similar tax [ph] pattern to Micrel occurred. 
I will now ask Ganesh to give his comments on the performance of the business in the September quarter. Ganesh?"
31500,315249354,894499,"Microchip Technology Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2015",2015-11-04,"Earnings Calls","Microchip Technology Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Eric, and good afternoon, everyone. Since this is the first time we are including results for Micrel, before I jump into the product line details, let me remind you how we will be reporting Micrel's results as part of our public reporting segme",667,"Thank you, Eric, and good afternoon, everyone. Since this is the first time we are including results for Micrel, before I jump into the product line details, let me remind you how we will be reporting Micrel's results as part of our public reporting segments. 
As Eric has already mentioned, what's included in our reporting is a partial quarter of Micrel's September quarter results, starting from the close date of August 3. 
Of the Micrel revenue, approximately 3% was derived from foundry services, where Micrel manufactured custom products designed by customers. This revenue is included in our public reporting segment called other. The remaining 97% of Micrel's revenue was derived from products developed by Micrel.
Of this revenue, over 99.5% of Micrel's revenue this quarter is part of our analog reporting segment, while less than 0.5% of Micrel's revenue this quarter is part of our microcontroller reporting segment. 
With that clarification, now let's take a closer look at the performance of each of our product lines starting with microcontrollers.
Our microcontroller revenue was down 4% in the September quarter as compared to the June quarter. We experienced the same broad-based weakness that has been reported by many of our peer group companies. In aggregate, over the last 4 rolling quarters, our microcontroller business was up 2.7% over the prior 4 rolling quarters. 
We are continuing to deliver innovative new 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit microcontrollers that we believe will enable us to grow faster than the market and gain further market share. Microcontrollers represented 59.7% of Microchip's overall revenue in the September quarter, down a little from last quarter as Micrel's revenue contributed predominantly to our analog reporting segment. 
Moving to analog. Our analog business excluding Micrel results was about flat in the September quarter as compared to the June quarter and was up 3.6% as compared to the year ago quarter. 
In this business too, we experienced a broad-based weakness that has been reported by many of our peers. In aggregate, over the last 4 rolling quarters, our analog business was up 8.6% over the prior 4 rolling quarters. 
Our analog business including Micrel results was up 30.1% in the September quarter as compared to the June quarter and was up 34.8% as compared to the year ago quarter. 
Including Micrel, our analog business represented 29.5% of Microchip's overall revenue in the September quarter. We continue to develop and introduce a wide range of innovative and proprietary new products to fuel the future growth of our analog business, complemented by the products added to our portfolio through acquisitions.
Moving to our memory business, which is comprised of our Serial E-squared memory products as well as our SuperFlash Memory products, this business was down 4.8% in the September quarter as compared to the June quarter. 
We continue to run our memory business in a disciplined fashion that maintains consistently high profitability, enables our licensing business and serves our microcontroller customers to complete their solution. Our memory business represented 5.4% of Microchip's overall revenue in the September quarter.
Now a short update about Micrel and where we are in the integration process. Micrel's analog power business and Ethernet business have been completely integrated into Microchip's businesses that focus on the same segments. 
Micrel's timing and communications business remains a stand-alone business that is part of our analog reporting segment. This is a brand-new field of play for Microchip that we're excited about and see sales synergies with our existing product lines. It also gives us visibility into a range of applications and customers that are new to Microchip, who could be customers for our microcontroller, analog and memory products.
The sales in manufacturing integration continues to go well against our plan. Steve will comment in more detail in his section along with how we expect to see the acquisition results rolling out over time.
Let me now pass it to Steve for some general comments about our business, the Micrel acquisition as well as our guidance going forward. Steve?"
31500,315249354,894499,"Microchip Technology Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2015",2015-11-04,"Earnings Calls","Microchip Technology Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Ganesh, and good afternoon, everyone.

Today, I would like to first comment on the results of fiscal second quarter of 2016 and then provide guidance for the fiscal third quarter of 2016, including comments on the progress of integration for Micrel.
Our September quarter results were better than our upwardly revised guidance. The revenue, gross margin percentage, operating expense percentage and operating profit percentage were all better than the midpoint of our guidance.
Overall, we executed the quarter extremely well amidst very difficult industry conditions and ended the quarter with an all-time record net sales. We also achieved the top end of our upwardly revised non-GAAP earnings per share guidance and beat the midpoint by $0.03 per share. 
The June quarter was also our 100th consecutive profitable quarter. I want to thank all the employees of Microchip for their dedication and contribution in this remarkable achievement of 100 consecutive profitable quarters, an achievement unmatched in our industry.
I also want to thank our 90,000-plus customers worldwide for the trust they place in us in selecting our solutions as well as our shareholders, particularly our long-term shareholders who have steadfastly supported us as we build one of the best semiconductor franchises in the industry.
I will now provide guidance for the December quarter, including Micrel revenue. December quarter is seasonally our weakest quarter of the year. Investors should be careful in calculating the seasonality because in 2012, we completed the acquisition of SMSC on August 2, and in 2014, we completed the acquisition of ISSC on July 18. Therefore, December quarter for those years reflected full quarter of revenue from acquisitions, while September quarter included partial quarters, and hence distorted seasonality for the December quarter. The exact calculation of seasonality without the effect of these 2 acquisitions for the past 5 years is minus 3.03%.
We believe that industry conditions continue to be very weak. At the same time, we began this inventory correction earlier than most companies and believe that we are nearing the end of it. We expect our net sales in the December quarter, excluding Micrel to be down between 2% and 6% sequentially.
We expect Micrel sales for the full December quarter to be between $51 million and $54 million. Adding Micrel sales, we expect the headline total net sales for Microchip for December quarter to be between $539.7 million and $563.5 million, which are between up 0.7% to down 3.5% sequentially. As we are nearing the end of this correction, we expect the March 2016 quarter to be sequentially up by low single-digit.
I want to remind you that the guidance we are providing is for non-GAAP revenue, which will include sell-through from the distributors of Micrel. The GAAP revenue will be lower since GAAP does not account for products sold to distributors that was shipped prior to the acquisition effective date. 
In the current quarter, we will also be converting many of Micrel distributors from selling revenue recognition to a sell-through revenue recognition to be consistent with that of Microchip. 
We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be between 57.7% to 57.9%, slightly negatively impacted by the full quarter of lower gross margin of Micrel. We expect the non-GAAP operating expenses to be between 28.6% and 29.3% of sales, and we expect the non-GAAP operating profit to be between 28.4% and 29.3% of sales, again, negatively impacted by the full quarter of higher expenses and lower operating profit of Micrel. We expect non-GAAP earnings per share to be between $0.58 to $0.64 per share. 
Now let me provide you with more updates on Micrel acquisition and integration. First of all, taking advantage of market volatility, Microchip repurchased the entire 8.626 million shares issued in the Micrel acquisition from the open market. This purchase was made at a net price of $42.17 per share, which is lower than the $42.888 price at which we issued shares in the Micrel acquisition. Since then, the stock price is up about $6.80 per share. So we made an excellent decision, and it substantially improves accretion from the Micrel acquisition.
Ganesh has already covered some of the elements of our integration planning. I will cover a few other areas. After studying the business systems of both companies, we had laid out a plan that will transfer all of Micrel to Microchip's business systems. On November 1, 2015, just last week, late last week, we transferred all of Micrel's business to Microchip's IT business and financial systems. 
Current quarter's financial close will be on both systems, but for the next quarter, we will have the whole company on only Microchip's IT business and financial system.
Regarding manufacturing, Micrel operates a small 6-inch fab in San Jose, California, that is about 30% utilized. We have begun transferring all of the Micrel products from its 6-inch fab to Microchip's to 8-inch facilities in Tempe, Arizona, and Gresham, Oregon. We currently anticipate that we will complete the transfer and close Micrel's fab in about 1 year from the acquisition date of August 3.
Regarding back-end manufacturing. Micrel subcontracts 100% of its assembly and test. Many of the packages that Micrel uses are than different than Microchip's, but many are same. As in the other acquisitions, we are doing a careful make-versus-buy analysis on each package and product type. We have already decided to begin transferring some products from outside subcontractors to Microchip's Thailand facility. We will be transferring many more products over time, but keeping in mind that completing the closure of San Jose fab is our highest priority.
Microchip is also combining the manufacturing systems, wafer ordering, assembly and test management, shipments and warehouses. All these items are at various stages of integration and should all be completed by the end of first calendar quarter of 2016.
Regarding sales force. In the current quarter, we are combining sales forces and distribution of both companies. We expect that this will provide an expanded distribution channel for Micrel's products. 
With this, let me now provide guidance for accretion from the acquisition of Micrel. Micrel acquisition was about $0.007 accretive in the September quarter. We expect Micrel acquisition to be about $0.011 accretive to the December quarter non-GAAP EPS.
This accretion will continue to increase every quarter, reaching approximately $0.25 annual run rate by the end of calendar year 2016. These numbers depend upon the speed of integration efforts and the health of the underlying economy in general.
Finally, let me provide guidance for the long-term financial model for Micrel. Our track record has shown that Microchip has been able to improve the business model of its acquisitions, and our combined business model has remained virtually unchanged. As an example, in case of Supertex acquisition, which we closed on April 1, 2014, the gross margin last quarter was over 60% and the operating profit was over 30%. 
At the same time -- at the time of the acquisition, Supertex gross margin was 47% and operating margin was only 9.3%. We believe that after San Jose fab of Micrel is closed and the older 6-inch inventory has been depleted, we will improve the financial model of Micrel also to be equivalent to that of Microchip.
Given all the complications of accounting for the acquisitions, including amortization of intangibles, restructuring charges and inventory write-up, Microchip will continue to provide guidance and track its results on non-GAAP basis. We believe that non-GAAP results provide more meaningful comparison to prior quarters, and we request that the analysts continue to report their non-GAAP estimates to First Call.
With this, operator, will you please poll for questions?"

And many of the small customers, when they make a mistake, there is no second chance. So that's why our visibility to thousands and thousands of small customers have always taught us over the years, and over the decades actually that we get a glimpse of what's coming ahead in the business first, in which is what we had told you. So yes, the problems materialized in China as we expected.

So this was universal across the board. And sooner or later, those customers got to run their businesses also. When they take those designs to production, you will see sort of the other side of it, a very pent-up new product design activity. As it goes to production, the business really takes off."

But in Micrel's situation, they had not really done any foreign tax planning. And unlike most companies in our space that are maybe more mature, higher revenue, higher profits, they've done that. And so all of Micrel's IP was sitting in -- intellectual property was sitting in the U.S. And so to get that into our structure, we have to move that value of that intellectual property offshore. Microchip is sitting on some net operating losses in the U.S. that can soak up that income coming in. That's net operating losses that have been generated for a variety of different reasons over the course of time. But in this particular situation, we're able to bring the cash back and not pay cash taxes on that in the U.S."
