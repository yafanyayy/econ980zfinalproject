With me for today's call are the other members of Nucor's senior management team, Chief Financial Officer, Jim Frias; and our other Executive Vice Presidents, Jim Darsey, Ladd Hall, Ray Napolitan, Joe Stratman, Dave Sumoski and Chad Utermark. The entire executive management team would like to thank everyone on our Nucor, Harris Steel, David J. Joseph, [indiscernible] NuMit Steel Technologies and Skyline Steel teams for a job extremely well done in 2014. You worked hard, worked smart, worked together, and most importantly, worked safely to deliver solid improvements in our performance, despite the steel industry conditions that remained a very challenging.
I am pleased to report that full year of 2014, net income increased significantly by 46% to $714 million. We also achieved a very robust growth in our cash generated from operations. 2014's operating cash flow represents our strongest performance since 2008, demonstrating the strength of our business model. Best of all, our more than 23,000 teammates continued their excellent work implementing our company's strategy for profitable growth. Subsequent to the last cyclical peak in the steel industry, Nucor has invested significant capital in a large number of projects that improved our cost structure and expand our product portfolios to include more value-added, higher-margined offerings. In 2014, we began to see some of the early benefits from these strategic investments. There are more to come. In 2015, these investments will enhance our ability to navigate through the current challenges presented by turbulence and high levels of imported steel.
I will now ask our CFO, Jim Frias, to review Nucor's fourth quarter performance and financial position. Following Jim's comments, I will update you on current market conditions and execution of our strategy for long-term earnings profitable growth. Jim?"

This out-performance was largely driven by better-than-expected results from our sheet mills, joist and decking",1308,"Thank you, John. Fourth quarter of 2014 earnings at $0.65 per diluted share exceeded our guidance range from $0.50 to $0.55 per diluted share. This out-performance was largely driven by better-than-expected results from our sheet mills, joist and decking business and our direct iron plant in Trinidad. Newly acquired Nucor Steel Gallatin made solid contributions to our fourth quarter earnings and cash flow, even after absorbing about $9 million or $0.02 per diluted share after-tax, a purchase accounting expenses early in the quarter. We are encouraged by our fourth quarter performance given the strong seasonal and other influences dampening volumes during the period. Total sales in [indiscernible] outside customers declined 10.5% in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter. Our strong full year 2014 earnings improvement highlight the value of Nucor's stage 3 product diversity. We are North America's only manufacturer of all 4 major steel mill products: bars, beams, plate and sheet. Our steel sheet shipments of 22 million tons increased more than 6% year-over-year, which is more than double the U.S. steel industry's overall growth rate. The increased steel mill volume is further leveraged by steel mill margin expansion of $32 per ton and has a $37 per ton gain in our average steel sales price of $5 [ph] per ton increase and average cost of iron units consumed.
In addition to the strong property growth at our core Steelmaking Operations, Nucor's downstream, steel product segment more than doubled its profitability in 2014. These businesses are benefiting from the initial stages of recovery in non-residential construction markets. Particularly strong volume growth was achieved in our joist, decking and rebar fabrication products. Nucor's 2014 earnings improvement was achieved despite a significant operating loss at our new DRI facility in Louisiana. Steel used Louisiana 2014 operating loss totaled $135 million or $0.28 per diluted share after-tax and $35 million [ph] or $0.07 per diluted share after tax for the fourth quarter.
Production operations at Louisiana facility have remained since a process experienced a failure in early November. Just to the lead times at the specialty that must be replaced, we estimate the plant will not resume operations until late in the first quarter. The process is not part of the DRI technology utilized by Louisiana, but it is ancillary equipment required to operate the plant. The DRI technology itself has worked well and established new world-class quality levels, as measured by body metallization rates and carbon content. Although Louisiana has been a challenging start-up, it will be a major step forward in the implementation of our long-term raw materials strategy. The recent declines in iron ore pricing and the fourth quarter profits generated by our DRI facility in Trinidad provide further validation to our work over the past decade, establishing and growing our DRI production capacity. A quick comment about our tax rates can be confusing due to the impact of profits from noncontrolling interests. After adjusting our profits belonging to our business process, the effective tax rate was 33.6% for the fourth quarter and 35.3% for the full year of 2014. Nucor's financial position remains strong at the end of 2014. Our growth debt-to-capital ratio was 37%. Cash and short-term investments totaled more than $1.1 billion at the close of 2014, including our net debt-to-capital ratio at approximately 31%. Our next significant debt maturity is not until December of 2017. Nucor's strong liquidity position also includes our $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, which remains undrawn. The facility does not mature until August of 2018. Nucor is the only North American steel producer to hold an investment-grade credit rating.
John mentioned our very robust operating cash flow generation in 2014. Cash provided by operations of approximately $1.3 billion comfortably exceeded capital spending of $668 million combined with cash paid to our shareholders of $475 million. In 2014, Nucor's balance sheet, liquidity and cash flow again allow us to take advantage of the opportunities to do long-term earning power. During the fourth quarter, we completed our purchase of all of the equity of Gallatin Steel for a cash purchase price of approximately $779 million. The acquisition was funded from cash on hand and the issuance of approximately $300 million of commercial paper. By the end of 2014, we've reduced the acquisition-related commercial paper outstanding by half to about $151 million. For 2015, we estimate capital spending will be approximately $500 million. Most of our recent larger-scale projects have been completed or are nearing completion. Our capital spending forecast also reflects our joint concession within Incana, our natural gas working interest partner, to extend our drilling suspension through the end of 2015. This year's capital spending for drilling will be very modest and consistent drilling a few wells required to maintain leasehold rights. Depreciation and amortization for 2015 is expected to total about $700 million.
Nucor's financial strength, as evidenced by our strong balance sheet and healthy cash flow generation through the economic cycle, is bedrock foundation to our mission of growing shareholder value. From this position of strength, we are able to allocate our shareholders' valuable capital to most optimal or attractive usage at any given point in time. Our financial strength allows us to invest in capital projects during the severe industry downturns long-term returns where the long-term returns are most attractive. It allows us to make strategic acquisitions when the right assets at the right price become available in the marketplace. And just as importantly, it allows us to reward our shareholders with a steadily growing base dividend, supplemental dividend during up-cycles and opportunistic share repurchases. During the current downturn from 2009 through 2014, our investments totaled nearly $6 billion with about 2/3 going to capital spending and 1/3 going to acquisitions. These diverse projects all [indiscernible] long-term earnings power. By expanding our product portfolios into higher value-added offerings to the less vulnerable to imports, by improving our cost structure, and finally, by building upon our market leadership positions. Growing stronger during downturns is a long tradition of Nucor. It is how we achieve higher profitability from one single [indiscernible] to the next. With our disciplined approach to capital allocation and success in building long-term earnings power, Nucor is able to reward shareholders with attractive cash returns. Our base dividend has more than tripled since the end of 2007. With the increase effective with net quarterly dividend payment, Nucor has increased its base dividend every year since it first began paying dividend in 1973, or 42 consecutive years. During the last industry up-cycle from 2004 to 2008, Nucor paid a total of $5 per share in supplemental dividends. And over the 10-year period ending in 2014, Nucor returned a total of $6.7 million of capital to our shareholders through dividends and opportunistic stock buybacks. The Nucor team's unrelenting focus remains continuing to build upon our record of being effective stewards of our shareholders' valuable capital.
First quarter of 20 -- first quarter of 2015 earnings will be impacted by the significant headwinds that's developed from the steel industry at the end of 2014. The [indiscernible] oil prices have triggered inventory reductions amongst producers, an important customer group for Nucor and the overall steel industry. At the same time, imports are up dramatically entering 2015. Now [indiscernible] contingency and favorable trends in non-residential construction markets that will benefit both our steel mills and Fabricated Construction Products. Overall, we expect first quarter 2015 earnings will decrease from fourth quarter to a level slightly exceeding the first quarter of 2014. Nucor will again follow our practice of providing quantitative guidance in the final month of the quarter. Whatever short-term economic and steel industry conditions we face in 2015, Nucor's unrivaled position of strength will allow our team to continue to execute on our proven strategies for delivering profitable long-term growth. We appreciate your interest in our company. John?"

Certainly has been an abrupt change in the near-term outlook in recent weeks. The 2 headwinds mentioned by Jim, crashing oil prices and surging imports, will certainly challenge our team during the first quarter, but that's okay. Our team has",1062,"Thanks, Jim. Certainly has been an abrupt change in the near-term outlook in recent weeks. The 2 headwinds mentioned by Jim, crashing oil prices and surging imports, will certainly challenge our team during the first quarter, but that's okay. Our team has faced and overcome challenges and adversity in the past, and we will do it again. Energy is an extremely important driver of demand for steel in the U.S. and here at Nucor. Pipe producers serving the energy markets represent approximately 10% of our steel mill shipments, meaningful production and inventory adjustments on our pipe and tube customers are currently underway. Following this period of marketplace adjustment, we believe the future remains very positive for low-cost energy production in North America. Importantly, lower energy cost, over time, should support increased U.S. manufacturing activity and consumer spending. That is all very positive for Nucor.
The other major headwind is from surging import activity. Full year 2014 imports of finished carbon steel products are estimated to have jumped up to an unreasonable and an exceptional level of approximately 34 million tons. That's an increase of about 37% over 2013 and just under 2006's record level of 35 million tons. Indications are that in January 2015 finished steel imports makes a monthly record of around 3.9 million [ph] tons. These short-term headwinds are all significant. And Nucor is extremely well positioned to navigate through them, and we will. Some key advantages of our company come immediately to mind. We will benefit from a low and highly variable cost structure. Additionally, we expect continued growth in non-residential construction activity. [indiscernible] Our largest-single cost item, as previously mentioned, profitability at our DRI plant in Trinidad is benefiting from the larger declines in iron ore costs. After resuming production, the Louisiana facility will also benefit from what appears to be an oversupply ore markets over at least the next several years. Continuing on the raw material costs topic, we believe that the U.S. scrap is currently significantly overpriced versus iron ore and global scrap markets. Based on increased import steel penetration, scrap international demand for U.S. scrap, the strength of U.S. dollar and moderating U.S. demand for scrap, we expect scrap prices to fall dramatically in early 2013. During this period of transition, Nucor will continue to utilize our unmatched global supply chain to optimize our raw material costs. Our investment in DRI and [indiscernible] as well as our access to international raw material markets Nucor's best-in-class capability and in approaching the market use. Non-residential construction markets account for more than half of the end-use demand to Nucor's products. As measured by square footage, U.S. non-residential construction activity increased by 6.7% in 2014. We expect continued improvement in 2015. It is worth noting that the 2014 square footage activity level represents only about 56% of the 2007's peak activity level. So there's plenty of room for additional improvement. Whenever the steel industry and the economy hit unexpected periods of turbulence, like what we are experiencing now in early 2015, Nucor will do what Nucor always does. We will grow bigger, stronger and more profitable. And we will outperform our competitors. Here are the reasons why Nucor will do this. Our balance sheet and [indiscernible] cash flow cycle generation is unrivaled by any of our competitors. Our industry-leading product end-market diversity continues to grow as we move up the value chain in all of our businesses. The recent expansions in our offerings included normalized and wider and sheet steels, additional SBQ and wire rod product and new piling sections. All of these products are less impacted by irrationally priced imports. Our low-cost structure will benefit from increased DRI production capacity as our new Louisiana facility completes its final process this year. Our commitment to achieving commercial excellence by leveraging Nucor's competitive advantages, such as product diversity and operational flexibility, to create more value for and building stronger relationships with each of our customers. And most importantly, Nucor's employees, the right people. They are our company's greatest assets and our greatest competitive advantage.
Here are just a few of the 2014 achievements implementing our strategy of investing for long-term profitable growth. In the fourth quarter, our new structural steel mill will begin production of its new sheet piling sections. Initial output will sold to Skyline Steel for piling distributor and will be installed next month at a construction project in New Jersey. Nucor-Yamato expanded its product portfolio to include wider piling sections that are wider and stronger, covering more area at a lower installed cost. The market for these high-value-added niche products is currently largely supplied by [indiscernible]. In addition to taking advantage of Nucor-Yamato's world-class steel manufacturing capabilities, our customers will benefit from this new domestic solution, which will create valuable synergies with the other products and services offered by Skyline Steel. Acquired in 2012, Skyline is the market leader in its business with an unrivaled package of engineering support, stocking locations, processing centers and dedicated sales teams. In 2014, Nucor's new Hertford County plate mill leverages capabilities to capture a growing share of a market for value-added plate products. For example, in 2014, Hertford County has more than doubled its share of the bridge market during the current steel industry downturn. Over the same period, shipments to higher-margin OEM customers have doubled as a percent of Nucor's total volume. These value-added products are also less vulnerable to pressure from commodity imports.
Our Nucor Steel sheet mills successful start-up in 2014 of its wide-light capital project continued to build momentum. Shipments on the new wide-light products totaled over 120,000 tons in the first year. Berkeley now has the lightest, hot-roll gauge capacity capabilities of any sheet mill in the southern U.S. market, and with a finished product with above [ph] 72 inches. We estimate the size of the new market segment now available to Berkeley to be approximately 4 million tons annually. Of particular importance, the upgrade allows Nucor to produce thinner, high-strength steel grade that can be used to develop lightweight automotive applications.
In closing, based upon all of this strategic practice and faith, the absolute faith I have in our team's ability to face and overcome challenges, I remain very confident that Nucor's best years are still ahead of us. Thank you for your interest in Nucor. We would now be happy to take your questions."

Let me start by saying that our first quarter outlook is based upon what we see today in the current scrap prices. As I mentioned in the script, there's numerous reasons why we believe that, that pricing will decline dramatically in the early part of the year, we believe, probably in the first quarter. One of the biggest drivers to that is, when you look at our scrap pricing -- excuse me, our steel pricing, our steel pricing has already gone down and decreased across products maybe $50 to $100 [indiscernible] As a result, scrap pricing has to follow that steel pricing now. We see the pricing -- steel pricing under pressure because of the imports that are coming in that's produced with iron ore and the cost advantage today over our scrap market. That has, too, we believe, will adjust. Several other reasons we believe that's we're going to see scrap pricing drop significantly over the next couple of months. The strength of the U.S. dollar. Global scrap markets are low. Scrap imports are bound to start coming in. And as I mentioned, decreased demand for steel scrap as a result of decreased production of steel because of the pressure that we're seeing both because of the import being produced by the iron ore and because of the iron -- the oil pricing, as I mentioned in the script. So with these reasons, we believe very strongly that we will see a dramatic drop in scrap pricing in the first quarter. The other thing I would want to mention is that we are seeing some impact from the lag of scrap pricing moves in the inventories in our mill. So we are currently in our mills higher-priced scrap usually a 4- to 6-week lead time in lag time in our ancillary inventories. So given all of those reasons, we believe that any scrap pricing is going to come down dramatically. And I want to stress that it's following steel pricing down. If steel pricing has already come down, scrap pricing must follow. And I also want to mention that, again, that [indiscernible] first quarter outlook based on current scrap pricing. Jim, you want to touch upon the LIFO assessments?"

But I think more particularly, on what's the cost of or what might happen with scrap pricing, which is why, once again, I'm emphasizing that is unusual event where we don't see scrap pricing following steel pricing down. Typically, it's reversed. This time, because of the pressure from imports and from our competition that is oil-based, we are seeing the adverse effect take place. Steel pricing has gone down and scrap pricing, we believe, that as I mentioned, scrap pricing will follow it down. And it will happen pretty quickly and pretty dramatically.

The entire executive management team would like to thank everyone on our Nucor, Harris Steel, David J. Joseph, Duferdofin, NuMit Steel Technologies and Skyline Steel teams for a job extremely well done in 2014. You worked hard, worked smart, worked together and, most importantly, worked safely to deliver solid improvements in our performance despite steel industry conditions that remained very challenging.
I am pleased to report that full year of 2014 net income increased significantly by 46% to $714 million. We also achieved a very robust growth in our cash generated from operations. 2014's operating cash flow represents our strongest performance since 2008, demonstrating the strength of our business model. Best of all, our more than 23,000 teammates continued their excellent work implementing our company's strategy for profitable growth. Subsequent to the last cyclical peak in the steel industry, Nucor has invested significant capital in a large number of projects that improve our cost structure and expand our product portfolios to include more value-added, higher-margin offerings. In 2014, we began to see some of the early benefits from these strategic investments. There are more to come. In 2015, these investments will enhance our ability to navigate through the current challenges presented by energy industry turbulence and high levels of imported steel.
I will now ask our CFO, Jim Frias, to review Nucor's fourth quarter performance and financial position. Following Jim's comments, I will update you on current market conditions and execution of our strategy for long-term profitable growth. Jim?"

This outperformance was largely driven by better-than-expected results from our sheet mills, joist and deck business",1329,"Thanks, John. Fourth quarter of 2014 earnings of $0.65 per diluted share exceeded our guidance range of $0.50 to $0.55 per diluted share. This outperformance was largely driven by better-than-expected results from our sheet mills, joist and deck business and our direct reduced iron plant in Trinidad. Newly acquired Nucor Steel Gallatin made solid contributions to our fourth quarter earnings and cash flow, even after absorbing about $9 million or $0.02 per diluted share after tax purchase accounting expenses early in the quarter. We are encouraged by our fourth quarter performance given the strong seasonal and other influences dampening volumes during the period. Total sales tons to outside customers declined 10.5% in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter. Our strong full year 2014 earnings improvement highlights the value of Nucor's industry-leading product diversity. We are North America's only manufacturer of all 4 major steel mill products: bars, beams, plate and sheet. Our steel mill shipments of 22 million tons increased more than 6% year-over-year, which is more than double the U.S. steel industry's overall growth rate. The increased steel mill volume was further leveraged by steel mill metal margin expansion of $32 per ton. That's a $37 per ton gain, and our average steel sales price outpaced the $5 per ton increase in our average cost of iron units consumed.
In addition to the strong profit growth at our core Steelmaking Operations, Nucor's downstream steel product segment more than doubled its profitability in 2014. These businesses are benefiting from the initial stages of recovery in nonresidential construction markets. Particularly strong volume growth was achieved in our joist, decking and rebar fabrication products.
Nucor's 2014 earnings improvement was achieved despite a significant operating loss at our new DRI facility in Louisiana. Nucor Steel Louisiana's 2014 operating loss totaled $135 million or $0.28 per diluted share after tax and $35 million or $0.07 per diluted share after tax for the fourth quarter.
Production operations at the Louisiana facility have remained suspended since the process gas heater experienced a failure in early November. Due to the lead times on the specialty steel pipes that must be replaced, we estimate that the plant will not resume operations until late in the first quarter. The process gas heater is not part of the DRI technology utilized by Louisiana, but it is ancillary equipment required to operate the plant. The DRI technology itself has worked well and established new world-class quality levels, as measured by metallization rates and carbon content. Although Louisiana has been a challenging start-up, it will be a major step forward in the implementation of our long-term raw materials strategy. The recent declines in iron ore pricing and the fourth quarter profits generated by our DRI facility in Trinidad provide further validation to our work over the past decade establishing and growing Nucor's DRI production capacity.
A quick comment about our tax rates can be confusing due to the impact of profits from noncontrolling interests. After adjusting our profits belonging to our business partners, the effective tax rate was 33.6% for the fourth quarter and 35.3% for the full year of 2014. Nucor's financial position remains strong at the end of 2014. Our gross debt-to-capital ratio was 37%. Cash and short-term investments totaled more than $1.1 billion at the close of 2014, putting our net debt-to-capital ratio at approximately 31%. Our next significant debt liquidity is not until December of 2017. Nucor's strong liquidity position also includes our $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, which remains undrawn. The facility does not mature until August of 2018. Nucor is the only North American steel producer to hold an investment-grade credit rating.
John mentioned our very robust operating cash flow generation in 2014. Cash provided by operations of approximately $1.3 billion comfortably exceeded capital spending of $668 million combined with cash dividends paid to our shareholders of $475 million.
In 2014, Nucor's strong balance sheet, liquidity and cash flow again allowed us to take advantage of attractive opportunities to build long-term earnings power. During the fourth quarter, we completed our purchase of all of the equity of Gallatin Steel for a cash purchase price of approximately $779 million. The acquisition was funded from cash on hand and the issuance of approximately $300 million of commercial paper. By the end of 2014, we have reduced the acquisition-related commercial paper outstanding by half to about $151 million. For 2015, we estimate capital spending will be approximately $500 million. Most of our recent larger-scale projects have been completed or are nearing completion. Our capital spending forecast also reflects our joint decision with Encana, our natural gas working interest partner, to extend our drilling suspension through the end of 2015. This year's capital spending for drilling will be very modest and consists of drilling a few wells required to maintain leasehold rights. Depreciation and amortization for 2015 is expected to total about $700 million.
Nucor's financial strength, as evidenced by our strong balance sheet and healthy cash flow generation through the economic cycle, is the bedrock foundation to our mission of growing shareholder value. From this position of strength, we are able to allocate our shareholders' valuable capital to the most optimal or attractive usage at any given point in time. Our financial strength allows us to invest in capital projects during the severe industry downturns and the long-term returns are most attractive. It allows us to make strategic acquisitions when the right assets at the right price become available in the marketplace. And just as importantly, it allows us to reward our shareholders with a steadily growing base dividend, supplemental dividends during up-cycles and opportunistic share repurchases.
During the current downturn from 2009 through 2014, our investments totaled nearly $6 billion, with about 2/3 going to capital spending and 1/3 going to acquisitions. These diverse projects are growing Nucor's long-term earnings power by expanding our product portfolios into higher value-added offerings that are less vulnerable to imports, by improving our cost structure and, finally, by building upon our market leadership positions. Growing stronger during downturns is a long tradition of Nucor. It is how we achieve higher highs in profitability from one cyclical beat to the next.
With our disciplined approach to capital allocation and success in building long-term earnings power, Nucor is able to reward shareholders with attractive cash returns. Our base dividend has more than tripled since the end of 2007. With the increase effective with next month's quarterly dividend payment, Nucor has increased its base dividend every year since it first began paying dividends in 1973 or 42 consecutive years. During the last industry up-cycle from 2004 to 2008, Nucor paid a total of $5 per share in supplemental dividends. And over the 10-year period ending in 2014, Nucor returned a total of $6.7 billion of capital to our shareholders through dividends and opportunistic stock buybacks.
The Nucor team's unrelenting focus remains on continuing to build upon our record of being effective stewards of our shareholders' valuable capital.
First quarter of 2015 earnings will be impacted by the significant headwinds that developed for the steel industry at the end of 2014. The crashing oil prices has triggered inventory reductions amongst pipe and tube producers, an important customer group for Nucor and the overall steel industry. At the same time, imports are up dramatically entering 2015. Now on the positive side, we continue to see favorable trends in non-residential construction markets that will benefit both our steel mills and fabricated construction products.
Overall, we expect first quarter 2015 earnings will decrease from the fourth quarter to a level slightly exceeding the first quarter of 2014. Nucor will again follow our practice of providing quantitative guidance in the final month of the quarter.
Whatever short-term economic and steel industry conditions we face in 2015, Nucor's unrivaled position of strength will allow our team to continue to execute on our proven strategies for delivering profitable long-term growth. We appreciate your interest in our company. John?"

There certainly has been an abrupt change in the near-term outlook in recent weeks. The 2 headwinds mentioned by Jim, crashing oil prices and surging imports, will certainly challenge our team during the first quarter. But that's okay. Our te",1087,"Thanks, Jim. There certainly has been an abrupt change in the near-term outlook in recent weeks. The 2 headwinds mentioned by Jim, crashing oil prices and surging imports, will certainly challenge our team during the first quarter. But that's okay. Our team has faced and overcome challenges and adversity in the past, and we will do it again.
Energy is an extremely important driver of demand for steel in the U.S. and here at Nucor. Pipe and tube producers serving the energy markets represent approximately 10% of our steel mill shipments. Meaningful production and inventory adjustments by our pipe and tube customers are currently underway. Following this period of marketplace adjustment, we believe the future remains very positive for low-cost energy production in North America. Importantly, lower energy costs, over time, should support increased U.S. manufacturing activity and consumer spending. That is all very positive for Nucor.
The other major headwind is from a renewed surge in import activity. Full year 2014 imports of finished carbon steel products are estimated to have jumped to an unreasonable and unacceptable level of approximately 34 million tons. That's an increase of about 37% over 2013 and just under 2006's record level of 35 million tons. Indications are that January 2015 finished steel imports may set a monthly record of around 3.9 million tons. These short-term headwinds are significant, and Nucor is extremely well positioned to navigate through them and we will.
Some key advantages of our company come immediately to mind. We will benefit from our low and highly variable cost structure. Additionally, we expect continued growth in nonresidential construction activities. Iron need [ph] is our largest-single cost item. As previously mentioned, profitability at our DRI plant in Trinidad is benefiting from the large declines in iron ore costs. After resuming production, the Louisiana facility will also benefit from what appears to be an oversupplied ore market over at least the next several years.
Continuing on the raw material cost topic, we believe that the U.S. scrap is currently significantly overpriced versus iron ore and global scrap markets. Based on increased import steel penetration, slacked international demand for U.S. scrap, the strength of the U.S. dollar and moderating U.S. demand for scrap, we expect scrap prices to fall dramatically in early 2015. During this period of transition, Nucor will continue to utilize our unmatched global supply chain to optimize our raw material costs. Our investment in DRI and in scrap yards as well as our access to international raw material markets is Nucor best-in-class capabilities and flexibility in approaching the market buying use [ph].
Nonresidential construction markets account for more than half of the end-use demand to Nucor's products. As measured by square footage, U.S. nonresidential construction activity increased by 6.7% in 2014. We expect continued improvement in 2015. It is worth noting that the 2014 square footage activity level represents only about 56% of 2007's peak activity level. So there's plenty of room for additional improvement.
Whenever the steel industry and the economy hit unexpected periods of turbulence, like what we are experiencing now in early 2015, Nucor will do what Nucor always does. We will grow bigger, stronger and more profitable, and we will outperform our competitors.
Here are the reasons why Nucor will do this. Our balance sheet, and we recycle cash flow generation, is unrivaled by any of our competitors. Our industry-leading product and market diversity continues to grow as we move up the value chain in all of our businesses. The recent expansions in our offerings include normalized and heat-treated plate, wider and lighter sheet steels, additional SBQ and wire rod products and new piling sections. All of these products are less impacted by irrationally priced imports. Our low-cost structure will benefit from increased DRI production capacity, as our new Louisiana facility completes its start-up process this year.
Our commitment to achieving commercial excellence by leveraging Nucor's competitive advantages, such as product diversity and operational flexibility, to create more value for and build stronger relationships with each of our customers. And most importantly, Nucor's employees, the right people. They are our company's greatest asset and our greatest competitive advantage.
Here are just a few of the 2014 achievements implementing our strategy of investing for long-term profitable growth. In the fourth quarter, our Nucor-Yamato structural steel mill began prime production of its new sheet piling sections. The initial output was sold to Skyline Steel for our piling distributor and will be installed next month at a construction project in New Jersey. Nucor-Yamato expanded its product portfolio to include wider piling sections that are lighter and stronger, covering more area at a lower installed cost. The market for these high value-added niche products is currently largely supplied by imports. In addition to taking advantage of Nucor-Yamato's world-class structural steel manufacturing capabilities, our customers will benefit from this new domestic solution, which will create valuable synergies with the other products and services offered by Skyline Steel. Acquired in 2012, Skyline is the market leader in its business, with an unrivaled package of engineering support, stocking locations, processing centers and dedicated sales teams.
In 2014, Nucor Steel Hertford County plate mill leveraged the T-trading capabilities that capture a growing share of a market for value-added plate products. For example, in 2014, Hertford County has more than doubled its share of the bridge market during the current steel industry downturn. Over the same period, shipments to higher-margin OEM customers have doubled as a percent of mills total volume. These value-added products are also less vulnerable to pressure from commodity imports.
Our Nucor Steel Berkeley sheet mill successful start-up in 2014 of its wide-light capital project continued to build momentum. Shipments of the new wide-light products totaled over 120,000 tons in the first year. Berkeley now has the lightest hot-roll gauge capacity -- capability of any sheet mill in the Southern U.S. market, and with a finished product width of up to 72 inches.
We estimate the size of the new market segment now available to Berkeley to be approximately 4 million tons annually. Of particular importance, the upgrade allows Nucor to produce thinner, high-strength steel grades that could be used to develop lightweight automotive applications.
In closing, based upon all of this strategic practice and the faith, the absolute faith I have in our team's ability to face and overcome challenges, I remain very confident that Nucor's best years are still ahead of us.

Let me start by saying that our first quarter outlook is based upon what we see today in the current scrap prices. As I mentioned in the script, there's numerous reasons why we believe that, that pricing will decline dramatically in the early part of the year, we believe probably in the first quarter. One of the biggest drivers to that is when you look at our scrap pricing -- excuse me, our steel pricing, our steel pricing has already gone down and decreased across products maybe $50 to $100 a ton. As a result, scrap pricing has to follow that steel pricing down. We see the pricing -- steel pricing under pressure because of the imports that are coming in that's produced with iron ore and giving them a cost advantage today over our scrap market. That has to and we believe will adjust. There's several other reasons we believe that we're going to see scrap pricing drop significantly over the next couple of months. You've got the strength of the U.S. dollar. Global scrap markets are low. Scrap imports are bound to start coming in. And as I mentioned, decreased demand for steel -- scrap as a result of decreased production of steel because of the pressure that we're seeing, both because of the imports being produced by the iron ore and because of the iron -- the oil pricing, as we mentioned in the script. So given these reasons, we believe very strongly that we will see a dramatic drop in scrap pricing in the first quarter. The other thing I would want to mention is that we are seeing some impact from the lag of the scrap pricing moves in the inventories in our mill. So we have currently in our mills higher-priced scrap because there's usually a 4- to 6-week lead time in -- lag time in our ancillary inventories. So given all of those reasons, we believe that a, scrap pricing is going to come down dramatically. And I want to stress that it's following steel pricing now. If steel pricing has already come down, scrap pricing must follow. And I also want to mention that, again, that we based our first quarter outlook based upon current scrap pricing. Jim, do you want to touch upon the LIFO adjustments?"

But I do want to stress, as I mentioned several times in the script, the investments that we've made over the last several years in diversifying our products and our markets will help us get through this period. Just as one tidbit of information, when you look at just in 2014, there's about 700,000 tons of product that is either new or value-added products or product that we can now supply into markets that we could not supply into the previous through these investments. So although we're going to be taking a hit on the oil and gas, no doubt about it, 10% of our shipments go into that, we believe that through the investments that we've made in diversifying our products will mitigate that input effect. I will also stress, as I mentioned in the script, that 50% of our products go into nonresidential construction. We expect to see continued improvement in that market."

Now certainly, there's a lot of doubt about what's going to happen, both on pricing, but I think more particularly on what's the customers' view might happen with scrap pricing, which is why I'm once again emphasizing that it's an unusual event, where we don't see scrap pricing following steel pricing down. Typically, it's reversed. This time, because of the pressure from imports and from our competition that is ore based, we are seeing the inverse effect take place. Steel pricing has gone down before scrap pricing. We believe that scrap -- as I mentioned, scrap pricing will follow it down, and it will happen pretty quickly and pretty dramatically. But again, it's following the steel pricing down, not the other way around. And I think our customers understand that. And so they're not expecting large price decreases as scrap continues to move down because we've already seen the impact of that on our pricing. One other metaphor [ph] that I'd mention in terms of just bookings as a general statement, we talked about imports being high and although we've been successful in some of our trade cases on rebar and hot-rolled coil and wire rod, there's still a lot of that import steel that's in inventory that is impacting our order book, and we'll see that in the next couple of months."

That's somewhat of a function of how long and how deep the oil pricing situation goes on. You hear all kinds of predictions on that. Frankly, as far as I'm concerned, it's anyone's guess at this point. It's entirely up to the producers and how much oil they start pumping out of the ground. But currently, if we were to remain at today's levels of oil pricing and we look at the inventories, we would be looking at probably around 6 to 7, 8 months of inventory on the ground at today's usage. Now having said that, there's always a shock to a system when something -- has a radical change, and we see that happening today. Big chains, people throughout the entire supply chain are caught with inventory on hand with some radical -- some major change, major reduction in the orders. Given that, there will be a period of time when all of this kind of works out, starts flushing through, we'll begin to see the orders for pipe and tube going into energy returning to a new normal level. Albeit less than where it was, but that will be some level greater than where it is today but less than where it was a year ago. The other thing that I would mention about that is that -- you asked about shutting or reducing our capacity. As you know, Timna, our furnaces are extremely flexible. We make that decision on a weekly basis. We want our mills to fill orders. And given our variable cost structure and the flexible schedules that we have, we can react extremely quickly to any changes, okay? Whether or not we see some improvement in that energy market quicker than we anticipated or whether we see an uptick in one of our other markets, we stand ready to be very quick in responding to any changes in the market. Again, when you compare our operation to those of a blast furnace, clearly, once you shut down a blast furnace, it's down for a while. And we have much greater flexibility. We don't need to shut down an EAF if we can simply skip a couple of skip a couple of heats, so skip a couple of shifts and come back in a couple of days if see the order book warranting it."

Where we see the bigger impact, frankly, on our order book in both SBQ and particularly in plate is due to the imports, [indiscernible] imports.

Timna, one more thing that I might mention because you've mentioned specifically about the plate market, when you think about some of the infrastructure, although it's coming way too slowly, there are some infrastructure that has been made, particularly in the bridge.

You worked hard, worked smart, worked together and, most importantly, worked safely to deliver solid improvements in our performance despite steel industry conditions that remained very challenging.
I am pleased to report that full year of 2014 net income increased significantly by 46% to $714 million. We also achieved a very robust growth in our cash generated from operations. 2014's operating cash flow represents our strongest performance since 2008, demonstrating the strength of our business model. Best of all, our more than 23,000 teammates continued their excellent work implementing our company's strategy for profitable growth. Subsequent to the last cyclical peak in the steel industry, Nucor has invested significant capital in a large number of projects that improve our cost structure and expand our product portfolios to include more value-added, higher-margin offerings. In 2014, we began to see some of the early benefits from these strategic investments. There are more to come. In 2015, these investments will enhance our ability to navigate through the current challenges presented by energy industry turbulence and high levels of imported steel.
I will now ask our CFO, Jim Frias, to review Nucor's fourth quarter performance and financial position. Following Jim's comments, I will update you on current market conditions and execution of our strategy for long-term profitable growth. Jim?"

This outperformance was largely driven by better-than-expected results from our sheet mills, joist and deck business",1330,"Thanks, John. Fourth quarter of 2014 earnings of $0.65 per diluted share exceeded our guidance range of $0.50 to $0.55 per diluted share. This outperformance was largely driven by better-than-expected results from our sheet mills, joist and deck business and our direct reduced iron plant in Trinidad. Newly acquired Nucor Steel Gallatin made solid contributions to our fourth quarter earnings and cash flow, even after absorbing about $9 million or $0.02 per diluted share after tax purchase accounting expenses early in the quarter. We are encouraged by our fourth quarter performance given the strong seasonal and other influences dampening volumes during the period. Total sales tons to outside customers declined 10.5% in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter. Our strong full year 2014 earnings improvement highlights the value of Nucor's industry-leading product diversity. We are North America's only manufacturer of all 4 major steel mill products: bars, beams, plate and sheet. Our steel mill shipments of 22 million tons increased more than 6% year-over-year, which is more than double the U.S. steel industry's overall growth rate. The increased steel mill volume was further leveraged by steel mill metal margin expansion of $32 per ton. That's a $37 per ton gain, and our average steel sales price outpaced a $5 per ton increase in our average cost of iron units consumed.
In addition to the strong profit growth at our core Steelmaking Operations, Nucor's downstream steel product segment more than doubled its profitability in 2014. These businesses are benefiting from the initial stages of recovery in nonresidential construction markets. Particularly strong volume growth was achieved in our joist, decking and rebar fabrication products.
Nucor's 2014 earnings improvement was achieved despite a significant operating loss at our new DRI facility in Louisiana. Nucor Steel Louisiana's 2014 operating loss totaled $135 million or $0.28 per diluted share after tax and $35 million or $0.07 per diluted share after tax for the fourth quarter.
Production operations at the Louisiana facility have remained suspended since the process gas heater experienced a failure in early November. Due to the lead times on the specialty steel pipes that must be replaced, we estimate that the plant will not resume operations until late in the first quarter. The process gas heater is not part of the DRI technology utilized by Louisiana, but it is ancillary equipment required to operate the plant. The DRI technology itself has worked well and established new world-class quality levels, as measured by metallization rates and carbon content. Although Louisiana has been a challenging start-up, it will be a major step forward in the implementation of our long-term raw materials strategy. The recent declines in iron ore pricing and the fourth quarter profits generated by our DRI facility in Trinidad provide further validation to our work over the past decade establishing and growing Nucor's DRI production capacity.
A quick comment about our tax rates, which can be confusing due to the impact of profits from noncontrolling interests. After adjusting our profits belonging to our business partners, the effective tax rate was 33.6% for the fourth quarter and 35.3% for the full year of 2014. Nucor's financial position remains strong at the end of 2014. Our gross debt-to-capital ratio was 37%. Cash and short-term investments totaled more than $1.1 billion at the close of 2014, putting our net debt-to-capital ratio at approximately 31%. Our next significant debt liquidity is not until December of 2017. Nucor's strong liquidity position also includes our $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, which remains undrawn. The facility does not mature until August of 2018. Nucor is the only North American steel producer to hold an investment-grade credit rating.
John mentioned our very robust operating cash flow generation in 2014. Cash provided by operations of approximately $1.3 billion comfortably exceeded capital spending of $668 million combined with cash dividends paid to our shareholders of $475 million.
In 2014, Nucor's strong balance sheet, liquidity and cash flow again allowed us to take advantage of attractive opportunities to build long-term earnings power. During the fourth quarter, we completed our purchase of all of the equity of Gallatin Steel for a cash purchase price of approximately $779 million. The acquisition was funded from cash on hand and the issuance of approximately $300 million of commercial paper. By the end of 2014, we have reduced the acquisition-related commercial paper outstanding by half, to about $151 million. For 2015, we estimate capital spending will be approximately $500 million. Most of our recent larger-scale projects have been completed or are nearing completion. Our capital spending forecast also reflects our joint decision with Encana, our natural gas working interest partner, to extend our drilling suspension through the end of 2015. This year's capital spending for drilling will be very modest and consists of drilling a few wells required to maintain leasehold rights. Depreciation and amortization for 2015 is expected to total about $700 million.
Nucor's financial strength, as evidenced by our strong balance sheet and healthy cash flow generation through the economic cycle, is the bedrock foundation to our mission of growing shareholder value. From this position of strength, we are able to allocate our shareholders' valuable capital to the most optimal or attractive usage at any given point in time. Our financial strength allows us to invest in capital projects during severe industry downturns, when the long-term returns are most attractive. It allows us to make strategic acquisitions when the right assets at the right price become available in the marketplace. And just as importantly, it allows us to reward our shareholders with a steadily growing base dividend, supplemental dividends during up-cycles and opportunistic share repurchases.
During the current downturn from 2009 through 2014, our investments totaled nearly $6 billion, with about 2/3 going to capital spending and 1/3 going to acquisitions. These diverse projects are growing Nucor's long-term earnings power by expanding our product portfolios into higher value-added offerings that are less vulnerable to imports, by improving our cost structure and, finally, by building upon our market leadership positions. Growing stronger during downturns is a long tradition of Nucor. It is how we achieve higher highs in profitability from one cyclical beat to the next.
With our disciplined approach to capital allocation and success in building long-term earnings power, Nucor is able to reward shareholders with attractive cash returns. Our base dividend has more than tripled since the end of 2007. With the increase effective with next month's quarterly dividend payment, Nucor has increased its base dividend every year since it first began paying dividends in 1973, or 42 consecutive years. During the last industry up-cycle from 2004 to 2008, Nucor paid a total of $5 per share in supplemental dividends. And over the 10-year period ending in 2014, Nucor returned a total of $6.7 billion of capital to our shareholders through dividends and opportunistic stock buybacks.
The Nucor team's unrelenting focus remains on continuing to build upon our record of being effective stewards of our shareholders' valuable capital.
First quarter of 2015 earnings will be impacted by the significant headwinds that developed for the steel industry at the end of 2014. The collapse in oil prices has triggered inventory reductions amongst pipe and tube producers, an important customer group for Nucor and the overall steel industry. At the same time, imports are up dramatically entering 2015. Now on the positive side, we continue to see favorable trends in non-residential construction markets that will benefit both our steel mills and fabricated construction products.
Overall, we expect first quarter 2015 earnings will decrease from the fourth quarter to a level slightly exceeding the first quarter of 2014. Nucor will again follow our practice of providing quantitative guidance in the final month of the quarter.
Whatever short-term economic and steel industry conditions we face in 2015, Nucor's unrivaled position of strength will allow our team to continue to execute on our proven strategies for delivering profitable long-term growth. We appreciate your interest in our company. John?"

There certainly has been an abrupt change in the near-term outlook in recent weeks. The 2 headwinds mentioned by Jim, collapsing oil prices and surging imports, will certainly challenge our team during the first quarter. But that's okay. Our team has faced and overcome challenges and adversity in the past, and we will do it again.
Energy is an extremely important driver of demand for steel in the U.S. and here at Nucor. Pipe and tube producers serving the energy markets represent approximately 10% of our steel mill shipments. Meaningful production and inventory adjustments by our pipe and tube customers are currently underway. Following this period of marketplace adjustment, we believe the future remains very positive for low-cost energy production in North America. Importantly, lower energy costs, over time, should support increased U.S. manufacturing activity and consumer spending. That is all very positive for Nucor.
The other major headwind is from a renewed surge in import activity. Full year 2014 imports of finished carbon steel products are estimated to have jumped to an unreasonable and unacceptable level of approximately 34 million tons. That's an increase of about 37% over 2013 and just under 2006's record level of 35 million tons. Indications are that January 2015 finished steel imports may set a monthly record of around 3.9 million tons. These short-term headwinds are significant, and Nucor is extremely well positioned to navigate through them and we will.
Some key advantages of our company come immediately to mind. We will benefit from our low and highly variable cost structure. Additionally, we expect continued growth in nonresidential construction activities. Iron units are our largest-single cost item. As previously mentioned, profitability at our DRI plant in Trinidad is benefiting from the large declines in iron ore costs. After resuming production, the Louisiana facility will also benefit from what appears to be an oversupplied ore market over at least the next several years.
Continuing on the raw material cost topic, we believe that the U.S. scrap is currently significantly overpriced versus iron ore and global scrap markets. Based on increased import steel penetration, slack international demand for U.S. scrap, the strength of the U.S. dollar and moderating U.S. demand for scrap, we expect scrap prices to fall dramatically in early 2015. During this period of transition, Nucor will continue to utilize our unmatched global supply chain to optimize our raw material costs. Our investment in DRI and in scrap yards as well as our access to international raw material markets gives Nucor best-in-class capabilities and flexibility in approaching the market for iron units.
Nonresidential construction markets account for more than half of the end-use demand for Nucor's products. As measured by square footage, U.S. nonresidential construction activity increased by 6.7% in 2014. We expect continued improvement in 2015. It is worth noting that the 2014 square footage activity level represents only about 56% of 2007's peak activity level. So there's plenty of room for additional improvement.
Whenever the steel industry and the economy hit unexpected periods of turbulence, like what we are experiencing now in early 2015, Nucor will do what Nucor always does. We will grow bigger, stronger and more profitable, and we will outperform our competitors.
Here are the reasons why Nucor will do this. Our balance sheet, and recycled cash flow generation, is unrivaled by any of our competitors. Our industry-leading product and market diversity continues to grow as we move up the value chain in all of our businesses. The recent expansions in our offerings include normalized and heat-treated plates, wider and lighter sheet steels, additional SBQ and wire rod products and new piling sections. All of these products are less impacted by irrationally priced imports. Our low-cost structure will benefit from increased DRI production capacity, as our new Louisiana facility completes its start-up process this year.
Our commitment to achieving commercial excellence by leveraging Nucor's competitive advantages, such as product diversity and operational flexibility, to create more value for and build stronger relationships with each of our customers. And most importantly, Nucor's employees, the right people. They are our company's greatest asset and our greatest competitive advantage.
Here are just a few of the 2014 achievements implementing our strategy of investing for long-term profitable growth. In the fourth quarter, our Nucor-Yamato structural steel mill began prime production of its new sheet piling sections. The initial output was sold to Skyline Steel, our piling distributor, and will be installed next month at a construction project in New Jersey. Nucor-Yamato expanded its product portfolio to include wider piling sections that are lighter and stronger, covering more area at a lower installed cost. The market for these high value-added niche products is currently largely supplied by imports. In addition to taking advantage of Nucor-Yamato's world-class structural steel manufacturing capabilities, our customers will benefit from this new domestic solution, which will create valuable synergies with the other products and services offered by Skyline Steel. Acquired in 2012, Skyline is the market leader in its business, with an unrivaled package of engineering support, stocking locations, processing centers and dedicated sales teams.
In 2014, Nucor Steel Hertford County plate mill leveraged its heat treating capabilities to capture a growing share of the market for value-added plate products. For example, in 2014, Hertford County has more than doubled its share of the bridge market during the current steel industry downturn. Over the same period, shipments to higher-margin OEM customers have doubled as a percent of the mills' total volume. These value-added products are also less vulnerable to pressure from commodity imports.
Our Nucor Steel Berkeley sheet mill's successful start-up in 2014 of its wide-light capital project continued to build momentum. Shipments of the new wide-light products totaled over 120,000 tons in the first year. Berkeley now has the lightest hot-roll gauge capacity -- capability of any sheet mill in the Southern U.S. market, and with a finished product width of up to 72 inches.
We estimate the size of the new market segment now available to Berkeley to be approximately 4 million tons annually. Of particular importance, the upgrade allows Nucor to produce thinner, high-strength steel grades that could be used to develop lightweight automotive applications.
In closing, based upon all of this strategic factors and the faith, the absolute faith I have in our team's ability to face and overcome challenges, I remain very confident that Nucor's best years are still ahead of us.

Let me start by saying that our first quarter outlook is based upon what we see today in the current scrap prices. As I mentioned in the script, the",406,"Let me start with the first part of the question, and then I'll turn it over to Jim for the LIFO comments. Let me start by saying that our first quarter outlook is based upon what we see today in the current scrap prices. As I mentioned in the script, there's numerous reasons why we believe that, that pricing will decline dramatically in the early part of the year, we believe probably in the first quarter. One of the biggest drivers to that is when you look at our scrap pricing -- excuse me, our steel pricing, our steel pricing has already gone down and decreased across products maybe $50 to $100 a ton. As a result, scrap pricing has to follow that steel pricing down. We see the pricing -- steel pricing under pressure because of the imports that are coming in that's produced with iron ore and giving them a cost advantage today over our scrap market. That has to and we believe will adjust. There's several other reasons we believe that we're going to see scrap pricing drop significantly over the next couple of months. You've got the strength of the U.S. dollar. Global scrap markets are low. Scrap imports are bound to start coming in. And as I mentioned, decreased demand for steel scrap as a result of decreased production of steel because of the pressure that we're seeing, both because of the imports being produced by the iron ore and because of the iron -- the oil pricing, as we mentioned in the script. So given these reasons, we believe very strongly that we will see a dramatic drop in scrap pricing in the first quarter. The other thing I would want to mention is that we are seeing some impact from the lag of the scrap pricing moves in the inventories in our mill.

Now certainly, there's a lot of doubt about what's going to happen, both on pricing, but I think more particularly on what the customers view might happen with scrap pricing, which is why I'm once again emphasizing that it's an unusual event, where we're going to be seeing scrap pricing following steel pricing down. Typically, it's reversed. This time, because of the pressure from imports and from our competition that is ore based, we are seeing the inverse effect take place. Steel pricing has gone down before scrap pricing. We believe that scrap -- as I mentioned, scrap pricing will follow it down, and it will happen pretty quickly and pretty dramatically. But again, it's following the steel pricing down, not the other way around. And I think our customers understand that. And so they're not expecting large price decreases as scrap continues to move down because we've already seen the impact of that on our pricing. One other -- a bit important that I mention in terms of just bookings as a general statement, we talk about imports being high and although we've been successful in some of our trade cases on rebar and hot-rolled coil and wire rod, there's still a lot of that import steel that's in inventory that is impacting our order book, and we'll see that in the next couple of months."

That's somewhat of a function of how long and how deep the oil pricing situation goes on. You hear all kinds of predictions on that. Frankly, as far as I'm concerned, it's anyone's guess at this point. It's entirely up to the producers and how much oil they start pumping out of the ground. But currently, if we were to remain at today's levels of oil pricing and we look at the inventories, we would be looking at probably around 6 to 7, 8 months of inventory on the ground at today's usage. Now having said that, there's always a shock to a system when something has a radical change, and we see that happening today. Big change, people throughout the entire supply chain are caught with inventory on hand with some radical -- some major change, major reduction in the orders. Given that, there will be a period of time when all of this kind of works out, starts flushing through, and we'll begin to see the orders for pipe and tube going into energy returning to a new normal level. Albeit less than where it was, but that will be some level greater than where it is today but less than where it was a year ago.

Whether or not we see some improvement in that energy market quicker than we anticipated or whether we see an uptick in one of our other markets, we stand ready to be very quick in responding to any changes in the market. Again, when you compare our operation to those of a blast furnace, clearly, once you shut down a blast furnace, it's down for a while. And we have much greater flexibility. We don't need to shut down an EAF; we can simply skip a couple of heats or skip a couple of shifts and come back in a couple of days if we see the order book warranting it."

As I mentioned earlier, SBQ does sell a little bit into that. It's been growing. We've been focused on that as a growth area, but it's not that heavy for us. Where we see the bigger impact, frankly, on our order book in both SBQ and particularly in plate is due to the imports, [indiscernible] imports. So we see some impacts due to the oil prices, but frankly a larger impact due to imports. Timna, one more thing that I might mention because you've mentioned specifically about the plate market, when you think about some of the infrastructure, although it's coming way too slowly, there are some infrastructure repairs being made, particularly in the bridge. And there's couple of bridges going on, some bridge fabrication, bridge repair. And our plate business is doing well in that arena.

First quarter of 2015 earnings of $0.21 per diluted share compared favorably against fourth quarter of 2014 earnings of $0.65 per diluted share and year ago first quarter earnings of $0.35 per diluted share. The profitability of our steel mills segment for the first quarter of 2015 declined approximately 46% compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. An unprecedented level of imports flooding the domestic market in late '14 and early 2015 has pressured steel selling prices margin volumes for all of our steel mill products. The hot roll sheet market is the weakest as the result of the combined impact of surging imports and severe inventory correction underway in the energy, pipe and tube sector. Capacity utilization of the steelmaking operations fell to 65% in the first quarter of 2015 from the fourth quarter's rate of 76%. Not surprisingly, our sheet mills experience the largest decline quarter-over-quarter in production and shipments. And Nucor Sheet Mill shipments decreased 14% over this period, which compared to an 8% decline in total steel mill shipments. Steel mill profitability was also impacted by continued erosion in selling prices that outpaced decreases in raw material price -- costs. The decline in steel selling prices exceeded the reduction in our scrap usage cards, which were $39 per ton quarter-over-quarter. Average sales prices dropped $70 per ton for plate, $67 [ph] per ton for beams and $49 per ton for sheet. The first quarter 2015 performance of our raw materials segment includes an operating loss of approximately $44 million or $0.09 per diluted share in our new facility in Louisiana. That is larger than the approximately $35 million operating loss Nucor Steel Louisiana experienced in the fourth quarter. Our Louisiana team has completed repairs and adjustments to the processed gas feeder that failed in November of last year. Operations resumed during the last week of the first quarter.
On the positive side, our downstream products segment continues to capitalize on the slow but steady growth underway in nonresidential construction markets. As expected, the segment's first quarter profitability decreased from the fourth quarter level due to typical seasonal factors. However, compared with the year ago quarter, segment pretax profitability increased to more than $32 million from less than $2 million. Particularly strong profit improvement was achieved in our joist and decking and metal building systems businesses.
Quick comments about our tax rate, which can be confusing, due to the impact of profits from noncontrolling interests. After adjusting our profits that belong to our business partners, the effective tax rate was 33.9% for the first quarter. Nucor's financial position remains strong. Our gross debt-to-capital ratio was 36% at the closing of the first quarter.
Cash and short-term investments totaled $1.3 billion, including our net debt to capital ratio at approximately 28%. Our net significant debt maturities is not until December 2017.
Nucor's strong liquidity position also includes a $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, which remains undrawn. The facility does not mature until August of 19 -- of 2018. Nucor Steel in North American steel producer to hold the investment-grade credit rating.
Nucor continues to generate very robust operating cash flow throughout the cyclical up and downs that characterize the steel business, but our highly variable cost structure will benefit from significant reductions in working capital during downturns. That was the case again in the first quarter of 2015, with cash provided by operations of $564 million, a dramatic increase from the year-ago first quarter. Our strong cash flow allows us to increase our liquidity and retire the year-end 2014 commercial paper balance of about $150 million that had been issued to fund a portion of the Gallatin Steel acquisition in the fourth quarter of last year.
First quarter of 2015 capital expenditures totaled $70 million. We continue to estimate full year 2015 capital spending will be approximately $500 million. Most of our recent largest scale gross projects have been completed or are nearing completion.
Depreciation and amortization for 2015 is expected to total about $700 million.
John made an excellent point about the strength of Nucor's business model. It is one that enjoys competitive advantages and a degree of flexibility that cannot be matched by any of our competitors in the North American steel industry. Nucor's strong balance sheet, consistently healthy cash flow generation and conservative financial practices are critical components of our business model. Times of adversity such as what our industry is currently undergoing, once again, highlight the strengthening value of Nucor's significant competitive advantages and superior adaptability. Our focus is not on survival but on growing stronger.
Earnings in the second quarter of 2015 are expected to be somewhat improved from the first quarter. The second quarter should be followed by further improvement in the second half of 2015, given the ongoing strength of nonresidential construction and its impact on our steel mills and downstream businesses. Nonresidential construction activity accounts for more than half of the end-use demand for our products. Margin in the steel mills segment are expected to improve, although we are -- we will not realize the full benefits of lower raw material costs until there is greater stability in steel pricing. As service centers stocking runs its course during this transition period, steel prices are expected to stabilize and to rebound. Second quarter performance at raw material segments will reflect continued high losses at the Louisiana-derived facility and the impact of a nearly completed 1-month maintenance outage at our facility in Trinidad. Our Louisiana plant resumed production will be assuming higher cost iron ore that was on hand when the plant suspended operations following a failure in its process gas in early November. Our steel products segment is expected to achieve continued improvement in profitability during the second quarter. All 3 major fabricated construction products, joist and decking, fabricated rebar and mill buildings are experiencing significant year-over-year gains in bookings, backlogs and backlog margins. Over the past several months, our confidence has increased that the overall U.S. nonresidential construction market is set to deliver square footage growth in the range of at least 7% to 8% in 2015. Such a growth rate would still place the market almost 40% below the peak level of 2007.
Whatever short-term economic and steel industry conditions we face for the remainder of 2015, Nucor's unrivaled position of strength will allow our team to continue to execute on our proven strategies for delivering profitable, long-term growth and shareholder returns. We appreciate your interest in our company. John?"

That's not an effective strategy for success or even survival. When confronted by challenges, we find ways to grow stronger, while fixing or mitigating the problem. During the first quarter, unprecedented volumes of steel entrants continued to be a major challenge for industry. Joists and government support of their steel industries has resulted in a neglect of global steel production. A brazen disregard for international trade rules has led to the dumping of steel products in our market. As a result, 1:3 tons of steel sold in the U.S. today is produced abroad by a less efficient, less safe and less environmentally friendly countries. This is a real crisis for our industry. We are tackling this issue head-on through fighting back. Nucor's working on a bipartisan basis with Members of Congress and with the administration to ensure that we have a strong and effective tools to combat unfair trade. If Congress passes trade promotion authority legislation authorizing the president to enter into new free trade agreements, we believe the bill must be balanced with the strongest possible trade enforcement mechanisms so that steel and other industries have the tools we need to fight this blatant disregard for international trade rules. There is substantial part from both Democrat and Republicans for doing this. Additionally, the administration must take a much tougher line with countries that break the law. We have a set of rules governing trade. We follow those rules. When foreign countries and producers break those rules, there must be meaningful consequences. Applying tariffs and other remedies is simply holding governments accountable for the agreements that they sign. To that end, Nucor continues to assess market conditions and will be proactive and aggressive in pursuing trade cases when and where it is appropriate.
I will now update you on some of our team's organic growth initiatives underway to improve our long-term course position and expand our product portfolios to include more value-added, higher-margin offerings that are less impacted by the tsunami of imports. After restarting operations at the end of the first quarter, Nucor Steel Louisiana is once again producing DRI at world-class quality levels that our team established prior to the equipment failure. It's important to note that the process is not part of the DRI technology utilized by Louisiana, but it is ancillary industrial equipment required to operate plant. During the Louisiana just-completed shutdown, modifications to the process gas heater's original design were implemented to prevent the recurrence of a similar failure. One significant bearing modification was the insulation of 2 large dampeners to enable the process gas heater to control of cooling rate which will expand the life of the tubes that have failed in the past. Another significant modification was the addition of nitrogen to the outlet of the heater to significantly reduce and any collateral damage in the event of any future failure. Louisiana has been a challenging plant. Nevertheless, it is a major step forward in the implementation of our long-term strategy to optimize our iron use process. In fact, we believe that it has already provided short-term benefits. The presence of our leading DRI facility, having produced 1.3 million [ph] tons one year and preparing to resume production at the end of last quarter, was a meaningful factor supporting February's dramatic adjustment of more than $100 per ton in scrap prices. With that very much support, I believe in the long-term benefit of our DRI investment.
In the first quarter of 2015, our [indiscernible] County North Carolina plate mills recently added heat treating and normalizing assets, continued to run at full capacity of approximately 245,000 tons annually. The Hertford County team is capturing a growing share of value-added and higher-margin plate products. Relative to an investment of approximately $150 million, our value-added capabilities are for incremental, pretax profit that should average $200 per ton with the cycle.
During the first quarter, the first field installation of Nucor models new wider, sections, was successfully completed. This new product is the result of a $115 million project we started up in the fourth quarter of last year. Our customers will benefit from this new domestic solution as they pursue by-American, government-funded infrastructure projects.
Nucor-Yamato expanded product portfolio will also create valuable synergies with the other products and services by the Skyline Steel piling distribution business we acquired in 2012. Our goal over the next several years is to grow our wider timing sections annual volume to 100,000 tons, which combined steel mill and distribution pretax profit potential of approximately $450 per ton.
Momentum continues to build at Nucor Steel Berkeley's $98 million, wide capital project. That started off in early 2004 and has shipped approximately 120,000 tons last year. We expect to ship  about 200,000 tons of the new products in 2015 and eventually grow volume to be at least 300,000 tons annually, with pretax profit averaging $100 per ton through the cycle. Berkeley now has the lightest, hot capability of hot sheet metal in the southern United States market. And with a finished capability of up to 72 inches. Of particular importance, the upgrade allows new quarter produce higher strength skin steel grades at the plant used to develop lightweight automotive applications.
As I've said earlier, these are just some of the growth initiatives. I look forward to updating you again next quarter on our progress implementing our strategy for profitable growth.
Here are some of the reasons why we believe Nucor will continue to deliver profitable, long-term growth and industry-leading returns on capital. Our loan and highly variable core structure is Nucor's bedrock competitive advantage. We understand that to generate attractive returns in a commodity business, you have to be a low-cost producer and seek continual improvement in your core structure. Our balance sheet strength and through the cycle cash flow generation all depends on long-term focus and ability to take advantage of profitable growth opportunities, particularly the cyclical downturns. Our upstream, vertical integration, and raw materials enhances the profitability and flexibility of Nucor's core steelmaking business. The David J. Joseph Company's unmatched global raw material supply chain, combined with our investments in DRI and scrap yards is Nucor's best-in-class capability and flexibility in optimizing what is by far among our largest single cost item, iron units.
Our industry-leading product and market diversity continues to grow as we move up the value chain in all of our businesses. Our downstream vertical integration and the to value-added steel products enhances the products' profitability and flexibility of Nucor's core steelmaking business. Our expanded channels to market, such as Harris Steel, Steel Technologies and Skyline Steel increase our ability to compete with unfairly traded imports by expanding our opportunities to add value to our customers. Our commitment to achieving commercial excellence by leveraging Nucor's competitive advantages such as product diversity and operational flexibility to create more value for, and build stronger relationships with, each of our customers. And most importantly, Nucor's employees. The right people. They embraced the Nucor culture's pay-for-performance philosophy and passion for continuous improvement in taking care of our customers, our shareholders and their fellow teammates. That is why they're our company's greatest asset and our greatest competitive advantage. As it stands true throughout Nucor's history, our company's best years are ahead of us.

The profitability of our steel mi",1094,"Thanks, John. First quarter of 2015 earnings of $0.21 per diluted share compared favorably against fourth quarter of 2014 earnings of $0.65 per diluted share and year ago first quarter earnings of $0.35 per diluted share. The profitability of our steel mills segment for the first quarter of 2015 declined approximately 46% compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. An unprecedented level of imports flooding the domestic market in late '14 and early 2015 has pressured steel selling prices, margins and volumes for all of our steel mill products. The hot roll sheet market is the weakest as a result of the combined impact of surging imports and the severe inventory correction underway in the energy, pipe and tube sector. Capacity utilization at our steelmaking operations fell to 65% in the first quarter of 2015 from the fourth quarter's rate of 76%. Not surprisingly, our sheet mills experienced the largest decline quarter-over-quarter in production and shipments. Nucor Sheet Mill shipments decreased 14% over this period, which compared to an 8% decline in total steel mill shipments. Steel mill profitability was also impacted by continued erosion in selling prices that outpaced decreases in raw material price -- costs. A decline in steel selling prices exceeded the reduction in our composite scrap and scrap usage costs, which were $39 per ton quarter-over-quarter. Average sales prices dropped $70 per ton for plate, $67 per ton for beams and $49 per ton for sheet. The first quarter 2015 performance of our raw materials segment includes an operating loss of approximately $44 million or $0.09 per diluted share in our new DRI facility in Louisiana. That is larger than the approximately $35 million operating loss Nucor Steel Louisiana experienced in the fourth quarter. Our Louisiana team has completed repairs and adjustments to the process gas feeder that failed in November of last year. Operations resumed during the last week of the first quarter.
On the positive side, our downstream products segment continues to capitalize on the slow but steady growth underway in nonresidential construction markets. As expected, the segment's first quarter profitability decreased from the fourth quarter level due to typical seasonal factors. However, compared with the year ago quarter, segment pretax profitability increased to more than $32 million from less than $2 million. Particularly strong profit improvement was achieved in our joist and decking and metal building systems businesses.
Quick comments about our tax rate, which can be confusing, due to the impact of profits from noncontrolling interests. After adjusting out profits belonging to our business partners, the effective tax rate was 33.9% for the first quarter. Nucor's financial position remains strong. Our gross debt-to-capital ratio was 36% at the close of the first quarter.
Cash and short-term investments totaled $1.3 billion, including our net debt to capital ratio at approximately 28%. Our net significant debt maturities is not until December 2017.
Nucor's strong liquidity position also includes a $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, which remains undrawn. The facility does not mature until August of 19 -- of 2018. Nucor is the only North American steel producer to hold an investment-grade credit rating.
Nucor continues to generate very robust operating cash flow throughout the cyclical up and downs that characterize the steel business. With our highly variable cost structure, we benefit from significant reductions in working capital during downturns. That was the case again in the first quarter of 2015, with cash provided by operations of $564 million, a dramatic increase from the year-ago first quarter. Our strong cash flow allows us to increase our liquidity and retire the year-end 2014 commercial paper balance of about $150 million that had been issued to fund a portion of the Gallatin Steel acquisition in the fourth quarter of last year.
First quarter of 2015 capital expenditures totaled $70 million. We continue to estimate full year 2015 capital spending will be approximately $500 million. Most of our recent largest scale growth projects have been completed or are nearing completion.
Depreciation and amortization for 2015 is expected to total about $700 million.
John made an excellent point about the strength of Nucor's business model. It is one that enjoys competitive advantages and a degree of flexibility that cannot be matched by any of our competitors in the North American steel industry. Nucor's strong balance sheet, consistently healthy cash flow generation and conservative financial practices are critical components of our business model. Times of adversity such as what our industry is currently undergoing, once again, highlight the strength and value of Nucor's significant competitive advantages and superior adaptability. Our focus is not on survival but on growing stronger.
Earnings in the second quarter of 2015 are expected to be somewhat improved from the first quarter. The second quarter should be followed by further improvement in the second half of 2015, given the ongoing strength of nonresidential construction and its impact on our steel mills and downstream businesses. Nonresidential construction activity accounts for more than half of the end-use demand for our products. Margin in the steel mills segment are expected to improve, although we are -- we will not realize the full benefits of lower raw material costs until there is greater stability in steel pricing. As service centers stocking runs its course during this transition period, steel prices are expected to stabilize and rebound. Second quarter performance at our raw material segment will reflect continued high losses at the Louisiana DRI facility and the impact of a nearly completed 1-month maintenance outage at our DRI facility in Trinidad. Our Louisiana plant has resumed production and will be consuming higher cost iron ore that was on hand when the plant suspended operations following a failure in its process gas heater in early November. Our steel products segment is expected to achieve continued improvement in profitability during the second quarter. All 3 major fabricated construction products, joist and decking, fabricated rebar and mill buildings are experiencing significant year-over-year gains in bookings, backlogs and backlog margins. Over the past several months, our confidence has increased that the overall U.S. nonresidential construction market is set to deliver square footage growth in the range of at least 7% to 8% in 2015. Such a growth rate would still place the market almost 40% below the peak level of 2007.
Whatever short-term economic and steel industry conditions we face for the remainder of 2015, Nucor's unrivaled position of strength will allow our team to continue to execute on our proven strategies for delivering profitable, long-term growth and shareholder returns. We appreciate your interest in our company. John?"

That's not an effective strategy for success or even survival. When confronted by challenges, we find ways to grow stronger, while fixing or mitigating the problem. During the first quarter, unprecedented volumes of steel entrants continued to be a major challenge for our industry. Blatant barring government support of their steel industries has resulted in a glut of global steel production. A brazen disregard for international trade rules has led to the dumping of steel products in our market. As a result, 1:3 tons of steel sold in the U.S. today is produced abroad by a less efficient, less safe and less environmentally friendly countries. This is a real crisis for our industry. We are attacking this issue head-on and fighting back. Nucor's working on a bipartisan basis with Members of Congress and with the administration to ensure that we have a strong and effective tools to combat unfair trade. If Congress passes trade promotion authority legislation authorizing the president to enter into new free trade agreements, we believe the bill must be balanced with the strongest possible trade enforcement mechanisms so that steel and other industries have the tools we need to fight this blatant disregard for international trade rules. There is substantial part from both Democrat and Republicans for doing this. Additionally, the administration must take a much tougher line with countries that break the law. We have a set of rules governing trade. We follow those rules. When foreign countries and producers break those rules, there must be meaningful consequences. Applying tariffs and other remedies is simply holding governments accountable for the agreements that they sign. To that end, Nucor continues to assess market conditions and will be proactive and aggressive in pursuing trade cases when and where it is appropriate.
I will now update you on some of our team's organic growth initiatives underway to improve our long-term course position and expand our product portfolios to include more value-added, higher-margin offerings that are less impacted by the tsunami of imports. After restarting operations at the end of the first quarter, Nucor Steel Louisiana is once again producing DRI at world-class quality levels that our team established prior to the equipment failure. It is important to note that the process gas heaters is not part of the DRI technology utilized by Louisiana, but it is ancillary industrial equipment required to operate plant. During Louisiana's just-completed shutdown, modifications to the process gas heater's original design were implemented to prevent the reoccurrence of a similar failure. One significant modification was the insulation of 2 large dampeners to enable the process gas heater to control its cooling rate which will expand the life of the tubes that have failed in the past. Another significant modification was the addition of a nitrogen purge to the outlet of the heater to significantly reduce any collateral damage in the event of any future tube failure. Louisiana has been a challenging startup. Nevertheless, it is a major step forward in the implementation of our long-term strategy to optimize our iron unit costs. In fact, we believe it has already provided short-term benefits. Presence of our leading DRI facility, having produced 1.3 million tons last year and preparing to resume production at the end of last quarter, was a meaningful factor supporting February's dramatic downward adjustment of more than $100 per ton in scrap prices. That very much supports our I belief in the long-term benefit of our DRI investment.
In the first quarter of 2015, our Hertford County, North Carolina plate mills recently added heat treating and normalizing assets, continued to run at full capacity of approximately 245,000 tons annually. The Hertford County team is capturing a growing share of value-added and higher-margin plate products. Relative to an investment of approximately $150 million, our value-added capabilities offer incremental, pretax profit that should average $200 per ton with the cycle.
During the first quarter, the first field installation of Nucor-Yamato's new wider, sheet piling sections was successfully completed. This new product is the result of a $115 million project we started up in the fourth quarter of last year. Our customers will benefit from this new domestic piling solution as they pursue by-American, government-funded infrastructure projects.
Nucor-Yamato's expanded product portfolio will also create valuable synergies with the other products and services offered by the Skyline Steel piling distribution business we acquired in 2012. Our goal over the next several years is to grow our wider piling sections annual volume to 100,000 tons, which combines steel mill and distribution pretax profit potential of approximately $450 per ton.
Momentum continues to build at Nucor Steel Berkeley's $98 million, wide light capital project that started off in early 2004 and has shipped approximately 120,000 tons last year. We expect to ship about 200,000 tons of the new products in 2015 and eventually grow volume to be at least 300,000 tons annually, with pretax profit averaging $100 per ton through the cycle. Berkeley now has the lightest, hot roll gauge capability of any sheet mill in the southern United States market. And with a finished width capability of up to 72 inches. Of particular importance, the upgrade allows Nucor to produce thinner, high strength steel grades that we plan to use to develop lightweight automotive applications.
As I've said earlier, these are just some of the growth initiatives. I look forward to updating you again next quarter on our progress implementing our strategy for profitable growth.
Here are some of the reasons why I believe Nucor will continue to deliver profitable, long-term growth and industry-leading returns on capital. Our loan and highly variable core structure is Nucor's bedrock competitive advantage. We understand that to generate attractive returns in a commodity business, you have to be a low-cost producer and seek continual improvement in your cost structure. Our balance sheet strength and through the cycle of cash flow generation underpins our long-term focus and ability to take advantage of profitable growth opportunities, particularly during cyclical downturns. Our upstream, vertical integration into raw materials enhances the profitability and flexibility of Nucor's core steelmaking business. The David J. Joseph Company's unmatched global raw material supply chain, combined with our investments in DRI and scrap yards is Nucor's best-in-class capability and flexibility in optimizing what is by far among our largest single cost item, iron units.
Our industry-leading product and market diversity continues to grow as we move up the value chain in all of our businesses. Our downstream vertical integration into value-added steel products enhances the profitability and flexibility of Nucor's core steelmaking business. Our expanded channels to market, such as Harris Steel, Steel Technologies and Skyline Steel increase our ability to compete with unfairly traded imports by expanding our opportunities to add value to our customers. Our commitment to achieving commercial excellence by leveraging Nucor's competitive advantages such as product diversity and operational flexibility to create more value for, and build stronger relationships with, each of our customers. And most importantly, Nucor's employees. The right people. They embraced Nucor culture's pay-for-performance philosophy and passion for continuous improvement in taking care of our customers, our shareholders and their fellow teammates. That is why they're our company's greatest asset and our greatest competitive advantage. As has been true throughout Nucor's history, our company's best years are ahead of us. Thank you for your interest in Nucor. We would now be happy to take your questions."

I frankly don't think it will be in the second quarter, but some point during the course of the year, maybe third or fourth quarter. We'll start working our way through that inventory, and we see order rates that are consistent with the new normal drilling levels that are expected with the lower price. Another thing you can keep your eye on is currency. Obviously, the strong dollar has an impact on what's happening both on our raw material side and on our steel shipment side as it relates to imports and other factors. So I tried to give you a couple of things that you can keep an eye on, but there's a multitude of things that we have to watch to see what's going to happen as we go forward."

And I said that we keep about 5 to 6 weeks of inventory on the ground. That is an accurate statement. But if he was looking to get some sense of when pricing change is relative to iron ore pricing on an index basis changes, we need to factor in the issue that we buy on a quarterly basis with a lag -- lagging quarter. So whoever asked that question earlier about seeing changes in the pricing of our raw material going into Louisiana, please bear in mind when you see the change occur in the index, there's a one quarter lag in the pricing that we see at the plant itself.

The profitability of our steel mi",1094,"Thanks, John. First quarter of 2015 earnings of $0.21 per diluted share compared favorably against fourth quarter of 2014 earnings of $0.65 per diluted share and year ago first quarter earnings of $0.35 per diluted share. The profitability of our steel mills segment for the first quarter of 2015 declined approximately 46% compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. An unprecedented level of imports flooding the domestic market in late '14 and early 2015 has pressured steel selling prices, margins and volumes for all of our steel mill products. The hot-rolled sheet market is the weakest as a result of the combined impact of surging imports and the severe inventory correction underway in the energy, pipe and tube sector. Capacity utilization at our steelmaking operations fell to 65% in the first quarter of 2015 from the fourth quarter's rate of 76%. Not surprisingly, our sheet mills experienced the largest decline quarter-over-quarter in production and shipments. Nucor Sheet Mill shipments decreased 14% over this period, which compared to an 8% decline in total steel mill shipments. Steel mill profitability was also impacted by continued erosion in selling prices that outpaced decreases in raw material price -- costs. A decline in steel selling prices exceeded the reduction in our composite scrap and scrap usage costs, which were $39 per ton quarter-over-quarter. Average sales prices dropped $70 per ton for plate, $67 per ton for beams and $49 per ton for sheet. The first quarter 2015 performance of our raw materials segment includes an operating loss of approximately $44 million or $0.09 per diluted share in our new DRI facility in Louisiana. That is larger than the approximately $35 million operating loss Nucor Steel Louisiana experienced in the fourth quarter. Our Louisiana team has completed repairs and adjustments to the process gas feeder that failed in November of last year. Operations resumed during the last week of the first quarter.
On the positive side, our downstream products segment continues to capitalize on the slow but steady growth underway in nonresidential construction markets. As expected, the segment's first quarter profitability decreased from the fourth quarter level due to typical seasonal factors. However, compared with the year ago quarter, segment pretax profitability increased to more than $32 million from less than $2 million. Particularly strong profit improvement was achieved in our joist and decking and metal building systems businesses.
A quick comment about our tax rate, which can be confusing, due to the impact of profits from noncontrolling interests. After adjusting out profits belonging to our business partners, the effective tax rate was 33.9% for the first quarter. Nucor's financial position remains strong. Our gross debt-to-capital ratio was 36% at the close of the first quarter.
Cash and short-term investments totaled $1.3 billion, including our net debt to capital ratio at approximately 28%. Our next significant debt maturity is not until December 2017.
Nucor's strong liquidity position also includes our $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, which remains undrawn. The facility does not mature until August of 19 -- of 2018. Nucor is the only North American steel producer to hold an investment-grade credit rating.
Nucor continues to generate very robust operating cash flow throughout the cyclical up and downs that characterize the steel business. With our highly variable cost structure, we benefit from significant reductions in working capital during downturns. That was the case again in the first quarter of 2015, with cash provided by operations of $564 million, a dramatic increase from the year-ago first quarter. Our strong cash flow allows us to increase our liquidity and retire the year-end 2014 commercial paper balance of about $150 million that had been issued to fund a portion of the Gallatin Steel acquisition in the fourth quarter of last year.
First quarter of 2015 capital expenditures totaled $70 million. We continue to estimate full year 2015 capital spending will be approximately $500 million. Most of our recent larger scale growth projects have been completed or are nearing completion.
Depreciation and amortization for 2015 is expected to total about $700 million.
John made an excellent point about the strength of Nucor's business model. It is one that enjoys competitive advantages and a degree of flexibility that cannot be matched by any of our competitors in the North American steel industry. Nucor's strong balance sheet, consistently healthy cash flow generation and conservative financial practices are critical components of our business model. Times of adversity such as what our industry is currently undergoing, once again, highlight the strength and value of Nucor's significant competitive advantages and superior adaptability. Our focus is not on survival, but on growing stronger.
Earnings in the second quarter of 2015 are expected to be somewhat improved from the first quarter. The second quarter should be followed by further improvement in the second half of 2015, given the ongoing strength of nonresidential construction and its impact on our steel mills and downstream businesses. Nonresidential construction activity accounts for more than half of the end-use demand for our products. Margins in the steel mills segment are expected to improve, although we are -- we will not realize the full benefits of lower raw material costs until there is greater stability in steel pricing. As service center destocking runs its course during this transition period, steel prices are expected to stabilize and rebound. Second quarter performance at our raw materials segment will reflect continued high losses at the Louisiana DRI facility and the impact of a nearly completed 1-month maintenance outage at our DRI facility in Trinidad. Our Louisiana plant has resumed production and will be consuming higher cost iron ore that was on hand when the plant suspended operations following a failure in its process gas heater in early November. Our steel products segment is expected to achieve continued improvement in profitability during the second quarter. All 3 major fabricated construction products, joist and decking, fabricated rebar and metal buildings are experiencing significant year-over-year gains in bookings, backlogs and backlog margins. Over the past several months, our confidence has increased that the overall U.S. nonresidential construction market is set to deliver square footage growth in the range of at least 7% to 8% in 2015. Such a growth rate would still place the market almost 40% below the peak level of 2007.
Whatever short-term economic and steel industry conditions we face over the remainder of 2015, Nucor's unrivaled position of strength will allow our team to continue to execute on our proven strategies for delivering profitable, long-term growth and shareholder returns. We appreciate your interest in our company. John?"

That's not an effective strategy for success or even survival. When confronted by challenges, we find ways to grow stronger, while fixing or mitigating the problem. During the first quarter, unprecedented volumes of steel imports continued to be a major challenge for our industry. Blatant foreign government support of their steel industries has resulted in a glut of global steel production. A brazen disregard for international trade rules has led to the dumping of steel products in our market. As a result, 1 in 3 tons of steel sold in the U.S. today is produced abroad by a less efficient, less safe and less environmentally friendly countries. This is a real crisis for our industry. We are attacking this issue head-on and fighting back. Nucor's working on a bipartisan basis with members of Congress and with the administration to ensure that we have a strong and effective tools to combat unfair trade. If Congress passes Trade Promotion Authority legislation authorizing the President to enter into new free trade agreements, we believe the bill must be balanced with the strongest possible trade enforcement mechanisms so that steel and other industries have the tools we need to fight this blatant disregard for international trade rules. There is substantial support from both Democrat and Republicans for doing this. Additionally, the administration must take a much tougher line with countries that break the law. We have a set of rules governing trade. We follow those rules. When foreign countries and producers break those rules, there must be meaningful consequences. Applying tariffs and other remedies is simply holding governments accountable for the agreements that they sign. To that end, Nucor continues to assess market conditions and will be proactive and aggressive in pursuing trade cases when and where it is appropriate.
I will now update you on some of our team's organic growth initiatives underway to improve our long-term course position and expand our product portfolios to include more value-added, higher-margin offerings that are less impacted by the tsunami of imports. 
After restarting operations at the end of the first quarter, Nucor Steel Louisiana is once again producing DRI at world-class quality levels that our team established prior to the equipment failure. It is important to note that the process gas heater is not part of the DRI technology utilized by Louisiana, but it is ancillary industrial equipment required to operate the plant. During Louisiana's just-completed shutdown, modifications to the process gas heater's original design were implemented to prevent the reoccurrence of a similar failure. One significant modification was the insulation of 2 large dampers to enable the process gas heater to control its cooling rate which will extend the life of the tubes that have failed in the past. Another significant modification was the addition of a nitrogen purge to the outlet of the heater to significantly reduce any collateral damage in the event of any future tube failure. 
Louisiana has been a challenging startup. Nevertheless, it is a major step forward in the implementation of our long-term strategy to optimize our iron unit costs. In fact, we believe it has already provided short-term benefits. Presence of our Louisiana DRI facility, having produced 1.3 million tons last year and preparing to resume production at the end of last quarter, was a meaningful factor supporting February's dramatic downward adjustment of more than $100 per ton in scrap prices. That very much supports our belief in the long-term benefit of our DRI investment.
In the first quarter of 2015, our Hertford County, North Carolina plate mills recently added heat treating and normalizing assets, continued to run at full capacity of approximately 245,000 tons annually. The Hertford County team is capturing a growing share of value-added and higher-margin plate products. Relative to an investment of approximately $150 million, our value-added capabilities offer incremental, pretax profit that should average $200 per ton with the cycle.
During the first quarter, the first field installation of Nucor-Yamato's new wider, sheet piling sections was successfully completed. This new product is the result of a $115 million project we started up in the fourth quarter of last year. Our customers will benefit from this new domestic piling solution as they pursue ""Buy American,"" government-funded infrastructure projects.
Nucor-Yamato's expanded product portfolio will also create valuable synergies with the other products and services offered by the Skyline Steel piling distribution business we acquired in 2012. Our goal over the next several years is to grow our wider piling sections annual volume to 100,000 tons with combined steel mill and distribution pretax profit potential of approximately $450 per ton.
Momentum continues to build at Nucor Steel Berkeley's $98 million, wide light capital project that started off in early 2004 and has shipped approximately 120,000 tons last year. We expect to ship about 200,000 tons of the new products in 2015 and eventually grow volume to be at least 300,000 tons annually, with pretax profit averaging $100 per ton through the cycle. Berkeley now has the lightest, hot-rolled gauge capability of any sheet mill in the southern United States market. And with a finished width capability of up to 72 inches. Of particular importance, the upgrade allows Nucor to produce thinner, high strength steel grades that we plan to use to develop lightweight automotive applications.
As I've said earlier, these are just some of the growth initiatives. I look forward to updating you again next quarter on our progress implementing our strategy for profitable growth.
Here are some of the reasons why I believe Nucor will continue to deliver profitable, long-term growth and industry-leading returns on capital. Our loan and highly variable core structure is Nucor's bedrock competitive advantage. We understand that to generate attractive returns in a commodity business, you have to be a low-cost producer and seek continual improvement in your cost structure. Our balance sheet strength and through-the-cycle cash flow generation underpins our long-term focus and ability to take advantage of profitable growth opportunities, particularly during cyclical downturns. Our upstream, vertical integration into raw materials enhances the profitability and flexibility of Nucor's core steelmaking business. The David J. Joseph Company's unmatched global raw material supply chain, combined with our investments in DRI and scrap yards is Nucor's best-in-class capability and flexibility in optimizing what is by far our largest single cost item, iron units.
Our industry-leading product and market diversity continues to grow as we move up the value chain in all of our businesses. Our downstream vertical integration into value-added steel products enhances the profitability and flexibility of Nucor's core steelmaking business. Our expanded channels to market, such as Harris Steel, Steel Technologies and Skyline Steel increase our ability to compete with unfairly traded imports by expanding our opportunities to add value to our customers. Our commitment to achieving commercial excellence by leveraging Nucor's competitive advantages such as product diversity and operational flexibility to create more value for, and build stronger relationships with, each of our customers. And most importantly, Nucor's employees. The right people. They embraced the Nucor culture's pay-for-performance philosophy and passion for continuous improvement in taking care of our customers, our shareholders and their fellow teammates. That is why they're our company's greatest asset and our greatest competitive advantage. As has been true throughout Nucor's history, our company's best years are ahead of us. Thank you for your interest in Nucor. We would now be happy to take your questions."

Although we've seen a slight decline in licenses, there was so much out there in the pipeline that this is going to take off. And so much has already reached the service centers and just build up their inventories. It's going to be a while before we work our way through that. Now I can tell you that for the first time, this month, the numbers that just came out on service center inventories, we see them being down just a little bit. But imports are something you should certainly watch, and there are other factors, too, particularly on our sheet business, when you want to look at oil pricing. Now I can't tell you when it's going to recover, but certainly, we've seen a tremendous impact on our flat-rolled business as a result of oil pricing going from $100 to $50. Our volumes are way down. Same situation there. We flooded the pipeline with material. There's been a complete stop as they work their way through this inventory at some point. I frankly don't think it will be in the second quarter, but some point during the course of the year, maybe third or fourth quarter. We'll start working our way through that inventory, and we'll see ordering that are consistent with the new normal drilling levels that are expected with the lower price. Another thing you can keep your eye on is currency. Obviously, the strong dollar has an impact on what's happening both on our raw material side and on our steel shipment side as it relates to imports and other factors. So I've tried to give you a couple of things that you can keep an eye on, but there's a multitude of things that we have to watch to see what's going to happen as we go forward."

And I said that we keep about 5 to 6 weeks of inventory on the ground. That is an accurate statement.

The profitability of our steel mi",1094,"Thanks, John. First quarter of 2015 earnings of $0.21 per diluted share compared favorably against fourth quarter of 2014 earnings of $0.65 per diluted share and year ago first quarter earnings of $0.35 per diluted share. The profitability of our steel mills segment for the first quarter of 2015 declined approximately 46% compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. An unprecedented level of imports flooding the domestic market in late '14 and early 2015 has pressured steel selling prices, margins and volumes for all of our steel mill products. The hot-rolled sheet market is the weakest as a result of the combined impact of surging imports and the severe inventory correction underway in the energy, pipe and tube sector. Capacity utilization at our steelmaking operations fell to 65% in the first quarter of 2015 from the fourth quarter's rate of 76%. Not surprisingly, our sheet mills experienced the largest decline quarter-over-quarter in production and shipments. Nucor Sheet Mill shipments decreased 14% over this period, which compared to an 8% decline in total steel mill shipments. Steel mill profitability was also impacted by continued erosion in selling prices that outpaced decreases in raw material price -- costs. A decline in steel selling prices exceeded the reduction in our composite scrap and scrap usage costs, which were $39 per ton quarter-over-quarter. Average sales prices dropped $70 per ton for plate, $67 per ton for beams and $49 per ton for sheet. The first quarter 2015 performance of our raw materials segment includes an operating loss of approximately $44 million or $0.09 per diluted share in our new DRI facility in Louisiana. That is larger than the approximately $35 million operating loss Nucor Steel Louisiana experienced in the fourth quarter. Our Louisiana team has completed repairs and adjustments to the process gas feeder that failed in November of last year. Operations resumed during the last week of the first quarter.
On the positive side, our downstream products segment continues to capitalize on the slow but steady growth underway in nonresidential construction markets. As expected, the segment's first quarter profitability decreased from the fourth quarter level due to typical seasonal factors. However, compared with the year ago quarter, segment pretax profitability increased to more than $32 million from less than $2 million. Particularly strong profit improvement was achieved in our joist and decking and metal building systems businesses.
A quick comment about our tax rate, which can be confusing, due to the impact of profits from noncontrolling interests. After adjusting out profits belonging to our business partners, the effective tax rate was 33.9% for the first quarter. Nucor's financial position remains strong. Our gross debt-to-capital ratio was 36% at the close of the first quarter.
Cash and short-term investments totaled $1.3 billion, including our net debt to capital ratio at approximately 28%. Our next significant debt maturity is not until December 2017.
Nucor's strong liquidity position also includes our $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, which remains undrawn. The facility does not mature until August of 19 -- of 2018. Nucor is the only North American steel producer to hold an investment-grade credit rating.
Nucor continues to generate very robust operating cash flow throughout the cyclical up and downs that characterize the steel business. With our highly variable cost structure, we benefit from significant reductions in working capital during downturns. That was the case again in the first quarter of 2015, with cash provided by operations of $564 million, a dramatic increase from the year-ago first quarter. Our strong cash flow allows us to increase our liquidity and retire the year-end 2014 commercial paper balance of about $150 million that had been issued to fund a portion of the Gallatin Steel acquisition in the fourth quarter of last year.
First quarter of 2015 capital expenditures totaled $70 million. We continue to estimate full year 2015 capital spending will be approximately $500 million. Most of our recent larger scale growth projects have been completed or are nearing completion.
Depreciation and amortization for 2015 is expected to total about $700 million.
John made an excellent point about the strength of Nucor's business model. It is one that enjoys competitive advantages and a degree of flexibility that cannot be matched by any of our competitors in the North American steel industry. Nucor's strong balance sheet, consistently healthy cash flow generation and conservative financial practices are critical components of our business model. Times of adversity such as what our industry is currently undergoing, once again, highlight the strength and value of Nucor's significant competitive advantages and superior adaptability. Our focus is not on survival, but on growing stronger.
Earnings in the second quarter of 2015 are expected to be somewhat improved from the first quarter. The second quarter should be followed by further improvement in the second half of 2015, given the ongoing strength of nonresidential construction and its impact on our steel mills and downstream businesses. Nonresidential construction activity accounts for more than half of the end-use demand for our products. Margins in the steel mills segment are expected to improve, although we are -- we will not realize the full benefits of lower raw material costs until there is greater stability in steel pricing. As service center destocking runs its course during this transition period, steel prices are expected to stabilize and rebound. Second quarter performance at our raw materials segment will reflect continued high losses at the Louisiana DRI facility and the impact of a nearly completed 1-month maintenance outage at our DRI facility in Trinidad. Our Louisiana plant has resumed production and will be consuming higher cost iron ore that was on hand when the plant suspended operations following a failure in its process gas heater in early November. Our steel products segment is expected to achieve continued improvement in profitability during the second quarter. All 3 major fabricated construction products, joist and decking, fabricated rebar and metal buildings are experiencing significant year-over-year gains in bookings, backlogs and backlog margins. Over the past several months, our confidence has increased that the overall U.S. nonresidential construction market is set to deliver square footage growth in the range of at least 7% to 8% in 2015. Such a growth rate would still place the market almost 40% below the peak level of 2007.
Whatever short-term economic and steel industry conditions we face over the remainder of 2015, Nucor's unrivaled position of strength will allow our team to continue to execute on our proven strategies for delivering profitable, long-term growth and shareholder returns. We appreciate your interest in our company. John?"

That's not an effective strategy for success or even survival. When confronted by challenges, we find ways to grow stronger, while fixing or mitigating the problem. During the first quarter, unprecedented volumes of steel imports continued to be a major challenge for our industry. Blatant foreign government support of their steel industries has resulted in a glut of global steel production. A brazen disregard for international trade rules has led to the dumping of steel products in our market. As a result, 1 in 3 tons of steel sold in the U.S. today is produced abroad by a less efficient, less safe and less environmentally friendly countries. This is a real crisis for our industry. We are attacking this issue head-on and fighting back. Nucor's working on a bipartisan basis with members of Congress and with the administration to ensure that we have a strong and effective tools to combat unfair trade. If Congress passes Trade Promotion Authority legislation authorizing the President to enter into new free trade agreements, we believe the bill must be balanced with the strongest possible trade enforcement mechanisms so that steel and other industries have the tools we need to fight this blatant disregard for international trade rules. There is substantial support from both Democrat and Republicans for doing this. Additionally, the administration must take a much tougher line with countries that break the law. We have a set of rules governing trade. We follow those rules. When foreign countries and producers break those rules, there must be meaningful consequences. Applying tariffs and other remedies is simply holding governments accountable for the agreements that they sign. To that end, Nucor continues to assess market conditions and will be proactive and aggressive in pursuing trade cases when and where it is appropriate.
I will now update you on some of our team's organic growth initiatives underway to improve our long-term course position and expand our product portfolios to include more value-added, higher-margin offerings that are less impacted by the tsunami of imports. 
After restarting operations at the end of the first quarter, Nucor Steel Louisiana is once again producing DRI at world-class quality levels that our team established prior to the equipment failure. It is important to note that the process gas heater is not part of the DRI technology utilized by Louisiana, but it is ancillary industrial equipment required to operate the plant. During Louisiana's just-completed shutdown, modifications to the process gas heater's original design were implemented to prevent the reoccurrence of a similar failure. One significant modification was the insulation of 2 large dampers to enable the process gas heater to control its cooling rate which will extend the life of the tubes that have failed in the past. Another significant modification was the addition of a nitrogen purge to the outlet of the heater to significantly reduce any collateral damage in the event of any future tube failure. 
Louisiana has been a challenging startup. Nevertheless, it is a major step forward in the implementation of our long-term strategy to optimize our iron unit costs. In fact, we believe it has already provided short-term benefits. Presence of our Louisiana DRI facility, having produced 1.3 million tons last year and preparing to resume production at the end of last quarter, was a meaningful factor supporting February's dramatic downward adjustment of more than $100 per ton in scrap prices. That very much supports our belief in the long-term benefit of our DRI investment.
In the first quarter of 2015, our Hertford County, North Carolina plate mills recently added heat treating and normalizing assets, continued to run at full capacity of approximately 245,000 tons annually. The Hertford County team is capturing a growing share of value-added and higher-margin plate products. Relative to an investment of approximately $150 million, our value-added capabilities offer incremental, pretax profit that should average $200 per ton with the cycle.
During the first quarter, the first field installation of Nucor-Yamato's new wider, sheet piling sections was successfully completed. This new product is the result of a $115 million project we started up in the fourth quarter of last year. Our customers will benefit from this new domestic piling solution as they pursue ""Buy American,"" government-funded infrastructure projects.
Nucor-Yamato's expanded product portfolio will also create valuable synergies with the other products and services offered by the Skyline Steel piling distribution business we acquired in 2012. Our goal over the next several years is to grow our wider piling sections annual volume to 100,000 tons with combined steel mill and distribution pretax profit potential of approximately $450 per ton.
Momentum continues to build at Nucor Steel Berkeley's $98 million, wide light capital project that started off in early 2004 and has shipped approximately 120,000 tons last year. We expect to ship about 200,000 tons of the new products in 2015 and eventually grow volume to be at least 300,000 tons annually, with pretax profit averaging $100 per ton through the cycle. Berkeley now has the lightest, hot-rolled gauge capability of any sheet mill in the southern United States market. And with a finished width capability of up to 72 inches. Of particular importance, the upgrade allows Nucor to produce thinner, high strength steel grades that we plan to use to develop lightweight automotive applications.
As I've said earlier, these are just some of the growth initiatives. I look forward to updating you again next quarter on our progress implementing our strategy for profitable growth.
Here are some of the reasons why I believe Nucor will continue to deliver profitable, long-term growth and industry-leading returns on capital. Our loan and highly variable core structure is Nucor's bedrock competitive advantage. We understand that to generate attractive returns in a commodity business, you have to be a low-cost producer and seek continual improvement in your cost structure. Our balance sheet strength and through-the-cycle cash flow generation underpins our long-term focus and ability to take advantage of profitable growth opportunities, particularly during cyclical downturns. Our upstream, vertical integration into raw materials enhances the profitability and flexibility of Nucor's core steelmaking business. The David J. Joseph Company's unmatched global raw material supply chain, combined with our investments in DRI and scrap yards is Nucor's best-in-class capability and flexibility in optimizing what is by far our largest single cost item, iron units.
Our industry-leading product and market diversity continues to grow as we move up the value chain in all of our businesses. Our downstream vertical integration into value-added steel products enhances the profitability and flexibility of Nucor's core steelmaking business. Our expanded channels to market, such as Harris Steel, Steel Technologies and Skyline Steel increase our ability to compete with unfairly traded imports by expanding our opportunities to add value to our customers. Our commitment to achieving commercial excellence by leveraging Nucor's competitive advantages such as product diversity and operational flexibility to create more value for, and build stronger relationships with, each of our customers. And most importantly, Nucor's employees. The right people. They embraced the Nucor culture's pay-for-performance philosophy and passion for continuous improvement in taking care of our customers, our shareholders and their fellow teammates. That is why they're our company's greatest asset and our greatest competitive advantage. As has been true throughout Nucor's history, our company's best years are ahead of us. Thank you for your interest in Nucor. We would now be happy to take your questions."

Import is beginning to drop off, although we have seen them, I want to stress that it's going to be a while before we see that dropoff. Although we've seen a slight decline in licenses, there was so much out there in the pipeline that this is going to take off. And so much has already reached the service centers and just build up their inventories. It's going to be a while before we work our way through that. Now I can tell you that for the first time, this month, the numbers that just came out on service center inventories, we see them being down just a little bit. But imports are something you should certainly watch, and there are other factors, too, particularly on our sheet business, when you want to look at oil pricing. Now I can't tell you when it's going to recover, but certainly, we've seen a tremendous impact on our flat-rolled business as a result of oil pricing going from $100 to $50. Our volumes are way down. Same situation there. We flooded the pipeline with material. There's been a complete stop as they work their way through this inventory at some point. I frankly don't think it will be in the second quarter, but some point during the course of the year, maybe third or fourth quarter. We'll start working our way through that inventory, and we'll see ordering that are consistent with the new normal drilling levels that are expected with the lower price. Another thing you can keep your eye on is currency. Obviously, the strong dollar has an impact on what's happening both on our raw material side and on our steel shipment side as it relates to imports and other factors. So I've tried to give you a couple of things that you can keep an eye on, but there's a multitude of things that we have to watch to see what's going to happen as we go forward."

And I said that we keep about 5 to 6 weeks of inventory on the ground. That is an accurate statement.

Second quarter of 2015 earnings of $0.39 per diluted share exceeded our guidance range of $0.20 to $0.25 per diluted share. Second quarter results included a benefit of approximately $0.03 per diluted share related to state tax credits that largely arose from recently completed capital investment projects, though state tax credits were not factored into our guidance for the quarter. Overall, second quarter out-performance resulted from better-than-expected shipments and margins in our steel mills segment. The effective execution of Nucor's channel-to-market strategy is driving strong relative performance at both our bar and beam mills. Also, our sheet and plate businesses are benefiting from recent investments, allowing us to expand our offerings of value-added and higher-margin products in more demanding and import-resistant applications.
Our downstream product segment continues to capitalize on the slow but steady growth in nonresidential construction markets. Segment profitability for the first 6 months of 2015 was more than double the first half of 2014. Backlogs are also higher over year-ago levels for all 3 of our major fabricated construction products, [indiscernible] decking, rebar application and metal buildings. As measured by square footage, we expect the U.S. nonresidential construction activity in 2015 to increase by approximately 5% to 6% from 2014 levels.
The second quarter of 2015 performance of our raw materials segment included an operating loss at our new facility in Louisiana for approximately $20 million. That was down from the first quarter operating loss of approximately $44 million. The quarter-over-quarter improvement resulted from the strong output achieved following last quarter's restart production and a better product payment of approximately $10 million. Nucor Steel Louisiana's second quarter results included a negative impact of consuming higher-cost iron ore inventory that was acquired in 2014. As we disclosed in our first quarter conference call, we expect to finish working through those higher-cost raw materials by the close of the third quarter.
A quick comment about our tax rates since they can be confusing due to the impact of profits from noncontrolling interests. After adjusting our profits belonging to our business partners and the $9.3 million benefit related to state tax credits, the effective tax rate was 36.4% for the second quarter. Nucor continued to generate very robust operating cash flow during extremely challenging first half of 2015. With the highly variable and low cost structure, we benefit from significant reductions in working capital during downturns. That was the case again in the first half of 2015, with cash provided by operations of approximately $1.2 billion, a dramatic increase from the year-ago first half's operating cash flow of $443 million. Nucor's strong through-the-cycle operating cash flow generation allows us to invest in attractive opportunities during periods of industry distress, when the long-term returns are most attractive and to continue rewarding our shareholders with immediate returns in the form of base dividends that increased for 42 consecutive years.
Here's some numbers that help explain our cash generation such an important competitive strength supporting our team's focus on profitable long-term growth. Over the past 4 quarters, Nucor's generated cash from operations totaling $2.1 billion. During that period, that cash flow has enabled us to fund the acquisition of Gallatin Steel for about $779 million, paid cash dividends to shareholders of $477 million, investing capital expenditures of $391 -- $381 million, excuse me, let me repeat that, the invested capital expenditures of $381 million and increase our liquidity. In this time of unprecedented industry turmoil, our focus is not on survival but on growing the long-term value of our shareholders' investments. Nucor's financial position remains strong. Our gross debt-to-capital ratio was 36% at the close of the second quarter.
Cash and short-term investments totaled $1.7 billion, putting our net debt-to-capital ratio at approximately 26%. Our next significant debt maturity is not until December 2017. Nucor's strong liquidity position also includes our $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, which remains undrawn. That facility does not mature until August of 2018. Nucor is the only North American steel producer to hold an investment-grade credit rating.
The first 6 months of 2015 capital expenditures totaled $163 billion. We estimate full year 2015 capital spending will be approximately $450 million. Most of our recent larger-scale organic growth investments have been completed or are nearing completion.
Depreciation and amortization for 2015 is expected to total about $700 million. Earnings in the third quarter of 2015 are expected to be improved from second quarter. The steel segment should benefit from beginning the quarter with lower-cost inventories. Our steel product segment is expected to benefit from continuing gradual improvement in nonresidential construction activity. We are confident Nucor's significant competitive advantages and highly adaptable business model will allow our team to continue to execute our proven strategies for delivering profitable long-term growth and shareholder returns.
We do appreciate your interest in our company. John?"

Nucor's long-time success has been achieved by focusing on a simple strategy. Nucor capitalizes on its unrivaled position of strength in gaining profitable market share in our core businesses of steel and steel products throughout the economi",1335,"Thanks, Jim. Nucor's long-time success has been achieved by focusing on a simple strategy. Nucor capitalizes on its unrivaled position of strength in gaining profitable market share in our core businesses of steel and steel products throughout the economic cycle. Anchored to our strategy and its execution are these very powerful competitive strengths of Nucor. Nucor is a low-cost producer of steel and steel products. Importantly, we work to drive continual improvement in our cost structure. Nucor's financial strength is unparalleled in the North American steel industry. Nucor generates robust operating cash flow throughout the cyclical ups and downs that are inevitable part of the steel business. Nucor is the market leader in 9 of the 11 largest markets where we compete. Market leadership matters as we are able to earn higher margins by providing the broadest mix of products and services to our customers.
Nucor's channel-to-the-market strategy allows our steel mills to increase their penetration of higher margin and higher value-added products in a global steel market burdened with irrational excess capacity resulting from foreign government subsidies. Nucor's raw material strategy of execution has positioned us with greater flexibility to take advantage of the lowest-cost feedstock for making steel in a commodity business characterized by high volatility and infill costs. The steel industry has seen some very tough times over the past nearly 7 years, stretching back to the fall of 2008. While Nucor certainly does not welcome tough times in our business, we do not fear them. In fact, we use them to our advantage to grow stronger. I'm pleased to report that Nucor's position of strength has improved during this protracted steel industry downturn. Since 2008, Nucor has invested almost $6 billion to expand our portfolio to higher-margin products and to improve our relative cost position. Given the growth in our earnings capacity and the strength of the steel market demand in the U.S., we believe our profitability will challenge and possibly exceed our 2008 record earnings level, were it not for the tsunami of illegally traded influence that are overwhelming domestic steel industry. Nevertheless, the very initial payoff from these investments already can be seen on our current results. Here are some examples: Nucor's market-leading long products businesses achieved year-over-year growth and profitability for both the second quarter and first half of 2015 despite significant marketplace pressures resulting from influence. The key to this performance are market leadership positions and our vertically integrated, channel-to-the-market strategy. Our bar milles benefited from our strong channels to market provided by our downstream businesses. These downstream channels to market include: our market-leading joist-and-decking operations; our Harris Steel rebar fabrication business; our market-leading cold finish bar business; our market-leading pre-engineered metal buildings business; and a few others. Our Nucor-Yamato steel mill delivered a particularly strong performance through the second quarter. This performance is evidenced of the strong partnerships Nucor-Yamato Steel has built with its fabricated customers. Also, the market-leading teams at Nucor-Yamato Steel and Skyline Steel continue to grow profitable market share for us in the steel piping market. Nucor-Yamato Steel expects to grow wider island sections annual volume to 100,000 tons over the next few years. These products were introduced to the marketplace earlier this year and received their first extra order in the second quarter.
The automotive market continues to be an attractive growth opportunity for Nucor. Our sheets and engineered bar businesses are on track in 2015 to increase their combined automotive volume by more than 20% to approximately 1.4 million tons. And there is more growth ahead as our goal is to reach an annual shipment rate of 2 million tons to the automotive market within the next 2 to 3 years. As always, our focus is on profitable growth in our automotive book of business, created by our ability to provide unique, value-added products and services. Nucor's recent and significant investments throughout our sheet and engineered bar mill groups are driving our growing market share in these higher-margin and more import-resistant products.
Our Nucor Steel Berkeley sheet mills continued to build momentum in the second quarter with its very successful rollout of new wide line products. Berkeley expects to ship 200,000 tons of these new products this year, allowing it to gain market share with a number of important heavy equipment service centers and automotive customers. Completed in 2014, the wide line modernization capital project has positioned Berkeley with the lightest capability of any sheet mill in the Southern U.S. market and with the finished product lift of up to 72 inches.
Our raw material strategy is a critical foundation, supporting Nucor's growing participation in higher value-added and higher-margin products. During the second quarter, our Louisiana directly produced iron plant successfully ramped up its -- following its 5-month shutdown to make major equipment improvements. Louisiana produced approximately 540,000 tons of DRI in the second quarter of 2015 with its usual world-class quality levels. Louisiana has been a challenging start-up as was our plan to Trinidad that started up in 2007. It is worth noting that the challenge is in Trinidad was somewhat masked by dramatically different raw materials striking environment. Despite recent challenges, our confidence has never been higher regarding the long-term value of Nucor owning DRI production capability. It puts Nucor in unrivaled position of flexibility in optimizing our iron units cost during the cycle. During the second quarter, major progress was achieved in the work done by Nucor and other producers to fight back against the tsunami of illegally traded steel influence coming into the United States. Influx was 32% of all steel sold in this country in the first 6 months of this year. That is up from a 27% market share for the year-ago period and slightly above 20% of the market in 2009.
I am very pleased to report that we scored 2 significant victories recently. Congress, on a bipartisan basis, adopted important trade remedy provisions championed by the U.S. steel industry as part of a package of trade bills. By passing this legislation, Congress has given our industry more effective tools to fight back against unfairly and illegally traded steel influence. These changes were long overdue. The U.S. trade laws have not been updated for over 20 years. The Nucor team implores Congress and the administration take a much tougher line with countries that break the law and destroy the economic vitality of our country. These new trade laws alone will not address the underlying issue of systemic global steel overcapacity resulting from trade distorting practices of some foreign governments. It is time for the world trading community to take firm action to stop these countries from dumping their steel and force them to comply with World Trade Organization rules. As has always been the case, Nucor will not hesitate to file a trade case if the evidence warrants such action. During the second quarter, we joined 5 other steel makers in filing a trade case against India, China, Italy, Korea and Taiwan for dumping and providing significant subsidies to producers of corrosion-resistant steel. We are pleased that last week, the U.S. International Trade Commission made a preliminary affirmative determination allowing the case to proceed. Nucor will continue to assess market conditions in other products market -- and other part of markets and pursue cases, when appropriate. Our fight against illegally traded steel implements is essential to meeting our responsibility to be an effective steward of our shareholders' valuable capital.
In closing, I am extremely confident that Nucor's best years are still ahead of us. Every time I visit a Nucor facility and spend time with my teammates, I'm reminded why I have absolute confidence that Nucor's future is extremely bright. It's because of the quality and commitment of the men and women who serve together with me on the Nucor team. They are truly the best. They are truly the right people. They will get the job done. Thank you for your interest in Nucor. We will now be happy to take your questions."

It gives the International Trade Commission the much broader list of factors on determining whether an industry has been injured, not just profitability. That's important. It's no longer be necessary for us to suffer severe financial damage before action can be taken. Another permission enhances the Commerce's Department -- excuse me, the Commerce Department's discretion in dealing with foreign companies and foreign governments that are uncooperative or very slow to provide the information they need to make a determination.

And all of these occasions we're focusing on investments on higher-margin products but also more import-resistant. Although we're taking a lot, we feel good about action that's being taken in Washington to fight off these illegally traded products. The focus that we have is to continue to work to better insulate Nucor from that flood of imports. And the way to do that is to focus on this value-added products. A good example that I can give you, Timna, is all the work that we're doing on our advanced supply strength steel going to the automotive market. I mentioned how we've done in that over the last couple of years. There's a product as of the quality requirements and because of the just-in-time delivery requirements, that's not easily imported. So that's an area of focus for us. I'd also like to speak a little bit more about the continued investment in lowering our total cost reduction. You mentioned that I referenced our DRI production, given the current environment, is not as attractive as we thought we might have been at one point. But I do want to point out that it's still attractive. If you take a look, the issue we're working on right through is the short-term issue when we have this iron ore that's higher-priced. But if you took a look at the cost of our conversion cost today, and you apply the market price for iron units coming out of iron ore today, our all-in costs will be under what we would have to be paying for other forms of low-residual products like pig iron and prime scrap. So it's [indiscernible] to how you both invest. The question of whether it's a good investment or whether it's a great investment in today's price environment. It's a good investment. In pricing environment of iron units where we were 1.5 years ago, it would be a great investment. And trust me, given the cyclical nature of our business, it will be a great investment again in the future. So I wanted to be clear about that so that should we move forward with investing further in some form of the DRI or blast furnace project, everyone understands that we have a short-term issue. We're dealing with it. It will pass. Long term, we still believe very strongly in the strategy. At the end of the day, we look at it this way. We look at it this way, the amount of iron ore in the world is virtually unlimited.

It's also the issue of allowing inventories in warehouses to continue to come down. It's a function that you look at that our business and where is our product going and how those markets performing. Obviously, we talked about our case participation in the automotive market, and that's a strong market. We talked about nonresidential construction. And clearly, a lot of all of our products, including sheet, will go into nonresidential construction, and we see that picking up. But on the other hand, we also have a lot of products that goes into oil-related products such as OCTG, and that's obviously struggling right now. We don't see that changing for the rest of the year. So we see some of the markets that we sell into our sheet products into is continuing to get better, and we see others that will continue to struggle. But overall, as we look at the third and fourth quarter, what we could put into them, another 20% to 25%. Whether we'll be able to do that will be a function of what happens and how quickly it happens with trade cases, potential trade cases on the hot-rolled and cold rolled products, how quickly that impacts imports coming in. That, of course, will also help drive how quickly the warehouse inventories deplete. But at end of the day, to say that -- I believe that we will be making more and more projects against imports. I feel really good about this pretty recent legislation and the impact it's going to have short term and long term in our business. And so as I look forward for the rest of the year, we do have, as a company, we're heavily weighted on the hot side sometimes, and that's a real advantage. Sometimes, it's not. Right now, that's not advantage. But that will turn around also. So I feel good about where we're going. I feel good about the import situation and the impact it will have the market."

Thank you for joining us for our conference call. As always, we appreciate your interest in Nucor. With me for today's call are the other members of Nucor's senior management team: Chief Financial Officer, Jim Frias; and our other executive vice presidents Jim Darsey, Ladd Hall, Ray Napolitan, Joe Stratman, Dave Sumoski and Chad Utermark. 
The entire executive team would like to thank you all, all of our team members on our Harris, Nucor, David J. Joseph, Duferdofin, Newbridge Steel Technologies [ph] and Skyline Steel teams for your excellent work taking care of our customers and implementing our company strategy for long-term, profitable growth. 
Without question, the first half of 2015 has been an extremely challenging time for the steel industry. The strategy at Nucor is about growing stronger and building the foundation for higher highs in earnings. Our unrivaled competitive advantages and highly flexible business model allow us to manage our business with a long-term focus on profitable and sustainable growth. Just as important, the financial success of our employees is tightly aligned with that of our shareholders. That is why the more than 23,000 men and women of the Nucor team apply both their high energy level and sense of urgency to achieving our goal of profitable growth. 
We have a lot of exciting progress to share with you today. But first, I will ask our CFO, Jim Frias, to review Nucor's second quarter performance and financial position. Following Jim's comments, I will update you on the execution of our strategy for long-term, profitable growth. Jim?"

Second quarter of 2015 earnings of $0.39 per diluted share exceeded our guidance range of $0.20 to $0.25 per diluted share. Second quarter results included a benefit of approximately $0.03 per diluted share related to state tax credits that largely arose from recently completed capital investment projects. Those state tax credits were not factored into our guidance for the quarter. Overall, second quarter outperformance resulted from better-than-expected shipments and margins in our steel mills segment. Effective execution of Nucor's channel-to-market strategy is driving strong relative performance at both our bar and beam mills. Also, our sheet and plate businesses are benefiting from recent investments, allowing us to expand our offerings of value-added and higher-margin products in more demanding and import-resistant applications.
Our downstream product segment continues to capitalize on the slow but steady growth in nonresidential construction markets. Segment profitability for the first 6 months in 2015 was more than double the first half of 2014. Backlogs are also higher over year-ago levels for all 3 of our major fabricated construction products, joist and decking, rebar fabrication and metal buildings. As measured by square footage, we expect the U.S. nonresidential construction activity in 2015 to increase by approximately 5% to 6% from 2014 levels.
The second quarter of 2015 performance of our raw materials segment included an operating loss at our new direct facility in Louisiana of approximately $20 million. That was down from the first quarter operating loss of approximately $44 million. The quarter-over-quarter improvement resulted from the strong output achieved following last quarter's restart of production and a better product warranty payment of approximately $10 million. Nucor Steel Louisiana's second quarter results included the negative impact of consuming higher-cost iron ore inventory that was acquired in 2014. As we disclosed in our first quarter conference call, we expect to finish working through those higher-cost raw materials by the close of the third quarter.
A quick comment about our tax rates since they can be confusing due to the impact of profits from noncontrolling interests. After adjusting our profits belonging to our business partners and the $9.3 million benefit related to state tax credits, the effective tax rate was 36.4% for the second quarter. Nucor continued to generate very robust operating cash flows during the extremely challenging first half of 2015. With a highly variable and low-cost structure, we benefit from significant reductions in working capital during downturns. That was the case again in the first half of 2015 with cash provided by operations of approximately $1.2 billion, a dramatic increase from the year-ago first half's operating cash flow of $443 million. Nucor's strong through-the-cycle operating cash flow generation allows us to invest in attractive opportunities during periods of industry distress when the long-term returns are most attractive and to continue rewarding our shareholders with immediate returns in the form of base dividends that increased for 42 consecutive years.
Here are some numbers to help explain how our cash generation is such an important competitive strength supporting our team's focus on profitable long-term growth. Over the past 4 quarters, Nucor has generated cash from operations totaling $2.1 billion. During that period, that cash flow has enabled us to fund the acquisition of Gallatin Steel for about $779 million, paid cash dividends to shareholders of $477 million, invest in capital expenditures of $391 million -- $381 million, excuse me, let me repeat that, investment -- invest in capital expenditures of $381 million and increase our liquidity. 
In this time of unprecedented industry turmoil, our focus is not on survival but on growing the long-term value of our shareholders' investments. Nucor's financial position remains strong. Our gross debt-to-capital ratio was 36% at the close of the second quarter. Cash and short-term investments totaled $1.7 billion, putting our net debt-to-capital ratio at approximately 26%. Our next significant debt maturity is not until December 2017. Nucor's strong liquidity position also includes our $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, which remains undrawn. That facility does not mature until August of 2018. Nucor is the only North American steel producer to hold an investment-grade credit rating.
The first 6 months of 2015 capital expenditures totaled $163 million. We estimate full year 2015 capital spending will be approximately $450 million. Most of our recent larger-scale organic growth investments have been completed or are nearing completion.
Depreciation and amortization for 2015 is expected to total about $700 million. 
Earnings in the third quarter of 2015 are expected to be improved from second quarter. The steel segment should benefit from beginning the quarter with lower-cost inventories. Our steel product segment is expected to benefit from continuing gradual improvement in nonresidential construction activity. We are confident Nucor's significant competitive advantages and highly adaptable business model will allow our team to continue to execute our proven strategies for delivering profitable, long-term growth in shareholder returns.
We do appreciate your interest in our company. John?"

Nucor's long-term success has been achieved by focusing on a simple strategy.

Nucor's long-term success has been achieved by focusing on a simple strategy. Nucor capitalizes on its unrivaled position of strength in gaining profitable market share in our core businesses of steel and steel products throughout the economic cycle. The anchors to our strategy and its execution are these very powerful competitive strengths of Nucor. Nucor is a low-cost producer of steel and steel products. Importantly, we work to drive continual improvement in our cost structure. 
Nucor's financial strength is unparalleled in the North American steel industry. Nucor generates robust operating cash flow throughout the cyclical ups and downs that are an inevitable part of the steel business. 
Nucor is the market leader in 9 of the 11 largest markets where we compete. Market leadership matters as we are able to earn higher margins by providing the broadest mix of products and services to our customers.
Nucor's channel-to-the-market strategy allows our steel mills to increase their penetration of higher-margin and higher-value-added products in a global steel market burdened with irrational excess capacity resulting from foreign government subsidies. Nucor's raw material strategy's execution has positioned us with greater flexibility to take advantage of the lowest-cost feedstock for making steel in a commodity business characterized by high volatility and input costs. 
The steel industry has seen some very tough times over the past nearly 7 years stretching back to the fall of 2008. While Nucor certainly does not welcome tough times in our business, we do not fear them. In fact, we use them to our advantage to grow stronger. 
I am pleased to report that Nucor's position of strength has improved during this protracted steel industry downturn. Since 2008, Nucor has invested almost $6 billion to expand our portfolios of higher-margin products and to improve our relative cost position. 
Given the growth in our earnings capacity and the strength of the steel market demand in the U.S., we believe our profitability will challenge and possibly exceed our 2008 record earnings level were it not for the tsunami of illegally traded imports that are overwhelming domestic steel industry. Nevertheless, the very initial payoff from these investments already can be seen in our current results. Here are some examples. 
Nucor's market-leading long products businesses achieved year-over-year growth in profitability for both the second quarter and first half of 2015 despite significant marketplace pressures resulting from imports. The keys to this performance were market leadership positions and our vertically integrated channel-to-the-market strategy. Our bar mills benefited from the strong channels to market provided by our downstream businesses. These downstream channels to the market include our market-leading Vulcraft/Verco joist and deck operations, our Harris Steel rebar fabrication business, our market-leading cold finished bar business, our market-leading pre-engineered metal buildings business and a few others. 
Our Nucor-Yamato structural steel mill delivered a particularly strong performance through the second quarter. This performance is evidence of the strong partnerships Nucor-Yamato has built with its fabricated customers. Also, the market-leading teams at Nucor-Yamato and Skyline Steel continue to grow profitable market share for us in the steel piping market. Nucor-Yamato expects to grow its wider piling sections' annual volume to 100,000 tons over the next few years. These products were introduced to the marketplace earlier this year and received their first export order in the second quarter.
The automotive market continues to be an attractive growth opportunity for Nucor. Our sheets and engineered bar businesses are on track in 2015 to increase their combined automotive volume by more than 20% to approximately 1.4 million tons. And there is more growth ahead as our goal is to reach an annual shipment rate of 2 million tons for the automotive market within the next 2 to 3 years. 
As always, our focus is on profitable growth in our automotive book of business created by our ability to provide unique, value-added products and services. Nucor's recent and significant investments throughout our sheet and engineered bar mill groups are driving our growing market share in these higher-margin and more import-resistant products.
Our Nucor Steel Berkeley sheet mills continued to build momentum in the second quarter with its very successful rollout of new wide-light products. Berkeley expects to ship 200,000 tons of these new products this year, allowing it to gain market share with a number of important heavy equipment, service center and automotive customers. Completed in 2014, the wide-light modernization capital project has positioned Berkeley with the widest hot-rolled gauge capability of any sheet mill in the Southern U.S. market and with a finished product width of up to 72 inches.
Our raw material strategy is a critical foundation, supporting Nucor's growing participation in the higher-value-added and higher-margin products. During the second quarter, our Louisiana direct reduced iron plant successfully ramped up its -- following its 5-month shutdown to make major equipment improvements. Louisiana produced approximately 540,000 tons of DRI in the second quarter of 2015 with its usual world-class quality levels. 
Louisiana has been a challenging start-up, as was our plan with Trinidad that started up in 2007. It is worth noting that the challenges in Trinidad were somewhat masked by a dramatically different raw material pricing environment. Despite recent challenges, our confidence has never been high regarding the long-term value of Nucor owning DRI production capability. It puts Nucor in an unrivaled position of flexibility in optimizing our iron unit's cost through the cycle. 
During the second quarter, major progress was achieved in the work done by Nucor and other producers to fight back against the tsunami of illegally traded steel imports coming into the United States. Imports were 32% of all steel sold in this country in the first 6 months of this year. That is up from a 27% market share for the year-ago period and from slightly above 20% of the market in 2009. 
I am very pleased to report that we scored 2 significant victories recently. Congress on a bipartisan basis adopted important trade remedy provisions championed by the U.S. steel industry as part of a package of trade bills. By passing this legislation, Congress has given our industry more effective tools to fight back against unfairly and illegally traded steel imports. 
These changes were long overdue. U.S. trade laws have not been updated for over 20 years. The Nucor team reports Congress and the administration are taking a much tougher line with countries that break the law and destroy the economic vitality of our country. 
These new trade laws alone will not address the underlying issue of systemic global steel overcapacity resulting from trade-distorting practices of some foreign governments. It is time for the world trading community to take firm action to stop these countries from dumping their steel and force them to comply with World Trade Organization rules. 
As has always been the case, Nucor will not hesitate to file a trade case if the evidence warrants such action. During the second quarter, we joined 5 other steelmakers in filing a trade case against India, China, Italy, Korea and Taiwan for dumping and providing significant subsidies to producers of corrosion-resistant steel. We are pleased that last week, the U.S. International Trade Commission made a preliminary affirmative determination allowing the case to proceed. 
Nucor will continue to assess market conditions in other products market -- in other product markets and pursue cases when appropriate. Our fight against illegally traded steel imports is essential to meeting our responsibility to be an effective steward of our shareholders' valuable capital.
In closing, I am extremely confident that Nucor's best years are still ahead of us. Every time I visit a Nucor facility and spend time with my teammates, I'm reminded why I have absolute confidence that Nucor's future is extremely bright. It's because of the quality and commitment of the men and women who serve together with me on the Nucor team. They are truly the best. They are truly the right people. They will get the job done. Thank you for your interest in Nucor. We will now be happy to take your questions."

It's no -- will no longer be necessary for us to suffer severe financial damage before action can be taken. Another provision enhances the Commerce's Department -- excuse me, the Commerce Department's discretion in dealing with foreign companies and foreign governments that are uncooperative or are very slow to provide the information they need to make a determination.

And although that we're looking at -- I'm here and I'm talking about the whole market there. Although we're looking at demand levels that are probably just about the same as last year, the import level has gone up from 27% to about 32% to 33%. So demand is not the issue. Demand is strong. But imports are taking a much bigger bite out of our potential long product business. My thoughts about 32% to 33%, that's across all of our products. When you look at it -- you mentioned being specific. Well, you saw our comment on that. Imports are up 33%. It means year-over-year. That's a huge increase. So the short answer to your question, demand is strong. We see good demand. We believe that we'll grow moderately throughout the rest of the year. The issue is not the imports.

And we would focus on areas that brought value-added, higher-value products. And our investments that we've made similar to what we did in Hertford County would be G3 and the normalizing investments that we've made in SBQ, investments that we've made at Berkeley with the wide-light project, the investments that we've made with wider piling sections. In all of these cases, we're focusing on investments on higher-margin products but also more import resistant. Although we're taking a lot and we feel good about the action that's being taken in Washington to fight off these illegally traded products, the focus that we have is to continue to work to better insulate Nucor from that flood of imports. And the way to do that is to focus on those value-added products. I think a great example that I can give you, Timna, is all the work that we're doing on our advanced high-strength steels that's going to the automotive market. I've mentioned how we've grown in that over the last couple of years. There's a product, because of the quality requirements and because of the just-in-time delivery requirements, that's not easily imported. So that's an area of focus for us. I'd also like to speak a little bit more about the continued investment in lowering our total cost of production. You mentioned that I referenced that our DRI production, given the current environment, is not as attractive as we thought it might have been at one point. But I do want to point out that it's still attractive. If you take a look, the issue we're working on right there was a short-term issue where we have this iron ore that's higher priced. But if you took a look at the cost of our -- our conversion costs today and you apply the market price for iron units coming out of iron ore today, our all-in costs will be under what we would have to be paying for other forms of low-residual products, say, like pig iron and prime scrap. So it's typical how you will invest. Now the question is whether it's a good investment or whether it's a great investment. In today's pricing environment, it's a good investment. In a pricing environment of iron units where we were 1.5 years ago, it would be a great investment. And trust me, given the cyclical nature of our business, it will be a great investment again in the future. So I wanted to be clear about that so that should we move forward with investing further in some form of DRI or blast furnace project, everyone understands that we have a short-term issue. We're dealing with it. It will pass. Long term, we still believe very strongly in this strategy. At the end of the day, at the end of the day, we look at it this way. The amount of iron ore in the world is virtually unlimited. The amount of scrap in the world is much more limited. And it's -- we could generate more iron ore by reinvesting in extraction techniques and start to generate more scrap. And we see that -- frankly, we see the amount of scrap being generated in the United States as declining."

Obviously -- now we talked about our increased participation in the automotive market, and that's a strong market. We talked about nonresidential construction. And clearly, a lot of -- all of our products, including sheet, will go into nonresidential construction, and we'll see that picking up. But on the other hand, we also have a lot of products that goes into oil-related products such as OCTG, and that's obviously struggling right now. We don't see that changing for the rest of the year. So we see some of the markets that we sell into, our sheet products into, as continuing to get better, and we see others that will continue to struggle. But overall, as we look at the third and fourth quarter, well, we could put into them another 20% to 25%. Whether we'll be able to do that will be a function of what happens and how quickly it happens with trade cases or potential trade cases on hot-rolled and on cold-rolled products, how quickly that impacts the imports coming in. That, of course, will also help drive how quickly the warehouse inventories deplete. But at end of the day, I will say that I believe that we will be making more and more progress against imports. I feel really good about the recent legislation and the impact that's going to have short term and long term in our business. And so as I look forward to the rest of the year, we do have -- as a company, we're heavily weighted on the hot hand [ph] side sometimes. That's a real advantage. Sometimes, it's not.

If it was winter and pricing is going down, a little harder to go out in the field and start tearing apart that old tractor and scrapping it.

So it's not a case of whether or not there's going to be product substitution going on and where that ends up going. They have learned the lesson of what's been going on, and they're reacting quicker. The law -- the recent legislation is going to give us not quite the same speed, but it is going to improve our ability to deal with that issue by dealing more quickly with each product as it comes up. And ultimately, there are mechanisms in the law. And if we find this to be a problem that spreads across all products in any one particular country or across different countries, that we might be able to take the action. It's much better to proceed with that type of action, but we've been successful with it in the past. I'm sure you're familiar with it. It's the -- frankly, it's the 201. And should a problem become so obvious that countries are employing the concept of product solution or country substitution, we would have -- we would not hesitate to go down that path again in the future. Certainly, it's a challenging situation, the imports, and one that we recognize is probably the largest -- and again, it's the largest challenge our industry faces.

Thank you for joining us for our conference call. As always, we appreciate your interest in Nucor. With me for today's call are the other members of Nucor's senior management team: Chief Financial Officer, Jim Frias; and our other executive vice presidents Jim Darsey, Ladd Hall, Ray Napolitan, Joe Stratman, Dave Sumoski and Chad Utermark. 
The entire executive team would like to thank you all, all of our team members on our Harris, Nucor, David J. Joseph, Duferdofin, Newbridge Steel Technologies [ph] and Skyline Steel teams for your excellent work taking care of our customers and implementing our company strategy for long-term, profitable growth. 
Without question, the first half of 2015 has been an extremely challenging time for the steel industry. The strategy at Nucor is about growing stronger and building the foundation for higher highs in earnings. Our unrivaled competitive advantages and highly flexible business model allow us to manage our business with a long-term focus on profitable and sustainable growth. Just as important, the financial success of our employees is tightly aligned with that of our shareholders. That is why the more than 23,000 men and women of the Nucor team apply both their high energy level and sense of urgency to achieving our goal of profitable growth. 
We have a lot of exciting progress to share with you today. But first, I will ask our CFO, Jim Frias, to review Nucor's second quarter performance and financial position. Following Jim's comments, I will update you on the execution of our strategy for long-term, profitable growth. Jim?"

Second quarter results included a benefit of approximately $0.03 per diluted share related to state tax credits that",798,"Thanks, John. Second quarter of 2015 earnings of $0.39 per diluted share exceeded our guidance range of $0.20 to $0.25 per diluted share. Second quarter results included a benefit of approximately $0.03 per diluted share related to state tax credits that largely arose from recently completed capital investment projects. Those state tax credits were not factored into our guidance for the quarter. Overall, second quarter outperformance resulted from better-than-expected shipments and margins in our steel mills segment. Effective execution of Nucor's channel-to-market strategy is driving strong relative performance at both our bar and beam mills. Also, our sheet and plate businesses are benefiting from recent investments, allowing us to expand our offerings of value-added and higher-margin products in more demanding and import-resistant applications.
Our downstream product segment continues to capitalize on the slow but steady growth in nonresidential construction markets. Segment profitability for the first 6 months in 2015 was more than double the first half of 2014. Backlogs are also higher over year-ago levels for all 3 of our major fabricated construction products, joist and decking, rebar fabrication and metal buildings. As measured by square footage, we expect the U.S. nonresidential construction activity in 2015 to increase by approximately 5% to 6% from 2014 levels.
The second quarter of 2015 performance of our raw materials segment included an operating loss at our new DRI facility in Louisiana of approximately $20 million. That was down from the first quarter operating loss of approximately $44 million. The quarter-over-quarter improvement resulted from the strong output achieved following last quarter's restart of production and a vendor product warranty payment of approximately $10 million. Nucor Steel Louisiana's second quarter results included the negative impact of consuming higher-cost iron ore inventory that was acquired in 2014. As we disclosed in our first quarter conference call, we expect to finish working through those higher-cost raw materials by the close of the third quarter.
A quick comment about our tax rates since they can be confusing due to the impact of profits from noncontrolling interests. After adjusting our profits belonging to our business partners and the $9.3 million benefit related to state tax credits, the effective tax rate was 36.4% for the second quarter. Nucor continued to generate very robust operating cash flows during the extremely challenging first half of 2015. With a highly variable and low-cost structure, we benefit from significant reductions in working capital during downturns. That was the case again in the first half of 2015 with cash provided by operations of approximately $1.2 billion, a dramatic increase from the year-ago first half's operating cash flow of $443 million. Nucor's strong through-the-cycle operating cash flow generation allows us to invest in attractive opportunities during periods of industry distress when the long-term returns are most attractive and to continue rewarding our shareholders with immediate returns in the form of base dividends that increased for 42 consecutive years.
Here are some numbers to help explain how our cash generation is such an important competitive strength supporting our team's focus on profitable long-term growth. Over the past 4 quarters, Nucor has generated cash from operations totaling $2.1 billion. During that period, that cash flow has enabled us to fund the acquisition of Gallatin Steel for about $779 million, paid cash dividends to shareholders of $477 million, invest in capital expenditures of $381 million and increase our liquidity. 
In this time of unprecedented industry turmoil, our focus is not on survival but on growing the long-term value of our shareholders' investments. Nucor's financial position remains strong. Our gross debt-to-capital ratio was 36% at the close of the second quarter. Cash and short-term investments totaled $1.7 billion, putting our net debt-to-capital ratio at approximately 26%. Our next significant debt maturity is not until December 2017. Nucor's strong liquidity position also includes our $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, which remains undrawn. That facility does not mature until August of 2018. Nucor is the only North American steel producer to hold an investment-grade credit rating.
The first 6 months of 2015 capital expenditures totaled $163 million. We estimate full year 2015 capital spending will be approximately $450 million. Most of our recent larger-scale organic growth investments have been completed or are nearing completion.
Depreciation and amortization for 2015 is expected to total about $700 million. 
Earnings in the third quarter of 2015 are expected to be improved from second quarter. The steel segment should benefit from beginning the quarter with lower-cost inventories. Our steel product segment is expected to benefit from continuing gradual improvement in nonresidential construction activity. We are confident Nucor's significant competitive advantages and highly adaptable business model will allow our team to continue to execute our proven strategies for delivering profitable, long-term growth in shareholder returns.
We do appreciate your interest in our company. John?"

Nucor's long-term success has been achieved by focusing on a simple strategy. Nucor capitalizes on its unrivaled position of strength in gaining profitable market share in our core businesses of steel and steel products throughout the economi",1336,"Thanks, Jim. Nucor's long-term success has been achieved by focusing on a simple strategy. Nucor capitalizes on its unrivaled position of strength in gaining profitable market share in our core businesses of steel and steel products throughout the economic cycle. The anchors to our strategy and its execution are these very powerful competitive strengths of Nucor. Nucor is a low-cost producer of steel and steel products. Importantly, we work to drive continual improvement in our cost structure. 
Nucor's financial strength is unparalleled in the North American steel industry. Nucor generates robust operating cash flow throughout the cyclical ups and downs that are an inevitable part of the steel business. 
Nucor is the market leader in 9 of the 11 largest markets where we compete. Market leadership matters as we are able to earn higher margins by providing the broadest mix of products and services to our customers.
Nucor's channel-to-the-market strategy allows our steel mills to increase their penetration of higher-margin and higher-value-added products in a global steel market burdened with irrational excess capacity resulting from foreign government subsidies. Nucor's raw material strategy's execution has positioned us with greater flexibility to take advantage of the lowest-cost feedstock for making steel in a commodity business characterized by high volatility and import costs. 
The steel industry has seen some very tough times over the past nearly 7 years stretching back to the fall of 2008. While Nucor certainly does not welcome tough times in our business, we do not fear them. In fact, we use them to our advantage to grow stronger. 
I am pleased to report that Nucor's position of strength has improved during this protracted steel industry downturn. Since 2008, Nucor has invested almost $6 billion to expand our portfolios of higher-margin products and to improve our relative cost position. 
Given the growth in our earnings capacity and the strength of the steel market demand in the U.S., we believe our profitability will challenge and possibly exceed our 2008 record earnings level were it not for the tsunami of illegally traded imports that are overwhelming domestic steel industry. Nevertheless, the very initial payoff from these investments already can be seen in our current results. Here are some examples. 
Nucor's market-leading long products businesses achieved year-over-year growth in profitability for both the second quarter and first half of 2015 despite significant marketplace pressures resulting from imports. The keys to this performance were market leadership positions and our vertically integrated channel-to-the-market strategy. Our bar mills benefited from the strong channels to market provided by our downstream businesses. These downstream channels to the market include our market-leading Vulcraft/Verco joist and deck operations, our Harris Steel rebar fabrication business, our market-leading cold finished bar business, our market-leading pre-engineered metal buildings business and a few others. 
Our Nucor-Yamato structural steel mill delivered a particularly strong performance through the second quarter. This performance is evidence of the strong partnerships Nucor-Yamato has built with its fabricated customers. Also, the market-leading teams at Nucor-Yamato and Skyline Steel continue to grow profitable market share for us in the steel pilings market. Nucor-Yamato expects to grow its wider piling sections' annual volume to 100,000 tons over the next few years. These products were introduced to the marketplace earlier this year and received their first export order in the second quarter.
The automotive market continues to be an attractive growth opportunity for Nucor. Our sheets and engineered bar businesses are on track in 2015 to increase their combined automotive volume by more than 20% to approximately 1.4 million tons. And there is more growth ahead as our goal is to reach an annual shipment rate of 2 million tons for the automotive market within the next 2 to 3 years. 
As always, our focus is on profitable growth in our automotive book of business created by our ability to provide unique, value-added products and services. Nucor's recent and significant investments throughout our sheet and engineered bar mill groups are driving our growing market share in these higher-margin and more import-resistant products.
Our Nucor Steel Berkeley sheet mills continued to build momentum in the second quarter with its very successful rollout of new wide-light products. Berkeley expects to ship 200,000 tons of these new products this year, allowing it to gain market share with a number of important heavy equipment, service center and automotive customers. Completed in 2014, the wide-light modernization capital project has positioned Berkeley with the lightest hot-rolled gauge capability of any sheet mill in the Southern U.S. market and with a finished product width of up to 72 inches.
Our raw material strategy is a critical foundation, supporting Nucor's growing participation in the higher-value-added and higher-margin products. During the second quarter, our Louisiana direct reduced iron plant successfully ramped up its -- following its 5-month shutdown to make major equipment improvements. Louisiana produced approximately 540,000 tons of DRI in the second quarter of 2015 with its usual world-class quality levels. 
Louisiana has been a challenging start-up, as was our plan with Trinidad that started up in 2007. It is worth noting that the challenges in Trinidad were somewhat masked by a dramatically different raw material pricing environment. Despite recent challenges, our confidence has never been higher regarding the long-term value of Nucor-owning DRI production capability. It puts Nucor in an unrivaled position of flexibility in optimizing our iron unit's cost through the cycle. 
During the second quarter, major progress was achieved in the work done by Nucor and other producers to fight back against the tsunami of illegally traded steel imports coming into the United States. Imports were 32% of all steel sold in this country in the first 6 months of this year. That is up from a 27% market share for the year-ago period and from slightly above 20% of the market in 2009. 
I am very pleased to report that we scored 2 significant victories recently. Congress on a bipartisan basis adopted important trade remedy provisions championed by the U.S. steel industry as part of a package of trade bills. By passing this legislation, Congress has given our industry more effective tools to fight back against unfairly and illegally traded steel imports. 
These changes were long overdue. U.S. trade laws have not been updated for over 20 years. The Nucor team reports Congress and the administration are taking a much tougher line with countries that break the law and destroy the economic vitality of our country. 
These new trade laws alone will not address the underlying issue of systemic global steel overcapacity resulting from trade-distorting practices of some foreign governments. It is time for the world trading community to take firm action to stop these countries from dumping their steel and force them to comply with World Trade Organization rules. 
As has always been the case, Nucor will not hesitate to file a trade case if the evidence warrants such action. During the second quarter, we joined 5 other steelmakers in filing a trade case against India, China, Italy, Korea and Taiwan for dumping and providing significant subsidies to producers of corrosion-resistant steel. We are pleased that last week, the U.S. International Trade Commission made a preliminary affirmative determination allowing the case to proceed. 
Nucor will continue to assess market conditions in other products market -- in other product markets and pursue cases when appropriate. Our fight against illegally traded steel imports is essential to meeting our responsibility to be an effective steward of our shareholders' valuable capital.
In closing, I am extremely confident that Nucor's best years are still ahead of us. Every time I visit a Nucor facility and spend time with my teammates, I'm reminded why I have absolute confidence that Nucor's future is extremely bright. It's because of the quality and commitment of the men and women who serve together with me on the Nucor team. They are truly the best. They are truly the right people. They will get the job done. Thank you for your interest in Nucor. We will now be happy to take your questions."

Now clearly, it gives us much stronger tools to fight back against unfair trade. Just to mention maybe a couple of the things that it does for us, and number one is it changes the definition of injury. It gives the International Trade Commission a much broader list of factors when determining whether an industry has been injured, not just profitability. That's important. It's no -- will no longer be necessary for us to suffer severe financial damage before action can be taken. Another provision enhances the Commerce's Department -- excuse me, the Commerce Department's discretion in dealing with foreign companies and foreign governments that are uncooperative or are very slow to provide the information they need to make a determination. So although I have to say that this is a very positive first step, there is more work to be done and we believe that this will create a much more balanced and fair marketplace competition here in the United States.

It's on the supply side. And it's the fact that the imports are coming in so heavy. As I'm sure you know, Timna, they have captured about 32% of the steel market today. And although that we're looking at -- again I'm talking about the whole market there. Although we're looking at demand levels that are probably just about the same as last year, the import level has gone up from 27% to about 32% to 33%. So demand is not the issue. Demand is strong. But imports are taking a much bigger bite out of our potential long product business. My thoughts about 32% to 33%, that's across all of our products. When you look at it -- you mentioned beams specifically, so I'll comment on that. Imports are up 33%. It means year-over-year. That's a huge increase. So the short answer to your question, demand is strong. We see good demand. We believe that we'll grow moderately throughout the rest of the year. The issue is not the imports. And I would stress the issue is actually not the imports. The issue is illegally, unfairly traded imports."

But if you -- can you talk to us a little bit about how you can deploy that capital going forward in ways that we can be confident will grow the business? Do you -- in light of the fact that you've already done a lot of investments to grow organically, do you start to steer maybe toward other uses of cash going forward?"

And we would focus on areas that brought value-added, higher-value products. And our investments that we've made similar to what we did in Hertford County would be G3 and the normalizing line [ph], investments that we've made in SBQ, investments that we've made at Berkeley with the wide-light project, the investments that we've made with wider piling sections. In all of these cases, we're focusing on investments on higher-margin products that are also more import resistant. Although we're taking a lot and we feel good about the action that's being taken in Washington to fight off these illegally traded products, the focus that we have is to continue to work to better insulate Nucor from that flood of imports. And the way to do that is to focus on those value-added products. I think a great example that I can give you, Timna, is all the work that we're doing on our advanced high-strength steels are going to the automotive market. I've mentioned how we've grown in that over the last couple of years. There's a product, because of the quality requirements and because of the just-in-time delivery requirements, that's not easily imported. So that's an area of focus for us. I'd also like to speak a little bit more about the continued investment in lowering our total cost of production. You mentioned that I referenced that our DRI production, given the current environment, is not as attractive as we thought it might have been at one point. But I do want to point out that it's still attractive. If you take a look, the issue we're working our way through was a short-term issue where we have this iron ore that's higher priced. But if you took a look at the cost of our -- our conversion costs today and you apply the market price for iron units coming out of iron ore today, our all-in costs will be under what we would have to be paying for other forms of low-residual products, say, like pig iron and prime scrap. So it's inevitable that you will invest. Now the question is whether it's a good investment or whether it's a great investment. In today's pricing environment, it's a good investment. In a pricing environment of iron units where we were 1.5 years ago, it would be a great investment. And trust me, given the cyclical nature of our business, it will be a great investment again in the future. So I wanted to be clear about that so that should we move forward with investing further in some form of DRI or blast furnace project, everyone understands that we had a short-term issue. We're dealing with it. It will pass. Long term, we still believe very strongly in this strategy. At the end of the day, at the end of the day, we look at it this way. The amount of iron ore in the world is virtually unlimited. The amount of scrap in the world is much more limited. And it's -- we could generate more iron ore by reinvesting in extraction techniques. It's tough to generate more scrap. And we see that -- frankly, we see the amount of scrap being generated in the United States as declining."

And clearly, a lot of -- all of our products, including sheet, will go into nonresidential construction, and we'll see that picking up. But on the other hand, we also have a lot of products that goes into oil-related products such as OCTG, and that's obviously struggling right now. We don't see that changing for the rest of the year. So we see some of the markets that we sell into, our sheet products into, as continuing to get better, and we see others that will continue to struggle. But overall, as we look at the third and fourth quarter what we could put into them? Another 20% to 25%. Whether we'll be able to do that will be a function of what happens and how quickly it happens with trade cases or potential trade cases on hot-rolled and on cold-rolled products, how quickly that impacts the imports coming in. That, of course, will also help drive how quickly the warehouse inventories deplete. But at end of the day, I will say that I believe that we will be making more and more progress against imports. I feel really good about the recent legislation and the impact that it's going to have short term and long term in our business. And so as I look forward to the rest of the year, we do have -- as a company, we're heavily weighted on the hot hand [ph] side sometimes. That's a real advantage. Sometimes, it's not.

So it's not a case of whether or not there's going to be product substitution going on and where does it ends up going. They have learned the lesson of what's been going on, and they're reacting quicker. The law -- the recent legislation is going to give us not quite the same speed, but it is going to improve our ability to deal with that issue by dealing more quickly with each product as it comes up. And ultimately, there are mechanisms in the law. And if we find this to be a problem that spreads across all products in any one particular country or across looper [ph] countries, that we might be able to take the action. It's much better to pursue that type of action, but we've been successful with it in the past. I'm sure you're familiar with it. It's the -- frankly, it's the 201. And should a problem become so obvious that countries are employing the concept of product substitution or country substitution, we would have -- we would not hesitate to go down that path again in the future. Certainly, it's a challenging situation, the imports, and one that we recognize is probably the largest -- and it is, it's the largest challenge our industry faces.

With me for today's call are the other members of Nucor's senior management team: Chief Financial Officer, Jim Frias; and our other executive vice presidents, Jim Darsey, Ladd Hall, Ray Napolitan, Joe Stratman, Dave Sumoski and Chad Utermark. 
The entire executive management team would like to thank everyone on our Nucor Harris Steel, David J. Joseph, Duferdofin, Newbridge Steel Technologies and Skyline Steel teams for your excellent work taking care of our customers and implementing our company's strategy for long-term, profitable growth.

Third quarter 2015 earnings of $0.71 per diluted share exceeded our guidance range of $0.45 to $0.50 per diluted share. .Third quarter results included a LIFO credit that was approximately $0.11 per diluted share larger than anticipated in",744,"Thanks, John. Third quarter 2015 earnings of $0.71 per diluted share exceeded our guidance range of $0.45 to $0.50 per diluted share. .
Third quarter results included a LIFO credit that was approximately $0.11 per diluted share larger than anticipated in our guidance for the quarter and a $0.03 per diluted share noncash gain related to a correction of deferred tax balances. 
Excluding LIFO and the tax-related gain, the third quarter outperformance resulted from better-than-expected results for the month of September at our Steel Mills and downstream products segments. We are benefiting from the effective execution of Nucor's channel-to-market strategy and our ongoing investments to expand our offerings of value-added products. 
We are successfully expanding into these higher-margin offerings using more demanding and import-resistant applications while, at the same time, maintaining our position as the low cost producer across our product portfolio. 
The third quarter of 2015 performance of our raw materials segment included an operating loss at our new DRI facility in Louisiana of approximately $28 million, which included a $7.7 million net charge related to the write-off of the 2 remaining storage at the facility. That compared with the second quarter operating loss of about $20 million, which included the benefit of the vendor product warranty payment of approximately $10 million. 
As expected, Nucor Steel Louisiana has now consumed the remaining higher cost iron ore inventory acquired in 2014. In addition to continuing to produce DRI at world-class quality levels, our Louisiana team has realized significant improvements in yield, facility uptime and conversion costs. 
Nucor's DRI production capability in Louisiana and Trinidad puts our company in an unrivaled position of flexibility and optimizing our raw material costs through the cycle. 
A quick comment of our tax rate to adjust for the impact of profits from noncontrolling interests. Excluding profits belonging to our business partners and the $10.2 million noncash gain for correction of deferred tax balances, the effective tax rate was approximately 29% for the third quarter. 
Nucor continued to generate very robust operating cash flow in extremely challenging steel market conditions. With a highly variable and low-cost structure, we benefit from significant reductions in working capital during downturns. That was the case again in the first 9 months of 2015 with cash provided by operations of approximately $1.8 billion, a dramatic increase from the year-ago period's operating cash flow of $926 million. Nucor's financial position remains strong. Our gross debt-to-capital ratio was 36% at the close of the third quarter. Cash and short-term investments totaled approximately $2 billion, which compares with total debt outstanding of $4.4 billion. Our next significant debt maturity is not until December 2017. 
Nucor's strong liquidity position also includes our $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, which remains undrawn. The facility does not mature until August of 2018. 
Nucor's the only North American steel producer to hold an investment-grade credit rating. 
Capital expenditures totaled $269 million for the first 9 months of 2015. We estimate full year 2015 capital spending will be approximately $400 million. Most of our recent larger scale organic investments have been completed or are nearing completion. 
Depreciation and amortization for 2015 is expected to total about $700 million. 
In September, Nucor's Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $900 million of our company's common stock. This replaced a repurchase program that had been in place since 2007. The timing and amount of repurchases will depend on market conditions, share price, applicable legal requirements and other factors. The Nucor team places the highest priority on making sound capital allocation decisions that continue our long-term history of being effective stewards of our shareholders' investments. 
Earnings in the fourth quarter of 2015 are expected to decrease compared to the third quarter of 2015 due to continued deterioration in global steel markets. A slowing economy in China is causing further global overcapacity and resulting in significant levels of imports into the domestic market. The performance of our downstream product segment is expected to decrease due to typical fourth quarter seasonality. 
We expect slightly lower performance in the raw materials segment due to lower scrap and metallic commodity prices. 
We are encouraged by the ongoing gradual improvement in nonresidential construction markets and the strength in the automotive market. We are confident in Nucor's significant competitive advantages and highly adaptable business model will allow our team to continue to execute our proven strategies for delivering profitable, long-term growth. We do appreciate your interest in our company. John?"

However, those words, in no way, describe the attitude and outlook of the Nucor team. Even better, those words also do not describe the performance of any of my teammates in the third quarter's extremely challenging environment. 
At Nucor, we remain optimistic, determined and focused. Nucor's long-term success has always been driven by our team's unrelenting focus on a simple strategy. Nucor capitalizes on its unrivaled position of strength to gain profitable market share in our core businesses of steel and steel products. In short, we work on what's under our control. Anchoring this strategy and its execution is Nucor's business model. Its strength and adaptability is highlighted by a number of powerful building blocks. They include: our culture, our robust balance sheet and cash flow generation, our low and highly variable cost structure, our flexibility and reliable production capabilities, our product diversity and our leadership positions that we hold in many of the markets we serve. Put together, these competitive strengths provide Nucor with a powerful platform for delivering value to our customers. 
Challenging market conditions, as we face currently, on serve to increase the opportunities to add value and grow our long-term relationships with our customers. 
What we call Nucor's 5 drivers to profitable growth highlight where we are focusing our energies to build long-term earnings power and provide our shareholders with attractive returns on their valuable capital. They are: one, enhance our position as a low-cost producer: two, achieve a market leadership position in every product line in our portfolio; three, move up the value chain by expanding our capabilities to produce higher-quality, more import-resistant products; four, expand our downstream channels to market to increase our steel mills' base buying load, especially in weak markets; and five, achieve commercial excellence to complement our traditional operational strength. 
Our third quarter performance provides strong evidence that our strategy of investing through the downturn is already paying off. Rather than being stuck in a defensive mode fighting to survive, the Nucor team is on the offensive and growing stronger. The examples are numerous. Let me review a few of them for you. 
Through the first 9 months of 2015, our rebar and merchant bar mills delivered year-over-year earnings improvement despite the challenges of high imports and less-than-robust capacity utilization rates. The keys to their success are clear. They have built market leadership positions. Equally important, they have established strong channels to market through Nucor's downstream joists, decking, rebar fabrication, cold finish bar and fastener businesses by providing our steel mills the opportunity to earn a base level of volume, our downstream vertical integration into value-added steel products significantly enhances that through the cycle profitability and flexibility of Nucor's core steelmaking business. Additionally, the downstream businesses are attractive profit generators for Nucor as well. All 3 major fabricated construction products, joist and decking, fabricated rebar and metal buildings, achieved very strong profit growth year-over-year in the third quarter and the first 9 months of 2015. 
I'm pleased to report that our Vulcraft vertical joist and decking group that a single-month profitability record in September. More importantly, both our Vulcraft Verco group and our metal buildings group achieved record performance for the third quarter of 2015. The improved results of our fabricated construction products group is particularly impressive when you consider the state of the overall construction market. 
Forecasted U.S. nonresidential construction activity for 2015, as measured by square footage, represents only about 60% of  2007's peak activity level. So there's plenty of room for additional growth. 
I would like to congratulate and thank our teammates for their hard work reducing costs and providing world-class quality products and services to our customers. 
Our B mills also delivered attractive year-to-date earnings growth while placing high import levels and low-mill capacity utilization. Nucor's structural steel group's success is driven by a potent combination of its market leadership position; strong channels to market throughout our independent, wide-flange beam fabricated partners; our Skyline Steel piling distribution business; and new product introductions that continue to move us up the value chain. 
After completing last year's $115 million [ph] sheet piling product expansion project, our Nucor-Yamato will is now enjoying strong marketplace success with its new wider piling sections. These value-added products are lighter and stronger, covering more area at a lower installed cost. Our Nucor-Yamato team is aggressively going after this market, which currently is largely supplied by imports. 
Our goal over the next several years is to grow our wider piling section's annual volume to 100,000 tons, with these value-added tons generating above-average profitability. 
Last month, Nucor-Yamato announced another project to expand its value-added offerings. A $75 million quench and self-tempering process will be installed, with commissioning expected during the second half of 2016. This will give Nucor-Yamato the capability to produce A913 structural sections, with a high-strength, low-alloy great chemistry that provides excellent weldability while achieving good toughness even at low temperatures. Common applications include gravity columns for high-rise buildings, long-span trusses for stadiums and convention centers and for all projects where seismic design is a critical factor. These A913 beams allow the use of lighter footweights, which reduces the weight and cost for the builder. That makes steel even more competitive versus concrete and wood. 
The low-alloy great chemistry also enhances our position as a low-cost producer of beams. As the sole North American supplier of high-strength, low-alloy beams, Nucor Yamato will further enhance its market leadership position in wide-flange beams. 
Nucor's focus on our drivers to profitable growth and resulting strategic investments are paying big dividends in our other businesses. This is particularly evident in the markets that are under the greatest pressure from the flood of imports and other challenges. Our Berkeley County, South Carolina sheet mill achieved very solid third quarter and year-to-date profitability in what can only be described as horrific flat-rolled market conditions. The Berkeley team is capitalizing on its investments in degassing, combined with upgrades last year to its caster and hot mill. The mill's performance is being driven by its very diverse product mix, technical capabilities and commitment to commercial excellence. As we have discussed on previous calls, Berkeley now has the lightest hot-rolled gauge capability of any sheet mill in the southern U.S. market and with a finished steel capability of up to 74 inches. 
New products from the wide-light monetization are allowing us to gain new business in a range of end-use markets, including metal buildings, rail cars, oil heaters, automotive, heavy equipment and water transmission pipe. 
Despite severe pressure from imports and demand weakness in several key end-use markets, Nucor's engineered bar mills remain profitable. We are moving aggressively to utilize our recently expanded range of production and inspection capabilities to grow profitable market share in the SBQ and wire rod markets. 
Our Memphis mill was recently awarded Automotive Business that is a direct result of its quality inspection investments made since 2012. This week, Memphis announced another improvement, the very cost-effective acquisition of a continuous quench in Temple line, with a separate and kneeling furnace, capable of processing bar products from 2.5 inches to 11 inches in diameter. The addition of heat-treating capabilities will enable Memphis to grow in a number of markets, including energy, heavy equipment, service centers and automotive. 
The automotive market continues to be an attractive growth opportunity for Nucor. Nucor's shipping rate into the automotive market increased by 20% in 2015 versus 2014 to a 1.4 million ton per year rate. Particularly encouraging is the volume of business that Nucor is being awarded on future automotive platforms. The automotive companies are more and more appreciating the value of Nucor's reliability, sustainability and our financial strength. Our portfolio of light-weighting advanced, high-strength steels is also attracting a lot of interest. We remain optimistic about reaching our 2 million tons annual goal in the next few years. 
Finally, our Darlington, South Carolina facilities wire rod rolling mill continues to grow Nucor's market share in the wire rod market. Year-to-date, rod shipments through the first 9 months are up 11% compared to 2014. Darlington's wire rod growth is also allowing us to more efficiently utilize capacity at our other bar mills producing merchant bar and rebar products. 
Since I have mentioned several times the challenging market conditions faced by all of our businesses, I will share my thoughts on what is, by far, the biggest factor driving the weakness. 
Illegally traded imports continue to have a significant impact on the U.S. steel industry. The underlying issue is global steelmaking overcapacity resulting from the trade-distorting practices of some governments. Steel imports into the U.S. market remained at historically high levels. The import levels are depressing to capacity utilization rates of the U.S. steel producers and continue to account for 1/3 of the U.S. market. In the first 8 months of this year, China's global steel exports serves 27% to 72 million tons. They are on track to exceed 100 million tons, which is greater than the total U.S. steel production last year. 
Steel products from China are flooding into markets around the world, creating a domino effect as countries look for markets for their steel products. The massive increase in China's steel exports are provoking a wave of trade actions across the globe, including Europe, South Africa, Mexico and India, as steel producers fight against illegally subsidized steel imports being dumped into their markets. 
As these nations continue to successfully protect their markets from illegally traded and subsidized  Chinese steel products, more of those products are being dumped into our market. Recent decisions in several trade cases have been positive for the U.S. industry. The International Trade Commission has made preliminary determinations of injury in the cold-rolled, hot-rolled and corrosion-resistant sheet steel trade cases, allowing the investigation in all 3 cases to proceed. Nucor will continue to assess market conditions in other product areas and aggressively pursue cases when appropriate. 
Our fight against illegally traded steel imports is essential to meeting our responsibility to being effective steward of our shareholders' valuable capital. These are challenging times, but for a company such as Nucor, one that is in a unique position of strength, these are also times for opportunistic action. And that is exactly what I see throughout Nucor, the right people, focusing their unrivaled energy level and sense of urgency to achieving our goal of profitable growth. 
I have never been more confident that Nucor's best years are still ahead of us. 
Thank you for your interest in Nucor. We would now be happy to answer your questions."

So yes, that had some impact on our total output. The higher-quality products, although they are more profitable, do tend to run slower on our mills. So that has some impact upon the amount of tons that we ship. But you're spot on. We are looking hard at those products that we believe bring higher margins, higher profits to our company and also more import-resistant.

But we are hearing from them that because of the trade cases and, frankly, because of oil pricing has become much more competitive relative to imported pricing, that they have not placed the orders for imports to the same level that they have in the past. And as you know, when you're talking about import orders, there's about a 2 to 3 months, maybe 4 months sometimes, depending upon the product, delay or lag time between when the order was placed and when the product arrives. So many of our service center customers, in particular, are recognizing that the orders that they placed 2, 3, 4 months ago now do not nearly as attractive. And unfortunately, they're on the water, they're on the way and they can't be canceled. So we're going to see this issue of heavy inventories continue for a little bit of time.

And you've heard us to us today as in the past conference calls, numerous projects in which we are growing our company profitably through organic investments in our existing operations. Frankly, acquisitions is another way that we are deploying our cash to accomplish profitable growth.

That's really -- that is not what is driving it. The opportunity for opportunistic buys as we go forward, again, as this challenging time extends out, there might be opportunities, as we've done in the past, to pick up some very good assets at a very good price. One of our strategies has always been to grow our company during the downturns when assets are less expensive. So we think that that's currently happening as we go forward. We think this can be more assets available at the prices. And we want to make sure that we're prepared to capitalize on those opportunities. So we have that, and it's one of the reasons that we're making sure that we're preserving our cash. Now to your questions about dividends  and buyback programs, I'll make just a couple of comments. First of all, as you know, we paid a very healthy dividend today, and we've proven in the past that one-off profit levels as such, that we can pay out a supplemental dividend without adversely affecting our ability to aggressively grow and profitably grow our company. We'll do it. Right now, that's not the case. And in terms of the buyback, what we did was we rest our Board to authorize a buyback program. That was, frankly, in place, so really just refreshing a program that had already been authorized and been on the books for many years. We did that. We want to be prepared for a situation where it might be limited profitable growth opportunities that do not provide a return, a large enough return that would without ways that we're purchasing of our stock. In other words, when you take a look at the opportunities in front of us. We want to make sure that the return that we gain from those acquisitions, those investments surpass what we would gain for our shareholders by repurchasing the scraps, the stock. If that's not the case, we want to be ready. If that situation should come up suddenly, we want to be ready. One thing about this industry, Timna, as you know, it changes.

And that we recognize, we recognize that from the beginning that it's going to be pricing situations in raw materials in which the DRI investment is going to be a single and times when it's going to be a home run and times when it's going to be a grand slam. But the other point that I would make is that we always look at our investments for the long term. And when you look at the macro impact reasons for making the investments, the fact that manufacturing is leaving the country and with its prime scrap, when you look at long  term, we still believe that availability in the pricing for natural gas will be much more attractive than that for coking coal. When you look at the improvement in the efficiency of automotive blanking, which results in less prime scrap availability, even in periods when the automotive market is very strong, for all of these reasons, as we look long term, we believe that having the ability to produce a low-residual scrap substitute product for Nucor is going to be a very good investment. And if I may, Timna, I let you ask the second question maybe you could make me let me make a second statement about this response. And that's one thing that we -- I don't know that we emphasize enough when we talk about the DRI project and what it does for us. And that gives us -- it's that it gives us tremendous flexibility in our selection of the material used for our furnaces. And by using that flexibility, we're able to impact other scrap, well, other iron-muted products, and that's been very beneficial to us. I mean, you've seen the impact of that a couple of months ago when we saw such a tremendous drop in scrap. We'd also suggest to you that whenever we put in or take out 4 million tons of a scrap substitute product, it's going to have an impact on other iron-muted products. It's just going to have an impact. So it gives us tremendous flexibility and the ability to better utilize our scrap mix to enhance our low-cost position as the steel supplier."

Safety performance before the acquisition was outstanding. The commitment to working safe is phenomenal. And the way they won their safety programs is phenomenal. We've learned quite a bit from them. So despite the fact that Gallatin is operating today in an extremely tough market, the energy, which is a big product coming out of Gallatin, as you know, has been really, really challenged. But our teammates are doing what we always do on Nucor, and that is finding new ways, new products. One example would be that they are working hard to qualify for automotive products, and we expect them to be successful in that attempt. And all I can say is that it is, without a doubt, going much better than we anticipated. And one other comment your question about where are they getting their materials from, obviously, on the scrap side, there's a lot of synergies with our operations right up the road.

So we do see the rate of increase, the rate of growth slowing as the year has progressed. Now when I look at all business in particular, Nucor's business in our downstream businesses, which frankly go into the nonresidential construction, we're feeling pretty good about our backlogs. Our backlog today in all 3 of our downstream businesses, bull crap, Velcro, drilling systems and Harris, our backlogs are the largest they've been, strongest they have been in a 10-year period. And when you couple that with the profitability that we talked about earlier, we've had a very good quarter for our downstream businesses. Although we see the rate of improvement slowing, we still feel pretty good about our downstream businesses and their ability to compete in the construction markets."

I'm not going to say whether or not we would struggle with it until we have an opportunity to read and to study the entire document, which we have not had at this time. That said, I will say that we are extremely, extremely disappointed that it's not -- that currency manipulation is not all strongly baked into that agreement. At the end of the day, you can have all kinds of trade agreements. And if a country manipulates its currency, it's guaranteed to have an unfair trade advantage. And so we have -- what we are insisting upon with TPP is that it does as it's promising to do, and that is to provide a more level playing field on which we can compete. We, at Nucor, are absolutely convinced that if we were given a level playing field to compete upon, we would compete successfully against any company or any country in the world. So we're taking a hard look at TPP before we come out with a definitive statement, but you are absolutely correct in saying that currency manipulation, not being a part of that agreement, makes us who really struggle about the impact it will have on our company, the impact it will have on our industry, the impact it'll have on manufacturing in the United States and the impact, most importantly, that it will have upon middle-class Americans working hard to make a living and make a better for themselves and their family. So you got a little philosophical, so did I, okay? Now to infrastructure. Once again, I have to say that I'm disappointed in the administration. And frankly, Congress is not taking advantage of, what I consider, a great opportunity. Right now, steel costs are down, but a time to focus on rebuilding our infrastructure, okay? Energy, okay? How important is energy going forward in the manufacturing world for our country, frankly? What a great time to be able to rebuild our energy infrastructure, our power grids. And frankly, with the price of oil where it is today and the resulting price of gasoline at the bump. It seems to me like this will be a great time to be able to -- I know this is politically unpopular, but I'm not running for office so I can say it, okay? This would be a great time to just put a little bump on to the tax of the tax rate on gasoline and use that money to rebuild the crumbling infrastructure of this country. What an embarrassment. 30, 40, 50 years ago, we were -- our country was known for its infrastructure. The people came here to study how we built bridges. And today, you look at it, overwhelms our bridges, our infrastructure as a whole. Just recently, we received a D+, and they were begging of the fact that it wasn't merely the D+, okay? We don't need infrastructure. With another manufacturing powerhouse in the 21st century, we need infrastructure that gives an A+, not a D+. This is a great opportunity to rebuild our infrastructure. I'm extremely disappointed that we continue to kick the can down the road on funding with 3-month extension after extension after extension. I believe that there's something like 33 or 34, 3-month extensions since 2008. That's an embarrassment. And I really hope that our leaders step up to the plate and do not miss this great opportunity to rebuild the infrastructure in this country."

Third quarter of 2015 earnings of $0.71 per diluted share exceeded our guidance range of $0.45 to $0.50 per diluted share. Third quarter results included a LIFO credit that was approximately $0.11 per diluted share larger than anticipated",743,"Thanks, John. Third quarter of 2015 earnings of $0.71 per diluted share exceeded our guidance range of $0.45 to $0.50 per diluted share. 
Third quarter results included a LIFO credit that was approximately $0.11 per diluted share larger than anticipated in our guidance for the quarter and a $0.03 per diluted share noncash gain related to a correction of deferred tax balances. 
Excluding LIFO and the tax-related gain, the third quarter outperformance resulted from better-than-expected results for the month of September at our steel mills and downstream products segments. We are benefiting from the effective execution of Nucor's channel-to-market strategy and our ongoing investments to expand our offerings of value-added products. We are successfully expanding into these higher-margin offerings using more demanding and import-resistant applications while, at the same time, maintaining our position as the low-cost producer across our product portfolio. 
The third quarter of 2015 performance of our raw materials segment included an operating loss at our new DRI facility in Louisiana of approximately $28 million, which included a $7.7 million net charge related to the write-off of the 2 remaining storage domes at the facility. That compared with the second quarter operating loss of about $20 million, which included the benefit of the vendor product warranty payment of approximately $10 million. 
As expected, Nucor Steel Louisiana has now consumed the remaining higher-cost iron ore inventory acquired in 2014. In addition to continuing to produce DRI at world-class quality levels, our Louisiana team has realized significant improvements in yield, facility uptime and conversion costs. Nucor's DRI production capability in Louisiana and Trinidad puts our company in an unrivaled position of flexibility and optimizing our raw material costs through the cycle. 
A quick comment of our tax rate to adjust for the impact of profits from noncontrolling interests. Excluding profits belonging to our business partners and the $10.2 million noncash gain for correction of deferred tax balances, the effective tax rate was approximately 29% for the third quarter. 
Nucor continued to generate very robust operating cash flow in extremely challenging steel market conditions. With a highly variable and low-cost structure, we benefit from significant reductions in working capital during downturns. That was the case again in the first 9 months of 2015 with cash provided by operations of approximately $1.8 billion, a dramatic increase from the year-ago period's operating cash flow of $926 million. Nucor's financial position remained strong. 
Our gross debt-to-capital ratio was 36% at the close of the third quarter. Cash and short-term investments totaled approximately $2 billion, which compares with total debt outstanding of $4.4 billion. Our next significant debt maturity is not until December 2017. Nucor's strong liquidity position also includes our $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, which remains undrawn. The facility does not mature until August of 2018.   
Nucor is the only North American steel producer to hold an investment-grade credit rating. 
Capital expenditures totaled $269 million for the first 9 months of 2015. We estimate full year 2015 capital spending will be approximately $400 million. Most of our recent larger-scale organic investments have been completed or are nearing completion. 
Depreciation and amortization for 2015 is expected to total about $700 million. 
In September, Nucor's Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $900 million of our company's common stock. This replaced a repurchase program that had been in place since 2007. The timing and amount of repurchases will depend on market conditions, share price, applicable legal requirements and other factors. The Nucor team places the highest priority on making sound capital allocation decisions that continue our long-term history of being effective stewards of our shareholders' investment. 
Earnings in the fourth quarter of 2015 are expected to decrease compared to the third quarter of 2015 due to continued deterioration in global steel markets. A slowing economy in China is causing further global overcapacity and resulting in significant levels of imports into the domestic market. The performance of our downstream products segment is expected to decrease due to typical fourth quarter seasonality. We expect slightly lower performance in the raw materials segment due to lower scrap and metallic commodity prices. 
We are encouraged by the ongoing gradual improvement in nonresidential construction markets and the strength in the automotive market. We are confident in Nucor's significant competitive advantages and highly adaptable business model will allow our team to continue to execute our proven strategies for delivering profitable, long-term growth. 
We do appreciate your interest in our company. John?"

However, those words in no way describe the attitude and outlook of the Nucor team. Even better, those words also do not describe the performance of any of my teammates in the third quarter's extremely challenging environment. At Nucor, we remain optimistic, determined and focused. 
Nucor's long-term success has always been driven by our team's unrelenting focus on a simple strategy: Nucor capitalizes on its unrivaled position of strength to gain profitable market share in our core businesses of steel and steel products. In short, we work on what's under our control. Anchoring this strategy and its execution is Nucor's business model. Its strength and adaptability is highlighted by a number of powerful building blocks. They include: our culture, our robust balance sheet and cash flow generation, our low and highly variable cost structure, our flexibility and reliable production capabilities, our product diversity and our leadership positions that we hold in many of the markets we serve. Put together, these competitive strengths provide Nucor with a powerful platform for delivering value to our customers.  Challenging market conditions, as we face currently, only serve to increase the opportunities to add value and grow our long-term relationships with our customers. 
What we call Nucor's 5 drivers to profitable growth highlight where we are focusing our energies to build long-term earnings power and provide our shareholders with attractive returns on their valuable capital. They are: one, enhance our position as a low-cost producer: two, achieve the market leadership position in every product line in our portfolio; three, move up the value chain by expanding our capabilities to produce higher-quality, more import-resistant products; four, expand our downstream channels to market to increase our steel mills' base volume load, especially in weak markets; and five, achieve commercial excellence to complement our traditional operational strength. 
Our third quarter performance provides strong evidence that our strategy of investing through the downturn is already paying off. Rather than being stuck in a defensive mode fighting to survive, the Nucor team is on the offensive and growing stronger. The examples are numerous. Let me review a few of them for you. 
Through the first 9 months of 2015, our rebar and merchant bar mills delivered year-over-year earnings improvement despite the challenges of high imports and less-than-robust capacity utilization rates. The keys to their success are clear. They have built market leadership positions. Equally important, they have established strong channels to market through Nucor's downstream joist, decking, rebar fabrication, cold finished bar and fastener businesses by providing our steel mills the opportunity to earn a base level of volume. Our downstream vertical integration into value-added steel products significantly enhances that through this cycle profitability and flexibility of Nucor's core steelmaking business. Additionally, the downstream businesses are attractive profit generators for Nucor as well. All 3 major fabricated construction products: joist and decking, fabricated rebar and metal buildings, achieved very strong profit growth year-over-year in the third quarter and the first 9 months of 2015. 
I'm pleased to report that our Vulcraft/Verco joist and decking group had a single-month profitability record in September. More importantly, both our Vulcraft/Verco Group and our metal buildings group achieved record performance for the third quarter of 2015. The improved results of our fabricated construction products group is particularly impressive when you consider the state of the overall construction market. Forecasted U.S. nonresidential construction activity for 2015, as measured by square footage, represents only about 60% of  2007's peak activity level. So there's plenty of room for additional growth -- 
I would like to congratulate and thank our teammates for their hard work, reducing costs and providing world-class quality products and services to our customers. 
Our beam mills also delivered attractive year-to-date earnings growth while facing high-import levels and low-mill capacity utilization. 
Nucor's structural steel group's success is driven by a potent combination of its market leadership position; strong channels to market throughout our independent, wide-flange beam fabricated partners; our Skyline Steel piling distribution business; and new product introductions that continued to move us up the value chain. 
After completing last year's $115 million sheet piling product expansion project, our Nucor-Yamato mill is now enjoying strong marketplace success with its new, wider piling sections. These value-added products are lighter and stronger, covering more area at a lower-installed cost. Our Nucor-Yamato team is aggressively going after this market, which currently is largely supplied by imports. Our goal over the next several years is to grow our wider piling sections' annual volume to 100,000 tons, with these value-added tons generating above-average profitability. 
Last month, Nucor-Yamato announced another project to expand its value-added offerings. A $75 million Quench and Self-Tempering process will be installed, with commissioning expected during the second half of 2016. This will give Nucor-Yamato the capability to produce A913 structural sections with a high-strength, low-alloy grade chemistry that provides excellent weldability while achieving good toughness even at low temperatures. 
Common applications include gravity columns for high-rise buildings, long-span trusses for stadiums and convention centers and for all projects where seismic design is a critical factor. These A913 beams allow the use of lighter foot weights, which reduces the weight and cost for the builder. That makes steel even more competitive versus concrete and wood. The low-alloy grade chemistry also enhances our position as a low-cost producer of beams. As the sole North American supplier of high-strength, low-alloy beams, Nucor Yamato will further enhance its market leadership position in wide-flange beams. 
Nucor's focus on our drivers to profitable growth and resulting strategic investments are paying big dividends in our other businesses. This is particularly evident in the markets that are under the greatest pressure from the flood of imports and other challenges. Our Berkeley County, South Carolina sheet mill achieved very solid third quarter and year-to-date profitability in what can only be described as horrific, flat-rolled market conditions. The Berkeley team is capitalizing on its investments in vacuum degassing, combined with upgrades last year to its caster and hot mill. The mill's performance is being driven by its very diverse product mix, technical capabilities and commitment to commercial excellence. As we have discussed on previous calls, Berkeley now has the lightest hot-rolled gauge capability of any sheet mill in the Southern U.S. market and with a finished steel capability of up to 74 inches. 
New products from the wide-light modernization are allowing us to gain new business in a range of end-use markets, including metal buildings, railcars, oil [ph] heaters, automotive, heavy equipment and water transmission pipe. 
Despite severe pressure from imports and demand weakness in several key end-use markets, Nucor's engineered bar mills remained profitable. We are moving aggressively to utilize our recently expanded range of production and inspection capabilities to grow profitable market share in the SBQ and wire rod markets. 
Our Memphis mill was recently awarded automotive crankshaft business that is a direct result of its quality inspection investments made since 2012. This week, Memphis announced another improvement, the very cost-effective acquisition of a continuous quench and temper line with a separate unyielding [ph] furnace, capable of processing bar products from 2.5 inches to 11 inches in diameter. The addition of heat-treating capabilities will enable Memphis to grow in a number of markets, including energy, heavy equipment, service centers and automotive. 
The automotive market continues to be an attractive growth opportunity for Nucor. Nucor's shipping rate into the automotive market increased by 20% in 2015 versus 2014 to a 1.4 million tons per year rate. Particularly encouraging is the volume of business that Nucor is being awarded on future automotive platforms. The automotive companies are more and more appreciating the value of Nucor's reliability, sustainability and our financial strength. Our portfolio of lightweighting, advanced, high-strength steels is also attracting a lot of interest. We remain optimistic about reaching our 2 million tons annual goal in the next few years. 
Finally, our Darlington, South Carolina facility's wire rod rolling mill continues to grow Nucor's market share in the wire rod market. Year-to-date, rod shipments through the first 9 months are up 11% compared to 2014. Darlington's wire rod growth is also allowing us to more efficiently utilize capacity at our other bar mills producing merchant bar and rebar products. 
Since I have mentioned several times the challenging market conditions faced by all of our businesses, I will share my thoughts on what is, by far, the biggest factor driving the weakness. Illegally traded imports continue to have a significant impact on the U.S. steel industry. The underlying issue is global steelmaking overcapacity resulting from the trade-distorting practices of some governments. Steel imports into the U.S. market remain at historically high levels. The import levels are depressing, the capacity utilization rates of the U.S. steel producers and continue to account for 1/3 of the U.S. market. 
In the first 8 months of this year, China's global steel exports surged 27% to 72 million tons. They are on track to exceed 100 million tons, which is greater than the total U.S. steel production last year. Steel products from China are flooding into markets around the world, creating a domino effect as countries look for markets for their steel products. The massive increase in China's steel exports are provoking a wave of trade actions across the globe, including Europe, South Africa, Mexico and India as steel producers fight against illegally subsidized steel imports being dumped into their markets. 
As these nations continue to successfully protect their markets from illegally traded and subsidized Chinese steel products, more of those products are being dumped into our market. 
Recent decisions in several trade cases have been positive for the U.S. industry. The International Trade Commission has made preliminary determinations of injury in the cold-rolled, hot-rolled and corrosion-resistant sheet steel trade cases, allowing the investigation in all 3 cases to proceed. Nucor will continue to assess market conditions in other product areas and aggressively pursue cases when appropriate. 
Our fight against illegally traded steel imports is essential to meeting our responsibility to be an effective steward of our shareholders' valuable capital. These are challenging times, but for a company such as Nucor, one that is in a unique position of strength, these are also times for opportunistic action. And that is exactly what I see throughout Nucor, the right people focusing their unrivaled energy level and sense of urgency to achieving our goal of profitable growth. I have never been more confident that Nucor's best years are still ahead of us. 
Thank you for your interest in Nucor. We would now be happy to answer your questions."

So yes, that had some impact on our total output. Now the higher-quality products, although they are more profitable, do tend to run slower on our mills. So that has some impact upon the amount of tons that we ship, but you're spot on. We're looking hard at those products that we believe bring higher margins, higher profits to our company and are also more import-resistant.

We are seeing customers coming back to us who recognizing that right now their inventories are a little bit bloated. So we don't see them pouring in right now with new orders, but we are hearing from them that because of the trade cases and, frankly, because oil pricing has become much more competitive relative to imported pricing that they have not placed the orders for imports to the same level that they have in the past. And as you know, when you're talking about import orders, there's about a 2- to 3-month, maybe 4 months sometimes, depending upon the product, delay or lag time between when the order was placed and when the product arrives. So many of our service center customers, in particular, are recognizing that the orders that they placed 2 or 3 or 4 months ago now do not look nearly as attractive. And unfortunately, they're on the water. They're on the way, and they can't be canceled. So we're going to see this issue of heavy inventories continue for a little bit of time. But ultimately, we do believe that because we're more competitive today and because they are seeing some other issues with lead times from the imported products, we'll be able to regain that business. We see our customers coming back to us from the imports. The other comment that I'll make, just in general, you asked about other customers coming back to us. We'll also see many new customers approaching us because they see Nucor as a company with a very strong financial position and sustainable.

Organic growth has been, for us, one of the ways that we get the lodges returned with the investments that we've made. And you've heard us list today and in the past conference calls numerous projects in which we are growing our company profitably through organic investments in our existing operations. Frankly, acquisitions is another way that we are deploying our cash to accomplish profitable growth. Skyline would be an example of that, fairly recent. More recent than that would be our Gallatin acquisition. So yes, we're looking at that. It's a way to not only grow our volumes, but to grow our customer base and grow the breadth of our products.

The opportunity for opportunistic buys as we go forward, again, as this challenging time extends out, there might be opportunities as we've done in the past to pick up some very good assets at a very good price.

So we have that, and it's one of the reasons that we're making sure that we preserve our cash. Now to your questions about dividends and buyback programs, I'll make just a couple of comments. First of all, as you know, we pay a very healthy dividend today. And we've proven in the past that one-off profit level as such, that we could pay out a supplemental dividend without adversely affecting our ability to aggressively grow and profitably grow our company, we'll do it. Right now, that's not the case. And in terms of the buyback, what we did was we rest [ph] our board to authorize a buyback program. That was, frankly, in place, so really just refreshing a program that had already been authorized and had been on the books for many years. We did that. We want to be prepared for a situation where that might be limited profitable growth opportunities that do not provide a return -- a large-enough return that would outweigh the repurchasing of our stock. In other words, when we take a look at the opportunities in front of us, we want to make sure that the return that we gain from those acquisitions, those investments surpass what we would gain for our shareholders by repurchasing the scraps -- the stock. If that's not the case, we want to be ready. If that situation should come up suddenly, we want to be ready. One thing about this industry, Timna, as you know, it changes.

And when you look at the macro impact reasons for making the investment, the fact that manufacturing is leaving the country, and with it prime scrap, when you look at long  term, we still believe that the availability and the pricing for natural gas will be much more attractive than that for coking coal. When you look at the improvement in the efficiency of automotive blanking, which results in less prime scrap availability even in periods where the automotive market is very strong, for all of these reasons, as we look long term, we believe that having the ability to produce a low-residual scrap substitute product for Nucor is going to be a very good investment. And if I may, Timna, what [indiscernible] as I let you ask the second question, maybe you can make me -- let me make a second statement about this response. And that's one thing that we -- I don't know that we emphasize enough when we talk about the DRI project and what it does for us, and that gives us -- is that it gives us tremendous flexibility in our selection of raw material used for our furnaces. And by using that flexibility, we're able to impact other scrap, well, other iron unit products, and that's been very beneficial to us. I mean, you've seen the impact of that a couple of months ago when we saw such a tremendous drop in scrap. We'd also suggest to you that whenever we put in or take out 4 million tons of a scrap substitute product, it's going to have an impact on other iron unit products. It's just going to have an impact. So it gives us tremendous flexibility and the ability to better utilize our scrap mix to enhance our low-cost position as a steel supplier."

And in one area, frankly, and I want to thank them for this, in one area, they helped us get a whole lot better. And that was in the area of safety. Their safety performance before the acquisition was outstanding. Their commitment to safe -- working safe is phenomenal, and the way they won their safety programs is phenomenal. And we've learned quite a bit from them. So despite the fact that Gallatin is operating today in an extremely tough market, the energy, which is a big product coming out of Gallatin, as you know, has been really, really challenged. But our teammates are doing what we always do at Nucor, and that is finding new ways, new products. One example would be that they are working hard to qualify for automotive products, and we expect them to be successful in that attempt. And all I can say is it's -- it is, without a doubt, going much better than we anticipated. And one other comment to your question about the -- where are they getting their raw materials from, obviously, on the scrap side, there's a lot of synergies with our BJJ [ph] operations right up the road. It's -- we have the metals and scrap substitutes today. They are taking scrap substitutes in.

At the beginning of the year, we were anticipating somewhere about an 8% or 9% growth over the cost of the year. Today, we would say that, that number is probably closer to 5% or 6% today. So we do see the rate of increase, the rate of growth slowing as the year has progressed. Now when I look at all business, in particular, Nucor's business in our downstream businesses, which frankly go into the nonresidential construction, we're feeling pretty good about our backlogs. Our backlog today in all 3 of our downstream businesses, Vulcraft, Verco, building systems at Harris, our backlogs are the largest they have been, the strongest they have been in a 10-year period. And when you couple that with the profitability that we've talked about earlier, we've had a very good quarter for our downstream businesses. Although we see the rate of improvement slowing, we still feel pretty good about our downstream businesses and their ability to compete in the construction markets."

That said, I will say that we are extremely, extremely disappointed that it's not -- that currency manipulation is not more strongly baked into that agreement. At the end of the day, you can have all kinds of trade agreements. And if a country manipulates its currency, it's guaranteed to have an unfair trade advantage. And so we have -- what we are insisting upon with TPP is that it does as it's promising to do, and that is to provide a more level playing field on which we can compete. We, at Nucor, are absolutely convinced that if we were given a level playing field to compete upon, we would compete successfully against any company or any country in the world. So we're taking a hard look at TPP before we come out with a definitive statement, but you are absolutely correct in saying that currency manipulation not being a part of that agreement makes us really struggle about the impact it will have on our company, the impact it will have on our industry, the impact it'll have on manufacturing in the United States and the impact, most importantly, that it will have upon middle-class Americans working hard to make a living and make a better life for themselves and their family. So you got a little philosophical, so did I. Okay? Now to infrastructure. Once again, I have to say that I'm disappointed in the administration. And frankly, Congress is not taking advantage what I -- of what I consider a great opportunity. Right now, steel costs are down but a time to focus on rebuilding our infrastructure. Okay? Energy, okay? How important is energy going forward in the manufacturing world and for our country, frankly? What a great time to be able to rebuild our energy infrastructure, our power grids. And frankly, with the price of oil where it is today and the resulting price of gasoline at the pump, it seems to me like this would be a great time to be able to -- and I know this is politically unpopular, but I'm not running for office so I can say it, okay? This would be a great time to just put a little bump on to the tax of -- to tax rate on gasoline and use that money to rebuild the crumbling infrastructure of this country. What an embarrassment? 30, 40, 50 years ago, we were -- our country was known for its infrastructure. People came here to study how we build bridges. And today, you look at it, and overall our bridges, our infrastructure as a whole just recently received a D+. And they were bragging on the fact that it wasn't really D. It was D+. Okay? We don't need infrastructure. If we're going to have a manufacturing powerhouse to the 21st century, we need infrastructure that gives an A+, not a D+. This is a great opportunity to rebuild our infrastructure. I'm extremely disappointed that we continue to kick the can down the road on funding, with 3-month extensions after extension after extension. I believe that there's something like 30 -- 33 or 34 3-month extensions since 2008. That's an embarrassment, and I really hope that our leaders step up to the play and do not miss this great opportunity to rebuild the infrastructure in this country."

Third quarter of 2015 earnings of $0.71 per diluted share exceeded our guidance range of $0.45 to $0.50 per diluted share. Third quarter results included a LIFO credit that was approximately $0.11 per diluted share larger than anticipated",743,"Thanks, John. Third quarter of 2015 earnings of $0.71 per diluted share exceeded our guidance range of $0.45 to $0.50 per diluted share. 
Third quarter results included a LIFO credit that was approximately $0.11 per diluted share larger than anticipated in our guidance for the quarter and a $0.03 per diluted share noncash gain related to a correction of deferred tax balances. 
Excluding LIFO and the tax-related gain, the third quarter outperformance resulted from better-than-expected results for the month of September at our steel mills and downstream products segments. We are benefiting from the effective execution of Nucor's channel-to-market strategy and our ongoing investments to expand our offerings of value-added products. We are successfully expanding into these higher-margin offerings using more demanding and import-resistant applications while, at the same time, maintaining our position as the low-cost producer across our product portfolio. 
The third quarter of 2015 performance of our raw materials segment included an operating loss at our new DRI facility in Louisiana of approximately $28 million, which included a $7.7 million net charge related to the write-off of the 2 remaining storage domes at the facility. That compared with the second quarter operating loss of about $20 million, which included the benefit of the vendor product warranty payment of approximately $10 million. 
As expected, Nucor Steel Louisiana has now consumed the remaining higher-cost iron ore inventory acquired in 2014. In addition to continuing to produce DRI at world-class quality levels, our Louisiana team has realized significant improvements in yield, facility uptime and conversion costs. Nucor's DRI production capability in Louisiana and Trinidad puts our company in an unrivaled position of flexibility and optimizing our raw material costs through the cycle. 
A quick comment of our tax rate to adjust for the impact of profits from noncontrolling interests. Excluding profits belonging to our business partners and the $10.2 million noncash gain for correction of deferred tax balances, the effective tax rate was approximately 29% for the third quarter. 
Nucor continued to generate very robust operating cash flow in extremely challenging steel market conditions. With a highly variable and low-cost structure, we benefit from significant reductions in working capital during downturns. That was the case again in the first 9 months of 2015 with cash provided by operations of approximately $1.8 billion, a dramatic increase from the year-ago period's operating cash flow of $926 million. Nucor's financial position remained strong. 
Our gross debt-to-capital ratio was 36% at the close of the third quarter. Cash and short-term investments totaled approximately $2 billion, which compares with total debt outstanding of $4.4 billion. Our next significant debt maturity is not until December 2017. Nucor's strong liquidity position also includes our $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, which remains undrawn. The facility does not mature until August of 2018.   
Nucor is the only North American steel producer to hold an investment-grade credit rating. 
Capital expenditures totaled $269 million for the first 9 months of 2015. We estimate full year 2015 capital spending will be approximately $400 million. Most of our recent larger-scale organic investments have been completed or are nearing completion. 
Depreciation and amortization for 2015 is expected to total about $700 million. 
In September, Nucor's Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $900 million of our company's common stock. This replaced a repurchase program that had been in place since 2007. The timing and amount of repurchases will depend on market conditions, share price, applicable legal requirements and other factors. The Nucor team places the highest priority on making sound capital allocation decisions that continue our long-term history of being effective stewards of our shareholders' investment. 
Earnings in the fourth quarter of 2015 are expected to decrease compared to the third quarter of 2015 due to continued deterioration in global steel markets. A slowing economy in China is causing further global overcapacity and resulting in significant levels of imports into the domestic market. The performance of our downstream products segment is expected to decrease due to typical fourth quarter seasonality. We expect slightly lower performance in the raw materials segment due to lower scrap and metallic commodity prices. 
We are encouraged by the ongoing gradual improvement in nonresidential construction markets and the strength in the automotive market. We are confident that Nucor's significant competitive advantages and highly adaptable business model will allow our team to continue to execute our proven strategies for delivering profitable, long-term growth. 
We do appreciate your interest in our company. John?"

However, those words in no way describe the attitude and outlook of the Nucor team. Even better, those words also do not describe the performance of any of my teammates in the third quarter's extremely challenging environment. At Nucor, we remain optimistic, determined and focused. 
Nucor's long-term success has always been driven by our team's unrelenting focus on a simple strategy: Nucor capitalizes on its unrivaled position of strength to gain profitable market share in our core businesses of steel and steel products. In short, we work on what's under our control. Anchoring this strategy and its execution is Nucor's business model. Its strength and adaptability is highlighted by a number of powerful building blocks. They include: our culture, our robust balance sheet and cash flow generation, our low and highly variable cost structure, our flexibility and reliable production capabilities, our product diversity and our leadership positions that we hold in many of the markets we serve. Put together, these competitive strengths provide Nucor with a powerful platform for delivering value to our customers.  Challenging market conditions, as we face currently, only serve to increase the opportunities to add value and grow our long-term relationships with our customers. 
What we call Nucor's 5 drivers to profitable growth highlight where we are focusing our energies to build long-term earnings power and provide our shareholders with attractive returns on their valuable capital. They are: one, enhance our position as a low-cost producer: two, achieve the market leadership position in every product line in our portfolio; three, move up the value chain by expanding our capabilities to produce higher-quality, more import-resistant products; four, expand our downstream channels to market to increase our steel mills' base volume load, especially in weak markets; and five, achieve commercial excellence to complement our traditional operational strength. 
Our third quarter performance provides strong evidence that our strategy of investing through the downturn is already paying off. Rather than being stuck in a defensive mode fighting to survive, the Nucor team is on the offensive and growing stronger. The examples are numerous. Let me review a few of them for you. 
Through the first 9 months of 2015, our rebar and merchant bar mills delivered year-over-year earnings improvement despite the challenges of high imports and less-than-robust capacity utilization rates. The keys to their success are clear. They have built market leadership positions. Equally important, they have established strong channels to market through Nucor's downstream joist, decking, rebar fabrication, cold finished bar and fastener businesses by providing our steel mills the opportunity to earn a base level of volume. Our downstream vertical integration into value-added steel products significantly enhances that through this cycle profitability and flexibility of Nucor's core steelmaking business. Additionally, the downstream businesses are attractive profit generators for Nucor as well. All 3 major fabricated construction products: joist and decking, fabricated rebar and metal buildings, achieved very strong profit growth year-over-year in the third quarter and the first 9 months of 2015. 
I'm pleased to report that our Vulcraft/Verco joist and decking group had a single-month profitability record in September. More importantly, both our Vulcraft/Verco Group and our metal buildings group achieved record performance for the third quarter of 2015. The improved results of our fabricated construction products group is particularly impressive when you consider the state of the overall construction market. Forecasted U.S. nonresidential construction activity for 2015, as measured by square footage, represents only about 60% of 2007's peak activity level. So there's plenty of room for additional growth.
I would like to congratulate and thank our teammates for their hard work, reducing costs and providing world-class quality products and services to our customers. 
Our beam mills also delivered attractive year-to-date earnings growth while facing high-import levels and low-mill capacity utilization. 
Nucor's structural steel group's success is driven by a potent combination of its market leadership position; strong channels to market throughout our independent, wide-flange beam fabricated partners; our Skyline Steel piling distribution business; and new product introductions that continued to move us up the value chain. 
After completing last year's $115 million sheet piling product expansion project, our Nucor-Yamato mill is now enjoying strong marketplace success with its new, wider piling sections. These value-added products are lighter and stronger, covering more area at a lower-installed cost. Our Nucor-Yamato team is aggressively going after this market, which currently is largely supplied by imports. Our goal over the next several years is to grow our wider piling sections' annual volume to 100,000 tons, with these value-added tons generating above-average profitability. 
Last month, Nucor-Yamato announced another project to expand its value-added offerings. A $75 million Quench and Self-Tempering process will be installed, with commissioning expected during the second half of 2016. This will give Nucor-Yamato the capability to produce A913 structural sections with a high-strength, low-alloy grade chemistry that provides excellent weldability while achieving good toughness even at low temperatures. 
Common applications include gravity columns for high-rise buildings, long-span trusses for stadiums and convention centers and for all projects where seismic design is a critical factor. These A913 beams allow the use of lighter foot weights, which reduces the weight and cost for the builder. That makes steel even more competitive versus concrete and wood. The low-alloy grade chemistry also enhances our position as a low-cost producer of beams. As the sole North American supplier of high-strength, low-alloy beams, Nucor Yamato will further enhance its market leadership position in wide-flange beams. 
Nucor's focus on our drivers to profitable growth and resulting strategic investments are paying big dividends in our other businesses. This is particularly evident in the markets that are under the greatest pressure from the flood of imports and other challenges. Our Berkeley County, South Carolina sheet mill achieved very solid third quarter and year-to-date profitability in what can only be described as horrific, flat-rolled market conditions. The Berkeley team is capitalizing on its investments in vacuum degassing, combined with upgrades last year to its caster and hot mill. The mill's performance is being driven by its very diverse product mix, technical capabilities and commitment to commercial excellence. As we have discussed on previous calls, Berkeley now has the lightest hot-rolled gauge capability of any sheet mill in the Southern U.S. market and with a finished steel capability of up to 74 inches. 
New products from the wide-light modernization are allowing us to gain new business in a range of end-use markets, including metal buildings, railcars, oil [ph] heaters, automotive, heavy equipment and water transmission pipe. 
Despite severe pressure from imports and demand weakness in several key end-use markets, Nucor's engineered bar mills remained profitable. We are moving aggressively to utilize our recently expanded range of production and inspection capabilities to grow profitable market share in the SBQ and wire rod markets. 
Our Memphis mill was recently awarded automotive crankshaft business that is a direct result of its quality inspection investments made since 2012. This week, Memphis announced another improvement, the very cost-effective acquisition of a continuous quench and temper line with a separate unyielding [ph] furnace, capable of processing bar products from 2.5 inches to 11 inches in diameter. The addition of heat-treating capabilities will enable Memphis to grow in a number of markets, including energy, heavy equipment, service centers and automotive. 
The automotive market continues to be an attractive growth opportunity for Nucor. Nucor's shipping rate into the automotive market increased by 20% in 2015 versus 2014 to a 1.4 million tons per year rate. Particularly encouraging is the volume of business that Nucor is being awarded on future automotive platforms. The automotive companies are more and more appreciating the value of Nucor's reliability, sustainability and our financial strength. Our portfolio of lightweighting, advanced, high-strength steels is also attracting a lot of interest. We remain optimistic about reaching our 2 million tons annual goal in the next few years. 
Finally, our Darlington, South Carolina facility's wire rod rolling mill continues to grow Nucor's market share in the wire rod market. Year-to-date, rod shipments through the first 9 months are up 11% compared to 2014. Darlington's wire rod growth is also allowing us to more efficiently utilize capacity at our other bar mills producing merchant bar and rebar products. 
Since I have mentioned several times the challenging market conditions faced by all of our businesses, I will share my thoughts on what is, by far, the biggest factor driving the weakness. Illegally traded imports continue to have a significant impact on the U.S. steel industry. The underlying issue is global steelmaking overcapacity resulting from the trade-distorting practices of some governments. Steel imports into the U.S. market remain at historically high levels. The import levels are depressing the capacity utilization rates of the U.S. steel producers and continue to account for 1/3 of the U.S. market. 
In the first 8 months of this year, China's global steel exports surged 27% to 72 million tons. They are on track to exceed 100 million tons, which is greater than the total U.S. steel production last year. Steel products from China are flooding into markets around the world, creating a domino effect as countries look for markets for their steel products. The massive increase in China's steel exports are provoking a wave of trade actions across the globe, including Europe, South Africa, Mexico and India as steel producers fight against illegally subsidized steel imports being dumped into their markets. 
As these nations continue to successfully protect their markets from illegally traded and subsidized Chinese steel products, more of those products are being dumped into our market. 
Recent decisions in several trade cases have been positive for the U.S. industry. The International Trade Commission has made preliminary determinations of injury in the cold-rolled, hot-rolled and corrosion-resistant sheet steel trade cases, allowing the investigation in all 3 cases to proceed. Nucor will continue to assess market conditions in other product areas and aggressively pursue cases when appropriate. 
Our fight against illegally traded steel imports is essential to meeting our responsibility to be an effective steward of our shareholders' valuable capital. These are challenging times, but for a company such as Nucor, one that is in a unique position of strength, these are also times for opportunistic action. And that is exactly what I see throughout Nucor, the right people focusing their unrivaled energy level and sense of urgency to achieving our goal of profitable growth. I have never been more confident that Nucor's best years are still ahead of us. 
Thank you for your interest in Nucor. We would now be happy to answer your questions."

So yes, that had some impact on our total output. Now the higher-quality products, although they are more profitable, do tend to run slower on our mills. So that has some impact upon the amount of tons that we ship, but you're spot on. We're looking hard at those products that we believe bring higher margins, higher profits to our company and that are also more import-resistant. Given the overcapacity in the world today, we believe that that's an important element of our long-term strategy."

So we don't see them pouring in right now with new orders, but we are hearing from them that because of the trade cases and, frankly, because our pricing has become much more competitive relative to imported pricing that they have not placed the orders for imports to the same level that they have in the past. And as you know, when you're talking about import orders, there's about a 2- to 3-month, maybe 4 months sometimes, depending upon the product, delay or lag time between when the order was placed and when the product arrives. So many of our service center customers, in particular, are recognizing that the orders that they placed 2 or 3 or 4 months ago now do not look nearly as attractive. And unfortunately, they're on the water. They're on the way, and they can't be canceled. So we're going to see this issue of heavy inventories continue for a little bit of time.

We see our customers coming back to us from the imports. The other comment that I'll make, just in general, you asked about other customers coming back to us.

But in a more general sense, when I think about the deployment of our cash going forward, our first priority will always be aggressive growth, profitable growth in our company, and that can be done several ways. Organic growth has been, for us, one of the ways that we get the largest return for the investments that we've made. And you've heard us list today and in the past conference calls numerous projects in which we are growing our company profitably through organic investments in our existing operations. Frankly, acquisitions is another way that we are deploying our cash to accomplish profitable growth. Skyline would be an example of that, fairly recent. More recent than that would be our Gallatin acquisition. So yes, we're looking at that. It's a way to not only grow our volumes, but to grow our customer base and grow the breadth of our products. And that's something that's very important as we look at potential targets out there. And I take this opportunity to just remind you of one other way that we can grow our company through investments, and that's we got a pretty good track record of growing through a greenfield expansion.

That's really not what -- that is not what is driving it. The opportunity for opportunistic buys as we go forward, again, as this challenging time extends out, there might be opportunities as we've done in the past to pick up some very good assets at a very good price. You know, Timna, that one of our strategies has always been to grow our company during the downturns when assets are less expensive. So we think that, that's going to be happening. As we go forward, we think there's going to be more assets available at good prices, and we want to make sure that we're prepared to capitalize on those opportunities. So we have that, and it's one of the reasons that we're making sure that we preserve our cash. Now to your questions about dividends and buyback programs, I'll make just a couple of comments. First of all, as you know, we pay a very healthy dividend today. And we've proven in the past that when are profit levels are such, that we could pay out a supplemental dividend without adversely affecting our ability to aggressively grow and profitably grow our company, we'll do it. Right now, that's not the case. And in terms of the buyback, what we did was we asked our board to authorize a buyback program. That was, frankly, in place, so really just refreshing a program that had already been authorized and had been on the books for many years. We did that. We want to be prepared for a situation where there might be limited profitable growth opportunities that do not provide a return -- a large-enough return that would outweigh the repurchasing of our stock. In other words, when we take a look at the opportunities in front of us, we want to make sure that the return that we gain from those acquisitions, those investments surpass what we would gain for our shareholders by repurchasing the scraps -- the stock. If that's not the case, we want to be ready. If that situation should come up suddenly, we want to be ready. One thing about this industry, Timna, as you know, it changes. And when a change occurs, it occurs rapidly. And we made this move just so that we're ready for that eventuality."

But the other point that I would make is that we always look at our investments for the long term. And when you look at the macro impact reasons for making the investment, the fact that manufacturing is leaving the country, and with it prime scrap, when you look at long term, we still believe that the availability and the pricing for natural gas will be much more attractive than that for coking coal. When you look at the improvement in the efficiency of automotive blanking, which results in less prime scrap availability even in periods where the automotive market is very strong, for all of these reasons, as we look long term, we believe that having the ability to produce a low-residual scrap substitute product for Nucor is going to be a very good investment. And if I may, Timna, what [indiscernible] as I let you ask the second question, maybe you can make me -- let me make a second statement about this response. And that's one thing that we -- I don't know that we emphasize enough when we talk about the DRI project and what it does for us, and that gives us -- is that it gives us tremendous flexibility in our selection of raw material used for our furnaces. And by using that flexibility, we're able to impact other scrap, well, other iron unit products, and that's been very beneficial to us. I mean, you've seen the impact of that a couple of months ago when we saw such a tremendous drop in scrap. I would also suggest to you that whenever we put in or take out 4 million tons of a scrap substitute product, it's going to have an impact on other iron unit products.

And in one area, frankly, and I want to thank them for this, in one area, they helped us get a whole lot better. And that was in the area of safety. Their safety performance before the acquisition was outstanding. Their commitment to safe -- working safe is phenomenal, and the way they run their safety programs is phenomenal. And we've learned quite a bit from them. So despite the fact that Gallatin is operating today in an extremely tough market, the energy, which is a big product coming out of Gallatin, as you know, has been really, really challenged. But our teammates are doing what we always do at Nucor, and that is finding new ways, new products. One example would be that they are working hard to qualify for automotive products, and we expect them to be successful in that attempt. And all I can say is it's -- it is, without a doubt, going much better than we anticipated. And one other comment to your question about the -- where are they getting their raw materials from, obviously, on the scrap side, there's a lot of synergies with our DJJ operations right up the road.

Now remember, we all -- all of us have not yet got a chance to take a look at the complete documents. So I'm not going to say whether or not we would favor it or we would struggle with it until we have an opportunity to read and study the entire document, which we have not had at this time. That said, I will say that we are extremely, extremely disappointed that it's not -- that currency manipulation is not more strongly baked into that agreement. At the end of the day, you can have all kinds of trade agreements. And if a country manipulates its currency, it's guaranteed to have an unfair trade advantage. And so we have -- what we are insisting upon with TPP is that it does as it's promising to do, and that is to provide a more level playing field on which we can compete. We, at Nucor, are absolutely convinced that if we were given a level playing field to compete upon, we would compete successfully against any company or any country in the world. So we're taking a hard look at TPP before we come out with a definitive statement, but you are absolutely correct in saying that currency manipulation not being a part of that agreement makes us really struggle about the impact it will have on our company, the impact it will have on our industry, the impact it'll have on manufacturing in the United States and the impact, most importantly, that it will have upon middle-class Americans working hard to make a living and make a better life for themselves and their family. So you got a little philosophical, so did I. Okay? Now to infrastructure. Once again, I have to say that I'm disappointed in the administration. And frankly, Congress is not taking advantage what I -- of what I consider a great opportunity. Right now, steel costs are down. What a time to focus on rebuilding our infrastructure. Okay? Energy, okay? How important is energy going forward in the manufacturing world and for our country, frankly? What a great time to be able to rebuild our energy infrastructure, our power grids. And frankly, with the price of oil where it is today and the resulting price of gasoline at the pump, it seems to me like this would be a great time to be able to -- and I know this is politically unpopular, but I'm not running for office so I can say it, okay? This would be a great time to just put a little bump on to the tax of -- the tax rate on gasoline and use that money to rebuild the crumbling infrastructure of this country. What an embarrassment? 30, 40, 50 years ago, we were -- our country was known for its infrastructure. People came here to study how we build bridges. And today, you look at it, and overall our bridges, our infrastructure as a whole just recently received a D+. And they were bragging on the fact that it wasn't really D. It was D+. Okay? We don't need infrastructure. If we're going to have a manufacturing powerhouse to the 21st century, we need infrastructure that gets an A+, not a D+. This is a great opportunity to rebuild our infrastructure. I'm extremely disappointed that we continue to kick the can down the road on funding, with 3-month extensions after extension after extension. I believe that there's something like 30 -- 33 or 34 3-month extensions since 2008. That's an embarrassment, and I really hope that our leaders step up to the plate and do not miss this great opportunity to rebuild the infrastructure in this country."

Well, clearly, the way that we have been able to grow our automotive presence has been through investments in our company. The vacuum tank, the gases throughout all of our sheet mills, the wide-light project at Berkeley, that -- the work that we've done and the advances that we have made, advanced high-strength steels, those have opened the doors for us in growing our automotive presence. And I also have to say that the automotive companies recognizing the long-term sustainability of Nucor and the quality of service that we've been able to provide for them, that's attracted them and given us the opportunity to grow in those areas. In terms of your specific question relative to how we see it growing over the next 2 years, the answer to that would be a yes. We're basing that upon qualifications that we've already have been through and have passed and qualified for applications in future platforms and commitments that have been made to us on future platforms. So we are confident in that projections of 2 million to 3 million tons. I would also add just one more thing on that. As you've mentioned, the commercial and marketing, we recognize the need to improve our marketing into automotive. And to that end, we established a sales office right in Detroit. It's the first time Nucor's had a sales office located in Detroit. We have named a sales manager to oversee automotive specifically, and this is an extremely experienced guy with a lot of years in the service. And again, we're confident that we will be able to commit the -- we will be able to build a commitment that I'm making to you, and that our commercial team has made to me, that we will get to 2 million tons over the next 2 to 3 years."
