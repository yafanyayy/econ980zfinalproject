A lot has happened in the last 90 days, and overall, we are pleased with where we ended the year. We're reporting solid results",933,"Thanks, Jim. Good morning, and thanks for joining our call. Today we are reporting fourth quarter and full-year 2014 earnings. A lot has happened in the last 90 days, and overall, we are pleased with where we ended the year. We're reporting solid results that in some places exceeded expectations. I'll give a quick overview of our financials, provide some perspective on the year and share updates on key initiatives contributing to our results before turning it over to Kathy to go into more detail on the financials.
We delivered strong profit and cash for the year, and we closed strong in Services revenue and margin. Services revenue growth improved through the year, and we saw improved margin performance. Services signings increased as well, driven by renewals in BPO, and we ended the year with strong Document Outsourcing signings of over $1 billion. In fact, our Canadian operation closed its largest ever multimillion dollar MPS deal with the government of Canada in November.
In Document Technology, we delivered strong margins throughout the year, reflecting both our continued focus on profitability as well as a favorable environment. And for the fifth consecutive year, we are the leader in equipment sale revenue. Demand has been strong for our products in the U.S. and Europe. These products provide our Graphic Communications customers with the ability to produce digital color prints at scale with a high level of personalization, quality and reliability.
As you know, Xerox has been focusing on the segments where we have the most competitive advantage, and we've been steadily shifting our portfolio mix. As an example, we announced the pending divestiture of our ITO business through a sale to Atos. This will allow us to focus squarely on Business Process Services and Document Outsourcing and provide additional capacity to invest further in these businesses.
We've aligned our Services go-to-market model into a set of industry teams and our delivery model along functional capability such as customer care, human resources, consulting and analytics and transaction processing. We've made progress in improving our government health care businesses, in and 2014, we committed resources to maturing our MMIS platform. While we still have work to do, the hard work of the team is paying off. We remain bullish about this market and its opportunities for us. Innovation is a differentiator for us now and will continue to be in the future.
Within customer care, we introduced an intelligent virtual customer care agent that can diagnose and resolve customer inquiries in the same way, if not better, than a human agent would. Xerox invested in health , a pioneering in-patient and provider-driven health care technology. As their exclusive BPO partner, we will support health spa as they provide ground-breaking tele health to patients at convenient neighborhood locations. It's an important step in the transformation of health care and an exciting space for Xerox to be.
In the second half, the Document Technology team launched 20 new products that were well received and a reminder to the market about innovation power.
We continue to receive recognition from the industry for business and technology leadership. Gartner, , and others recognized us for our Managed Print and content services, finance and accounting and BPO. Everest Group named Xerox a leader in its service provider landscape, renting for the contact center outsourcing markets for the health care industry. We're feeling good about our progress. We remain focused on being the best partner to our clients and making Xerox a great place to work for our people and delivering value to our investors.
Now let's take a look at the results in more detail. We delivered earnings just above our range and grew margin in both our segments and on a total Xerox basis. We're reporting adjusted EPS of $0.31 and GAAP EPS of $0.26. Profit improved this quarter as we made progress in Services. Services margin improved in the fourth quarter to 9.8%, and we continue to benefit from a favorable environment and strong operational management in Document Technology.
On the revenue side. The improved growth in Services to 3% in the quarter is notable, especially considering the impact from the loss of the Texas Medicaid contract. Document Technology revenue declined in line with recent trends. Acquisitions remain a key aspect of our portfolio management strategy. For the full-year 2014, we invested almost $350 million in acquisitions. We're focus on enhancing our Services offerings and expanding our global reach. We have a goal in 2015 to get more done on this front, up to $900 million in acquisitions, with part of those funds coming from the sale of our ITO business.
With that objective in mind, we closed on 1 modestly sized acquisition since the beginning of the year, Intrepid Learning Systems, which include the service to ensure company's employees are equipped with the latest skills and knowledge to improve their business performance. And underpinning our results in business model is strong gas generation. We closed the quarter with $850 million in cash from operations and over $2 billion for the year. This supported our acquisition activity, growing dividends and share repurchases. In fact, we announced today a 12% increase in our annual dividend rate to $0.28 per share.
Now shifting ahead to 2015. Our results will be impacted by the recent volatility in foreign currencies. As a result, we have adjusted 2015 guidance to reflect these headwinds. Kathy will go into greater detail on currency in just a moment.
With that, I'll turn it over to Kathy, then I'll wrap up and we'll open the call for your questions. Kathy?"
103599,281083789,752387,"Xerox Corporation, Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Jan 30, 2015",2015-01-30,"Earnings Calls","Xerox Holdings Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Ursula, and good morning, everyone. We were pleased with the progress we made this quarter. Both Services revenue growth and margin improved. And with the announcement of the planned sale of our ITO business to Atos, we took a key step in our port",2844,"Thanks, Ursula, and good morning, everyone. We were pleased with the progress we made this quarter. Both Services revenue growth and margin improved. And with the announcement of the planned sale of our ITO business to Atos, we took a key step in our portfolio management strategy. In addition, our Document Technology business continued to deliver strong profitability. The positive results in Services and Document Technology yielded earnings higher than our expectations and strong cash flow.
I'll cover the segments in cash flow in a moment. But first, let me walk through our fourth quarter earnings.
As noted earlier, with the pending sale of our ITO business, my commentary will be on a continuing operations basis, excluding ITO.
Total revenue in the quarter was down 3% at actual currency and 1% at constant currency. This compares to down 2% at both actual and constant currency in the third quarter. Underlying constant currency growth improved from the third quarter, driven by better Services performance. And as expected, we saw the impact of actual currency rates turn negative in the quarter.
Gross margin of 32.1% was up 10 basis points year-over-year as the positive benefit in Document Technology from productivity initiatives, currency and pension expense more than offset the greater mix of Services at a lower margin.  was modestly lower year-over-year as increased investments in Services were more than offset by reductions in Document Technology. SAG was lower in both segments as we benefited from productivity initiatives as well as lower bad debt and pension expenses. These improvements resulted in our fourth quarter operating margin increasing 100 basis points year-over-year and operating profit growth of almost 7%. And for the full year, operating profit improved $72 million and operating margin was up 60 basis points.
Moving down the income statement. Adjusted other net was a $6 million higher expense year-over-year. Lower gains on sale of assets of $20 million and ruble-related currency losses of $5 million were only partially offset by $19 million in lower restructuring costs. For the full year, a tough compare resulted in adjusted other net expense coming in $102 million higher. In 2013, we realized greater benefits from transaction gains and other nonoperational below the line credit. In addition, restructuring charges were $13 million higher this year.
Our equity income was $41 million in the fourth quarter, down $2 million year-over-year, driven by the impact of negative translation currency. Our fourth quarter adjusted tax rate of 25.3% was up about a percentage point year-over-year and within our guidance of 23% to 27%.
Adjusted EPS of $0.31 was $0.04 higher year-over-year driven by operating profit growth and lower share count. For the full year, adjusted EPS of $1.07 was $0.03 higher as operating profit growth and lower share count were partially offset by higher adjusted other net expense.
I'll now move to the Services segment slide to review those results in a little bit more detail.
Services revenue grew 1% and was up 3% at constant currency, which was 2 points better, sequentially. Within Services, at constant currency, BPO growth increased to 4% from 2% in the third quarter, with good growth in commercial health care payer, electronic tolling, litigation services and international.
Document Outsourcing was up 1% year-over-year at constant currency, a modest improvement from the third quarter but under our segment growth objectives. We're beginning to see good traction from our next-generation MPS offerings, and we're encouraged by the good signings in the quarter. Overall, in Services, we're making progress improving growth. And we continue to expect 2% to 4% constant currency Services growth this year. Our growth rate will be lower in the first half, reflecting the impact from the Texas Medicaid contract loss last year, slower first half Document Outsourcing growth and expected ramp timing for a couple of large new business contract awards. The Texas loss creates a headwind of about 150 basis points until we lap it in August.
Total signings in the quarter were up 20%, driven by strong growth in renewals, including the large BPO contract renewal that I referenced last quarter which helped to drive strong BPO renewal rate of 93%. BPO new business was light as we're still working towards signed and approved contracts for the New York Medicaid and Florida tolling new business awards. We're getting closer on both and continue to expect them to sign in the first half.
Our sales force is now aligned to specific industry verticals, and we're investing in increased sales coverage and training. These actions will positively impact new business signings as we move through 2015.
Document Outsourcing signings of $1 billion were the highest in recent history with good growth on both the renewal and new business side. So a good signings quarter for Document Outsourcing, we should enable growth to pick up by the middle of the year.
Shifting to profitability. Segment margin was 9.8% in the fourth quarter, which was up 70 basis points sequentially, up 10 basis points year-over-year and towards the higher end of our targeted 9% to 10% range. We're making progress on our Services initiative and improving execution. In BPO, we saw multiple lines of business contribute to the year-over-year profit improvement, and Document Outsourcing margins remained strong. Our results in government health care were in line with our expectation, and we're seeing positive results from our investment to mature the platform and improve our operational performance. We're confident we're on the right track, and we started some work ahead of finalizing the New York Medicaid contract to ensure we get off to the right start there.
In 2015, our focus will be on accelerating growth and driving a solid 50 basis points of margin improvement year-over-year.
In summary, the fourth quarter was the strongest quarter of the year for Services, both in terms of growth and margin. And we're taking the actions required to hit our targeted 2015 core operating results.
With that, I'll now turn to Document Technology. Fourth quarter total revenue in Document Technology was in line with our expectations, with constant currency results down 6%, which was consistent with the full year rate of decline. As expected, the impact of actual currency rate turned on us this quarter with a negative 2-point impact. Equipment revenue declines were higher driven by weakness in Eurasia, reflecting the volatility in Russia's economy, as well as the timing of large account sales. The decline in annuity revenue moderated a bit sequentially, driven by modestly higher supply demand and a more favorable compare given the prior year channel inventory reduction. Similar to last quarter, the finance receivable sales in the prior year was almost a 1 point negative impact to revenue growth.
From a geographic perspective, the U.S. and Europe were relatively stable, while developing markets outside of Russia was a positive contributor to results.
Looking at our product groups. High-end remains the best-performing subsegment, reporting annuity growth at constant currency for the third quarter in a row. We saw good traction from the recent launch of our new entry production color entry product as well as good growth in our product family. Mid-range color activity was relatively flat and consistent with the third quarter as we continue to lap our ConnectKey launch from last year. Mono declined in line with industry trends. Entry a for activity was lower year-over-year given weakness in Eurasia as well as the timing of our entry product refresh. We launched 11 new products late in the third quarter and early in the fourth. Market reception has been positive, but the timing caused us to only catch a partial benefit in the quarter.
Profitability was quite strong. Our Q4 margins came in above our expectations at 14.4%, resulting in segment profit growth of 14%. This strong performance reflects benefits from restructuring and productivity initiatives, positive transaction currencies that more than offset negative translation impact and lower bad debt expense as well as lower pension expense. So another solid quarter for Document Technology.
Now I'm going to turn to cash flow. Before I go through the cash flow, I'd like to make 1 comment related to the announced ITO sale. Our GAAP net income includes the noncash loss triggered by the pending sale of the ITO business of approximately $180 million, driven mainly by goodwill allocated to that business. You can see the losses add back further down in the cash flow statement, so net-net, there's no cash flow impact.
Moving on, our cash flow from operations with $857 million in the quarter and a little over $2 billion for the year, which was just above our range. As expected, cash flow in the quarter and full year were lower solely due to the impact from finance receivable sales in prior year versus no sales this -- in '14.
Looking at the full year. Underlying cash flow, which excludes the impact from prior finance receivable sales, was $2.5 billion and compares to $2.1 billion in 2013. The largest driver of the year-over-year improvement in underlying cash flow was a reduction in net working capital resulting from both performance and timing factors, including lower DSO and improved year end collections, especially of Services, improved terms of a few key vendors as well as seasonal smoothing of working capital. Additionally, we have higher runoff from our underlying finance receivables associated with lower originations as well as lower equipment revenue. These year-over-year benefits were partially offset by higher pension funding.
Moving down the cash flow statement. Investing cash flows were $129 million used in the quarter and a $703 million use for the full year. For the full year, we spent $452 million on CapEx and $340 million on acquisition. Cash from financing was a use of $297 million in the fourth quarter and $1.6 billion for the year. Included in that full year amount is $1.07 billion spent on share repurchases and $313 million used for preferred and common stock dividend.
Now I'll quickly cover our capital structure. We ended the year with $7.7 billion in debt, which excludes approximately $75 million in capital lease obligations related to our ITO business, which we'll reclassify to a discontinued operations liability account. Applying 7 to 1 leverage on customer financing assets, our allocated financing debt at year end was $4.2 billion, leaving core debt of $3.5 billion.
We manage our core debt to maintain a leverage ratio consistent with our investment-grade ratings. Our financing debt has come down over the past few years driven by finance receivable transactions as well as lower origination.
During 2015, we have 2 tranches of debt coming due, about $1 billion in February and $250 million in June. We continue to be comfortable with our leverage position, and we plan to refinance these notes during 2015, which will result in our year-end debt being roughly flat at about $7.7 billion. So our capital structure remains stable. And if we move to the next slide, I'll review where we're at in terms of capital allocation.
During 2014, we returned close to $1.4 billion to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends. This equates to approximately 85% of our free cash flow for the year. Those numbers include $1.07 billion of share repurchases and approximately $300 million of dividends. We also spent a total of $340 million on acquisition. That's $185 million higher year-over-year but shy of our target of up to $500 million. We obviously have more work to do here, and we're focused on concentrating on a bit larger deals as well as adding more resources into this area.
For 2015, our capital allocation plan is unchanged, and it reflects the redeployment of the expected net proceeds of roughly $850 million from the ITO sale. On share repurchase, we plan to spend about $1 billion repurchasing stock in 2015. We continue to view our shares as an attractive price and it's a good investment.
On acquisitions, we expect to spend up to $900 million. In keeping with our portfolio management strategy, we're looking to acquire companies that will expand our capabilities in attractive service areas as well as to expand our global reach in Services.
As I mentioned on debt, we're comfortable with our leverage position and expect to end the year roughly flat at $7.7 billion. And finally, on dividends. We're announcing today a 12% increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.07 per share. This will result in spend of just over $300 million, with share repurchases effectively self-funding most of the increase.
Before I turn it back to Ursula, I'd like to summarize our expectations for the full year as well as the first quarter. As Ursula mentioned, we've seen a sharp movement in currencies around the world in the last 45 days. Where we normally offset modest currency impact, the dramatic nature of this move creates almost $100 million of profit exposure year-over-year. Most significant to us in the short time the euro weakens by about 10% versus the dollar and 9% versus the yen and the Canadian dollars weakened 7% against the dollar. These currency moves caused both negative translation and transaction impacts. While we continue to look for ways to offset more of this negative impact, we believe it's prudent to capture the current exposure by revising our guidance.
Let me walk you through the details on where we're at on full year guidance and then I'll cover the first quarter. On revenue, our constant currency expectations are unchanged versus what we communicated at our November investor conference. Total company, roughly flat at constant currency; Services, up 2% to 4%, with growth improving and as we move through the year; Document Technology, down 4% to 5%, which reflects some improvement as the negative impact of the prior finance receivable sales moderate and we realize more benefit from our product launches late in the second half of last year. However, we now expect currency will have a negative the 3 to 4-point impact revenue for the full year versus flat to about a point previously communicated, with Document Technology having a little higher impact and Services a little lower given the geographic mix of the revenues.
On margins, we continue to target a 50 basis point improvement year-over-year on Services, which would put us at the middle of our 9% to 10% range. For Document Technology, we continue to expect to be within our 11% to 13% range but likely more towards the middle of the range, driven by year-over-year increased pension costs that we've talked about previously as well as the negative net currency impact.
As a result of the lower expected revenue at actual currency as well as related pressure on Document Technology margins, we expect the flow-through to impact earnings roughly by $0.06. And as a result, we're lowering our full year adjusted EPS guidance by $0.05 to $1 to $1.06.
Turning to cash flow. The timing of the ITO sale negatively impacts free cash flow as we expect to sell the business in the first half and it produces most of its free cash flow in the second. Additionally, currency impacts our cash, presenting another headwind. We expect to offset some of this impact in 2015 and incremental M&A should offset the ITO impact next year. Net-net, we're bringing down our operating cash flow guidance by $200 million to $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion and our free cash flow down $100 million to $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion.
Now, to first quarter guidance. In Document Technology, we anticipate revenue declines to be down mid-single digits in constant currency with actual results about 4 points lower given currency rates, particularly the weakening of the euro and Canadian dollar. We expect Q1 Document Technology to continue to deliver very strong margins, but seasonally, they'll be lower and below last year's 12.2%, driven mainly by higher noncash pension expense as well as negative currency impact.
In Services. Constant currency revenue growth will be at the low end of our 2% to 4% full year guidance range, driven by tougher compares, expected timing of ramping award at new business and slower Document Outsourcing growth. We expect currency to have about a 3 point negative impact. We expect margins to be seasonally lower but up modestly year-over-year.
At the consolidated level for the first quarter, we expect revenue will be down 1 to 2 points at constant currency, with 3 to 4 points of negative currency impact. Adjusted earnings per share is expected to be $0.20 to $0.22, which includes approximately $0.02 of restructuring. The decline versus $0.26 last year is driven by higher noncash pension expense, adverse currency, higher OID given a prior year gain on asset sale, as well as a higher tax rate, 26% planned this year versus 26% last year. That's partially offset by improvement in Services operational performance as well as lower share count.
Overall, we're making progress in our core business operation, and we'll be working hard to offset the pressure we're seeing from currency.
With that, I'll hand it back to you, Ursula."

But I would expect our pipeline to grow during the year as a result of the sales force additions and the focus on customers and vertical markets."

By the way, the incremental money not coming in the door until the middle of the year, right? So just a note for folks on that. And so there is a possibility that we won't get 100% of the $900 million spend this year. Our expectation is we would look to kind of flow that in trying to accomplish more in the first quarter of 2016. We've already announced that we're going to do roughly $1 million in share repurchases this quarter. We ended the year with a strong cash balance to enable us to again be more consistent in terms of being in the market consistently.

Part of that, obviously, reflects the sale of the ITO business. We would expect to start to offset that as we do more M&A, basically, utilizing the proceeds. And so I would call that impact a transitory impact, right? Clearly, we've said we think we'll be able to offset some of the currency impacts in 2015, reflected in the guidance that we gave with respect to free cash flow. But the company is a -- an incredibly, I'd say, solid and consistent cash flow producer. And the sale of the ITO business is really just a modest transitory impact on cash flow. I'm not trying to try and call where currencies go in 2016. But obviously, we're going to do everything that we can to offset the currency impact as much as possible. Overall, with regard to pension, we're increasing our pension funding this year by about $50 million. I would expect our pension funding start to stabilize at that point, unless there's an opportunity to do something more materially with our pension, which at this point I don't necessarily see. So I think the overall factors around our cash flow are very solid. And we've reduced it at the moment for some transitory issues, but I wouldn't expect those to last forever."

From a foreign currency perspective on Doc Tech, with regard to top line, translation impacts to top line happen immediately, right? The flipside of that is what's going on in transaction impact. The transaction impact don't hit us immediately as a result of our hedging program. So that's a little bit more back half. It gets worse relative to front half as a result. That's obviously a profit and a margin constraint as opposed to a revenue constraint. So hopefully, that gives you a little bit of color."

Today we are reporting fourth quarter and full year 2014 earnings. A lot has happened in the last 90 days and overall, we are pleased with where we ended the year. We're reporting solid results that in some places exceeded expectations. I'll give a quick overview of our financials, provide some perspective on the year and share updates on key initiatives contributing to our results before turning it over to Kathy to go into more detail on the financials.
We delivered strong profit and cash for the year, and we closed strong in Services revenue and margin. Services revenue growth improved through the year and we saw improved margin performance. Services signings increased as well, driven by renewals in BPO, and we ended the year with strong Document Outsourcing signings of over $1 billion. In fact, our Canadian operation closed its largest ever multimillion dollar MPS deal with the government of Canada in November.
In Document Technology, we delivered strong margin throughout the year, reflecting both our continued focus on profitability as well as a favorable environment. And for the fifth consecutive year, we are the leader in equipment sale revenue. Demand has been strong for our iGen and the new Versant products in the U.S. and Europe. These products provide our Graphic Communications customers with the ability to produce digital color prints at scale with a high level of personalization, quality and reliability.
As you know, Xerox has been focusing on the segments where we have the most competitive advantage, and we've been steadily shifting our portfolio mix. As an example, we announced the pending divestiture of our ITO business through a sale to Atos. This will allow us to focus squarely on business process services and Document Outsourcing and provide additional capacity to invest further in these businesses.
We've aligned our Services go-to-market model into a set of industry teams and our delivery model along functional capabilities such as customer care, human resources, consulting and analytics and transaction processing. We've made progress in improving our government health care business and in 2014, we committed resources to maturing our MMIS enterprise platform. While we still have work to do, the hard work of the team is paying off. We remain bullish about this market and its opportunities for us. Innovation is a differentiator for us now and will continue to be in the future.
Within customer care, we introduced an intelligent virtual customer care agent that can diagnose and resolve customer inquiries in the same way, if not better, than a human agent would. Xerox invested in HealthSPA, a pioneer in patient and provider-driven health care technology. As their exclusive BPO partner, we will support HealthSPA as they provide ground-breaking telehealth to patients at convenient neighborhood locations. It's an important step in the transformation of health care and an exciting place for Xerox to be.
In the second half, the Document Technology team launched 20 new products that were well received and are a reminder to the market about innovation power.
We continue to receive recognition from the industry for business and technology leadership. Gartner, Quocirca and others recognize us for our Managed Print and content services, finance and accounting and BPO. Everest Group named Xerox a leader in its service provider landscape, renting for the contact center outsourcing markets for the health care industry. We're feeling good about our progress. We remain focused on being the best partner to our clients and making Xerox a great place to work for our people and delivering value to our investors.
 
Now let's take a look at the results in more detail. We delivered earnings just above our range and grew margin in both our segments and on a total Xerox basis. We're reporting adjusted EPS of $0.31 and GAAP EPS of $0.26. Profit improved this quarter as we made progress in Services. Services margin improved in the fourth quarter to 9.8%, and we continue to benefit from a favorable environment and strong operational management in Document Technology.
On the revenue side. The improved growth in Services to 3% in the quarter is notable, especially considering the impact from the loss of the Texas Medicaid contract. Document Technology revenue declined in line with recent trends. Acquisitions remain a key aspect of our portfolio management strategy. For the full year 2014, we invested almost $350 million in acquisitions. We are focused on enhancing our Services offerings and expanding our global reach. We have a goal in 2015 to get more done on this front, up to $900 million in acquisitions, with part of those funds coming from the sale of our ITO business.
With that objective in mind, we closed on 1 modestly sized acquisition since the beginning of the year, Intrepid Learning Systems, which include the service to ensure company's employees are equipped with the latest skills and knowledge to improve their business performance. And underpinning our results in business model is strong cash generation. We closed the quarter with $850 million in cash from operations and over $2 billion for the year. This supported our acquisitions activity on growing dividends and share repurchases. In fact, we announced today a 12% increase in our annual dividend rate to $0.28 per share.
Now shifting ahead to 2015. Our results will be impacted by the recent volatility in foreign currencies. As a result, we have adjusted 2015 guidance to reflect these headwinds. Kathy will go into greater detail on currency in just a moment.
With that, I'll turn it over to Kathy, then I'll wrap up and we'll open the call to your questions. Kathy?"
103599,281083789,752667,"Xerox Corporation, Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Jan 30, 2015",2015-01-30,"Earnings Calls","Xerox Holdings Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Ursula, and good morning, everyone.

We were pleased with the progress we made this quarter. Both Services revenue growth and margin improved. And with the announcement of the planned sale of our ITO business to Atos, we took a key step in our portfolio management strategy. In addition, our Document Technology business continued to deliver strong profitability. The positive results in Services and Document Technology yielded earnings higher than our expectations and strong cash flow.
I'll cover the segments in cash flow in a moment. But first, let me walk through our fourth quarter earnings. As noted earlier, with the pending sale of our ITO business, my commentary will be on a continuing operations basis, excluding ITO.
Total revenue in the quarter was down 3% at actual currency and 1% at constant currency. This compares to down 2% at both actual and constant currency in the third quarter. Underlying constant currency growth improved from the third quarter driven by better Services performance. And as expected, we saw the impact of actual currency rates turn negative in the quarter.
Gross margin of 32.1% was up 10 basis points year-over-year as the positive benefit in Document Technology from productivity initiatives, currency and pension expense more than offset the greater mix of Services at a lower margin.  RD&E was modestly lower year-over-year as increased investments in Services were more than offset by reductions in Document Technology. SAG was lower in both segments as we benefited from productivity initiatives as well as lower bad debt and pension expenses. These improvements resulted in our fourth quarter operating margin increasing 100 basis points year-over-year and operating profit growth of almost 7%. And for the full year, operating profit improved $72 million and operating margin was up 60 basis points.
Moving down the income statement. Adjusted other net was a $6 million higher expense year-over-year. Lower gains on sale of assets of $20 million and ruble-related currency losses of $5 million were only partially offset by $19 million in lower restructuring costs. For the full year, a tough compare resulted in adjusted other net expense coming in $102 million higher. In 2013, we realized greater benefits from transaction gains and other nonoperational below the line credit. In addition, restructuring charges were $13 million higher this year.
Our equity income was $41 million in the fourth quarter, down $2 million year-over-year driven by the impact of negative translation currency. Our fourth quarter adjusted tax rate of 25.3% was up about 1 percentage point year-over-year and within our guidance of 23% to 27%.
Adjusted EPS of $0.31 was $0.04 higher year-over-year driven by operating profit growth and lower share count. For the full year, adjusted EPS of $1.07 was $0.03 higher as operating profit growth and lower share count were partially offset by higher adjusted other net expense.
I'll now move to the Services segment slide to review those results in a little bit more detail.
Services revenue grew 1% and was up 3% at constant currency, which was 2 points better, sequentially. Within Services, at constant currency, BPO growth increased to 4% from 2% in the third quarter, with good growth in commercial health care payer, electronic tolling, litigation services and international.
Document Outsourcing was up 1% year-over-year at constant currency, a modest improvement from the third quarter, but under our segment growth objectives. We're beginning to see good traction from our next-generation MPS offerings, and we're encouraged by the good signings in the quarter. Overall, in Services, we're making progress improving growth. And we continue to expect 2% to 4% constant currency Services growth this year. Our growth rate will be lower in the first half, reflecting the impact from the Texas Medicaid contract loss last year, slower first half Document Outsourcing growth and expected ramp timing for a couple of large new business contract awards. The Texas loss creates a headwind of about 150 basis points until we lap it in August.
Total signings in the quarter were up 20%, driven by strong growth in renewals, including the large BPO contract renewal that I referenced last quarter which helped to drive a strong BPO renewal rate of 93%. BPO new business was light as we're still working towards signed and approved contracts for the New York Medicaid and Florida tolling new business awards. We're getting closer on both and continue to expect them to sign in the first half.
Our sales force is now aligned to a specific industry vertical, and we're investing in increased sales coverage and training. These actions will positively impact new business signings as we move through 2015.
Document Outsourcing signings of $1 billion were the highest in recent history with good growth on both the renewal and new business side. So a good signings quarter for Document Outsourcing, we should enable growth to pick up by the middle of the year.
Shifting to profitability. Segment margin was 9.8% in the fourth quarter, which was up 70 basis points sequentially, up 10 basis points year-over-year and towards the higher end of our targeted 9% to 10% range. We're making progress on our Services initiative and improving execution. In BPO, we saw multiple lines of business contribute to the year-over-year profit improvement and Document Outsourcing margins remained strong. Our results in government health care were in line with our expectation, and we're seeing positive results from our investments to mature the platform and improve our operational performance. We're confident we're on the right track and we started some work ahead of finalizing the New York Medicaid contract to ensure we get off to the right start there.
In 2015, our focus will be on accelerating growth and driving a solid 50 basis points of margin improvement year-over-year. In summary, the fourth quarter was the strongest quarter of the year for Services, both in terms of growth and margin. And we're taking the actions required to hit our targeted 2015 core operating results.
With that, I'll now turn to Document Technology. Fourth quarter total revenue in Document Technology was in line with our expectations, with constant currency results down 6%, which was consistent with the full year rate of decline. As expected, the impact of actual currency rate turned on us this quarter with a negative 2-point impact. Equipment revenue declines were higher driven by weakness in Eurasia, reflecting the volatility in Russia's economy as well as the timing of large account sales. The decline in annuity revenue moderated a bit sequentially, driven by modestly higher supply demand and a more favorable compare given the prior year channel inventory reduction. Similar to last quarter, the finance receivable sales in the prior year was almost a 1 point negative impact to revenue growth.
From a geographic perspective, the U.S. and Europe were relatively stable while developing markets outside of Russia was a positive contributor to results.
Looking at our product groups. High-end remains the best-performing subsegment, reporting annuity growth at constant currency for the third quarter in a row. We saw good traction from the recent launch of our new Versant entry production color product as well as good growth in iGen product family. Mid-range color activity was relatively flat and consistent with the third quarter as we continue to lap our ConnectKey launch from last year. Mono declined in line with industry trends. Entry A4 activity was lower year-over-year given weakness in Eurasia as well as the timing of our entry product refresh. We launched 11 new products late in the third quarter and early in the fourth. Market reception's been positive, but the timing caused us to only catch a partial benefit in the quarter.
Profitability was quite strong. Our Q4 margins came in above our expectations at 14.4%, resulting in segment profit growth of 14%. This strong performance reflects benefits from restructuring and productivity initiatives, positive transaction currencies that more than offset negative translation impact and lower bad debt expense as well as lower pension expense. So another solid quarter for Document Technology.
Now I'm going to turn to cash flow. Before I go through the cash flow, I'd like to make 1 comment related to the announced ITO sale. Our GAAP net income includes a noncash loss triggered by the pending sale of the ITO business of approximately $180 million, driven mainly by goodwill allocated to that business. You can see the losses added back further down in the cash flow statement. So net-net, there's no cash flow impact.
Moving on, our cash flow from operations was $857 million in the quarter and a little over $2 billion for the year, which was just above our range. As expected, cash flow in the quarter and full year were lower solely due to the impact from finance receivable sales in prior years versus no sales this -- in '14.
Looking at the full year. Underlying cash flow, which excludes the impact from prior finance receivable sales, was $2.5 billion and compares to $2.1 billion in 2013. The largest driver of the year-over-year improvement in underlying cash flow was a reduction in net working capital resulting from both performance and timing factors, including lower DSO and improved year end collections, especially in Services, improved terms with a few key vendors as well as seasonal smoothing of working capital. Additionally, we have higher runoff from our underlying finance receivables associated with lower originations as well as lower equipment revenue. These year-over-year benefits were partially offset by higher pension funding.
Moving down the cash flow statement. Investing cash flows were $129 million used in the quarter and a $703 million use for the full year. For the full year, we spent $452 million on CapEx and $340 million on acquisition. Cash from financing was a use of $297 million in the fourth quarter and $1.6 billion for the year. Included in that full year amount is $1.07 billion spent on share repurchases and $313 million used for preferred and common stock dividend.
Now I'll quickly cover our capital structure. We ended the year with $7.7 billion in debt, which excludes approximately $75 million in capital lease obligations related to our ITO business, which were reclassified to a discontinued operations liability account. Applying 7 to 1 leverage on customer financing assets, our allocated financing debt at year end was $4.2 billion, leaving core debt of $3.5 billion.
We manage our core debt to maintain a leverage ratio consistent with our investment-grade ratings. Our financing debt has come down over the past few years driven by finance receivable transactions as well as lower origination.
During 2015, we have 2 tranches of debt coming due, about $1 billion in February and $250 million in June. We continue to be comfortable with our leverage position and we plan to refinance these notes during 2015, which will result in our year-end debt being roughly flat at about $7.7 billion. So our capital structure remains stable. And if we move to the next slide, I'll review where we're at in terms of capital allocation.
During 2014, we returned close to $1.4 billion to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends. This equates to approximately 85% of our free cash flow for the year. Those numbers include $1.07 billion of share repurchases and approximately $300 million of dividends. We also spent a total of $340 million on acquisitions. That's $185 million higher year-over-year, but shy of our target of up to $500 million. We obviously have more work to do here, and we're focused on concentrating on a bit larger deals as well as adding more resources into this area.
For 2015, our capital allocation plan is unchanged, and it reflects the redeployment of the expected net proceeds of roughly $850 million from the ITO sale. On share repurchase, we plan to spend about $1 billion repurchasing stock in 2015. We continue to view our shares as an attractive price and it's a good investment.
On acquisitions, we expect to spend up to $900 million. In keeping with our portfolio management strategy, we're looking to acquire companies that will expand our capabilities in attractive service areas as well as to extend our global reach in Services.
As I mentioned on debt, we're comfortable with our leverage position and expect to end the year roughly flat at $7.7 billion. And finally, on dividends. We're announcing today a 12% increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.07 per share. This will result in spend of just over $300 million, with share repurchases effectively self-funding most of the increase.
Before I turn it back to Ursula, I'd like to summarize our expectations for the full year as well as the first quarter. As Ursula mentioned, we've seen a sharp movement in currencies around the world in the last 45 days. Where we normally offset modest currency impacts, the dramatic nature of this move creates almost $100 million of profit exposure year-over-year. Most significant to us, in the short time the euro weakens by about 10% versus the dollar and 9% versus the yen and the Canadian dollars weaken 7% against the dollar. These currency moves cause both negative translation and transaction impacts. While we continue to look for ways to offset more of this negative impact, we believe it's prudent to capture the current exposure by revising our guidance.
Let me walk you through the details on where we're at on full year guidance, and then I'll cover the first quarter. On revenue, our constant currency expectations are unchanged versus what we communicated at our November investor conference. Total company, roughly flat at constant currency; Services, up 2% to 4%, with growth improving as we move through the year; Document Technology, down 4% to 5%, which reflects some improvement as the negative impact of the prior finance receivable sales moderate and we realize more benefit from our product launches late in the second half of last year. However, we now expect currency will have a negative 3- to 4-point impact to revenue for the full year versus flat to about 1 point previously communicated, with Document Technology having a little higher impact and Services a little lower, given the geographic mix of the revenues.
On margins, we continue to target a 50-basis-point improvement year-over-year on Services, which would put us at the middle of our 9% to 10% range. For Document Technology, we continue to expect to be within our 11% to 13% range, but likely more towards the middle of the range, driven by year-over-year increased pension costs that we've talked about previously as well as the negative net currency impact.
As a result of the lower expected revenue at actual currency as well as related pressure on Document Technology margins, we expect the flow-through to impact earnings roughly by $0.06. And as a result, we're lowering our full year adjusted EPS guidance by $0.05 to $1 to $1.06.
Turning to cash flow. The timing of the ITO sale negatively impacts free cash flow as we expect to sell the business in the first half and it produces most of its free cash flow in the second. Additionally, currency impacts our cash, presenting another headwind. We expect to offset some of this impact in 2015 and incremental M&A should offset the ITO impact next year. Net-net, we're bringing down our operating cash flow guidance by $200 million to $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion and our free cash flow down $100 million to $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion.
Now to first quarter guidance. In Document Technology, we anticipate revenue declines to be down mid-single digits in constant currency with the actual results about 4 points lower given currency rates, particularly the weakening of the euro and Canadian dollar. We expect Q1 Document Technology to continue to deliver very strong margins, but seasonally, they'll be lower and below last year's 12.2%, driven mainly by higher noncash pension expense as well as negative currency impact.
In Services. Constant currency revenue growth will be at the low end of our 2% to 4% full year guidance range, driven by tougher compares, expected timing of ramping award at new business and slower Document Outsourcing growth. We expect currency to have about a 3 point negative impact. We expect margins to be seasonally lower but up modestly year-over-year.
At the consolidated level for the first quarter, we expect revenue will be down 1 to 2 points at constant currency, with 3 to 4 points of negative currency impact. Adjusted earnings per share is expected to be $0.20 to $0.22, which includes approximately $0.02 of restructuring. The decline versus $0.26 last year is driven by higher noncash pension expense, adverse currency, higher OID given a prior year gain on asset sale as well as a higher tax rate, 26% planned this year versus 20% last year. That's partially offset by improvement in Services' operational performance as well as lower share count.
Overall, we're making progress in our core business operation, and we'll be working hard to offset the pressure we're seeing from currency.
With that, I'll hand it back to you, Ursula."

Our Services business is now better positioned for future growth. We know 2015 is already bringing some headwinds. As we mentioned earlier, we are watching the unprecedented movements in currencies, especially the euro, as Kathy outlined. But as always, we will manage with a disciplined approach. We'll work hard and make the necessary adjustments to our operations. Our commitment remains the same and our diversified portfolio and strong cash flow, combined with our operating model, guides our priorities.
In Services, building on the momentum to increase sales and profits through portfolio management, improved productivity and excellent offerings.

And as we pivot forward towards 2015, organizationally, changing our go-to-market approach focused by industry and putting together operating capabilities that go across the company in order to help us to drive further productivity enhancement. One of the factors was clearly our overall government health care solutions business stabilizing for us that came in, I would say, very consistent with our expectations. And our overall margins came in consistent with our expectations as well. So we feel good about the fact that our government health care business is performing a little bit better.

Our expectation is we would look to kind of flow that over in trying to accomplish more in the first quarter of 2016. We've already announced that we're going to do roughly $1 billion in share repurchases this quarter.

If that goes the other way with what's going on in some of the economies you serve, I was wondering if the guidance actually had offsets for if that goes the other direction, and then I had a quick follow-up."

And so we're taking that into account then as we look at what the year-over-year changes are expected to be. So my commentary around they were -- as we steer our guidance margin of 11% to 13% back at the investor conference, I would have been more bullish on the higher end of that range versus now talking about coming down towards the middle. That's taking into account, Ben, both the fact that bad debt will be a year-over-year headwind for us, right? We expect bad debt overall, I'll call it, the rate of bad debt to continue to be just fine. It's improved over the last couple of years and that should continue. But certainly, we had a phenomenal 2014 in terms of what the overall bad debt expense is. And so we're reflecting that in our margin guidance."

Absolutely. But that's part of our design and sourcing model, and you should not need to expect any degradation as a result of winning that business. We want to win it.

And so that's really about getting the share repurchases deployed and getting the M&A accomplished as well as, I'd say, offsetting some of the friction costs associated with the transaction, sort of stranded costs that we then need to attack. And so we're still absolutely there in terms of impacting -- offsetting that impact. The second question you asked was really sort of about currency and our ability to offset the currency impact. Embedded in our guidance for 2015 already is an expectation we're going to offset a little bit of that impact. So you heard me in my prepared remarks say it's worth a little over $0.06. We're bringing down our EPS guidance by $0.05. So we're expecting that we're going to drive harder to offset some of that impact, and it's built-in already."

I mean, not on the ITO contracts themselves, which were big contracts for us, and we really have found in the -- I guess, we're 30 days plus, 40 days. We have a very good customer reaction. So as we go around with our clients and say our future delivery model includes Atos as a delivery partner, as a piece of this delivery ecosystem, I do not view it as something that's going to compromise or put us at a competitive disadvantage.

Clearly, we've said we think we'll be able to offset some of the currency impacts in 2015, reflected in the guidance that we gave with respect to free cash flow. But the company is an incredibly, I'd say, solid and consistent cash flow producer. And the sale of the ITO business is really just a modest transitory impact on cash flow. I'm not going to try and call where currencies go in 2016. But obviously, we're going to do everything that we can to offset the currency impact as much as possible. Overall, with regard to pension, we're increasing our pension funding this year by about $50 million. I would expect our pension funding start to stabilize at that point, unless there's an opportunity to do something more materially with our pension, which at this point, I don't necessarily see. So I think the overall factors around our cash flow are very solid. And we've reduced it at the moment for some transitory issues, but I wouldn't expect those to last forever."

Today we are reporting fourth quarter and full year 2014 earnings. A lot has happened in the last 90 days and overall, we are pleased with where we ended the year. We're reporting solid results that in some places exceeded expectations. I'll give a quick overview of our financials, provide some perspective on the year and share updates on key initiatives contributing to our results before turning it over to Kathy to go into more detail on the financials.
We delivered strong profit and cash for the year, and we closed strong in Services revenue and margin. Services revenue growth improved through the year and we saw improved margin performance. Services signings increased as well, driven by renewals in BPO, and we ended the year with strong Document Outsourcing signings of over $1 billion. In fact, our Canadian operation closed its largest ever multimillion dollar MPS deal with the government of Canada in November.
In Document Technology, we delivered strong margin throughout the year, reflecting both our continued focus on profitability as well as a favorable environment. And for the fifth consecutive year, we are the leader in equipment sale revenue. Demand has been strong for our iGen and the new Versant products in the U.S. and Europe. These products provide our Graphic Communications customers with the ability to produce digital color prints at scale with a high level of personalization, quality and reliability.
As you know, Xerox has been focusing on the segments where we have the most competitive advantage, and we've been steadily shifting our portfolio mix. As an example, we announced the pending divestiture of our ITO business through a sale to Atos. This will allow us to focus squarely on business process services and Document Outsourcing and provide additional capacity to invest further in these businesses.
We've aligned our Services go-to-market model into a set of industry teams and our delivery model along functional capabilities such as customer care, human resources, consulting and analytics and transaction processing. We've made progress in improving our government health care business and in 2014, we committed resources to maturing our MMIS enterprise platform. While we still have work to do, the hard work of the team is paying off. We remain bullish about this market and its opportunities for us. Innovation is a differentiator for us now and will continue to be in the future.
Within customer care, we introduced an intelligent virtual customer care agent that can diagnose and resolve customer inquiries in the same way, if not better, than a human agent would. Xerox invested in HealthSPA, a pioneer in patient and provider-driven health care technology. As their exclusive BPO partner, we will support HealthSPA as they provide ground-breaking telehealth to patients at convenient neighborhood locations. It's an important step in the transformation of health care and an exciting place for Xerox to be.
In the second half, the Document Technology team launched 20 new products that were well received and are a reminder to the market about innovation power.
We continue to receive recognition from the industry for business and technology leadership. Gartner, Quocirca and others recognize us for our Managed Print and content services, finance and accounting and BPO. Everest Group named Xerox a leader in its service provider landscape, renting for the contact center outsourcing markets for the health care industry. We're feeling good about our progress. We remain focused on being the best partner to our clients and making Xerox a great place to work for our people and delivering value to our investors.
 
Now let's take a look at the results in more detail. We delivered earnings just above our range and grew margin in both our segments and on a total Xerox basis. We're reporting adjusted EPS of $0.31 and GAAP EPS of $0.26. Profit improved this quarter as we made progress in Services. Services margin improved in the fourth quarter to 9.8%, and we continue to benefit from a favorable environment and strong operational management in Document Technology.
On the revenue side. The improved growth in Services to 3% in the quarter is notable, especially considering the impact from the loss of the Texas Medicaid contract. Document Technology revenue declined in line with recent trends. Acquisitions remain a key aspect of our portfolio management strategy. For the full year 2014, we invested almost $350 million in acquisitions. We are focused on enhancing our Services offerings and expanding our global reach. We have a goal in 2015 to get more done on this front, up to $900 million in acquisitions, with part of those funds coming from the sale of our ITO business.
With that objective in mind, we closed on 1 modestly sized acquisition since the beginning of the year, Intrepid Learning Systems, which include the service to ensure company's employees are equipped with the latest skills and knowledge to improve their business performance. And underpinning our results and business model is strong cash generation. We closed the quarter with $850 million in cash from operations and over $2 billion for the year. This supported our acquisitions activity on growing dividends and share repurchases. In fact, we announced today a 12% increase in our annual dividend rate to $0.28 per share.
Now shifting ahead to 2015. Our results will be impacted by the recent volatility in foreign currencies. As a result, we have adjusted 2015 guidance to reflect these headwinds. Kathy will go into greater detail on currency in just a moment.
With that, I'll turn it over to Kathy, then I'll wrap up and we'll open the call to your questions. Kathy?"

We were pleased with the progress we made this quarter. Both Services revenue growth and margin improved. And with the announcement of the planned sale of our ITO business to Atos, we took a key step in our portfolio management strategy. In addition, our Document Technology business continued to deliver strong profitability. The positive results in Services and Document Technology yielded earnings higher than our expectations and strong cash flow.
I'll cover the segments in cash flow in a moment. But first, let me walk through our fourth quarter earnings. As noted earlier, with the pending sale of our ITO business, my commentary will be on a continuing operations basis, excluding ITO.
Total revenue in the quarter was down 3% at actual currency and 1% at constant currency. This compares to down 2% at both actual and constant currency in the third quarter. Underlying constant currency growth improved from the third quarter driven by better Services performance. And as expected, we saw the impact of actual currency rates turn negative in the quarter.
Gross margin of 32.1% was up 10 basis points year-over-year as the positive benefit in Document Technology from productivity initiatives, currency and pension expense more than offset the greater mix of Services at a lower margin.  RD&E was modestly lower year-over-year as increased investments in Services were more than offset by reductions in Document Technology. SAG was lower in both segments as we benefited from productivity initiatives as well as lower bad debt and pension expenses. These improvements resulted in our fourth quarter operating margin increasing 100 basis points year-over-year and operating profit growth of almost 7%. And for the full year, operating profit improved $72 million and operating margin was up 60 basis points.
Moving down the income statement. Adjusted other net was a $6 million higher expense year-over-year. Lower gains on sale of assets of $20 million and ruble-related currency losses of $5 million were only partially offset by $19 million in lower restructuring costs. For the full year, a tough compare resulted in adjusted other net expense coming in $102 million higher. In 2013, we realized greater benefits from transaction gains and other nonoperational below the line credit. In addition, restructuring charges were $13 million higher this year.
Our equity income was $41 million in the fourth quarter, down $2 million year-over-year driven by the impact of negative translation currency. Our fourth quarter adjusted tax rate of 25.3% was up about 1 percentage point year-over-year and within our guidance of 23% to 27%.
Adjusted EPS of $0.31 was $0.04 higher year-over-year driven by operating profit growth and lower share count. For the full year, adjusted EPS of $1.07 was $0.03 higher as operating profit growth and lower share count were partially offset by higher adjusted other net expense.
I'll now move to the Services segment slide to review those results in a little bit more detail.
Services revenue grew 1% and was up 3% at constant currency, which was 2 points better, sequentially. Within Services, at constant currency, BPO growth increased to 4% from 2% in the third quarter, with good growth in commercial health care payer, electronic tolling, litigation services and international.
Document Outsourcing was up 1% year-over-year at constant currency, a modest improvement from the third quarter, but under our segment growth objectives. We're beginning to see good traction from our next-generation MPS offerings, and we're encouraged by the good signings in the quarter. Overall, in Services, we're making progress improving growth. And we continue to expect 2% to 4% constant currency Services growth this year. Our growth rate will be lower in the first half, reflecting the impact from the Texas Medicaid contract loss last year, slower first half Document Outsourcing growth and expected ramp timing for a couple of large new business contract awards. The Texas loss creates a headwind of about 150 basis points until we lap it in August.
Total signings in the quarter were up 20%, driven by strong growth in renewals, including the large BPO contract renewal that I referenced last quarter which helped to drive a strong BPO renewal rate of 93%. BPO new business was light as we're still working towards signed and approved contracts for the New York Medicaid and Florida tolling new business awards. We're getting closer on both and continue to expect them to sign in the first half.
Our sales force is now aligned to a specific industry vertical, and we're investing in increased sales coverage and training. These actions will positively impact new business signings as we move through 2015.
Document Outsourcing signings of $1 billion were the highest in recent history with good growth on both the renewal and new business side. So a good signings quarter for Document Outsourcing, we should enable growth to pick up by the middle of the year.
Shifting to profitability. Segment margin was 9.8% in the fourth quarter, which was up 70 basis points sequentially, up 10 basis points year-over-year and towards the higher end of our targeted 9% to 10% range. We're making progress on our Services initiatives and improving execution. In BPO, we saw multiple lines of business contribute to the year-over-year profit improvement and Document Outsourcing margins remained strong. Our results in government health care were in line with our expectation, and we're seeing positive results from our investments to mature the platform and improve our operational performance. We're confident we're on the right track and we started some work ahead of finalizing the New York Medicaid contract to ensure we get off to the right start there.
In 2015, our focus will be on accelerating growth and driving a solid 50 basis points of margin improvement year-over-year. In summary, the fourth quarter was the strongest quarter of the year for Services, both in terms of growth and margin. And we're taking the actions required to hit our targeted 2015 core operating results.
With that, I'll now turn to Document Technology. Fourth quarter total revenue in Document Technology was in line with our expectations, with constant currency results down 6%, which was consistent with the full year rate of decline. As expected, the impact of actual currency rate turned on us this quarter with a negative 2-point impact. Equipment revenue declines were higher driven by weakness in Eurasia, reflecting the volatility in Russia's economy as well as the timing of large account sales. The decline in annuity revenue moderated a bit sequentially, driven by modestly higher supply demand and a more favorable compare given the prior year channel inventory reduction. Similar to last quarter, the finance receivable sales in the prior year was almost a 1 point negative impact to revenue growth.
From a geographic perspective, the U.S. and Europe were relatively stable while developing markets outside of Russia was a positive contributor to results.
Looking at our product groups. High-end remains the best-performing subsegment, reporting annuity growth at constant currency for the third quarter in a row. We saw good traction from the recent launch of our new Versant entry production color product as well as good growth in  our iGen product family. Mid-range color activity was relatively flat and consistent with the third quarter as we continue to lap our ConnectKey launch from last year. Mono declined in line with industry trends. Entry A4 activity was lower year-over-year given weakness in Eurasia as well as the timing of our entry product refresh. We launched 11 new products late in the third quarter and early in the fourth. Market reception's been positive, but the timing caused us to only catch a partial benefit in the quarter.
Profitability was quite strong. Our Q4 margins came in above our expectations at 14.4%, resulting in segment profit growth of 14%. This strong performance reflects benefits from restructuring and productivity initiatives, positive transaction currencies that more than offset negative translation impact and lower bad debt expense as well as lower pension expense. So another solid quarter for Document Technology.
Now I'm going to turn to cash flow. Before I go through the cash flow, I'd like to make 1 comment related to the announced ITO sale. Our GAAP net income includes a noncash loss triggered by the pending sale of the ITO business of approximately $180 million, driven mainly by goodwill allocated to that business. You can see the losses added back further down in the cash flow statement. So net-net, there's no cash flow impact.
Moving on, our cash flow from operations was $857 million in the quarter and a little over $2 billion for the year, which was just above our range. As expected, cash flow in the quarter and full year were lower solely due to the impact from finance receivable sales in prior years versus no sales this -- in '14.
Looking at the full year. Underlying cash flow, which excludes the impact from prior finance receivable sales, was $2.5 billion and compares to $2.1 billion in 2013. The largest driver of the year-over-year improvement in underlying cash flow was a reduction in net working capital resulting from both performance and timing factors, including lower DSO and improved year end collections, especially in Services, improved terms with a few key vendors as well as seasonal smoothing of working capital. Additionally, we have higher runoff from our underlying finance receivables associated with lower originations as well as lower equipment revenue. These year-over-year benefits were partially offset by higher pension funding.
Moving down the cash flow statement. Investing cash flows were $129 million used in the quarter and a $703 million use for the full year. For the full year, we spent $452 million on CapEx and $340 million on acquisition. Cash from financing was a use of $297 million in the fourth quarter and $1.6 billion for the year. Included in that full year amount is $1.07 billion spent on share repurchases and $313 million used for preferred and common stock dividend.
Now I'll quickly cover our capital structure. We ended the year with $7.7 billion in debt, which excludes approximately $75 million in capital lease obligations related to our ITO business, which were reclassified to a discontinued operations liability account. Applying 7 to 1 leverage on customer financing assets, our allocated financing debt at year end was $4.2 billion, leaving core debt of $3.5 billion.
We manage our core debt to maintain a leverage ratio consistent with our investment-grade ratings. Our financing debt has come down over the past few years driven by finance receivable transactions as well as lower origination.
During 2015, we have 2 tranches of debt coming due, about $1 billion in February and $250 million in June. We continue to be comfortable with our leverage position and we plan to refinance these notes during 2015, which will result in our year-end debt being roughly flat at about $7.7 billion. So our capital structure remains stable. And if we move to the next slide, I'll review where we're at in terms of capital allocation.
During 2014, we returned close to $1.4 billion to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends. This equates to approximately 85% of our free cash flow for the year. Those numbers include $1.07 billion of share repurchases and approximately $300 million of dividends. We also spent a total of $340 million on acquisitions. That's $185 million higher year-over-year, but shy of our target of up to $500 million. We obviously have more work to do here, and we're focused on concentrating on a bit larger deal as well as adding more resources into this area.
For 2015, our capital allocation plan is unchanged, and it reflects the redeployment of the expected net proceeds of roughly $850 million from the ITO sale. On share repurchase, we plan to spend about $1 billion repurchasing stock in 2015. We continue to view our shares as an attractive price and it's a good investment.
On acquisitions, we expect to spend up to $900 million. In keeping with our portfolio management strategy, we're looking to acquire companies that will expand our capabilities in attractive service areas as well as to extend our global reach in Services.
As I mentioned on debt, we're comfortable with our leverage position and expect to end the year roughly flat at $7.7 billion. And finally, on dividends. We're announcing today a 12% increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.07 per share. This will result in spend of just over $300 million, with share repurchases effectively self-funding most of the increase.
Before I turn it back to Ursula, I'd like to summarize our expectations for the full year as well as the first quarter. As Ursula mentioned, we've seen a sharp movement in currencies around the world in the last 45 days. Where we'd normally offset modest currency impacts, the dramatic nature of this move creates almost $100 million of profit exposure year-over-year. Most significant to us, in the short time the euro's weakened by about 10% versus the dollar and 9% versus the yen and the Canadian dollar has weakened 7% against the dollar. These currency moves cause both negative translation and transaction impacts. While we continue to look for ways to offset more of this negative impact, we believe it's prudent to capture the current exposure by revising our guidance.
Let me walk you through the details on where we're at on full year guidance, and then I'll cover the first quarter. On revenue, our constant currency expectations are unchanged versus what we communicated at our November investor conference. Total company, roughly flat at constant currency; Services, up 2% to 4%, with growth improving as we move through the year; Document Technology, down 4% to 5%, which reflects some improvement as the negative impact of the prior finance receivable sales moderate and we realize more benefit from our product launches late in the second half of last year. However, we now expect currency will have a negative 3- to 4-point impact to revenue for the full year versus flat to about 1 point previously communicated, with Document Technology having a little higher impact and Services a little lower, given the geographic mix of the revenues.
On margins, we continue to target a 50-basis-point improvement year-over-year on Services, which would put us at the middle of our 9% to 10% range. For Document Technology, we continue to expect to be within our 11% to 13% range, but likely more towards the middle of the range, driven by year-over-year increased pension costs that we've talked about previously as well as the negative net currency impact.
As a result of the lower expected revenue at actual currency as well as related pressure on Document Technology margins, we expect the flow-through to impact earnings roughly by $0.06. And as a result, we're lowering our full year adjusted EPS guidance by $0.05 to $1 to $1.06.
Turning to cash flow. The timing of the ITO sale negatively impacts free cash flow as we expect to sell the business in the first half and it produces most of its free cash flow in the second. Additionally, currency impacts our cash, presenting another headwind. We expect to offset some of this impact in 2015 and incremental M&A should offset the ITO impact next year. Net-net, we're bringing down our operating cash flow guidance by $200 million to $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion and our free cash flow down $100 million to $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion.
Now to first quarter guidance. In Document Technology, we anticipate revenue declines to be down mid-single digits in constant currency with the actual results about 4 points lower given currency rates, particularly the weakening of the euro and Canadian dollar. We expect Q1 Document Technology to continue to deliver very strong margins, but seasonally, they'll be lower and below last year's 12.2%, driven mainly by higher noncash pension expense as well as negative currency impact.
In Services. Constant currency revenue growth will be at the low end of our 2% to 4% full year guidance range, driven by tougher compares, expected timing of ramping award at new business and slower Document Outsourcing growth. We expect currency to have about a 3 point negative impact. We expect margins to be seasonally lower but up modestly year-over-year.
At the consolidated level for the first quarter, we expect revenue will be down 1 to 2 points at constant currency, with 3 to 4 points of negative currency impact. Adjusted earnings per share is expected to be $0.20 to $0.22, which includes approximately $0.02 of restructuring. The decline versus $0.26 last year is driven by higher noncash pension expense, adverse currency, higher OID given a prior year gain on asset sale as well as a higher tax rate, 26% planned this year versus 20% last year. That's partially offset by improvement in Services' operational performance as well as lower share count.
Overall, we're making progress in our core business operation, and we'll be working hard to offset the pressure we're seeing from currency.
With that, I'll hand it back to you, Ursula."

I would say we're seeing already better cross-selling opportunities. So as we go to market and we've moved out of our large number of independent business units and we have a sales force that has a broader responsibility of all the offerings set to those clients, we're seeing better cross-selling opportunities. We had the whole team together for a big sales kickoff, and I think that, that's off to a fair start. I would say relative to pipeline, as you saw from our release, our overall pipeline numbers are down marginally. There's a lot of moving parts relative to pipeline with taking ITO out and trying to count once validated as opposed to just earlier in the cycle once noticed. But I would expect our pipeline to grow during the year as a result of the sales force additions and the focus on customers in vertical markets."

So Bob certainly would tell you it's something that's a top priority in the businesspeople, so we're working collectively across the organization in order to make this happen. Finally, on timing. We recognize that this is a big step up for us in 2015 in terms of what we're trying to accomplish, right? By the way, the incremental money not coming in the door until the middle of the year, right? So just a note for folks on that. And so there is a possibility that we won't get 100% of the $900 million spend this year. Our expectation is we would look to kind of flow that over in trying to accomplish more in the first quarter of 2016. We've already announced that we're going to do roughly $1 billion in share repurchases this year. We ended the year with a strong cash balance to enable us to again be kind of more consistent in terms of being in the market consistently. So that's what we expect to do with the money, and we're all working hard to get it deployed as fast as possible."

And so we're still absolutely there in terms of impacting -- offsetting that impact. The second question you asked was really about sort of currency and our ability to offset the currency impact. Embedded in our guidance for 2015 already is an expectation we're going to offset a little bit of that impact. So you heard me in my prepared remarks say it's worth a little over $0.06.

So as we go around with our clients and say our future delivery model includes Atos as a delivery partner, as a piece of this delivery ecosystem, I do not view it as something that's going to compromise or put us at a competitive disadvantage.

I'm not going to try and call where currencies go in 2016. But obviously, we're going to do everything that we can to offset the currency impact as much as possible. Overall, with regard to pension, we're increasing our pension funding this year by about $50 million. I would expect our pension funding starts to stabilize at that point, unless there's an opportunity to do something more materially with our pension, which at this point, I don't necessarily see.

And so that had, in the third and the fourth quarter, about 1 point of negative impact in 2014. So we will get an easier comp towards the back half of the year. From a foreign currency perspective on Doc Tech, with regard to top line, translation impacts to top line happen immediately, right? The flip side of that is what's going on in transaction impacts. The transaction impacts don't hit us immediately as a result of our hedging program. So that's a little bit more back half. It gets worse relative to front half as a result. That's obviously a profit and a margin constraint as opposed to a revenue constraint. So hopefully, that gives you a little bit of color."

Today we reported our first quarter results and provided full year guidance, lowering expectations.

Today we reported our first quarter results and provided full year guidance, lowering expectations. I'll start with a brief reminder of our direction and then provide an overview of our Q1 performance. Kathy will review the financials and then we'll take your questions.
Our diversified portfolio, strong annuity business and solid cash flow enabled us to participate and invest in attractive markets that will drive growth. Services represents 56% of a total revenue, and we expect that proportion to continue to grow. We are the leader in diversified business process services, and we are maintaining leadership in Document Technology.
Over the last few years we have taken significant steps to lay the foundation for sustainable long-term success. We are differentiating ourselves by incorporating greater automation and intelligence in our solutions and products, all with the goal of helping our clients better manage their critical business processes.
As an example, we recently launched the readmission forecaster, an advanced analytics healthcare solution to help hospitals drive quality improvement around patient care and reduce Medicare penalties for excess hospital readmissions. Additionally, we introduced our new mobility analytics platform, which makes it significantly easier for transport and parking operators to understand and even predict commuter needs.
Lindsay Park, the world's leading parking space provider, is testing the system in a town in the suburbs of Paris.
Within Document Technology, we retained our #1 position in equipment revenue market share for the 21st straight quarter, and we launched 8 new products plus workflow solutions, reinforcing our leadership in mobile printing, inkjet technology and digital color.
Lastly, our solid balance sheet and strong free cash flow, along with the proceeds from the pending ITO divestiture, will enable us to continue to deliver strong shareholder returns. We have returned more than 50% of free cash flow to shareholders over the last 4 years and plan to do the same this year by repurchasing up to $1 billion in shares and returning approximately $300 million to shareholders in dividends.
At the same time, we will continue to invest in our business organically and through acquisitions.
And let's look at our performance in the quarter. In the first quarter, we reported total revenue of $4.5 billion, down 6%, 2% in constant currency. And we delivered adjusted earnings per share of $0.21. Earnings were in line with our guidance, but the performance of our Services business was below our expectations, principally because of implementation issues in certain legacy Health Enterprise platform accounts.
It's important to note that many areas of our Services business performed quite well in the quarter. This includes Document Outsourcing and several of our commercial vertical industry groups. We continue to perform well in commercial healthcare.
As many of you may have seen, we finalized the New York Medicaid contract that we were awarded last year. We have invested in advance to ensure our good start, and we look forward to working with the state to serve their Medicaid population.
That said, in Services we have more work to do to improve our financial performance. We continue to align our go-to-market resources along vertical industries, and we're investing in sales coverage and training. At the same time, we're focused on driving more consistent delivery and capturing efficiencies through our new operating model. And specifically within our Health Enterprise accounts, we have taken action to address the issues. We continue to add expertise in the most critical areas of this business. Our operating performance and delivery quantity continue to improve, and I'm confident in the Services and Healthcare teams.
Kathy will go into more detail in the financials in a moment, and we can have additional discussion during the Q&A.
Our Document Technology results, which included the increased impact from foreign currency, largely met our expectations. It continues to be a business where we generate strong profits and cash. In quarter 1, we delivered shareholder value by repurchasing shares, supporting our dividend program and acquiring Intrepid Learning Systems to enhance our services capabilities.
Now I'll turn it over to Kathy, who will provide more details on the quarter and cover guidance."
103599,290034143,794280,"Xerox Corporation, Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2015",2015-04-24,"Earnings Calls","Xerox Holdings Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Ursula, and good morning, everyone. We delivered Q1 EPS in the middle of our range with solid cash flow of $113 million. However, as Ursula mentioned, the quarter was challenging in many respects. Some challenges have been contemplated such as neg",2471,"Thanks, Ursula, and good morning, everyone. We delivered Q1 EPS in the middle of our range with solid cash flow of $113 million. However, as Ursula mentioned, the quarter was challenging in many respects. Some challenges have been contemplated such as negative currency impacts, higher pension expense and in Services, the timing of investments relative to improved productivity from our global capability. However, we failed to accurately call the incremental financial pressure we're experiencing in our government health care business from the rollout of our Health Enterprise Medicaid platform. Our delivery quality and operating performance continue to improve, but the financials were a clear signal that we have more work ahead.
I'll take you through more details on that when I cover the Services segment, but first let me walk you through the total company results for the quarter.
Total revenue in the quarter was down 6% at actual currency and 2% in constant currency as growth in Services was offset by declines in Document Technology. The negative currency impact of 4 points in the quarter was at the high end of our expectation and reflected the continued strengthening of the dollar within the quarter.
Gross margin of 31.2% was down 30 basis points year-over-year driven by Services.
RD&E was modestly lower year-over-year driven by reductions in Document Technology. SAG in absolute dollar terms was lower year-over-year driven by currency. However, as a percent of revenue, SAG was up 70 basis points year-over-year to 20.5% as productivity benefits where more than offset by higher pension expense and the investments in Services.
As a result, our first quarter operating margin decreased 110 basis points year-over-year and operating profit declined 18%, with the largest drivers being pension expense, the financial pressure from our Health Enterprise implementation and currency.
Moving down the income statement. Adjusted other net expense was $5 million lower year-over-year. Within that, lower gains on sales of assets and higher currency losses were offset by lower restructuring costs and lower interest expense. Equity income was $34 million in the quarter, down $8 million year-over-year driven by the impact of negative translation currency. Our Q1 adjusted tax rate of 24.5% was at the low end of our range and up 4 percentage points year-over-year.
Adjusted EPS of $0.21 was at the midpoint of our guidance and $0.05 lower year-over-year driven by the operating profit decline.
I'll now move to Services segment to review those results in a little more detail. Services revenue declined 3% and was up 1% at constant currency, which was a bit shy of where expect it to come in. Document Outsourcing constant currency growth of 2% was in line with our expectation. BPO growth of 1% at constant currency was a bit light of what we were targeting with the Health Enterprise platform implementation producing less revenue than we had anticipated.
We continue to see good BPO growth in commercial health care and other commercial industry verticals. We anticipate our revenue growth rate will improve in the second half as we lap the impact of last year's larger contract losses and begin to ramp the New York Medicaid and Florida tolling deal. M&A also remains a variable factor to growth depending on timing of acquisition.
Our renewal rate in the quarter was 91%, evidence that overall, we're delivering well for our client. I should note that we are now including Document Outsourcing in our renewal rate in addition to BPO.
Overall, it was a really strong renewal quarter.
Total signings in the quarter were down 13%, driven by both lower new business signings and lower renewal opportunities. New business signings declined 26% year-over-year. We mentioned on our last call that we've aligned our sales force to specific industry verticals. We recently moved our Document Outsourcing sales force into the same structure to better enable cross-selling opportunities.
We are continuing to invest and increase sales coverage and training, which takes time to yield results and should positively impact new business signings as we move through 2015. Additionally, our signings did not include the New York Medicaid contract, which was finalized after the end of the quarter, and the new Florida tolling contract, which is still pending. These new signings will reverse the downward signings trend this quarter.
Turning to margin. Segment margin was 7.5% in the quarter, which was down 110 basis points year-over-year and well below our objective of modest year-over-year improvement.
As referenced earlier, the driver of the Services margin mix was lower revenue and more cost than anticipated with our Health Enterprise platform implementation. California had the largest impact on our results in the quarter. We successfully implemented the first phase at the end of last year. However, recent estimate to deliver the remaining phases are higher. We also had startup cost in New York with no revenue offset as the contract didn't get finalized until April.
Margin excluding those impacts would have been up 10 basis points year-over-year, so a very modest improvement. We saw margin improvements in a number of lines of business, including Document Outsourcing as well as some of our commercial verticals. At the same time, we're continuing to invest in our industry and capability operating model, sales coverage and training as well as some new offerings, which Ursula discussed. 
As we move through the year, we expect to see our investments mature and produce more value. We should also see further productivity gains as we roll out our initiative across our operating groups.
Before moving on, I'm going to take a minute to further discuss the financial challenges we're facing in our Health Enterprise implementation.
With the exception of the New York Medicaid contract, these deals were signed before we finished development of the core software platform. We had to wait finishing the new platform and meeting client delivery date, resulting in cost increases.
In the case of California, as the new project plan was built out further, we recognized that the cost to complete the entire program would increase, which triggered an adjustment in the quarter. In contrast, New York was bid at after the Health Enterprise platform was completed, and we've been investing ahead to position us for a strong start.
Operationally, the platform is performing well in the states where it's been rolled out, and we're progressing on the implementations in other states. However, we have more work ahead to turn around the financial performance.
We're taking a number of additional actions to improve the picture and have adjusted our expectation to reflect what we believe is required to meet our customer commitment. This is the main driver of our revised Services margin guidance, which I'll get to in more detail when I review guidance in a few minutes.
Now I'm going to turn to Document Technology. Document Technology revenue in the quarter was largely in line with our guidance with adverse currency coming in at the high end of our expectation. On a constant-currency basis, revenue was down 6%, which was consistent with last year's rate of decline. Currency was a 4-point dragged on revenue, with revenue at actual currency down 10%. While we don't typically include developing markets in our constant currency calculation, we are impacted when currencies devalue quickly. In the first quarter, revenue at constant currency would have been down 5% if we excluded the impact of currency on developing markets.
Relative to our performance in the fourth quarter, we saw some moderation of equipment revenue decline at constant currency as we began to see some benefits from the second half 2014 new product launches. Offsetting this were modestly worse annuity revenue declines, driven by supplies revenue decline in the entry segment.
Looking at entry. It continues to be impacted by economic weakness and uncertainty in developing markets, especially Eurasia and Brazil. We anticipate some improvement in the rate of declines as benefit from new products grow. But overall, we continue to expect economic headwind to weigh on entry.
Mid-range mono and color activity were relatively flat year-over-year and overall, mid-range results showed improvement. High-end continues to show good annuity revenue performance, although equipment was weaker in the quarter driven by the timing of new product launches as well as a couple of deals slipping into the second quarter.
Document Technology margins were down 110 basis points with almost the entire decline driven by higher pension expense. As previously discussed, the higher pension expense this year is a function of higher pension settlement given lower discount rates as well as last year's mortality table change.
So overall, core Document Tech business performance continues to be strong, and we're focused improving top line by capitalizing on our growth opportunities in the market.
Before I go through the cash flow, I'd like to remind everyone that while our ITO results are included in discontinued operations pending the sale to Atos, ITO s still in our operating cash flow until we close the transaction. ITO was a use of $13 million in the quarter and a use of $32 million in free cash flow.
Overall, cash flow from operations was $113 million in the quarter, solidly positive and reflecting the progress that we've made smoothing working capital impact over the past couple of years.
A couple of highlights to note within operating cash flow. The add-back for depreciation is lower than last year by about $50 million and reflects, in part, the write-down of the carrying value of the ITO assets to fair value now that it's being held for sale.
Working capital is a use of cash, which is consistent with our normal seasonality and largely consistent with 2014. Inventory was a larger use this year, reflecting a higher level of in-transit inventory and timing of sales. Additionally, accounts receivable was a higher use this year, primarily due to the strong fourth quarter collections, particularly in Services.
Moving down the cash flow statement. Investing cash flows where a $98 million use, including $95 million spent on CapEx in the quarter and $28 million on acquisition.
Cash flow from financing was a use of $485 million, which included net debt payments of approximately $150 million, $216 million spent on share repurchases and $76 million used for preferred and common stock dividends.
Now I'm going to quickly go over our capital structure. We ended the first quarter with $7.6 billion in debt. During the quarter, we retired $1 billion in senior notes and issued $400 million in 5-year notes with a coupon of 2.75% and $250 million in 20-year notes with a coupon of 4.8%.
Applying 7 to 1 [ph] leverage on customer financing assets, our allocated financing debt at the end of the first quarter was $3.9 billion, leaving core debt of $3.7 billion. We manage our core debt to maintain credit metrics consistent with our investment-grade rating, so our capital structure remains pretty stable.
If we go onto the next slide, I'll review where we're at in terms of capital allocation.
Our capital allocation plans for the year are unchanged and as previously communicated, incorporates the redeployments of the expected net proceeds of roughly $850 million from the ITO sale, which have closed later this quarter.
On share repurchases. We spent $216 million in the quarter and continued to plan to spend about $1 billion for purchasing stock this year. We continue to view our shares as attractively priced and a good investment.
On acquisitions. We closed 1 acquisition in the quarter, Intrepid Learning Systems, for $28 million. We continue to look to spend up to $900 million in 2015 and plan to roll over any unspent fund into 2016. Acquisitions are a priority for us as we believe it's an important element of our portfolio management strategy to evolve our portfolio to higher-value services as well as supporting BPO expansion internationally.
We're very disciplined in our approach. Our pipeline is strong, and we've actively considered more deals year-to-date than last year. We're working to further build our business development capabilities so we can be more acquisitive and expand our pipeline potential target.
Now onto debt. We have 1 more tranche of debt coming due this year, $250 million in June. We expect debt to temporarily decline in conjunction with the receipt of the ITO proceeds and plan to complete additional refinancing activity as needed in the second half. We continue to expect to end the year at roughly $7.7 billion in debt.
And finally, on dividends. We spent just under $300 million, which contemplates the recent 12% dividend increase we announced on our last earnings call.
Before I turn it back to Ursula, I'd like to summarize our expectations for the second quarter and for the full year.
The second quarter, we expect adjusted EPS in the range of $0.21 to $0.23 with constant currency revenues down about 2 points and currency pressure and top line by another 5 points, reflecting the dollar strengthening a bit from the first quarter.
For Document Technology revenue, we expect the constant currency rate of decline to modestly improve from the first quarter with a negative currency impact of 5 to 6 points. Margins should be within our 11% to 13% for the year, up sequentially but down year-over-year driven by the increased pension costs and currency. For Services, we expect the second quarter year-over-year revenue growth to be roughly flat at constant currency with a negative currency impact of 4 to 5 points. Slow growth reflects softer signings as well as the timing of new contracts ramped versus loss contract runoff and slower acquisition activity.
We anticipate second quarter margins will be approximately flat sequentially, reflecting period compare headwinds in Document Outsourcing, continued higher costs to implement our Health Enterprise platform and incremental investments not yet fully offset by productivity gains.
Document Outsourcing margins continue to be strong with normal year-over-year compares in the second half.
For the full year, at constant currency, we expect Services revenue will now be at the low end of the 2% to 4% range, no change to Document Technology with revenue expected to decline 4% to 5% and total company revenue now expected to be down about 1 point year-over-year.
We expect currency will have a negative 4-point impact to total revenue for the year. We're maintaining our Document Technology margin expectation but reducing our Services margin guidance to 8.5% to 9% due to higher cost within our Health Enterprise implementation and not as much net benefit from enhanced productivity relative to investments.
In total, we expect this to yield adjusted EPS of $0.95 to $1.01.
To conclude, while we are disappointed with the guidance revision, we are making decisions for the long term to ensure that we're taking the necessary actions to drive sustainable growth and margin improvement in the future.
With that, I'll hand it back over to you, Ursula."

Although earnings met expectations, it was a challenging quarter. As Kathy detailed a moment ago, we are lowering our full year guidance. We know we have work to do to achieve sustainable long-term success, and I'm confident in our business strategy, our strong portfolio and our ability to succeed in the many industries that we serve.
Going forward, in Services, we are focused on revenue and margin expansion. Improved signings and executing on our new operating model will help us there.
Document Technology continues to execute well, and we remain focused on leading in the most attractive segments of the market. Overall, we anticipate positive results from the changes we've made, and I'm certain that the actions that we're taking today will ensure a healthy Xerox for tomorrow and beyond.

So we're looking not just do the deal size of the 1 deal that we did this quarter but looking at things that are a little larger, which can make more of a difference for us. We're targeting specific areas. I mean, when you look across our portfolio, we've got a great business in commercial health care, there are places we'd like to continue build out that business. Transportation is an area of target for us. We talked about the continued move into workflow within our Document Outsourcing group, so that's an area. And then as we look to continue to expand internationally, we do need a bigger footprint, and acquisitions can help us in that space as well. So as you can imagine, tough to call. It's tough to call in which quarter we're actually going to land things. But we're certainly generating more activity and looking to do larger deals.

And so if you look at the situation in California, which triggered the adjustment that we took this quarter, we had made a decision with the State of California to do this in a staged implementation rather than a single cutover, right? And that caused us to have to basically kind of restage and rework our project plan. As we got into the further detail of what that was going to costs, right, the cost for the overall implementation went up, and that triggered us to have to take an adjustment this quarter. So we scrubbed much further what that project plan was going to look like. It's the right answer for the client and for us to do a staged implementation. It reduces the risk of execution. But at the end of the day, we now understand that it's going to cost more. And this is a contract that was signed years ago and in advance of our standard platform being completed. If I contrast that done, you asked about New York, New York is very different, because New York we actually did a standard contract, right? In addition to bidding a standard contract, we were awarded this contract last May. We started standing up resources toward the end of the third quarter in order to really get us on the right track with New York. So we're very excited about New York.

Once we get past laying down the platform, which is really complicated and what we did for good, for ugly, but the facts we actually implemented a brand-new platform in these 5 states that readies us for this future of aging and new regulations, et cetera. It's even more challenging than even I would like it to be but it's 1 with many -- with continuous review, we keep coming down on the fact that this is a good business and business that can be profitable, for sure. It is already in the historic account we will just have to make it that way in the new accounts."

Overall, when we talk about investments in Services outside of government health care group, we're investing in things like sales leadership, training, tools, new offerings, this shift to our new industry business groups sort of vertical approach and adding leadership in there. So when we talk about investments, it's clearly outside of the government health care solution business as well. With regard to kind of the staging, so clearly the first quarter, we took a big adjustment in California. As I described, that's a pretty isolated instance. If I look over 2015 for sort of the pattern of what we're expecting in the Health Enterprise accounts, I would describe this as first half sort of heavy on incremental cost and expecting in the second half that we're actually going to get a reasonable amount as pickup. So it's still going to be a drag on the full year basis, right? So if you look at our adjustments to we made overall for our margin, originally the when we gave guidance back in November, we said we thought we were going to get 25 to 50 basis points, largely candidly from these Health Enterprise account improving, right? I would describe that now on a full year basis in our guidance as taking into consideration, we might actually see a little bit of the dilution overall on our margins for the year. So we thought -- we think as we've revised our guidance that we've really taken into consideration that some of these things are tough to call. They're pretty complicated projects, and we need to make sure that we have room if there's any changes, and we've taken that into account."

It will probably be a little bit of a headwind for us in 2015, not a tailwind. So the margin adjustment that we've taken for the full company and for Services that pressure that we're not going to the progress that we wanted to make in government health from a financial perspective. Operationally, the great news about this operationally is that we are doing fairly well, I think, across all of the accounts, just some struggles in maybe one but we're doing fairly well operationally across these accounts."

Going forward, obviously we expect both of those, New York being finalized and Florida, that will help our dynamics to the second quarter. And I think in the second half of the year, the changes that we've made relative to the industry go-to-market model, we have been beefing up the sales force. We're 90% of the key sales positions now filled, that's up from where we were at the time of the investor conference.

And then I would say very modestly, a little bit lighter on investment -- I'm sorry, on productivity relative to investment.

We still believe that the fundamental strategy of a diversified services portfolio globalized, which we are still working on doing, and that's supported by a good level of acquisitions in the areas that we're in. We're doing portfolio management and trimming out things that we're not great at and investing in areas that we're really good. That strategy still holds.

We are the leader in diversified business process services, and we are maintaining leadership in Document Technology.
Over the last few years, we have taken significant steps to lay the foundation for sustainable long-term success. We are differentiating ourselves by incorporating greater automation and intelligence in our solutions and products, all with the goal of helping our clients better manage their critical business processes.
As an example, we recently launched the Midas+ Readmission Forecaster, an advanced analytics health care solution to help hospitals drive quality improvement around patient care and reduce Medicare penalties for excess hospital readmissions. Additionally, we introduced our new Mobility Analytics Platform, which makes it significantly easier for transport and parking operators to understand and even predict commuter needs. VINCI Park, the world's leading parking space provider, is testing the system in a town in the suburbs of Paris.
Within Document Technology, we retained our #1 position in equipment revenue market share for the 21st straight quarter, and we launched 8 new products plus workflow solutions, reinforcing our leadership in mobile printing, inkjet technology and digital color.
Lastly, our solid balance sheet and strong free cash flow, along with the proceeds from the pending ITO divestiture, will enable us to continue to deliver strong shareholder returns. We have returned more than 50% of free cash flow to shareholders over the last 4 years and plan to do the same this year by repurchasing up to $1 billion in shares and returning approximately $300 million to shareholders in dividends. At the same time, we will continue to invest in our business organically and through acquisitions.
Now let's look at our performance in the quarter. In the first quarter, we reported total revenue of $4.5 billion, down 6%, 2% in constant currency. And we delivered adjusted earnings per share of $0.21. Earnings were in line with our guidance, but the performance of our Services business was below our expectations, principally because of implementation issues in certain legacy Health Enterprise platform accounts.
It's important to note that many areas of our Services business performed quite well in the quarter. This includes Document Outsourcing and several of our commercial vertical industry groups. We continued to perform well in Commercial Healthcare.
As many of you may have seen, we finalized the New York Medicaid contract that we were awarded last year. We have invested in advance to ensure our good start, and we look forward to working with the state to serve their Medicaid population.
That said, in Services, we have more work to do to improve our financial performance. We continue to align our go-to-market resources along vertical industries, and we're investing in sale coverage and training. At the same time, we're focused on driving more consistent delivery and capturing efficiencies through our new operating model. 
And specifically within our Health Enterprise accounts, we have taken action to address the issues. We continue to add expertise in the most critical areas of this business. Our operating performance and delivery quality continue to improve, and I'm confident in the Services and health care teams.
Kathy will go into more detail on the financials in a moment, and we can have additional discussion during the Q&A.
Our Document Technology results, which included the increased impact from foreign currency, largely met our expectations. It continues to be a business where we generate strong profits and cash. In quarter 1, we delivered shareholder value by repurchasing shares, supporting our dividend program and acquiring Intrepid Learning Systems to enhance our services capabilities.
Now I'll turn it over to Kathy, who will provide more details on the quarter and cover guidance."

Some challenges had been contemplated, such as neg",2466,"Thanks, Ursula, and good morning, everyone. We delivered Q1 EPS in the middle of our range with solid cash flow of $113 million. However, as Ursula mentioned, the quarter was challenging in many respects. Some challenges had been contemplated, such as negative currency impacts, higher pension expense and, in Services, the timing of investments relative to improved productivity from our global capabilities. However, we failed to accurately call the incremental financial pressure we're experiencing in our Government Healthcare business from the rollout of our Health Enterprise Medicaid platform. Our delivery quality and operating performance continued to improve, but the financials were a clear signal that we have more work ahead.
I'll take you through more details on that when I cover the Services segment, but first, let me walk you through the total company results for the quarter.
Total revenue in the quarter was down 6% at actual currency and 2% in constant currency as growth in Services was offset by declines in Document Technology. The negative currency impact of 4 points in the quarter was at the high end of our expectations and reflected the continued strengthening of the dollar within the quarter.
Gross margin of 31.2% was down 30 basis points year-over-year, driven by Services.
RD&E was modestly lower year-over-year, driven by reductions in Document Technology. SAG, in absolute dollar terms, was lower year-over-year, driven by currency. However, as a percent of revenue, SAG was up 70 basis points year-over-year to 20.5% as productivity benefits were more than offset by higher pension expense and the investments in Services.
As a result, our first quarter operating margin decreased 110 basis points year-over-year and operating profit declined 18%, with the largest drivers being pension expense, the financial pressure from our Health Enterprise implementation and currency.
Moving down the income statement. Adjusted other net expense was $5 million lower year-over-year. Within that, lower gains on sales of assets and higher currency losses were offset by lower restructuring costs and lower interest expense. Equity income was $34 million in the quarter, down $8 million year-over-year, driven by the impact of negative translation currency. Our Q1 adjusted tax rate of 24.5% was at the low end of our range and up 4 percentage points year-over-year.
Adjusted EPS of $0.21 was at the midpoint of our guidance and $0.05 lower year-over-year, driven by the operating profit decline.
I'll now move to Services segment to review those results in a little more detail. Services revenue declined 3% and was up 1% at constant currency, which was a bit shy of where we expected to come in. Document Outsourcing constant-currency growth of 2% was in line with our expectation. BPO growth of 1% at constant currency was a bit light of what we were targeting, with the Health Enterprise platform implementations producing less revenue than we had anticipated.
We continue to see good BPO growth in Commercial Healthcare and other commercial industry verticals. We anticipate our revenue growth rate will improve in the second half as we lap the impact of last year's larger contract losses and begin to ramp the New York Medicaid and Florida tolling deals. M&A also remains a variable factor to growth depending on timing of acquisition.
Our renewal rate in the quarter was 91%, evidence that, overall, we're delivering well for our clients. I should note that we are now including Document Outsourcing in our renewal rate in addition to BPO. Overall, it was a really strong renewal quarter.
Total signings in the quarter were down 13%, driven by both lower new business signings and lower renewal opportunities. New business signings declined 26% year-over-year. We mentioned on our last call that we've aligned our sales force to specific industry verticals. We recently moved our Document Outsourcing sales force into the same structure to better enable cross-selling opportunities.
We are continuing to invest in increased sales coverage and training, which takes time to yield results and should positively impact new business signings as we move through 2015. Additionally, our signings did not include the New York Medicaid contract, which was finalized after the end of the quarter, and the new Florida tolling contract, which is still pending. These new signings will reverse the downward signings trend this quarter.
Turning to margin. Segment margin was 7.5% in the quarter, which was down 110 basis points year-over-year and well below our objective of modest year-over-year improvement.
As referenced earlier, the driver of the Services margin mix was lower revenue and more cost than anticipated with our Health Enterprise platform implementation. California had the largest impact on our results in the quarter. We successfully implemented the first phase at the end of last year. However, recent estimate to deliver the remaining phases are higher. We also had startup cost in New York with no revenue offset as the contract didn't get finalized until April.
Margin excluding those impacts would have been up 10 basis points year-over-year, so a very modest improvement. We saw margin improvements in a number of lines of business, including Document Outsourcing as well as some of our commercial verticals. At the same time, we're continuing to invest in our industry and capability operating model, sales coverage and training as well as some new offerings, which Ursula discussed. 
As we move through the year, we expect to see our investments mature and produce more value. We should also see further productivity gains as we roll out our initiative across our operating groups.
Before moving on, I'm going to take a minute to further discuss the financial challenges we're facing in our Health Enterprise implementation. With the exception of the New York Medicaid contract, these deals were signed before we finished development of the core software platform. We had delayed finishing the new platform and meeting client delivery dates, resulting in cost increases.
In the case of California, as the new project plan was built out further, we recognized that the cost to complete the entire program would increase, which triggered an adjustment in the quarter. In contrast, New York was bid after the Health Enterprise platform was completed, and we've been investing ahead to position us for a strong start.
Operationally, the platform is performing well in the states where it's been rolled out, and we're progressing on the implementations in other states. However, we have more work ahead to turn around the financial performance.
We're taking a number of additional actions to improve the picture and have adjusted our expectations to reflect what, we believe, is required to meet our customer commitment. This is the main driver of our revised Services margin guidance, which I'll get to in more detail when I review guidance in a few minutes.
Now I'm going to turn to Document Technology. Document Technology revenue in the quarter was largely in line with our guidance with adverse currency coming in at the high end of our expectations. On a constant-currency basis, revenue was down 6%, which was consistent with last year's rate of decline. Currency was a 4-point drag on revenue, with revenue at actual currency down 10%. While we don't typically include developing markets in our constant-currency calculation, we are impacted when currencies devalue quickly. In the first quarter, revenue at constant currency would have been down 5% if we excluded the impact of currency on developing markets.
Relative to our performance in the fourth quarter, we saw some moderation of equipment revenue declines at constant currency as we began to see some benefits from the second half 2014 new product launches. Offsetting this were modestly worse Annuity revenue declines, driven by a surprise revenue decline in the entry segment.
Looking at entry, it continues to be impacted by economic weakness and uncertainty in developing markets, especially Eurasia and Brazil. We anticipate some improvement in the rate of declines as benefit from new products grow. But overall, we continue to expect economic headwinds to weigh on entry.
Mid-range, mono and color activity were relatively flat year-over-year, and overall, mid-range results showed improvement. High-end continues to show good Annuity revenue performance, although equipment was weaker in the quarter, driven by the timing of new product launches as well as a couple of deals slipping into the second quarter.
Document Technology margins were down 110 basis points, with almost the entire decline driven by higher pension expense. As previously discussed, the higher pension expense this year is a function of higher pension settlement given lower discount rates as well as last year's mortality table change.
So overall, core Document Tech business performance continues to be strong, and we're focused on improving top line by capitalizing on our growth opportunities in the market.
Before I go through the cash flow, I'd like to remind everyone that while our ITO results are included in discontinued operations pending the sale to Atos, ITO is still in our operating cash flow until we close the transaction. ITO was a use of $13 million in the quarter and a use of $32 million in free cash flow.
Overall, cash flow from operations was $113 million in the quarter, solidly positive and reflecting the progress that we've made smoothing working capital impact over the past couple of years.
A couple of highlights to note within operating cash flow. The add-back for depreciation is lower than last year by about $50 million and reflects, in part, the write-down of the carrying value of the ITO assets to fair value, now that it's being held for sale.
Working capital is a use of cash, with this -- which is consistent with our normal seasonality and largely consistent with 2014. Inventory was a larger use this year, reflecting a higher level of in-transit inventory and timing of sales. Additionally, accounts receivable was a higher use this year, primarily due to the strong fourth quarter collections, particularly in Services.
Moving down the cash flow statement. Investing cash flows were a $98 million use, including $95 million spent on CapEx in the quarter and $28 million on acquisitions.
Cash flow from financing was a use of $485 million, which included net debt payments of approximately $150 million, $216 million spent on share repurchases and $76 million used for preferred and common stock dividends.
Now I'm going to quickly go over our capital structure. We ended the first quarter with $7.6 billion in debt. During the quarter, we retired $1 billion in senior notes and issued $400 million in 5-year notes with a coupon of 2.75% and $250 million in 20-year notes with a coupon of 4.8%.
Applying 7:1 leverage on customer financing assets, our allocated financing debt at the end of the first quarter was $3.9 billion, leaving core debt of $3.7 billion. We manage our core debt to maintain credit metrics consistent with our investment-grade rating, so our capital structure remains pretty stable.
If we go on to the next slide, I'll review where we're at in terms of capital allocation.
Our capital allocation plans for the year are unchanged and, as previously communicated, incorporates the redeployments of the expected net proceeds of roughly $850 million from the ITO sale, which had closed later this quarter.
On share repurchases, we spent $216 million in the quarter and continue to plan to spend about $1 billion for purchasing stock this year. We continue to view our shares as attractively priced and a good investment.
On acquisitions. We closed one acquisition in the quarter, Intrepid Learning Systems, for $28 million. We continue to look to spend up to $900 million in 2015 and plan to roll over any unspent fund into 2016. Acquisitions are a priority for us, as we believe it's an important element of our portfolio management strategy to evolve our portfolio to higher-value services as well as supporting BPO expansion internationally.
We're very disciplined in our approach. Our pipeline is strong, and we've actively considered more deals year-to-date than last year. We're working to further build our business development capabilities so we can be more acquisitive and expand our pipeline of potential targets.
Now onto debt. We have one more tranche of debt coming due this year, $250 million in June. We expect debt to temporarily decline in conjunction with the receipt of the ITO proceeds and plan to complete additional refinancing activity as needed in the second half. We continue to expect to end the year at roughly $7.7 billion in debt.
And finally, on dividends. We spent just under $300 million, which contemplates the recent 12% dividend increase we announced on our last earnings call.
Before I turn it back to Ursula, I'd like to summarize our expectations for the second quarter and for the full year.
For the second quarter, we expect adjusted EPS in the range of $0.21 to $0.23, with constant-currency revenue down about 2 points and currency pressuring and top line by another 5 points, reflecting the dollar strengthening a bit from the first quarter.
For Document Technology revenue, we expect the constant-currency rate of decline to modestly improve from the first quarter with a negative currency impact of 5 to 6 points. Margins should be within our 11% to 13% range for the year, up sequentially but down year-over-year driven by the increased pension cost and currency. 
For Services, we expect the second quarter year-over-year revenue growth to be roughly flat at constant currency, with a negative currency impact of 4 to 5 points. Slow growth reflects softer signings as well as the timing of new-contract ramp versus lost-contract runoff and slower acquisition activity. We anticipate second quarter margins will be approximately flat sequentially, reflecting period-compare headwinds in Document Outsourcing, continued higher cost to implement our Health Enterprise platform and incremental investments not yet fully offset by productivity gains. Document Outsourcing margins continue to be strong with normal year-over-year compares in the second half.
For the full year, at constant currency, we expect Services revenue will now be at the low end of the 2% to 4% range; no change to Document Technology, with revenue expected to decline 4% to 5%; and total company revenue now expected to be down about 1 point year-over-year. We expect currency will have a negative 4-point impact to total revenue for the year. 
We're maintaining our Document Technology margin expectation but reducing our Services margin guidance to 8.5% to 9% due to higher cost within our Health Enterprise implementation and not as much net benefit from enhanced productivity relative to investments.
In total, we expect this to yield adjusted EPS of $0.95 to $1.01.
To conclude, while we are disappointed with the guidance revision, we are making decisions for the long term to ensure that we're taking the necessary actions to drive sustainable growth and margin improvement in the future.
With that, I'll hand it back over to you, Ursula."

Document Technology continues to execute well, and we remain focused on leading in the most attractive segments of the market.

Transportation is an area of target for us. We've talked about the continued move into workflow within our Document Outsourcing group, so that's an area.

And then, I just want to pull the importance to New York and just being confident here about you have good line of sight into the ramp there. [indiscernible]."

And so if you look at the situation in California, which triggered the adjustment that we took this quarter, we had made a decision with the state of California to do this in a staged implementation rather than a single cutover, right? And that caused us to have to basically kind of restage and rework our project plan. As we got into the further details of what that was going to costs, right, the cost for the overall implementation went up, and that triggered us to have to take an adjustment this quarter. So we scrubbed much further what that project plan was going to look like. It's the right answer for the client and for us to do a staged implementation. It reduces the risk of execution. But at the end of the day, we now understand that it's going to cost more. And this is a contract that was signed years ago and in advance of our standard platform being completed. If I contrast that on -- because you asked about New York. New York is very different, because New York, we actually bid a standard contract, right? And in addition to bidding a standard contract, we were awarded this contract last May, we started standing up resources toward the end of the third quarter in order to really get us on a right track with New York. So we're very excited about New York. And it's a different situation than, I'll say, the legacy implementations that we had pre-New York."

So when we're implementing the platform, we are using percent-of-completion accounting, right? And in that case, as we got in and did the more detailed planning for the now-phased implementation and costed out that more detailed plan, that's what triggered us to take the adjustment in the quarter. That adjustment in the quarter is not all cash. That kind of lands in the quarter, right? That's a software platform that we'll be delivering with the course of this year and next, kind of through these stages. So I would call that a pretty isolated adjustment, not the kind of adjustment that we would expect we'd be taking on an ongoing basis. And it's part of the reason -- earlier I talked about the fact that this area gets less risky for us as we complete more and more of these implementations with the states where we signed contracts 3-plus years ago.
Once we get beyond the implementation, right, then the economics move to, I'll call it, the regular Medicaid transaction processing, right?

Overall, when we talk about investments in Services outside of our Government Healthcare group, we're investing in things like sales leadership, training, tools, new offerings, this shift to our new industry business group sort of vertical approach and adding leadership in there. So when we talk about investments, it's clearly outside of the Government Healthcare Solution business as well. With regard to kind of the staging, so clearly, the first quarter, we took a big adjustment in California. As I described, that's a pretty isolated instance. If I look over 2015 for sort of the pattern of what we're expecting in the Health Enterprise accounts, I would describe this as first half sort of heavy on incremental costs and expecting in the second half that we're actually going to get a reasonable amount of pickup. Now it's still going to be a drag on a full year basis, right, so if you look at the adjustment that we made overall to our margins. Originally, when we gave guidance back in November, we said we thought we were going to get 25 to 50 basis points largely, candidly, from these Health Enterprise accounts improving, right? I would describe that now on a full year basis, and that is in our guidance, as taking into consideration. We might actually see a little bit of dilution, overall, on our margins for the year. So we thought -- we think, as we've revised our guidance, that we've really taken into consideration that some of these things are tough to call. They're pretty complicated projects, and we need to make sure that we have room if there's any changes, and we've taken that into account."

That 25 to 50 basis points will not happen. It'll probably be a little bit of a headwind for us in 2015, not a tailwind. And so the margin adjustment that we've taken for the full company and for Services comprehends that pressure that we're not going to make the progress that we want to make in Government Health from a financial perspective. Operationally, the great news about this operationally is that we are doing fairly well, I think, across all of the accounts.

We've adjusted the other state that hasn't yet been implemented and we're close on the one that we're going to cut over this year."

I think a good last question as well. We obviously spend -- the leadership team, the board, we spend a lot of time looking at performance versus strategy to make sure that the loop is continually closed and that we are on the right stack of mail. Separating operational challenges, are we on the right stack of mail for 10% to 12% margins, revenue growth overall and being valuable for our clients? And the answer is yes. We still believe that the fundamental strategy of a diversified services portfolio globalized, which we are still working on doing, and that's supported by a good level of acquisitions in the areas that we're in. We are doing portfolio management and trimming out things that we are not great at and investing in areas that we're really good. That strategy still holds. Document Technology has a good cash generator, good base for us to grow Services from, also, that strategy still holds. So I think with -- we look at it all the time. We look at it against our financial goals and against our capabilities. We can get to 10% to 12% margins, for sure. Government Healthcare is a place that we have to continue to focus and continue to improve and hopefully not talk about a whole lot as we go on. We have to just get this stuff behind us. New York, we think we have a good start. We have these 5 contracts, et cetera, et cetera. So Government Health is the place that we're spending a lot of time on this call, and rightfully so, but the rest of the mix of the business that we have and the remainder of the strategy is one that, absolutely, still holds water and still works for us. And so -- and I think it will work for the shareholders over time, and that's where we're focused on.
With that, I can -- think I can actually transition to a close, and let me just thank all of you for taking the time to ask questions and listen to the call.

Today we reported our first quarter results and provided full year guidance, lowering expectations.

Today we reported our first quarter results and provided full year guidance, lowering expectations. I'll start with a brief reminder of our direction and then provide an overview of our Q1 performance. Kathy will review the financials, and then we'll take your questions.
Our diversified portfolio, strong Annuity business and solid cash flow enabled us to participate and invest in attractive markets that will drive growth. Services represents 56% of our total revenue, and we expect that proportion to continue to grow. We are the leader in diversified business process services, and we are maintaining leadership in Document Technology.
Over the last few years, we have taken significant steps to lay the foundation for sustainable long-term success. We are differentiating ourselves by incorporating greater automation and intelligence in our solutions and products, all with the goal of helping our clients better manage their critical business processes.
As an example, we recently launched the Midas+ Readmission Forecaster, an advanced analytics health care solution to help hospitals drive quality improvement around patient care and reduce Medicare penalties for excess hospital readmissions. Additionally, we introduced our new Mobility Analytics Platform, which makes it significantly easier for transport and parking operators to understand and even predict commuter needs. VINCI Park, the world's leading parking space provider, is testing the system in a town in the suburbs of Paris.
Within Document Technology, we retained our #1 position in equipment revenue market share for the 21st straight quarter, and we launched 8 new products plus workflow solutions, reinforcing our leadership in mobile printing, inkjet technology and digital color.
Lastly, our solid balance sheet and strong free cash flow, along with the proceeds from the pending ITO divestiture, will enable us to continue to deliver strong shareholder returns. We have returned more than 50% of free cash flow to shareholders over the last 4 years and plan to do the same this year by repurchasing up to $1 billion in shares and returning approximately $300 million to shareholders in dividends. At the same time, we will continue to invest in our business organically and through acquisitions.
Now let's look at our performance in the quarter. In the first quarter, we reported total revenue of $4.5 billion, down 6%, 2% in constant currency. And we delivered adjusted earnings per share of $0.21. Earnings were in line with our guidance, but the performance of our Services business was below our expectations, principally because of implementation issues in certain legacy Health Enterprise platform accounts.
It's important to note that many areas of our Services business performed quite well in the quarter. This includes Document Outsourcing and several of our commercial vertical industry groups. We continued to perform well in Commercial Healthcare.
As many of you may have seen, we finalized the New York Medicaid contract that we were awarded last year. We have invested in advance to ensure our good start, and we look forward to working with the state to serve their Medicaid population.
That said, in Services, we have more work to do to improve our financial performance. We continue to align our go-to-market resources along vertical industries, and we're investing in sale coverage and training. At the same time, we're focused on driving more consistent delivery and capturing efficiencies through our new operating model. 
And specifically within our Health Enterprise accounts, we have taken action to address the issues. We continue to add expertise in the most critical areas of this business. Our operating performance and delivery quality continue to improve, and I'm confident in the Services and health care teams.
Kathy will go into more detail on the financials in a moment, and we can have additional discussion during the Q&A.
Our Document Technology results, which included the increased impact from foreign currency, largely met our expectations. It continues to be a business where we generate strong profits and cash. In quarter 1, we delivered shareholder value by repurchasing shares, supporting our dividend program and acquiring Intrepid Learning Systems to enhance our services capabilities.
Now I'll turn it over to Kathy, who will provide more details on the quarter and cover guidance."
103599,290034143,794654,"Xerox Corporation, Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2015",2015-04-24,"Earnings Calls","Xerox Holdings Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Ursula, and good morning, everyone. We delivered Q1 EPS in the middle of our range with solid cash flow of $113 million. However, as Ursula mentioned, the quarter was challenging in many respects. Some challenges had been contemplated, such as neg",2472,"Thanks, Ursula, and good morning, everyone. We delivered Q1 EPS in the middle of our range with solid cash flow of $113 million. However, as Ursula mentioned, the quarter was challenging in many respects. Some challenges had been contemplated, such as negative currency impacts, higher pension expense and, in Services, the timing of investments relative to improved productivity from our global capabilities. However, we failed to accurately call the incremental financial pressure we're experiencing in our Government Healthcare business from the rollout of our Health Enterprise Medicaid platform. Our delivery quality and operating performance continued to improve, but the financials were a clear signal that we have more work ahead.
I'll take you through more details on that when I cover the Services segment, but first, let me walk you through the total company results for the quarter.
Total revenue in the quarter was down 6% at actual currency and 2% in constant currency as growth in Services was offset by declines in Document Technology. The negative currency impact of 4 points in the quarter was at the high end of our expectations and reflected the continued strengthening of the dollar within the quarter.
Gross margin of 31.2% was down 30 basis points year-over-year, driven by Services.
RD&E was modestly lower year-over-year, driven by reductions in Document Technology. SAG, in absolute dollar terms, was lower year-over-year, driven by currency. However, as a percent of revenue, SAG was up 70 basis points year-over-year to 20.5% as productivity benefits were more than offset by higher pension expense and the investments in Services.
As a result, our first quarter operating margin decreased 110 basis points year-over-year and operating profit declined 18%, with the largest drivers being pension expense, the financial pressure from our Health Enterprise implementation and currency.
Moving down the income statement. Adjusted other net expense was $5 million lower year-over-year. Within that, lower gains on sales of assets and higher currency losses were offset by lower restructuring costs and lower interest expense. Equity income was $34 million in the quarter, down $8 million year-over-year, driven by the impact of negative translation currency. Our Q1 adjusted tax rate of 24.5% was at the low end of our range and up 4 percentage points year-over-year.
Adjusted EPS of $0.21 was at the midpoint of our guidance and $0.05 lower year-over-year, driven by the operating profit decline.
I'll now move to Services segment to review those results in a little more detail. Services revenue declined 3% and was up 1% at constant currency, which was a bit shy of where we expected to come in. Document Outsourcing constant currency growth of 2% was in line with our expectation. BPO growth of 1% at constant currency was a bit light of what we were targeting, with the Health Enterprise platform implementations producing less revenue than we had anticipated.
We continue to see good BPO growth in Commercial Healthcare and other commercial industry verticals. We anticipate our revenue growth rate will improve in the second half as we lap the impact of last year's larger contract losses and begin to ramp the New York Medicaid and Florida Tolling deals. M&A also remains a variable factor to growth depending on timing of acquisitions.
Our renewal rate in the quarter was 91%, evidence that, overall, we're delivering well for our clients. I should note that we are now including Document Outsourcing in our renewal rate in addition to BPO. Overall, it was a really strong renewal quarter.
Total signings in the quarter were down 13%, driven by both lower new business signings and lower renewal opportunities. New business signings declined 26% year-over-year. We mentioned on our last call that we've aligned our sales force to specific industry verticals. We recently moved our Document Outsourcing sales force into the same structure to better enable cross-selling opportunities.
We are continuing to invest in increased sales coverage and training, which takes time to yield results and should positively impact new business signings as we move through 2015. Additionally, our signings did not include the New York Medicaid contract, which was finalized after the end of the quarter, and the new Florida Tolling contract, which is still pending. These new signings will reverse the downward signings trend this quarter.
Turning to margin. Segment margin was 7.5% in the quarter, which was down 110 basis points year-over-year and well below our objective of modest year-over-year improvement.
As referenced earlier, the driver of the Services margin mix was lower revenue and more cost than anticipated with our Health Enterprise platform implementations. California had the largest impact on our results in the quarter. We successfully implemented the first phase at the end of last year. However, recent estimates to deliver the remaining phases are higher. We also had startup costs in New York with no revenue offset as the contract didn't get finalized until April.
Margin excluding those impacts would have been up 10 basis points year-over-year, so a very modest improvement. We saw margin improvements in a number of lines of business, including Document Outsourcing as well as some of our commercial verticals. At the same time, we're continuing to invest in our industry and capability operating model, sales coverage and training as well as some new offerings, which Ursula discussed. 
As we move through the year, we expect to see our investments mature and produce more value. We should also see further productivity gains as we roll out our initiative across our operating groups.
Before moving on, I'm going to take a minute to further discuss the financial challenges we're facing in our Health Enterprise implementations. With the exception of the New York Medicaid contract, these deals were signed before we finished development of the core software platform. We had delayed finishing the new platform and meeting client delivery dates, resulting in cost increases.
In the case of California, as the new project plan was built out further, we recognized that the cost to complete the entire program would increase, which triggered an adjustment in the quarter. In contrast, New York was bid after the Health Enterprise platform was completed, and we've been investing ahead to position us for a strong start.
Operationally, the platform is performing well in the states where it's been rolled out, and we're progressing on the implementations in other states. However, we have more work ahead to turn around the financial performance.
We're taking a number of additional actions to improve the picture and have adjusted our expectations to reflect what, we believe, is required to meet our customer commitment. This is the main driver of our revised Services margin guidance, which I'll get to in more detail when I review guidance in a few minutes.
Now I'm going to turn to Document Technology. Document Technology revenue in the quarter was largely in line with our guidance with adverse currency coming in at the high end of our expectations. On a constant currency basis, revenue was down 6%, which was consistent with last year's rate of decline. Currency was a 4-point drag on revenue, with revenue at actual currency down 10%. While we don't typically include developing markets in our constant currency calculation, we are impacted when currencies devalue quickly. In the first quarter, revenue at constant currency would have been down 5% if we excluded the impact of currency on developing markets.
Relative to our performance in the fourth quarter, we saw some moderation of equipment revenue declines at constant currency as we began to see some benefits from the second half 2014 new product launches. Offsetting this were modestly worse Annuity revenue declines, driven by a supplies revenue decline in the entry segment.
Looking at entry, it continues to be impacted by economic weakness and uncertainty in developing markets, especially Eurasia and Brazil. We anticipate some improvement in the rate of declines as benefits from new products grow. But overall, we continue to expect economic headwinds to weigh on entry.
Mid-range, mono and color activity were relatively flat year-over-year, and overall, mid-range results showed improvement. High-end continues to show good Annuity revenue performance, although equipment was weaker in the quarter, driven by the timing of new product launches as well as a couple of deals slipping into the second quarter.
Document Technology margins were down 110 basis points, with almost the entire decline driven by higher pension expense. As previously discussed, the higher pension expense this year is a function of higher pension settlements given lower discount rates as well as last year's mortality table change.
So overall, core Document Tech business performance continues to be strong, and we're focused on improving top line by capitalizing on our growth opportunities in the market.
Before I go through the cash flow, I'd like to remind everyone that while our ITO results are included in discontinued operations pending the sale to Atos, ITO is still in our operating cash flow until we close the transaction. ITO was a use of $13 million in the quarter and a use of $32 million in free cash flow.
Overall, cash flow from operations was $113 million in the quarter, solidly positive and reflecting the progress that we've made smoothing working capital impacts over the past couple of years.
A couple of highlights to note within operating cash flow. The add-back for depreciation is lower than last year by about $50 million and reflects, in part, the write-down of the carrying value of the ITO assets to fair value, now that it's being held for sale.
Working capital is a use of cash, with this -- which is consistent with our normal seasonality and largely consistent with 2014. Inventory was a larger use this year, reflecting a higher level of in-transit inventory and timing of sales. Additionally, accounts receivable was a higher use this year, primarily due to the strong fourth quarter collections, particularly in Services.
Moving down the cash flow statement. Investing cash flows were a $98 million use, including $95 million spent on CapEx in the quarter and $28 million on acquisitions.
Cash flow from financing was a use of $485 million, which included net debt payments of approximately $150 million, $216 million spent on share repurchases and $76 million used for preferred and common stock dividends.
Now I'm going to quickly go over our capital structure. We ended the first quarter with $7.6 billion in debt. During the quarter, we retired $1 billion in senior notes and issued $400 million in 5-year notes with a coupon of 2.75% and $250 million in 20-year notes with a coupon of 4.8%.
Applying 7:1 leverage on customer financing assets, our allocated financing debt at the end of the first quarter was $3.9 billion, leaving core debt of $3.7 billion. We manage our core debt to maintain credit metrics consistent with our investment-grade rating, so our capital structure remains pretty stable.
If we go on to the next slide, I'll review where we're at in terms of capital allocation.
Our capital allocation plans for the year are unchanged and, as previously communicated, incorporates the redeployment of the expected net proceeds of roughly $850 million from the ITO sale, which should close later this quarter.
On share repurchases, we spent $216 million in the quarter and continue to plan to spend about $1 billion for purchasing stock this year. We continue to view our shares as attractively priced and a good investment.
On acquisitions. We closed one acquisition in the quarter, Intrepid Learning Systems, for $28 million. We continue to look to spend up to $900 million in 2015 and plan to roll over any unspent funds into 2016. Acquisitions are a priority for us, as we believe it's an important element of our portfolio management strategy to evolve our portfolio to higher-value services as well as supporting BPO expansion internationally.
We're very disciplined in our approach. Our pipeline is strong, and we've actively considered more deals year-to-date than last year. We're working to further build our business development capabilities so we can be more acquisitive and expand our pipeline of potential targets.
Now onto debt. We have one more tranche of debt coming due this year, $250 million in June. We expect debt to temporarily decline in conjunction with the receipt of the ITO proceeds and plan to complete additional refinancing activity as needed in the second half. We continue to expect to end the year at roughly $7.7 billion in debt.
And finally, on dividends. We spent just under $300 million, which contemplates the recent 12% dividend increase we announced on our last earnings call.
Before I turn it back to Ursula, I'd like to summarize our expectations for the second quarter and for the full year.
For the second quarter, we expect adjusted EPS in the range of $0.21 to $0.23, with constant currency revenue down about 2 points and currency pressuring top line by another 5 points, reflecting the dollar strengthening a bit from the first quarter.
For Document Technology revenue, we expect the constant currency rate of decline to modestly improve from the first quarter with a negative currency impact of 5 to 6 points. Margins should be within our 11% to 13% range for the year, up sequentially but down year-over-year driven by the increased pension cost and currency. 
For Services, we expect the second quarter year-over-year revenue growth to be roughly flat at constant currency, with a negative currency impact of 4 to 5 points. Slowed growth reflects softer signings as well as the timing of new contract ramp versus lost contract runoff and slower acquisition activity. We anticipate second quarter margins will be approximately flat sequentially, reflecting period-compare headwinds in Document Outsourcing, continued higher costs to implement our Health Enterprise platform and incremental investments not yet fully offset by productivity gains. Document Outsourcing margins continue to be strong with normal year-over-year compares in the second half.
For the full year, at constant currency, we expect Services revenue will now be at the low end of the 2% to 4% range; no change to Document Technology, with revenue expected to decline 4% to 5%; and total company revenue now expected to be down about 1 point year-over-year. We expect currency will have a negative 4-point impact to total revenue for the year. 
We're maintaining our Document Technology margin expectation, but reducing our Services margin guidance to 8.5% to 9% due to higher costs within our Health Enterprise implementation and not as much net benefit from enhanced productivity relative to investments.
In total, we expect this to yield adjusted EPS of $0.95 to $1.01.
To conclude, while we are disappointed with the guidance revision, we are making decisions for the long term to ensure that we're taking the necessary actions to drive sustainable growth and margin improvement in the future.
With that, I'll hand it back over to you, Ursula."

Although earnings met expectations, it was a challenging quarter. As Kathy detailed a moment ago, we are lowering our full year guidance. We know we have work to do to achieve sustainable long-term success, but I'm confident in our business strategy, our strong portfolio and our ability to succeed in the many industries that we serve.
Going forward, in Services, we are focused on revenue and margin expansion. Improved signings and executing on our new operating model will help us there.
Document Technology continues to execute well, and we remain focused on leading in the most attractive segments of the market. Overall, we anticipate positive results from the changes that we've made, and I'm certain that the actions that we're taking today will ensure a healthy Xerox for tomorrow and beyond.
So thank you for listening, and now I'll turn it over to Leslie."

We've added project management oversight in each of these projects to try to drive better predictability. We're working to consolidate the customized instances into a standardized platform that would then be less costly to implement and manage going forward.

We've added additional both financial management resources and expanded the financial teams in this area that sit over the accounts, specifically in California, which is where we had the big adjustment for the quarter.

Two have already been implemented, another one will be implemented next year.

So we are looking to not just do the deal size of the one deal that we did this quarter, but looking at things that are a little larger, which can make more of a difference for us. We're targeting specific areas. I mean, when you look across our portfolio, we've got a great business in Commercial Healthcare. There are places we'd like to continue to build out that business. Transportation is an area of target for us. We've talked about the continued move into workflow within our Document Outsourcing group, so that's an area. And then, as we look to continue to expand internationally, we do need a bigger footprint, and acquisitions can help us in that space as well. So they're, as you can imagine, tough to call. It's tough to call in which quarter we actually going to land things. But we're certainly generating more activity and looking to do larger deals. And then, in the second part of your question, so what about share repurchases? We are committed to doing about $1 billion of share repurchases this year. We know M&A timing is hard to call.

And so if you look at the situation in California, which triggered the adjustment that we took this quarter, we had made a decision with the State of California to do this in a staged implementation rather than a single cutover, right? And that caused us to have to basically kind of restage and rework our project plan. As we got into the further details of what that was going to cost, right, the cost for the overall implementation went up, and that triggered us to have to take an adjustment this quarter. So we scrubbed much further what that project plan was going to look like. It's the right answer for the client and for us to do a staged implementation. It reduces the risk of execution. But at the end of the day, we now understand that it's going to cost more. And this is a contract that was signed years ago and in advance of our standard platform being completed. If I contrast that then -- because you asked about New York. New York is very different, because New York, we actually bid a standard contract, right? And in addition to bidding a standard contract, we were awarded this contract last May, we started standing up resources toward the end of the third quarter in order to really get us on a right track with New York.

So the first part of the question is important for you to ask and for us to get out on this call and just lay our foundation. Government Healthcare is something that, I think, that Bob said it earlier, we've been in for more than 40 years. And it is a business that will be around and growing with a lot of focus because of the aging population, regulation changes in the United States, all of the foundational elements. We make, in this business, above-average margins. This is a -- above-average Services margins in this business. It's important to know that and that we are very successful and liked by our clients. We do business in many, many states. We service millions of recipients of benefits from those states. And it's a very profitable business for us. Once we get past laying down the platform, which is really complicated, and what we did for good, for bad or for ugly, but the facts are that we actually implemented a brand-new platform in these 5 states that readies us for the -- for this future of aging and new regulation, et cetera. It's been more challenging than even I would like for it to be, but it is one that, with many -- with continuous review, we keep coming down on the fact that this is a good business and we -- and a business that can be profitable, for sure. It is already in the historic accounts, and we just have to make it that way in the new accounts."

Overall, when we talk about investments in Services outside of our Government Healthcare group, we're investing in things like sales leadership, training, tools, new offerings, this shift to our new industry business group sort of vertical approach and adding leadership in there. So when we talk about investments, it's clearly outside of the Government Healthcare Solution business as well. With regard to kind of the staging, so clearly, the first quarter, we took a big adjustment in California. As I described, that's a pretty isolated instance. If I look over 2015 for sort of the pattern of what we're expecting in the Health Enterprise accounts, I would describe this as first half sort of heavy on incremental costs and expecting in the second half that we're actually going to get a reasonable amount of pickup. Now it's still going to be a drag on a full year basis, right, so if you look at the adjustment that we made overall to our margins. Originally, when we gave guidance back in November, we said we thought we were going to get 25 to 50 basis points largely, candidly, from these Health Enterprise accounts improving, right? I would describe that now on a full year basis, and that is in our guidance, as taking into consideration. We might actually see a little bit of dilution, overall, on our margins for the year. So we thought -- we think, as we've revised our guidance, that we've really taken into consideration that some of these things are tough to call. They're pretty complicated projects, and we need to make sure that we have room if there's any changes, and we've taken that into account."

So our margin expansion that comes from Health Enterprise, as she said -- again, I'm just repeating it so that we can actually get it clear, that will not happen. That 25 to 50 basis points will not happen. It'll probably be a little bit of a headwind for us in 2015, not a tailwind. And so the margin adjustment that we've taken for the full company and for Services comprehends that pressure that we're not going to make the progress that we wanted to make in Government Health from a financial perspective. Operationally, the great news about this operationally is that we are doing fairly well, I think, across all of the accounts. There's some struggles in maybe one, but we're doing fairly well operationally across these accounts."

When we move and bolt-grow the smaller deal component and have those and what's been signed, that would be, to me, a more typical kind of mix of signings. So I don't think -- obviously, you -- when you add big clients, then that individual client is kind of a bigger share of your revenue stream. But from an overall signings mix, no, I don't think a portfolio for the year that would include Florida, New York and then the rest of our book of business would be more concentrated than 2012, 2013, kind of what our historical rate's been."

Separating operational challenges, are we on the right stack of mail for 10% to 12% margins, revenue growth overall and being valuable to our clients? And the answer is yes. We still believe that the fundamental strategy of a diversified services portfolio globalized, which we are still working on doing, and that's supported by a good level of acquisitions in the areas that we're in. We are doing portfolio management and trimming out things that we are not great at and investing in areas that we're really good. That strategy still holds. Document Technology has a good cash generator, good base for us to grow Services from, also, that strategy still holds. So I think with -- we look at it all the time. We look at it against our financial goals and against our capabilities. We can get to 10% to 12% margins, for sure. Government Healthcare is a place that we have to continue to focus and continue to improve and hopefully not talk about a whole lot as we go on. We have to just get this stuff behind us.

Today, we reported the second quarter results that are largely in line with our guidance. During the call, we will update you on our strategy, provide detail on the second quarter, and share the areas where we are intensifying our focus throughout the balance of the year. Let's start with our strategy. 
Our direction has been consistent. We are making progress in some areas, but we know we can and should do better in other areas. Our direction is unchanged. We are making several shifts in the way that we execute against it. First, we have taken steps to create much greater focus in our Services business. We completed the divestiture of our ITO business, enabling a clear focus on the BPO and Document Outsourcing businesses. Last Friday, we announced a major change in our Government Healthcare strategy. We are focused on ensuring the success of the existing Health Enterprise implementations by limiting new pursuits with this platform. 
Second, we are modifying our acquisition expectations for the year, setting an achievable spend level given our progress to date. Third, the Services leadership team is in place with our last industry leader appointed in April. Our capabilities are fully staffed and sales resources are in place to market our full portfolio of Services. Collectively, these actions result in a sharpened focus on achieving organic improvements in our Services business. 
We have also announced changes to our 2015 capital allocation plan. For the full year, we will increase our share repurchase by $300 million to $1.3 billion and we will return $300 million to shareholders in dividends as unchanged. In summary, we have the right business strategy. We are reprioritizing investments and accelerating our structuring actions in Services to improve revenue and margin. While we have more work to do, we are making decisions and changes that will deliver attractive returns for our investors. Now let's look at quarter 2. 
We delivered adjusted earnings per share of $0.22, as in line with our guidance, which excludes the previously announced health care software impairment charges of $0.08. Total revenue was $4.6 billion, which is down 3% in constant currency. We grew Services revenue modestly in constant currency. That was driven by strong performance in Document Outsourcing. We delivered on our Services margin guidance. There are a few highlights in Services that I would like to share. We are seeing indications that our new Services go-to-market model is taking root. Our opportunity pipeline is up significantly and we are seeing more cross-selling and better customer engagement. 
We made some important strides in innovation, introducing new levels of robotic automation to support our BPO offerings. For example, we recently announced clear site automated intelligence and clear sight case management. We also introduced Managed Print Services innovations with next-generation offerings and Workflow Automation solutions to reinforce our leadership in the industry. And for internal productivity, we're driving transformational change in our own capability operations with the call center of the future program. 
Now moving on to Document Technology. Revenue was down 7% in constant currency, which is modestly lower than what we had expected, including DO though, total document related revenues were down 4% in constant currency. That's consistent with the trends that we've seen over the last several quarters. Document Technology margins were in line with expectations, and here's some highlights on Doc Tech. We retained our #1 position in equipment sales revenue market share for the 22nd straight quarter. We were pleased with install performance in the quarter as most product segments improved especially in the high end of our business. The new product introductions due in the quarter, and the launch of the iGen5 earlier this month will enable us to continue in our leadership position. 
Finally, we used our strong free cash flow, $349 million in the quarter to acquire Health Communities Institute and business solutions. We repurchased shares and supported our dividend program. 
Now I'll turn it over to Kathy to go over some details in the quarter. I'll be back later for -- to wrap things up. Kathy?"
103599,305695692,838310,"Xerox Corporation, Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 24, 2015",2015-07-24,"Earnings Calls","Xerox Holdings Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Ursula, and good morning, everyone. Our bottom line results were within our guidance for the quarter with Services profit in line, tech profits a little light on modestly softer revenue, which was offset by a bit better nonoperating expenses. I wi",2060,"Thanks, Ursula, and good morning, everyone. Our bottom line results were within our guidance for the quarter with Services profit in line, tech profits a little light on modestly softer revenue, which was offset by a bit better nonoperating expenses. I will cover the segments in more detail in a minute. But first, I will run through total company results for the second quarter. 
Total revenue in the quarter was down 7% at actual currency and 3% at constant currency. Growth in Services was more than offset by declines in Document Technology, which accelerated modestly, driven by continued weakness in developing markets and higher declines in supply revenue. The negative currency impact of 4 points on our top line was consistent with our expectations and with first quarter results. Gross margin of 31.1% was down 100 basis points year-over-year, driven by lower technology gross margin as well as the greater mix of Services, which carries a lower margin. 
RD&E was slightly lower year-over-year and SAG in absolute dollar terms was down 6% helped by currency. However, as a percent of revenue, SAG was up 30 basis points year-over-year to 19.7% as productivity benefits were more than offset by investments in Services. As a result, our second quarter operating margin decreased 160 basis points year-over-year and operating profit declined 22%. About a quarter of the operating profit decline was driven by currency in developing markets with the remainder of the decline coming from the causals that I just discussed. 
Moving down the income statement. Adjusted other net expense was $26 million lower year-over-year, driven by lower restructuring costs. Equity income was $29 million in the quarter, down $4 million year-over-year driven by the continued impact of negative translation currency. Our second quarter adjusted tax rate of 25.8% was in the middle of our guidance and about 1 point lower year-over-year. Second quarter adjusted earnings per share was in the middle of our guidance range at $0.22. GAAP EPS from continuing operations in the quarter was $0.09 and includes the $0.08 impact from the Government Healthcare software impairment we announced last week, which was driven by the strategy change that Ursula already discussed. As this was a very large noncash charge, we excluded it from our adjusted results to better reflect underlying operating performance.
I'll now move on to discuss our operating performance in Services. Services revenue declined 3% and was up 1% at constant currency, which was consistent with first quarter and a bit better than our guidance of roughly flat, driven by 4% growth in Document Outsourcing. Growth in Document Outsourcing reflects continued strong Xerox Partner Print Services growth as well as good equipment revenue growth in enterprise accounts from recent strong signings. BPO revenue was down 1%, reflecting the continued headwind from last year's larger contract losses, more than offsetting lower new ramp from softer signings in previous quarters. 
We continue to expect BPO growth to improve in the second half as we lap the larger contract losses. We completed 2 small struggle acquisitions in the first half and M&A remains a variable factor. I'll talk about this more when I cover cash flow and capital allocation. Total signings in the quarter were up 20% and new business signings were up 9% driven by strong signings and Document Outsourcing as well as the recently signed New York Medicaid processing contract in BPO. We expect our go-to-market investment and move to industry alignment will yield improved new business signings growth as we progress through the year. Our pipeline continues to build and is up, sequentially. 
Our renewal rate in the quarter was 82%, which was below our target range of 85% to 90% and reflected in part lower renewal opportunities in the quarter. Year-to-date renewal rate is 87%. Turning to margin. Segment margin was 7.5% in the quarter, which was down 100 basis points year-over-year and in line with our expectation. As expected, margin was pressured by higher costs related to our Health Enterprise platform implementations. As we acknowledged last quarter, across our continuing to run high and we have more work to do to turn around financial performance in these accounts. 
Additionally, investments in our new Services operating model are not yet been fully offset by enhanced productivity from our operational initiatives, which are still ramping up. Partially offsetting these impacts was continued good margins in Document Outsourcing, albeit lower year-over-year as expected and a year-over-year compare benefit related to the charge last year from the loss of Nevada HIX business. So in summary, the quarter was in line for Services. 
We have made significant changes over the past year to move our Services business forward and we will be taking restructuring actions to ensure our productivity ramp was faster throughout the second half. I'll discuss this more when we get to guidance. I'll now turn to Document Technology. Document Technology revenue in the quarter was down 7% at constant currency. As expected, currency had a 5-point negative impact with revenue at actual currency down 12%. As we highlighted last quarter, we don't include developing markets in our constant currency calculation, but if we had, revenue would've been down 6% at constant currency. So overall, revenue trends remain fairly stable. 
Looking at the details. Equipment revenue declines moderated, down 6% at constant currency in the second quarter versus down 8% in the first quarter and 10% in the fourth quarter. The improving trend reflects benefits from recent new product launches, especially within high-end where equipment revenue grew in the quarter. Offsetting the positive equipment trend were higher declines in supplies revenue, driven in part by developing markets, which were pressured by softening economies and currency. From an activity perspective, we saw improvements in growth in mid-range, high-end and higher volume entry products. So overall, positive growth in installs across our product segment. 
Document Technology margin of 12.1% was down year-over-year, but up sequentially and in the middle of our 11% and 13% range for 2015. Year-over-year drivers included the anticipated higher pension expense and negative mix associated with improved equipment sales at lower margin. These were partially offset by a retiree health curtailment gain. So in closing, revenues were a little lighter than expected, but overall, a reasonable quarter for technology with equipment trends and high-end performance being positive takeaways. 
Turning to cash flow. Cash flow from operations was $349 million in the quarter, above last year's cash flow of $325 million. This reflects good overall performance despite weaker profit, as working capital was the lower net use versus last year, driven by the following factors. Account receivable was a source of $56 million in the quarter versus the use last year, reflecting lower revenue and flat year-over-year DSO. Accounts payable and accrued compensation was a $75 million lower use this year reflecting timing of supplier payments. This was, partially offset by a little higher inventory due to timing of shipments. 
Moving down to cash flow statement. Investing cash flows were in $831 million source, driven by proceeds of $930 million from the sale of the ITO business. This was partially offset by $102 million spent on CapEx and $20 million on acquisition. Cash flow from financing a $423 million use, which included $395 million spent on share repurchases and $83 million used for preferred and common stock dividend. As well, it reflects an increase in commercial paper, offset by payments of $260 [ph] million on senior notes. Our cash balance at the end of the quarter was $1.6 billion, an increase of $769 million since the end of the first quarter, driven by the proceeds received on June 30 from the ITO divestiture. So cash flow is strong and continues to track our expectation. 
Now I'll quickly go over capital structure. We ended the second quarter with $7.6 billion in debt. Applying 7 to 1 leverage on customer financing assets, our allocated financing debt at the end of the second quarter was $3.9 billion, leaving core debt of $3.7 billion. We manage our core debt to maintain credit metrics consistent with our investment-grade rating. Our capital structure remains fairly early stable. If we move to the next slide, I'll review where we are in terms of capital allocation. 
During the first half, we have repurchased $611 million in shares, spent $147 million on common stock dividends and $48 million on acquisition. Considering our first half performance and the opportunities we see for the balance of the year, we're adjusting our capital allocation plan. On acquisitions, we have spent about $50 million year-to-date. We now expect to spend between $100 million and $400 million for the full year. The bar is higher as we focus on organic improvements in Services for the next few quarters. We are working to enhance our proactive business development capabilities and recently hired a new leader for business development and M&A. 
On share repurchase, we are increasing our full year plan by $300 million to $1.3 billion. This reflects our view that our shares are attractively priced and a good investment as well as our reduced near-term plans for acquisition. This leaves approximately $200 million unallocated that we will deploy opportunistically. On debt, we retired our lowest tranche of debt coming due this year, $250 million in June and we continue to expect to end the year at a debt balance of roughly $7.7 billion. And finally on dividends. We continue to expect to spend just over $300 million. I'll now turn to a discussion of guidance. 
First, starting with revenue. Document Technology trends are stable. As expected improvements in high-end and financing have been offset by ongoing weakness in developing markets from softening economies as well as from currency. As a result, we are planning for Document Technology revenue to be down roughly 6% at constant currency in the second half and for the full year. Additionally, we are spending less on acquisitions than originally planned, dampening back half Services revenue acceleration. At the total company level, we now anticipate full year revenue of constant currency will be down approximately 2%, consistent with prior year and down 1 point from what we last communicated. 
Turning to margin. We expect Services margin will be at the low end of the 8.5% to 9% range for the year. With our margin at 7.5% for the first half, we need to average about 9.5% in the second half of the year to hit that level. This requires a step function change given the continued higher Health Enterprise implementation cost and margins not yet improving in the business as a whole outside of Health Enterprise. While our productivity initiatives are beginning to ramp, we need to further accelerate that to drive the second half improvement. In addition to capturing attrition benefit, we are planning a restructuring initiative, which combined will reduce headcount by approximately 3,000 people. We expect modest sequential Services margin improvement in the third quarter, with the fourth quarter clearly showing the greatest benefit given the timing of additional workforce actions and accelerating deals from our operating model changes. 
Seasonality in Document Outsourcing also aids sequential improvement in the fourth quarter. For Document Technology, we continue to expect margins between 11% to 13% for the full year, in part supported by pension expense coming in lower than originally anticipated. In the first half, restructuring actions were focused on technology. In contrast, our second half actions will be focused on Services. As a result, we expect relatively low restructuring costs due to natural attrition and relatively low average severance cost and Services. 
So in summary, we now expect to be at the lower end of our $0.95 to $1.01 adjusted earnings per share range. For the third quarter, we expect adjusted earnings per share between $0.22 and $0.24, reflecting normal seasonality and approximately $0.01 of restructuring. As I indicated earlier, operating cash flow was strong in the first half and we still expect to be within our $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion range despite the lower earnings, reflecting both good capital performance and lower production costs. We are committed to taking the needed actions to improve profitability and meet our 2015 earnings and cash flow guidance and we are confident that we have the right plan in place to deliver that and create value for our shareholders. 
With that, I'll hand it back to you, Ursula."

In Services, we are accelerating cost reduction actions and reprioritizing investments in the second half to position the business for stronger financial performance, while investing in the parts of the business that are critical to drive productivity and future growth. 
In Document Technology, we are focused on leading in the most attractive segments of the market and on delivering strong financial performance. So in short, it's all about focus at Xerox. In addition to leading the new attractive document segment markets, we are focused on making portfolio moves that strengthen our business financially and strategically. We are focused on optimizing our new Services operating model, productivity improvements across the business. We are focused on driving revenue and profit growth in every line of business.

So basically, accelerate our margin improvement over the second half. The other thing that's really important to recall is that Document Outsourcing is a meaningful part of our Services business, and as a percent of our Services business, that larger 1-week divested the ITO business and that has a natural seasonal pattern in the second half of the year where margins declined in the third quarter and then accelerate sequentially in the fourth quarter.

I'd note in the recent guidance we just gave, we're giving a range because it seems like when we said up to, if we didn't hit the top end of that number, people really dinged us for falling short when M&A is a little difficult to call. If I go to what we need to do to actually get more done, I'd say the core thing we need to do is improve our hit rate and the changes that we are looking to make is to pivot more of our activity to a proactive approach rather than just looking at deals that are being brokered in the market. That isn't something that happens overnight. I mentioned that we hired a new leader recently in order to head up that business.

We've had the sales force full. We have the line of business guys all in place. We have a good start to our operating model. And focus here is an important thing. I don't want anyone to believe that we're walking away from M&A on that we're not going to do it. But based on the reality of where we are, I think we're going to be in this $100 million to $400 million range. We're going to spend the last half of the year trying to get that done and making sure that we have a foundation, a strong foundation, a kind of unshakable foundation on the organic side of the business. So I know it's not where we want to end up, but it is where we are."

So when we look at these numbers and publish these numbers, it has developing markets at actual currency. If you make that adjustment in tech for supply, it actually moves the number by about 2 points. And that will be the case for the last couple of quarters that currencies in developing markets have really been under pressure. So I think if you look at it that way, I would say overall, supplies ebb and flow a little bit, but we don't see any kind of monumental shifts going on here. We think the business is pretty stable."

So are there things that are helping out cash flow onetime this year, whether it's pension or reversals or something like that, that we should be aware that are not sustainable?

And I guess, what I would go back to is we've got a broad set of actions that drive that, if you will, hockey stick of improvement. They start with the productivity that we talked about earlier and restructuring, and taking cost out of our delivery model and cost base. It also includes a lower level of losses at our -- in our Health Enterprise portfolio. We think we've got sufficient contingency for beyond predictability that we would see there, but that is part of our design model. I talked about the restructuring beyond delivery. We've got continued strong profitability in our Document Outsourcing business and it's got a seasonality that's heavier in the second half in terms of profit yield than the first half. And then we -- we're really committed to driving improved revenue dynamics. So we've been pretty visible all along that we thought that we would be at the lower end of the 2 to 4 revenue range. We've run at 1 for the first half of the year. So mathematically, we obviously, have to get to 3 in the second half. We've got headwinds that dissipates relative to Texas and suited loans. We've got New York ramping. On the other side of it, we'll have less in the way of inorganic revenue growth, but the combination of factors will get us to improved revenue dynamics in the second half and then that profit increase, its part of our model.

If you look at some of the charges that we've taken this year, especially in Health Enterprise outside of the recent impairment charge, which is obviously, noncash, some of those charges are just spread over the contract period where we're doing the Health Enterprise implementation. And so while they have some cash impact in the current year, the cash impact is really spread over a multiple year period. As we see declines in our Technology business that actually throws off a reduction in working capital. And so we get a natural benefit there as well as actually just managing our working capital really well.

And I mentioned the fact that we don't adjust out developing markets for constant currency basis. And so that kind of heightened the decline for us a little bit. On Services, really the only change there is the fact that we're a little light on M&A. And so that will make us a tad bit lighter in terms of just trying to accelerate growth in the back half. But it's important to understand the same way that the Services segment margin kind of ramps over the course of the back half, we have a very similar dynamic going on in revenue in large part because we're going to start to lap some big contract losses. So you'll recall the loss of the Texas Medicaid contract. If we look at first half over our second half, that's worth about 2 points to us.

Today, we reported the second quarter results that are largely in line with our guidance. During the call, we will update you on our strategy, provide detail on the second quarter, and share the areas where we are intensifying our focus throughout the balance of the year. Let's start with our strategy. 
Our direction has been consistent. We are making progress in some areas, but we know we can and should do better in other areas. Our direction is unchanged; we are making several shifts in the way that we execute against it. First, we have taken steps to create much greater focus in our Services business. We completed the divestiture of our ITO business, enabling a clear focus on the BPO and Document Outsourcing businesses. Last Friday, we announced a major change in our Government Healthcare strategy. We are focused on ensuring the success of the existing Health Enterprise implementations by limiting new pursuits with this platform. 
Second, we are modifying our acquisition expectations for the year, setting an achievable spend level, given our progress to date. 
Third, the Services leadership team is in place, with our last industry leader appointed in April. Our capabilities are fully staffed and sales resources are in place to market our full portfolio of Services. Collectively, these actions result in a sharpened focus on achieving organic improvements in our Services business. 
We have also announced changes in -- to our 2015 capital allocation plan. For the full year, we will increase our share repurchase by $300 million to $1.3 billion, and we will return $300 million to shareholders in dividends, unchanged. 
In summary, we have the right business strategy. We are re-prioritizing investments and accelerating our restructuring actions in Services to improve revenue and margin. While we have more work to do, we are making decisions and changes that will deliver attractive returns to our investors. 
Now let's look at quarter 2. We delivered adjusted earnings per share of $0.22, as in line with our guidance, which excludes the previously announced Healthcare software impairment charges of $0.08. Total revenue was $4.6 billion, which was down 3% in constant currency. 
We grew Services revenue modestly in constant currency. It was driven by a strong performance in Document Outsourcing, and we delivered on our Services margin guidance. 
And there are a few highlights in Services that I'd like to share. We are seeing indications that our new Services go-to-market model is taking root. Our opportunity pipeline is up sequentially, and we are seeing more cross-selling and better customer engagement. 
We made some important strides in innovation, introducing new levels of robotic automation to support our BPO offerings. For example, we recently announced ClearSight Automated Intelligence and ClearSight Case Management. We also introduced Managed Print Services innovations with the next-generation offerings and Workflow Automation solutions to reinforce our leadership in the industry. And for internal productivity, we're driving transformational change in our own capability operations with the ""call center of the future"" program. 
Now moving on to Document Technology. Revenue was down 7% in constant currency, which is modestly lower than what we had expected. Including DO, though, total document-related revenues were down 4% in constant currency. That's consistent with the trends that we've seen over the last several quarters. Document Technology margins were in line with expectations. And here are some highlights on Doc Tech. We retained our #1 position in equipment sales revenue market share for the 22nd straight quarter. We were pleased with install performance in the quarter, as most product segments improved, especially in the high end of our business. The new product introductions during the quarter and the launch of the iGen 5 earlier this month will enable us to continue in our leader position. 
Finally, we used our strong free cash flow, $349 million in the quarter, to acquire Health Communities Institute (sic) [Healthy Communities Institute] and Conestoga Business Solutions. We repurchased shares and supported our dividend program. 
Now I'll turn it over to Kathy to go over some details in the quarter. I'll be back later for -- to wrap things up. Kathy?"
103599,305695692,838539,"Xerox Corporation, Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 24, 2015",2015-07-24,"Earnings Calls","Xerox Holdings Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Ursula, and good morning, everyone. Our bottom line results were within our guidance for the quarter with Services profit in line, Tech profits a little light on modestly softer revenue, which was offset by a bit better nonoperating expenses. I wi",2051,"Thanks, Ursula, and good morning, everyone. Our bottom line results were within our guidance for the quarter with Services profit in line, Tech profits a little light on modestly softer revenue, which was offset by a bit better nonoperating expenses. I will cover the segments in more detail in a minute, but first, I will run through total company results for the second quarter. 
Total revenue in the quarter was down 7% at actual currency and 3% at constant currency. Growth in Services was more than offset by declines in Document Technology, which accelerated modestly, driven by continued weakness in developing markets and higher declines in supply revenue. The negative currency impact of 4 points on our top line was consistent with our expectations and with first quarter results. 
Gross margin of 31.1% was down 100 basis points year-over-year, driven by lower Technology gross margin as well as the greater mix of Services, which carries a lower margin. 
RD&E was slightly lower year-over-year and SAG, in absolute dollar terms, was down 6% helped by currency. However, as a percent of revenue, SAG was up 30 basis points year-over-year to 19.7%, as productivity benefits were more than offset by investments in Services. 
As a result, our second quarter operating margin decreased 160 basis points year-over-year and operating profit declined 22%. About 1/4 of the operating profit decline was driven by currency in developing markets, with the remainder of the decline coming from the causals that I just discussed. 
Moving down the income statement. Adjusted other net expense was $26 million lower year-over-year, driven by lower restructuring costs. Equity income was $29 million in the quarter, down $4 million year-over-year, driven by the continued impact of negative translation currency. Our second quarter adjusted tax rate of 25.8% was in the middle of our guidance and about 1 point lower year-over-year. 
Second quarter adjusted earnings per share was in the middle of our guidance range at $0.22. GAAP EPS from continuing operations in the quarter was $0.09 and includes the $0.08 impact from the Government Healthcare software impairment we announced last week, which was driven by the strategy change that Ursula already discussed. As this was a very large noncash charge, we excluded it from our adjusted results to better reflect underlying operating performance.
I'll now move on to discuss our operating performance in Services. Services revenue declined 3% and was up 1% at constant currency, which was consistent with the first quarter and a bit better than our guidance of roughly flat, driven by 4% growth in Document Outsourcing. Growth in Document Outsourcing reflects continued strong Xerox Partner Print Services growth as well as good equipment revenue growth in enterprise accounts from recent strong signings. 
BPO revenue was down 1%, reflecting the continued headwind from last year's larger contract losses, more than offsetting lower new ramp from softer signings in previous quarters. We continue to expect BPO growth to improve in the second half as we lap the larger contract losses. 
We completed 2 small acquisitions in the first half, and M&A remains a variable factor. I'll talk about this more when I cover cash flow and capital allocation. 
Total signings in the quarter were up 20% and new business signings were up 9%, driven by strong signings in Document Outsourcing as well as the recently signed New York Medicaid processing contract in BPO. We expect our go-to-market investments and move to industry alignment will yield improved new business signings growth as we progress through the year. Our pipeline continues to build and is up sequentially. 
Our renewal rate in the quarter was 82%, which was below our target range of 85% to 90%, and reflected, in part, lower renewal opportunities in the quarter. Year-to-date renewal rate is 87%. 
Turning to margin. Segment margin was 7.5% in the quarter, which was down 100 basis points year-over-year and in line with our expectations. As expected, margin was pressured by higher costs related to our Health Enterprise platform implementations. As we acknowledged last quarter, costs are continuing to run high, and we have more work to do to turn around financial performance in these accounts. 
Additionally, investments in our new Services operating model are not yet being fully offset by enhanced productivity from our operational initiatives, which are still ramping up. Partially offsetting these impacts was continued good margins in Document Outsourcing, albeit lower year-over-year as expected, and a year-over-year compare benefit related to the charge last year from the lost Nevada HIX business. So in summary, the quarter was in line for Services. 
We have made significant changes over the past year to move our Services business forward and will be taking additional restructuring actions to ensure our productivity ramps up faster throughout the second half. I'll discuss this more when we get to guidance. 
I'll now turn to Document Technology. Document Technology revenue in the quarter was down 7% at constant currency. As expected, currency had a 5-point negative impact, with revenue at actual currency down 12%. As we highlighted last quarter, we don't include developing markets in our constant-currency calculation, but if we had, revenue would've been down 6% at constant currency. So overall, revenue trends remain fairly stable. 
Looking at the details. Equipment revenue declines moderated, down 6% at constant currency in the second quarter versus down 8% in the first quarter and 10% in the fourth quarter. The improving trend reflects benefits from recent new-product launches, especially within high-end, where equipment revenue grew in the quarter. 
Offsetting the positive equipment trend were higher declines in supplies revenue, driven in part by developing markets, which were pressured by softening economies and currency. 
From an activity perspective, we saw improvements in growth in mid-range, high-end and higher-volume entry products. So overall, positive growth in installs across our product segments. 
Document Technology margin of 12.1% was down year-over-year, but up sequentially and in the middle of our 11% to 13% range for 2015. Year-over-year drivers included the anticipated higher pension expense and negative mix associated with improved equipment sales at lower margin. These were partially offset by a retiree health curtailment gain. 
So in closing, revenues were a little lighter than expected, but overall, a reasonable quarter for technology, with equipment trends and high-end performance being positive takeaways. 
Turning to cash flow. Cash flow from operations was $349 million in the quarter, above last year's cash flow of $325 million. This reflects good overall performance despite weaker profits, as working capital was a lower net use versus last year, driven by the following factors: Accounts receivable was a source of $56 million in the quarter versus the use last year, reflecting lower revenues and flat year-over-year DSO; accounts payable and accrued compensation was a $75 million lower use this year, reflecting timing of supplier payments. This was partially offset by a little higher inventory due to timing of shipments. 
Moving down the cash flow statement. Investing cash flows were an $831 million source, driven by proceeds of $930 million from the sale of the ITO business. This was partially offset by $102 million spent on CapEx and $20 million on acquisitions. Cash flow from financing was a $423 million use, which included $395 million spent on share repurchases and $83 million used for preferred and common stock dividends. As well, it reflects an increase in commercial paper, offset by payments of $250 million on senior notes. 
Our cash balance at the end of the quarter was $1.6 billion, an increase of $769 million since the end of the first quarter, driven by the proceeds received on June 30 from the ITO divestiture. So cash flow is strong and continues to track our expectations. 
Now I'll quickly go over capital structure. We ended the second quarter with $7.6 billion in debt. Applying 7:1 leverage on customer financing assets, our allocated financing debt at the end of the second quarter was $3.9 billion, leaving core debt of $3.7 billion. We manage our core debt to maintain credit metrics consistent with our investment-grade rating. Our capital structure remains fairly stable. 
If we move to the next slide, I'll review where we are in terms of capital allocation. Through the first half, we have repurchased $611 million in shares, spent $147 million on common stock dividends and $48 million on acquisition. 
Considering our first half performance and the opportunities we see for the balance of the year, we're adjusting our capital allocation plan. On acquisitions, we have spent about $50 million year-to-date. We now expect to spend between $100 million and $400 million for the full year. The bar is higher as we focus on organic improvements in Services for the next few quarters. We are working to enhance our proactive business development capabilities and recently hired a new leader for business development and M&A. 
On share repurchase, we are increasing our full year plan by $300 million to $1.3 billion. This reflects our view that our shares are attractively priced and a good investment as well as our reduced near-term plans for acquisition. This leaves approximately $200 million unallocated that we will deploy opportunistically. 
On debt, we retired our last tranche of debt coming due this year, $250 million in June, and we continue to expect to end the year at a debt balance of roughly $7.7 billion. And finally, on dividends, we continue to expect to spend just over $300 million. 
I'll now turn to a discussion of guidance. First, starting with revenue. Document Technology trends are stable, as expected improvements in high-end and financing have been offset by ongoing weakness in developing markets from softening economies as well as from currency. As a result, we are planning for Document Technology revenue to be down roughly 6% at constant currency in the second half and for the full year. 
Additionally, we are spending less on acquisitions than originally planned, dampening back-half Services revenue acceleration. At the total company level, we now anticipate full year revenue at constant currency will be down approximately 2%, consistent with prior year, and down 1 point from what we last communicated. 
Turning to margin. We expect Services margin will be at the low end of the 8.5% to 9% range for the year. With our margin at 7.5% for the first half, we need to average about 9.5% in the second half of the year to hit that level. This requires a step-function change, given the continued higher Health Enterprise implementation cost and margins not yet improving in the business as a whole outside of Health Enterprise. While our productivity initiatives are beginning to ramp, we need to further accelerate that to drive the second half improvement. 
In addition to capturing attrition benefit, we are planning a restructuring initiative, which, combined, will reduce headcount by approximately 3,000 people. 
We expect modest sequential Services margin improvement in the third quarter, with the fourth quarter clearly showing the greatest benefit, given the timing of additional workforce actions and accelerating deals from our operating model changes. Seasonality in Document Outsourcing also aids sequential improvement in the fourth quarter. 
For Document Technology, we continue to expect margins between 11% to 13% for the full year, in part supported by pension expense coming in lower than originally anticipated. 
In the first half, restructuring actions were focused on technology. In contrast, our second half actions will be focused on Services. As a result, we expect relatively low restructuring costs due to natural attrition and relatively low average severance cost in Services. 
So in summary, we now expect to be at the lower end of our $0.95 to $1.01 adjusted earnings per share range. For the third quarter, we expect adjusted earnings per share between $0.22 and $0.24, reflecting normal seasonality and approximately $0.01 of restructuring. 
As I indicated earlier, operating cash flow was strong in the first half, and we still expect to be within our $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion range despite the lower earnings, reflecting both good working capital performance and lower restructuring costs. 
We are committed to taking the needed actions to improve profitability and meet our 2015 earnings and cash flow guidance, and we are confident that we have the right plan in place to deliver that and create value for our shareholders. 
With that, I'll hand it back to you, Ursula."

We are committed to delivering our guidance, and we are doing everything that we can to overachieve. In Services, we are accelerating cost-reduction actions and re-prioritizing investments in the second half to position the business for stronger financial performance while investing in the parts of the business that are critical to drive productivity and future growth. 
In Document Technology, we are focused on leading in the most attractive segments of the market and on delivering strong financial performance. 
So in short, it's all about focus at Xerox. In addition to leading in the attractive Document segment markets, we are focused on making portfolio moves that strengthen our business financially and strategically; we are focused on optimizing our new Services operating model, [indiscernible] productivity improvements across the business; we are focused on driving revenue and profit growth in every line of business; and most importantly, we are focused on our people and on our clients. 
We remain committed to the -- our business strategy, and we are bullish about the markets that we serve and the opportunities that lie ahead. Thank you. 
And now let me turn it over to Leslie."

If you look at what I discussed in terms of the overall progression in Services' margin in the second half, it's very clear that outside of the Health Enterprise account, what we're expecting is ramping productivity between the third and the fourth quarter. So basically, accelerate our margin improvement over the second half. The other thing that's really important to recall is that Document Outsourcing is a meaningful part of our Services business and, as a percent of our Services business, got larger when we divested the ITO business. And that has a natural seasonal pattern in the second half of the year where margins decline in the third quarter and then accelerate sequentially in the fourth quarter. So those are some of the important puts and takes in terms of the acceleration in the back half of the year."

And so we also said at the same time that we expect that we might roll some of that over until next year. I'd note, in the recent guidance we just gave, we're giving a range, because it seems like when we said up to, if we didn't hit the top end of that number, people really dinged us for falling short when M&A is a little difficult to call. If I go to what we need to do to actually get more done, I'd say, the core thing we need to do is improve our hit rate. And the changes that we're looking to make is to pivot more of our activity to a proactive approach rather than just looking at deals that are being brokered in the market. That isn't something that happens overnight. I mentioned that we hired a new leader recently in order to head up that business. And in the meantime, we're also clearly looking to hold the bar a little higher as we focus over the next couple of quarters on really getting our organic improvements in Services accelerating."

I don't want anyone to believe that we're walking away from M&A, that we're not going to do it, but based on the reality of where we are, I think we're going to be in this $100 million to $400 million range.

And I guess, what I would go back to is we've got a broad set of actions that drive that, if you will, hockey stick of improvement. They start with the productivity that we talked about earlier and restructuring and taking cost out of our delivery model and cost base. It also includes a lower level of losses at our -- in our Health Enterprise portfolio. We think we've got sufficient contingency for -- beyond predictability that we would see there, but that is part of our design model. I talked about the restructuring beyond delivery. We've got continued strong profitability in our Document Outsourcing business, and it's got a seasonality that's heavier in the second half in terms of profit yield than the first half. And then, we're really committed to driving improved revenue dynamics. So we've been pretty visible all along that we thought that we would be at the lower end of the 2 to 4 revenue range. We've run at 1 for the first half of the year. So mathematically, we'd obviously have to get to 3 in the second half. We've got headwinds that dissipate relative to Texas and student loans, and we've got New York ramping. On the other side of it, we'll have less in the way of inorganic revenue growth, but the combination of factors would get us to improved revenue dynamics in the second half, and that profit increase is part of our model.

If you look at some of the charges that we've taken this year, especially in Health Enterprise outside of the recent impairment charge, which is, obviously, noncash, some of those charges are just spread over the contract period where we're doing the Health Enterprise implementations. And so while they have some cash impact in the current year, the cash impact is really spread over a multiple-year period. As we see declines in our Technology business, that actually throws off reduction in working capital, and so we get a natural benefit there, as well as actually just managing our working capital really well. And then, finally, the lower segment results are, in part, offset with a little lower restructuring.

Maybe help me understand -- or help us understand how you expect the trajectory of ramp for that -- for the benefits of that contract to be realized by the company. And then, with this kind of 18-months implementation timeline, when did that clock start ticking? Are you well ahead of that?

And the reason -- not the only reason, but a reason that we're off to a good start, as you referenced, is we invested ahead. So we took the financial hit in -- a little bit in the fourth quarter and in the first quarter from investing ahead. And our initial concept sessions with the states where we confirm designs have been very collaborative, all going well. So at this point, we're tracking well.

And to the extent that they do extend into '16, can you make it up anywhere? And if not, should we feel -- when we start to think about '16, I realize you're not going to give that, but is there sort of like a $0.02 tail, $0.02 impact to these things in the second half of the year.

So while we're seeing good execution in a place like high-end, it's being offset by developing markets; not stabilizing, but continuing to be a little bit soft, both from soft economies in developing markets and from currency. And I mentioned the fact that we don't adjust out developing markets for constant-currency basis. And so that kind of heightened the decline for us a little bit. On Services, really, the only change there is the fact that we're a little light on M&A, and so that will make us a tad bit lighter in terms of just trying to accelerate growth in the back half. But it's important to understand, the same way that the Services segment margin kind of ramps over the course of the back half, we have a very similar dynamic going on in revenue, in large part because we're going to start to lap some big contract losses. So you'll recall the loss of the Texas Medicaid contract. If we look at first half over our second half, that's worth about 2 points to us. So between that and New York, we have quite good, I'd say, organic revenue growth dynamics kind of naturally from half to half and throughout the second half of the year."

That, I'd say, shift in overall approach, not a shift in strategy for what we're trying to accomplish through M&A but shift in the execution approach, should help us to improve our hit rate. And if I had to kind of point to one soft underbelly in M&A is that with a large part of our pipeline coming through brokered deals, our hit rate is not as high as we would desire it to be.

During the call, we will update you on our strategy, provide detail on the second quarter, and share the areas where we are intensifying our focus throughout the balance of the year. Let's start with our strategy. 
Our direction has been consistent. We are making progress in some areas, but we know we can and should do better in other areas. Our direction is unchanged; we are making several shifts in the way that we execute against it. First, we have taken steps to create much greater focus in our Services business. We completed the divestiture of our ITO business, enabling a clear focus on the BPO and Document Outsourcing businesses. Last Friday, we announced a major change in our Government Healthcare strategy. We are focused on ensuring the success of the existing Health Enterprise implementations by limiting new pursuits with this platform. 
Second, we are modifying our acquisition expectations for the year, setting an achievable spend level, given our progress to date. 
Third, the Services leadership team is in place, with our last industry leader appointed in April. Our capabilities are fully staffed and sales resources are in place to market our full portfolio of Services. Collectively, these actions result in a sharpened focus on achieving organic improvements in our Services business. 
We have also announced changes in -- to our 2015 capital allocation plan. For the full year, we will increase our share repurchase by $300 million to $1.3 billion, and we will return $300 million to shareholders in dividends, unchanged. 
In summary, we have the right business strategy. We are re-prioritizing investments and accelerating our restructuring actions in Services to improve revenue and margin. While we have more work to do, we are making decisions and changes that will deliver attractive returns to our investors. 
Now let's look at quarter 2. We delivered adjusted earnings per share of $0.22. That's in line with our guidance, which excludes the previously announced Healthcare software impairment charges of $0.08. Total revenue was $4.6 billion, which is down 3% in constant currency. 
We grew Services revenue modestly in constant currency. It was driven by a strong performance in Document Outsourcing, and we delivered on our Services margin guidance. 
And there are a few highlights in Services that I'd like to share. We are seeing indications that our new Services go-to-market model is taking root. Our opportunity pipeline is up sequentially, and we are seeing more cross-selling and better customer engagement. 
We made some important strides in innovation, introducing new levels of robotic automation to support our BPO offerings. For example, we recently announced ClearSight Automated Intelligence and ClearSight Case Management. We also introduced Managed Print Services innovations with the next-generation offerings and Workflow Automation solutions to reinforce our leadership in the industry. And for internal productivity, we're driving transformational change in our own capability operations with the ""call center of the future"" program. 
Now moving on to Document Technology. Revenue was down 7% in constant currency, which is modestly lower than what we had expected. Including DO, though, total document-related revenues were down 4% in constant currency. That's consistent with the trends that we've seen over the last several quarters. Document Technology margins were in line with expectations. And here are some highlights on Doc Tech. We retained our #1 position in equipment sales revenue market share for the 22nd straight quarter. We were pleased with install performance in the quarter, as most product segments improved, especially in the high end of our business. The new product introductions during the quarter and the launch of the iGen 5 earlier this month will enable us to continue in our leader position. 
Finally, we used our strong free cash flow, $349 million in the quarter, to acquire Health Communities Institute (sic) [Healthy Communities Institute] and Conestoga Business Solutions. We repurchased shares and supported our dividend program. 
Now I'll turn it over to Kathy to go over some details in the quarter. I'll be back later for -- to wrap things up. Kathy?"
103599,305695692,838733,"Xerox Corporation, Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 24, 2015",2015-07-24,"Earnings Calls","Xerox Holdings Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Ursula, and good morning, everyone. Our bottom line results were within our guidance for the quarter with Services profit in line, Tech profits a little light on modestly softer revenue, which was offset by a bit better nonoperating expenses. I wi",2051,"Thanks, Ursula, and good morning, everyone. Our bottom line results were within our guidance for the quarter with Services profit in line, Tech profits a little light on modestly softer revenue, which was offset by a bit better nonoperating expenses. I will cover the segments in more detail in a minute, but first, I will run through total company results for the second quarter. 
Total revenue in the quarter was down 7% at actual currency and 3% at constant currency. Growth in Services was more than offset by declines in Document Technology, which accelerated modestly, driven by continued weakness in developing markets and higher declines in supply revenue. The negative currency impact of 4 points on our top line was consistent with our expectations and with first quarter results. 
Gross margin of 31.1% was down 100 basis points year-over-year, driven by lower Technology gross margin as well as the greater mix of Services, which carries a lower margin. 
RD&E was slightly lower year-over-year and SAG, in absolute dollar terms, was down 6% helped by currency. However, as a percent of revenue, SAG was up 30 basis points year-over-year to 19.7%, as productivity benefits were more than offset by investments in Services. 
As a result, our second quarter operating margin decreased 160 basis points year-over-year and operating profit declined 22%. About 1/4 of the operating profit decline was driven by currency in developing markets, with the remainder of the decline coming from the causals that I just discussed. 
Moving down the income statement. Adjusted other net expense was $26 million lower year-over-year, driven by lower restructuring cost. Equity income was $29 million in the quarter, down $4 million year-over-year, driven by the continued impact of negative translation currency. Our second quarter adjusted tax rate of 25.8% was in the middle of our guidance and about 1 point lower year-over-year. 
Second quarter adjusted earnings per share was in the middle of our guidance range at $0.22. GAAP EPS from continuing operations in the quarter was $0.09 and includes the $0.08 impact from the Government Healthcare software impairment we announced last week, which was driven by the strategy change that Ursula already discussed. As this was a very large noncash charge, we excluded it from our adjusted results to better reflect underlying operating performance.
I'll now move on to discuss our operating performance in Services. Services revenue declined 3% and was up 1% at constant currency, which was consistent with the first quarter and a bit better than our guidance of roughly flat, driven by 4% growth in Document Outsourcing. Growth in Document Outsourcing reflects continued strong Xerox Partner Print Services growth as well as good equipment revenue growth in enterprise accounts from recent strong signings. 
BPO revenue was down 1%, reflecting the continued headwind from last year's larger contract losses, more than offsetting lower new ramp from softer signings in previous quarters. We continue to expect BPO growth to improve in the second half as we lap the larger contract losses. 
We completed 2 small acquisitions in the first half, and M&A remains a variable factor. I'll talk about this more when I cover cash flow and capital allocation. 
Total signings in the quarter were up 20% and new business signings were up 9%, driven by strong signings in Document Outsourcing as well as the recently signed New York Medicaid processing contract in BPO. We expect our go-to-market investments and move to industry alignment will yield improved new business signings growth as we progress through the year. Our pipeline continues to build and is up sequentially. 
Our renewal rate in the quarter was 82%, which was below our target range of 85% to 90%, and reflected, in part, lower renewal opportunities in the quarter. Year-to-date renewal rate is 87%. 
Turning to margin. Segment margin was 7.5% in the quarter, which was down 100 basis points year-over-year and in line with our expectations. As expected, margin was pressured by higher costs related to our Health Enterprise platform implementations. As we acknowledged last quarter, costs are continuing to run high, and we have more work to do to turn around financial performance in these accounts. 
Additionally, investments in our new Services operating model are not yet being fully offset by enhanced productivity from our operational initiatives, which are still ramping up. Partially offsetting these impacts was continued good margins in Document Outsourcing, albeit lower year-over-year as expected, and a year-over-year compare benefit related to the charge last year from the lost Nevada HIX business. So in summary, the quarter was in line for Services. 
We have made significant changes over the past year to move our Services business forward and we'll be taking additional restructuring actions to ensure our productivity ramps up faster throughout the second half. I'll discuss this more when we get to guidance. 
I'll now turn to Document Technology. Document Technology revenue in the quarter was down 7% at constant currency. As expected, currency had a 5-point negative impact, with revenue at actual currency down 12%. As we highlighted last quarter, we don't include developing markets in our constant-currency calculation, but if we had, revenue would've been down 6% at constant currency. So overall, revenue trends remain fairly stable. 
Looking at the details. Equipment revenue declines moderated, down 6% at constant currency in the second quarter versus down 8% in the first quarter and 10% in the fourth quarter. The improving trend reflects benefits from recent new-product launches, especially within high-end, where equipment revenue grew in the quarter. 
Offsetting the positive equipment trend were higher declines in supplies revenue, driven in part by developing markets, which were pressured by softening economies and currency. 
From an activity perspective, we saw improvements in growth in mid-range, high-end and higher-volume entry products. So overall, positive growth in installs across our product segments. 
Document Technology margin of 12.1% was down year-over-year, but up sequentially and in the middle of our 11% to 13% range for 2015. Year-over-year drivers included the anticipated higher pension expense and negative mix associated with improved equipment sales at lower margins. These were partially offset by a retiree health curtailment gain. 
So in closing, revenues were a little lighter than expected, but overall, a reasonable quarter for technology, with equipment trends and high-end performance being positive takeaways. 
Turning to cash flow. Cash flow from operations was $349 million in the quarter, above last year's cash flow of $325 million. This reflects good overall performance despite weaker profits, as working capital was a lower net use versus last year, driven by the following factors: Accounts receivable was a source of $56 million in the quarter versus the use last year, reflecting lower revenues and flat year-over-year DSO; accounts payable and accrued compensation was a $75 million lower use this year, reflecting timing of supplier payments. This was partially offset by a little higher inventory due to timing of shipments. 
Moving down the cash flow statement. Investing cash flows were an $831 million source, driven by proceeds of $930 million from the sale of the ITO business. This was partially offset by $102 million spent on CapEx and $20 million on acquisitions. Cash flow from financing was a $423 million use, which included $395 million spent on share repurchases and $83 million used for preferred and common stock dividends. As well, it reflects an increase in Commercial Paper, offset by payments of $250 million on Senior Notes. 
Our cash balance at the end of the quarter was $1.6 billion, an increase of $769 million since the end of the first quarter, driven by the proceeds received on June 30 from the ITO divestiture. So cash flow is strong and continues to track our expectations. 
Now I'll quickly go over capital structure. We ended the second quarter with $7.6 billion in debt. Applying 7:1 leverage on customer financing assets, our allocated financing debt at the end of the second quarter was $3.9 billion, leaving core debt of $3.7 billion. We manage our core debt to maintain credit metrics consistent with our investment-grade rating. Our capital structure remains fairly stable. 
If we move to the next slide, I'll review where we are in terms of capital allocation. Through the first half, we have repurchased $611 million in shares, spent $147 million on common stock dividends and $48 million on acquisitions. 
Considering our first half performance and the opportunities we see for the balance of the year, we're adjusting our capital allocation plan. On acquisitions, we have spent about $50 million year-to-date. We now expect to spend between $100 million and $400 million for the full year. The bar is higher as we focus on organic improvements in Services for the next few quarters. We are working to enhance our proactive business development capabilities and recently hired a new leader for business development and M&A. 
On share repurchase, we are increasing our full year plan by $300 million to $1.3 billion. This reflects our view that our shares are attractively priced and a good investment as well as our reduced near-term plans for acquisition. This leaves approximately $200 million unallocated that we will deploy opportunistically. 
On debt, we retired our last tranche of debt coming due this year, $250 million in June, and we continue to expect to end the year at a debt balance of roughly $7.7 billion. And finally, on dividends, we continue to expect to spend just over $300 million. 
I'll now turn to a discussion of guidance. First, starting with revenue. Document Technology trends are stable, as expected improvements in high-end and financing have been offset by ongoing weakness in developing markets from softening economies as well as from currency. As a result, we are planning for Document Technology revenue to be down roughly 6% at constant currency in the second half and for the full year. 
Additionally, we are spending less on acquisitions than originally planned, dampening back-half Services revenue acceleration. At the total company level, we now anticipate full year revenue at constant currency will be down approximately 2%, consistent with prior year, and down 1 point from what we last communicated. 
Turning to margin. We expect Services margin will be at the low end of the 8.5% to 9% range for the year. With our margin at 7.5% for the first half, we need to average about 9.5% in the second half of the year to hit that level. This requires a step-function change, given the continued higher Health Enterprise implementation costs and margins not yet improving in the business as a whole outside of Health Enterprise. While our productivity initiatives are beginning to ramp, we need to further accelerate that to drive the second half improvement. 
In addition to capturing attrition benefits, we are planning a restructuring initiative, which combined, will reduce headcount by approximately 3,000 people. 
We expect modest sequential Services margin improvement in the third quarter, with the fourth quarter clearly showing the greatest benefits, given the timing of additional workforce actions and accelerating deals from our operating model changes. Seasonality in Document Outsourcing also aids sequential improvement in the fourth quarter. 
For Document Technology, we continue to expect margins between 11% to 13% for the full year, in part supported by pension expense coming in lower than originally anticipated. 
In the first half, restructuring actions were focused on technology. In contrast, our second half actions will be focused on Services. As a result, we expect relatively low restructuring costs due to natural attrition and relatively low average severance cost in Services. 
So in summary, we now expect to be at the lower end of our $0.95 to $1.01 adjusted earnings per share range. For the third quarter, we expect adjusted earnings per share between $0.22 and $0.24, reflecting normal seasonality and approximately $0.01 of restructuring. 
As I indicated earlier, operating cash flow was strong in the first half, and we still expect to be within our $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion range despite the lower earnings, reflecting both good working capital performance and lower restructuring costs. 
We are committed to taking the needed actions to improve profitability and meet our 2015 earnings and cash flow guidance, and we are confident that we have the right plan in place to deliver that and create value for our shareholders. 
With that, I'll hand it back to you, Ursula."

We are committed to delivering our guidance, and we are doing everything that we can to overachieve. In Services, we are accelerating cost-reduction actions and re-prioritizing investments in the second half to position the business for stronger financial performance while investing in the parts of the business that are critical to drive productivity and future growth. 
In Document Technology, we are focused on leading in the most attractive segments of the market and on delivering strong financial performance. 
So in short, it's all about focus at Xerox. In addition to leading in the attractive Document segment markets, we are focused on making portfolio moves that strengthen our business financially and strategically; we are focused on optimizing our new Services operating model, [indiscernible] productivity improvements across the business; we are focused on driving revenue and profit growth in every line of business; and most importantly, we are focused on our people and on our clients.

If you look at what I discussed in terms of the overall progression in Services' margin in the second half, it's very clear that outside of the Health Enterprise account, what we're expecting is ramping productivity between the third and the fourth quarter to basically accelerate our margin improvement over the second half. The other thing that's really important to recall is that Document Outsourcing is a meaningful part of our Services business and, as a percent of our Services business, got larger when we divested the ITO business. And that has a natural seasonal pattern in the second half of the year where margins decline in the third quarter and then accelerate sequentially in the fourth quarter. So those are some of the important puts and takes in terms of the acceleration in the back half of the year."

I'd note, in the recent guidance we just gave, we're giving a range, because it seems like when we said up to, if we didn't hit the top end of that number, people really dinged us for falling short when M&A is a little difficult to call. If I go to what we need to do to actually get more done, I'd say, the core thing we need to do is improve our hit rate. And the changes that we're looking to make is to pivot more of our activity to a proactive approach rather than just looking at deals that are being brokered in the market. That isn't something that happens overnight. I mentioned that we hired a new leader recently in order to head up that business. And in the meantime, we're also clearly looking to hold the bar a little higher as we focus over the next couple of quarters on really getting our organic improvements in Services accelerating."

So when we look at these numbers and publish these numbers, it has developing markets at actual currency. If you make that adjustment in Tech for supplies, it actually moves the number by about 2 points, and that would be the case for the last couple of quarters, that currencies in developing markets have really been under pressure. So I think, if you look at it that way, I would say, overall, supplies ebb and flow a little bit, but we don't see any kind of monumental shifts going on here.

And I guess, what I would go back to is we've got a broad set of actions that drive that, if you will, hockey stick of improvement. They start with the productivity that we talked about earlier and restructuring and taking cost out of our delivery model and cost base. It also includes a lower level of losses at our -- in our Health Enterprise portfolio. We think we've got sufficient contingency for -- beyond predictability that we would see there, but that is part of our design model. I talked about the restructuring beyond delivery. We've got continued strong profitability in our Document Outsourcing business, and it's got a seasonality that's heavier in the second half in terms of profit yield than the first half. And then, we're really committed to driving improved revenue dynamics. So we've been pretty visible all along that we thought that we would be at the lower end of the 2 to 4 revenue range. We've run at 1 for the first half of the year. So mathematically, we'd obviously have to get to 3 in the second half. We've got headwinds that dissipate relative to Texas and student loans, and we've got New York ramping. On the other side of it, we'll have less in the way of inorganic revenue growth, but the combination of factors would get us to improved revenue dynamics in the second half, and that profit increase is part of our model.

If you look at some of the charges that we've taken this year, especially in Health Enterprise outside of the recent impairment charge, which is, obviously, noncash, some of those charges are just spread over the contract period where we're doing the Health Enterprise implementations. And so while they have some cash impact in the current year, the cash impact is really spread over a multiple-year period. As we see declines in our Technology business, that actually throws off a reduction in working capital, and so we get a natural benefit there, as well as actually just managing our working capital really well. And then, finally, the lower segment results are, in part, offset with a little lower restructuring. So as we look out to the back half based on where we've been tracking year-to-date this year, we feel very comfortable about where we're at in meeting our guidance."

So while we're seeing good execution in a place like high-end, it's being offset by developing markets; not stabilizing, but continuing to be a little bit soft, both from soft economies in developing markets and from currency. And I mentioned the fact that we don't adjust out developing markets for constant-currency basis. And so that kind of heightened the decline for us a little bit. On Services, really, the only change there is the fact that we're a little light on M&A, and so that will make us a tad bit lighter in terms of just trying to accelerate growth in the back half. But it's important to understand, the same way that the Services segment margin kind of ramps over the course of the back half, we have a very similar dynamic going on in revenue, in large part because we're going to start to lap some big contract losses. So you'll recall the loss of the Texas Medicaid contract. If we look at first half over our second half, that's worth about 2 points to us.

And kind of my business experience is if you've got the acquiree as a client, that's not a good place to be. When you have both the acquirer and the acquiree, you are better positioned. So I would expect -- and we don't do the exact same work with each side, if you will, in some of the big, visibly announced, planned mergers. So I think, for us, there's always the chance that you're going to get -- you're going to be part of the synergy-savings play and help those lead customers achieve their synergy savings. We think we -- we're well positioned to participate in that because we're on both sides of the visible transactions. We have very strong client referenceability and we tend to see the clients wanting to consolidate and leverage providers, where they would be more likely -- even use us more broadly."

Today, we reported our third quarter results and provided an update on the fourth quarter and full-year outlook. During this call, we will update you on our strategy, provide details on our third quarter, and",830,"Good morning and thanks for joining our call. Today, we reported our third quarter results and provided an update on the fourth quarter and full-year outlook. During this call, we will update you on our strategy, provide details on our third quarter, and share the actions that we are taking to improve our business. So let me begin with a look at our priorities. 
In Services, our goal is to lead an attractive segments of the business Services market and throughout the year, we've taken steps to strengthen this business, including: acquisitions to build our Commercial Healthcare offerings and the divestiture of ITO. As we announced 2 weeks ago, we are also taking action to improve our future financial performance and significantly reduce the volatility of our results with the uptake to our Government Healthcare business strategy. With these strategy changes to our Government Healthcare business, we are more clearly focused on the most profitable segments of our Services business. 
In Document Technology, our efforts are focused on continuing to lead the market. We maintained our #1 market share position in equipment sales revenue for the 23rd straight quarter, closing in on 6 years, a solid record of leadership and we're seeing good demand from small and mid-sized businesses, and important growth segment through Global Imaging Systems and with the growth of our partner print solutions sold through our channels. 
Also, in the third quarter, we launched our new communication platform: work can work better, and we are pleased with the reactions so far. Our new advertising and digital content highlight how we're enabling businesses and governments to achieve better results by helping them work better. 
For our shareholders, we have returned more than 50% of our free cash flow to them over the last 4 years and we are on track to do even more this year. Through September, we completed $1.3 billion in share repurchases, achieving our full year expectations. Although we have already taken steps to accelerate cost reductions and prioritize investments to drive improved revenue, productivity and margins, we announced today that the Xerox Board of Directors have authorized a comprehensive review of structural options for the company's business portfolio and capital allocation with the goal of enhancing shareholder value. Now let's look at the third quarter performance.
During the third quarter, we delivered adjusted earnings per share of $0.24 that's in line with our guidance, which excludes $0.05 related to the amortization of intangibles and $0.23 from the previously announced Health Enterprise charge. Because the circumstances in Health Enterprise are unique, I'll speak to our adjusted results in the quarter, which better reflects our underlying operating performance. 
Total adjusted revenue was $4.4 billion, down 4% in constant currency. On an adjusted basis, Services revenue was consistent with the same period last year and we delivered sequential improvement in our Services margin. Document Outsourcing continues to perform well overall and BPO was down 1%, which was consistent with previous quarters. 
There are a few highlights in Services that I would like to share. Acquisitions remain a key aspect of our portfolio in management strategy. And in the third quarter, we acquired RSA Medical and iPas, expanding our suite of healthcare related offerings. Our new go-to-market teams are establishing leadership roles in their industries. As examples, our retail team convened top clients and thought leaders at a retail -- Xerox retail Industry Summit, and Xerox Analytics were demonstrated at the grand opening of MCB, University of Michigan's one-of-a-kind test site for connected and automated vehicles. And a number of Services offerings received external recognition. We retained a top position in the Managed Print Services market -- landscape report for the sixth consecutive year. And for the third year running, Everest group rated Xerox as a leading service provider for contact center outsourcing BPO. 
Now moving on to Document Technology. Document Technology revenue was down 9% in constant currency, which is lower than we had expected and mostly was driven by increased pressure in developing markets. Excluding the impact of developing markets, the revenue trends in Document Technology remains stable. Document Technology margin of 12.8% was strong and within our guidance range of 11% to 13%. Some additional Doc Tech highlights. We're seeing the benefits of recent product launches with strong demand for our new entry production color devices and we showcased the best of team Xerox at Graph Expo, the largest U.S. trade show for the Graphic Communications market, including 2 new Xerox production digital presses, the Xerox iGen 5 press and the Xerox Rialto 9 inkjet press. We also rolled out FreeFlow core cloud, which is the latest release in our leading Workflow Automation portfolio. 
In total, the company generated operating cash flow of $271 million and we returned $774 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Then now I'll turn it over to Kathy to provide more details on the quarter. I'll be back later to share fourth quarter guidance and wrap up. Kathy?"
103599,311627840,881608,"Xerox Corporation, Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2015",2015-10-26,"Earnings Calls","Xerox Holdings Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Ursula and good morning, everyone. I'll start with an overview of our financial performance before moving into a more detailed discussion of the segment. As announced 2 weeks ago, this quarter, we reported a pretax charge of $389 million or $241 m",1194,"Thanks, Ursula and good morning, everyone. I'll start with an overview of our financial performance before moving into a more detailed discussion of the segment. As announced 2 weeks ago, this quarter, we reported a pretax charge of $389 million or $241 million after tax, reflecting that we no longer expect to fully complete the Health Enterprise platform projects in California and in Montana. This decision will improve Xerox's future financial performance as these implementations were generating losses and will remove an element of risk and volatility in the business. Accordingly, I'll provide results and growth rates, adjusting for the charge to give better visibility to the underlying business performance in the quarter. 
Our bottom line results were within our third quarter guidance with revenues a bit softer and profitability generally in line with our expectations. Total revenue in the quarter was down 7% at actual currency and 4% at constant currency. Services was flat at constant currency as growth in Document Outsourcing offset a 1% decline in BPO. Document Technology declined 9% at constant currency and was impacted by increasing weakness in developing markets. Gross margin of 30.9% was down 130 basis points year-over-year, driven by a lower technology equipment gross margin as well as the greater mix of services, which carries the lower-margin. 
RD&E was slightly lower year-over-year. SAG in absolute dollars was down 9%. SAG as a percent of revenue was better by 40 basis points helped by currency and our ongoing productivity initiatives as well as lower compensation and benefit expense. Our third quarter operating margin of 8.7% decreased 90 basis points year-over-year and operating profit declined 16%. Over 40% of the operating profit decline was driven by currency and developing markets. 
Moving down the income statement. Adjusted other net expense was $8 million lower year-over-year, driven by lower restructuring costs. Equity income was $40 million in the quarter, down $4 million year-over-year, driven in part by the continued impact of negative translation currency. Our third quarter adjusted tax rate of 24.6% was at the low end of our guidance range of 25% to 27%. Our third quarter adjusted EPS was at the top of our guidance range at $0.24.
I'll now move on to discuss our operational performance and Services. Services revenue declined 3% and was flat at constant currency. BPO was down 1%, consistent with the second quarter, reflecting the headwind from last year's larger contract losses, lower inorganic contribution as well as lower new contract ramp from softer signing from previous quarters. Good growth continues in Document Outsourcing, up 3%, driven by strong Xerox Partner Print Services growth as well as good equipment revenue growth and enterprise accounts from recent strong signings. 
Total signings in the third quarter were down 7%, but are up 5% on a trailing 12-month basis. New business signings were down 9% year-over-year as growth in Document Outsourcing was more than offset by declines in BPO. Our go-to-market investments and move to industry business groups are beginning to result in good growth and shorter sales cycle offerings such as customer care, but we have yet to see a pickup in higher-value longer sales cycle offerings. 
Our renewal rate in the quarter was 89%, which was at the high end of our target range of the 85% to 90% and reflects continued overall good customer retention. Turning to margin. Segment margin was 8.1%, in line with our expectations for sequential improvement from 7.5% in the second quarter. Margin was down 100 basis points year-over-year, reflecting investments in resources and in our new Services operating model, negative business mix within BPO as well as higher overhead as we work to lean out cost following the ITO divestiture. We continue to expect productivity from operational initiatives and our recent restructuring to yield increasing benefits in the fourth quarter. 
I'll now turn to Document Technology. Document Technology revenue in the quarter was down 9% at constant currency. Developing market weakness, including negative currency, accelerated in the third quarter, contributing more than 1/3 of the constant currency revenue decline. Also, contributing to the decline in the third quarter was high-end revenue. After good equipment growth in the second quarter, high end was weaker in the third quarter, reflecting in part timing of product launches, including our recently announced iGen 5, which had helped us drive improvement in the fourth quarter. 
From a total printing perspective, combining Document Technology with Document Outsourcing, revenues been fairly stable, down 5% in the third quarter and down 4% year-to-date at constant currency. Turning to activity. We saw a strong growth in entry A4 color, driven by new products, relatively stable results in mid-range, but weaker installs and mix of products and high-end. Document Technology margin of 12.8% was down year-over-year, but within our full year guidance of 11% to 13%. Year-over-year drivers include negative equipment mix given better A4 results and the anticipated higher pension expense, partially offset by lower compensation and benefit expense. 
We continue to actively manage our cost base to ensure alignment to revenue trends. So in closing, Doc Tech revenues were slightly lower-than-expected, but profitability remains strong. 
Turning now to cash. Cash flow from operations was $271 million in the quarter, which was lower than prior year cash flow of $595 million. The decline year-over-year reflects lower profit and Document Technology with the 2 largest drivers being continued negative currency impact and developing markets weakness. Lower profits and Services, driven by margin decline as well as the expected loss of cash flow from the ITO business following the divestiture. Additionally, working capital was a use of cash due to timing of vendor payments as well as lower demand in timing of shipment impacting inventory. 
The Health Enterprise charge in the third quarter had a negligible impact on cash in the period and we anticipate the approximate $225 million of cash outflows will be spread over time. Moving down the cash flow statement. Investing cash flows were $206 million use, driven by $65 million spent on CapEx and $153 million on acquisition. Cash flow from financing was an $888 million used, which included $691 million spent on share repurchases and $90 million used for preferred and common stock dividends. And our cash balance at the end of the quarter was just over $800 million. So cash flow in the third quarter was impacted by lower operating profit as well as working capital timing. 
Now I'll review our capital structure. We ended the third quarter with $7.6 billion in debt. Applying 7:1 leverage on customer financing assets, our allocated financing debt at the end of the third quarter was $3.9 billion, leaving core debt of $3.7 billion. In the fourth quarter, we are now anticipating an additional $200 million debt reduction, which will bring our year-end debt level to approximately $7.4 billion, a $350 million reduction for the year. This reduction will help offset the impact to our credit metrics from lower earnings and the reduction in our financing assets. 
Overall, we continue to manage our capital structure to maintain credit metrics consistent with our investment-grade rating. I'll now hand it back to Ursula to discuss capital allocation and guidance."

As Kathy just mentioned, we have spent about $200 million on acquisitions year-to-date and we don't anticipate closing any large acquisitions before year-end. We now expect to deploy an additional $200 million of capital toward debt reduction. We will spend $300 million on dividends. And lastly, on share repurchase, we reached our full year target of 1.3 billion in quarter 3, which represents a 115 million share reduction -- reduction in shares year-to-date and a 10% reduction of our share count this year. I will now discuss guidance. 
Starting with revenue. We expect improvement in the third quarter, but considering current trends, we now expect full year revenue will be down approximately 3% at constant currency, in line with year-to-date results to with Services flat-to-up 1%, and Document Technology down 6% to 7%. 
From a margin perspective in Doc Tech, we expect continued strong margins with quarter 4 and full year margins in the middle of our full year range of 11% to 13%. In Services, we anticipate sequential improvement and for margins to be approximately 9% in quarter 4. So we're making progress in Services, but we do not expect to get to the 8.5% margin for the full year. And for earnings, we expect quarter 4 adjusted EPS to be between $0.28 to $0.30 and for the full year, we anticipate being at the lower end of our previously guided range of $0.95 to $1.01. 
Lastly, we expect free cash flow in the range $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion with modestly lower operating cash flow of between $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion and CapEx that is now also expected to be lower. So in summary, for the third quarter, we achieved adjusted earnings in line with our guidance, but we will -- we have come through the 9-month point and we're not satisfied with our performance. We are sharpening our focus on execution across the enterprise. We continue to lead an aggressive agenda to strengthen our offering portfolio and targeting segments where we are best positioned to compete and differentiate. And across both Services and technology, we are prioritizing investments, taking actions to improve revenue and margin and managing costs in Doc Tech to maintain our profitability. 
And as previously mentioned, we are reviewing structural options for the company's business portfolio on capital allocation with the goal of enhancing shareholder value. As we undertake this activity, we are focused on the execution of our strategy and remaining fully committed to our customers, partners, suppliers and employees and to delivering strong financial results. 
Finally, before we go to Q&A as you know, this is Kathy Mikells last earnings calls. I'd like to thank Kathy for her financial leadership and contributions to Xerox during her time with us.

And then, obviously, one of the big things that we've got to continue to execute on is just managing working capital.

So what -- and they and we, were with us on -- for us to stay in a substantive long-term role as a fiscal agent operator, which is the primary component of our operating revenue in both states.

It's about a point on the Services revenue dynamics for the next 3 quarters and it was also roughly 1 point -- not quite, but roughly 1 point last quarter. So that's a little bit of a downside. The upside is that we have been very unpredictable. As you know, our Services margins have not been -- we have not been as consistent as we need to be because we have been recognizing more cost to development would kind of hit the period INE because of percentage-of-completion accounting.

Really for Ursula and Bob, I guess, in the context of how you talked about your capital allocation going forward, but given also the new context about looking at strategic options. Philosophically, how do guys think about doing -- not tuck ins, but larger Services deals? And it sounds like you're going to have the $700 million left over after capital allocation of generative cash and will lead to do deals. I don't know that, that could get to you without levering up something significant. But clearly, there's some sort of intent behind making this announcement the way that you guys have announced it. So I just love to get your thoughts on philosophically your view on making a larger Services deals.

So sorry, Jim. And I was captured that. Our capital for this year. We have essentially completed our share repurchase activities. We've -- as I said earlier. And we are still active in the market in M&A, but we have a pipeline and that pipeline doesn't lead to anything significant for the remainder of this year. So from a capital allocation on those 2 items, I think that we're really pretty much settled. CapEx we talked about the fact that it's coming in a little bit lighter that will help us. We're focused on remaining investment-grade, that's one of the things that you know that we think we need for both our Services and tech business, and we'll continue to make sure that we manage our capital to ensure that we fall inside there. That's one. Second is the fragmented nature of the Services market and our therefore, M&A activities for the future. I mean, one of the things that we will continue to need to do in the Services business is to consolidate some of this fragmentation, particularly in this area where we have strength and I would suspect -- I would plan to and you should expect that we will continue to do that type of activity. As we go forward and the business as usual kind of a manner. I didn't quite get to the $700 million that you got to, because we haven't quite done 2016 yet, which I think is what you were looking towards when you were making those numbers, that those projections, unmanned out. But as I said earlier, I don't think that we see in the business as usual, a lot of change in returning value to shareholders to an M&A structure that continues to strengthen our Services business and to a debt structure that allows us to remain capital investment-grade. So those are the 3 kinds of tenants that we're sitting on right now. And that's why I intend to come out as well. We'll see if there's anything that changes as we go forward. We'll tell you about it.

As we mix more towards customer care is a lower-margin business, we're trying to mix up towards more -- towards higher-margin, more innovative solutions while we try to actually innovate in customer care. So the reason why I bring it up is our M&A strategy is going to be towards these types of areas where the margins are stronger, where we don't continue to -- where we want to stay leader in our customer care. We don't want to walk away from that business. But we just are not selling enough of the higher-margin businesses -- business areas and that's one of the things that we have to fix and we haven't quite cracked that nut yet. So we're going to continue to acquire in those areas, so that we can actually move away from the more commodity-based customer care implementations."

Today, we reported our third quarter results and provided an update on the fourth quarter and full year outlook. During this call, we will update you on our strategy, provide details on our third quarter results and share the actions that we are taking to improve our business. So let me begin with a look at our priorities.
In Services, our goal is to lead an attractive segments of the business services market. And throughout the year, we've taken steps to strengthen this business, including acquisitions to build our Commercial Healthcare offerings and the divestiture of ITO. As we announced 2 weeks ago, we are also taking action to improve our future financial performance and significantly reduce the volatility of our results with the uptake to our Government Healthcare business strategy. With these strategy changes to our Government Healthcare business, we are more clearly focused on the most profitable segments of our Services business.
In Document Technology, our efforts are focused on continuing to lead the market. We maintained our #1 market share position in equipment sales revenue for the 23rd straight quarter, closing in on 6 years, a solid record of leadership. And we're seeing good demand from small and mid-sized businesses, an important growth segment, through Global Imaging Systems and with the growth of our partner print solutions sold through our channels. 
Also, in the third quarter, we launched our new communication platform, work can work better, and we are pleased with the reactions so far. Our new advertising and digital content highlight how we're enabling businesses and governments to achieve better results by helping them work better.
For our shareholders, we have returned more than 50% of our free cash flow to them over the last 4 years, and we are on track to do even more this year. Through September, we completed $1.3 billion in share repurchases, achieving our full year expectations. Although we have already taken steps to accelerate cost reductions and prioritize investments to drive improved revenue, productivity and margins, we announced today that the Xerox Board of Directors have authorized a comprehensive review of structural options for the company's business portfolio and capital allocation with the goal of enhancing shareholder value.
Now let's look at the third quarter performance.
During the third quarter, we delivered adjusted earnings per share of $0.24 that's in line with our guidance, which excludes $0.05 related to the amortization of intangibles and $0.23 from the previously announced Health Enterprise charge. Because the circumstances in Health Enterprise are unique, I'll speak to our adjusted results in the quarter, which better reflects our underlying operating performance.
Total adjusted revenue was $4.4 billion, down 4% in constant currency. On an adjusted basis, Services revenue was consistent with the same period last year and we delivered sequential improvement in our Services margin. Document Outsourcing continued to perform well overall and BPO was down 1%, which was consistent with the previous quarters. 
There are a few highlights in Services that I would like to share. Acquisitions remain a key aspect of our portfolio management strategy. And in the third quarter, we acquired RSA Medical and iPAS, expanding our suite of health care-related offerings. Our new go-to-market teams are establishing leadership roles in their industries. As examples, our retail team convened top clients and thought leaders at a retail -- Xerox retail industry summit, and Xerox analytics were demonstrated at the grand opening of Mcity, the University of Michigan's one-of-a-kind test site for connected and automated vehicles. And a number of Services offerings received external recognition. We retained the top position in Quocirca Managed Print Services market -- landscape report for the sixth consecutive year. And for the third year running, Everest Group rated Xerox as a leading service provider for contact center outsourcing BPO.
Now moving on to Document Technology. Document Technology revenue was down 9% in constant currency, which is lower than we had expected and mostly was driven by increased pressures in developing markets. Excluding the impact of developing markets, the revenue trends in Document Technology remained stable. Document Technology margin of 12.8% was strong and within our guidance range of 11% to 13%.
Some additional Doc Tech highlights. We're seeing the benefits of recent product launches with strong demand for our new entry production color devices. And we showcased the best of team Xerox at Graph Expo, the largest U.S. trade show for the graphic communications market, including 2 new Xerox digital production color presses, the Xerox iGen 5 press and the Xerox Rialto 900 inkjet press. We also rolled out FreeFlow Core Cloud, which is the latest release in our leading Workflow Automation portfolio.
In total, the company generated operating cash flow of $271 million and we returned $774 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.
And now I'll turn it over to Kathy to provide more details on the quarter. I'll be back later to share fourth quarter guidance and wrap up. Kathy?"
103599,311627840,881643,"Xerox Corporation, Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2015",2015-10-26,"Earnings Calls","Xerox Holdings Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Ursula, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with an overview of our financial performance before moving into a more detailed discussion of the segment. As announced 2 weeks ago, this quarter, we recorded a pretax charge of $389 million or $241",1196,"Thanks, Ursula, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with an overview of our financial performance before moving into a more detailed discussion of the segment. As announced 2 weeks ago, this quarter, we recorded a pretax charge of $389 million or $241 million after tax, reflecting that we no longer expect to fully complete the Health Enterprise platform projects in California and in Montana. This decision will improve Xerox's future financial performance as these implementations were generating losses and will remove an element of risk and volatility in the business. Accordingly, I'll provide results and growth rates, adjusting for the charge to give better visibility to the underlying business performance in the quarter.
Our bottom line results were within our third quarter guidance, with revenues a bit softer and profitability generally in line with our expectations. Total revenue in the quarter was down 7% at actual currency and 4% at constant currency. Services was flat at constant currency as growth in Document Outsourcing offset a 1% decline in BPO. Document Technology declined 9% at constant currency and was impacted by increasing weakness in developing markets. Gross margin of 30.9% was down 130 basis points year-over-year, driven by a lower technology equipment gross margin as well as the greater mix of services, which carries a lower margin.
RD&E was slightly lower year-over-year. SAG in absolute dollars was down 9%. SAG as a percent of revenue was better by 40 basis points, helped by currency, our ongoing productivity initiative as well as lower compensation and benefit expense.
Our third quarter operating margin of 8.7% decreased 90 basis points year-over-year and operating profit declined 16%. Over 40% of the operating profit decline was driven by currency and developing markets.
Moving down the income statement. Adjusted other net expense was $8 million lower year-over-year, driven by lower restructuring costs. Equity income was $40 million in the quarter, down $4 million year-over-year, driven in part by the continued impact of negative translation currency. Our third quarter adjusted tax rate of 24.6% was at the low end of our guidance range of 25% to 27%. Our third quarter adjusted EPS was at the top of our guidance range at $0.24.
I'll now move on to discuss our operational performance and services. Services revenue declined 3% and was flat at constant currency. BPO was down 1%, consistent with the second quarter, reflecting the headwind from last year's larger contract losses, lower inorganic contribution as well as lower new contract ramp from softer signings in previous quarters. Good growth continues in Document Outsourcing, up 3%, driven by strong Xerox Partner Print Services growth as well as good equipment revenue growth and enterprise accounts from recent strong signings.
Total signings in the third quarter were down 7% but are up 5% on a trailing 12-month basis. New business signings were down 9% year-over-year as growth in Document Outsourcing was more than offset by declines in BPO. Our go-to-market investments and move to industry business groups are beginning to result in good growth and shorter sales cycle offerings such as customer care, but we have yet to see a pickup in higher-value, longer sales cycle offerings.
Our renewal rate in the quarter was 89%, which was at the high end of our target range of 85% to 90% and reflects continued overall good customer retention.
Turning to margin. Segment margin was 8.1%, in line with our expectations for sequential improvement from 7.5% in the second quarter. Margin was down 100 basis points year-over-year, reflecting investments in resources and in our new Services operating model, negative business mix within BPO as well as higher overhead as we work to lean out costs following the ITO divestiture. We continue to expect productivity from operational initiatives and our recent restructuring to yield increasing benefits in the fourth quarter.
I'll now turn to Document Technology. Document Technology revenue in the quarter was down 9% at constant currency. Developing market weakness, including negative currency, accelerated in the third quarter, contributing more than 1/3 of the constant currency revenue decline. Also, contributing to the decline in the third quarter was high-end revenue. After good equipment growth in the second quarter, high-end was weaker in the third quarter, reflecting in part timing of product launches, including our recently announced iGen 5, which had helped us drive improvement in the fourth quarter.
From a total printing perspective, combining Document Technology with Document Outsourcing, revenue's been fairly stable, down 5% in the third quarter and down 4% year-to-date at constant currency.
Turning to activity. We saw a strong growth in entry A4 color, driven by new products, relatively stable results in mid-range but weaker installs and mix of products in high-end. Document Technology margin of 12.8% was down year-over-year but within our full year guidance of 11% to 13%. Year-over-year drivers include negative equipment mix given better A4 results and the anticipated higher pension expense, partially offset by lower compensation and benefit expense.
We continue to actively manage our cost base to ensure alignment to revenue trends. So in closing, Doc Tech revenues were slightly lower than expected, but profitability remained strong.
Turning now to cash. Cash flow from operations was $271 million in the quarter, which was lower than prior year cash flow of $595 million. The decline year-over-year reflects lower profit in Document Technology, with the 2 largest drivers being continued negative currency impact and developing markets weakness; lower profits in Services, driven by margin decline as well as the expected loss of cash flow from the ITO business following the divestiture. Additionally, working capital was a use of cash due to timing of vendor payments as well as lower demand in timing of shipments, impacting inventory.
The Health Enterprise charge in the third quarter had a negligible impact on cash in the period, and we anticipate the approximate $225 million of cash outflows will be spread over time.
Moving down the cash flow statement. Investing cash flows were a $206 million use, driven by $65 million spent on CapEx and $153 million on acquisition. Cash flow from financing was an $888 million use, which included $691 million spent on share repurchases and $90 million used for preferred and common stock dividends. And our cash balance at the end of the quarter was just over $800 million. So cash flow in the third quarter was impacted by lower operating profit as well as working capital timing.
Now I'll review our capital structure. We ended the third quarter with $7.6 billion in debt. Applying 7:1 leverage on customer financing assets, our allocated financing debt at the end of the third quarter was $3.9 billion, leaving core debt of $3.7 billion. In the fourth quarter, we are now anticipating an additional $200 million debt reduction, which will bring our year-end debt level to approximately $7.4 billion, a $350 million debt reduction for the year. This reduction will help offset the impact to our credit metrics from lower earnings and the reduction in our financing assets.
Overall, we continue to manage our capital structure to maintain credit metrics consistent with our investment-grade rating.
I'll now hand it back to Ursula to discuss capital allocation and guidance."

As Kathy just mentioned, we have spent about $200 million on acquisitions year-to-date and we don't anticipate closing any large acquisitions before year-end. We now expect to deploy an additional $200 million of capital toward debt reduction. We will spend $300 million on dividends. And lastly, on share repurchase, we reached our full year target of $1.3 billion in quarter 3, which represents 115 million share reduction -- reduction in shares year-to-date and a 10% reduction of our share count this year.
I will now discuss guidance.
Starting with revenue. We expect improvement in the fourth quarter. But considering current trends, we now expect full year revenue will be down approximately 3% at constant currency, in line with year-to-date results, with Services flat to up 1% and Document Technology down 6% to 7%.
From a margin perspective in Doc Tech, we expect continued strong margins with quarter 4 and full year margins in the middle of our full year range of 11% to 13%. In Services, we anticipate sequential improvement and for margins to be approximately 9% in quarter 4. So we're making progress in Services, but we do not expect to get to the 8.5% margin for the full year.
And for earnings, we expect quarter 4 adjusted EPS to be between $0.28 to $0.30. And for full year, we anticipate being at the low end of our previously guided range of $0.95 to $1.01.
Lastly, we expect free cash flow in the range $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion, with modestly lower operating cash flow of between $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion and CapEx that is now also expected to be lower.
So in summary, for the third quarter, we achieved adjusted earnings in line with our guidance. But we will -- we have come through the 9-month point and we're not satisfied with our performance. We are sharpening our focus on execution across the enterprise. We continue to lead an aggressive agenda to strengthen our offering portfolio and target segments where we are best positioned to compete and differentiate. And across both Services and technology, we are prioritizing investments, taking actions to improve revenue and margin and managing costs in Doc Tech to maintain our profitability.
And as previously mentioned, we are reviewing structural options for the company's business portfolio on capital allocation with the goal of enhancing shareholder value. As we undertake this activity, we are focused on the execution of our strategy and remaining fully committed to our customers, partners, suppliers and employees and to delivering strong financial results.
Finally, before we go to Q&A, as you know, this is Kathy Mikells last earnings call. I'd like to thank Kathy for her financial leadership and contributions to Xerox during her time with us. Leslie Varon will be stepping in as the interim CFO, a position that she has held previously. Leslie has deep experience and great connections throughout the business, so I know we won't miss a beat on -- with this transition.
With that, let me turn it over to Jennifer."

And it's at an early stage, so I really can't get into more details about that -- about what is happening because we haven't really progressed it that far."

And our approach there really hasn't changed. So I wouldn't expect any kind of big changes year-over-year in terms of what we're trying to do in pension. And then, obviously, one of the big things that we've got to continue to execute on is just managing working capital. That was a particular headwind for us in this quarter and something that we'd expect actually we'd improve on as we get through our fourth quarter and something we'll be very mindful of as we look forward to 2016.

So what -- and they and we were with us  for us to stay in a substantive long-term role as the physical agent operator, which is the primary component of our operating revenue in both states. Now what that will mean to us going forward is we will have -- as Ursula briefly mentioned, we'll have some revenue pressure. It's about 1 point on the Services segment revenue dynamics for the next 3 quarters and it was also roughly 1 point -- not quite, but roughly 1 point last quarter. So that's a little bit of a downside. The upside is that we had been very unpredictable. As you know, our Services margins have not been -- we have not been as consistent as we need to be because we have been recognizing more cost to development, would kind of hit the period I&E because of percentage-of-completion accounting. So because of the change that we've made with them, we expect to take that unpredictability out of our model.

By the way, I didn't answer the second part of Jim's question, which is basically the first part of your question. So sorry, Jim, and Ananda captured that. Our capital, for this year, we have essentially completed our share repurchase activities, we've -- as I said earlier. And we are still active in the market in M&A. But we have a pipeline, and that pipeline doesn't lead to anything significant for the remainder of this year. So from a capital allocation on those 2 items, I think that we're really pretty much settled. CapEx, we talked about the fact that it's coming in a little bit lighter that will help us. We are focused on remaining investment-grade. That's one of the things that you know that we think that we need for both our Services and tech business, and we'll continue to make sure that we manage our capital to ensure that we fall inside there. That's one. Second is the fragmented nature of the Services market and our, therefore, M&A activities for the future. I mean, one of the things that we will continue to need to do in the Services business is to consolidate some of this fragmentation, particularly in areas that we have strength. And I would suspect -- I would plan to and you should suspect that we'll continue to do that type of activity as we go forward in a business-as-usual kind of manner. I didn't quite get to the $700 million that you got to because we haven't quite done 2016 yet, which I think is what you were looking towards when you were making those numbers, those projections, Ananda. But as I said earlier, I don't think that we see in the business-as-usual mode a lot of change in returning value to shareholders to an M&A structure that continues to strengthen our Services business and to a debt structure that allows us to remain capital investment-grade. So those are the 3 kind of tenets that we're sitting on right now. And that's why I intend to come out as well -- we'll see, if there's anything that changes as we go forward, we'll tell you about it. But it won't be before January, the January call.

As we mix more towards customer care, it's a lower-margin business, we're trying to mix up towards more -- towards higher margin, more innovative solutions, while we try to actually innovate in customer care. So the reason why I bring it up is our M&A strategy is going to be towards these types of areas where the margins are stronger, where we don't continue to -- we want to stay a leader in customer care. We don't want to walk away from that business. But we just are not selling enough of the higher-margin businesses -- business areas, and that's one of the things that we have to fix and we haven't quite cracked that nut yet. So we're going to continue to acquire in those areas so that we can actually move away from the more commodity-based customer care implementations."

Today, we reported our third quarter results and provided an update on the fourth quarter and full year outlook. During this call, we will update you on our strategy, provide details on our third quarter results and share the actions that we are taking to improve our business. So let me begin with a look at our priorities.
In Services, our goal is to lead an attractive segments of the business services market. And throughout the year, we've taken steps to strengthen this business, including acquisitions to build our Commercial Healthcare offerings and the divestiture of ITO. As we announced 2 weeks ago, we are also taking action to improve our future financial performance and significantly reduce the volatility of our results with the uptake to our Government Healthcare business strategy. With these strategy changes to our Government Healthcare business, we are more clearly focused on the most profitable segments of our Services business.
In Document Technology, our efforts are focused on continuing to lead the market. We maintained our #1 market share position in equipment sales revenue for the 23rd straight quarter, closing in on 6 years, a solid record of leadership. And we're seeing good demand from small and mid-sized businesses, an important growth segment, through Global Imaging Systems and with the growth of our partner print solutions sold through our channels. 
Also, in the third quarter, we launched our new communication platform, ""Work Can Work Better"" and we are pleased with the reactions so far. Our new advertising and digital content highlight how we're enabling businesses and governments to achieve better results by helping them work better.
For our shareholders, we have returned more than 50% of our free cash flow to them over the last 4 years, and we are on track to do even more this year. Through September, we completed $1.3 billion in share repurchases, achieving our full year expectations. Although we have already taken steps to accelerate cost reductions and prioritize investments to drive improved revenue, productivity and margins, we announced today that the Xerox Board of Directors has authorized a comprehensive review of structural options for the company's business portfolio and capital allocation with the goal of enhancing shareholder value.
Now let's look at the third quarter performance.
During the third quarter, we delivered adjusted earnings per share of $0.24 that's in line with our guidance, which excludes $0.05 related to the amortization of intangibles and $0.23 from the previously announced Health Enterprise charge. Because the circumstances in Health Enterprise are unique, I'll speak to our adjusted results in the quarter, which better reflects our underlying operating performance.
Total adjusted revenue was $4.4 billion, down 4% in constant currency. On an adjusted basis, Services revenue was consistent with the same period last year and we delivered sequential improvement in our Services margin. Document Outsourcing continues to perform well overall and BPO was down 1%, which was consistent with the previous quarters. 
There are a few highlights in Services that I would like to share. Acquisitions remain a key aspect of our portfolio management strategy. And in the third quarter, we acquired RSA Medical and iPAS, expanding our suite of health care-related offerings. Our new go-to-market teams are establishing leadership roles in their industries. As examples, our retail team convened top clients and thought leaders at a retail -- Xerox retail industry summit, and Xerox analytics were demonstrated at the grand opening of Mcity, the University of Michigan's one-of-a-kind test site for connected and automated vehicles. And a number of Services offerings received external recognition. We retained the top position in Quocirca's Managed Print Services market -- landscape report for the sixth consecutive year. And for the third year running, Everest Group rated Xerox as a leading service provider for contact center outsourcing BPO.
Now moving on to Document Technology. Document Technology revenue was down 9% in constant currency, which is lower than we had expected and mostly was driven by increased pressures in developing markets. Excluding the impact of developing markets, the revenue trends in Document Technology remained stable. Document Technology margin of 12.8% was strong and within our guidance range of 11% to 13%.
Some additional Doc Tech highlights. We're seeing the benefits of recent product launches with strong demand for our new entry production color devices. And we showcased the best of team Xerox at Graph Expo, the largest U.S. trade show for the graphic communications market, including 2 new Xerox digital production color presses, the Xerox iGen 5 press and the Xerox Rialto 900 inkjet press. We also rolled out FreeFlow Core Cloud, which is the latest release in our leading Workflow Automation portfolio.
In total, the company generated operating cash flow of $271 million and we returned $774 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.
And now I'll turn it over to Kathy to provide more details on the quarter. I'll be back later to share fourth quarter guidance and wrap up. Kathy?"
103599,311627840,881694,"Xerox Corporation, Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2015",2015-10-26,"Earnings Calls","Xerox Holdings Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Ursula, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with an overview of our financial performance before moving into a more detailed discussion of the segment. As announced 2 weeks ago, this quarter, we recorded a pretax charge of $389 million or $241",1195,"Thanks, Ursula, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with an overview of our financial performance before moving into a more detailed discussion of the segment. As announced 2 weeks ago, this quarter, we recorded a pretax charge of $389 million or $241 million after tax, reflecting that we no longer expect to fully complete the Health Enterprise platform projects in California and in Montana. This decision will improve Xerox's future financial performance as these implementations were generating losses and will remove an element of risk and volatility in the business. Accordingly, I'll provide results and growth rates, adjusting for the charge to give better visibility to the underlying business performance in the quarter.
Our bottom line results were within our third quarter guidance, with revenues a bit softer and profitability generally in line with our expectations. Total revenue in the quarter was down 7% at actual currency and 4% at constant currency. Services was flat at constant currency as growth in Document Outsourcing offset a 1% decline in BPO. Document Technology declined 9% at constant currency and was impacted by increasing weakness in developing markets. Gross margin of 30.9% was down 130 basis points year-over-year, driven by a lower technology equipment gross margin as well as the greater mix of services, which carries a lower margin.
RD&E was slightly lower year-over-year. SAG in absolute dollars was down 9%. SAG as a percent of revenue was better by 40 basis points, helped by currency, our ongoing productivity initiatives as well as lower compensation and benefit expense.
Our third quarter operating margin of 8.7% decreased 90 basis points year-over-year and operating profit declined 16%. Over 40% of the operating profit decline was driven by currency and developing markets.
Moving down the income statement. Adjusted other net expense was $8 million lower year-over-year, driven by lower restructuring costs. Equity income was $40 million in the quarter, down $4 million year-over-year, driven in part by the continued impact of negative translation currency. Our third quarter adjusted tax rate of 24.6% was at the low end of our guidance range of 25% to 27%. Our third quarter adjusted EPS was at the top of our guidance range at $0.24.
I'll now move on to discuss our operational performance and services. Services revenue declined 3% and was flat at constant currency. BPO was down 1%, consistent with the second quarter, reflecting the headwind from last year's larger contract losses, lower inorganic contribution as well as lower new contract ramp from softer signings in previous quarters. Good growth continues in Document Outsourcing, up 3%, driven by strong Xerox Partner Print Services growth as well as good equipment revenue growth and enterprise accounts from recent strong signings.
Total signings in the quarter were down 7% but are up 5% on a trailing 12-month basis. New business signings were down 9% year-over-year as growth in Document Outsourcing was more than offset by declines in BPO. Our go-to-market investments and move to industry business groups are beginning to result in good growth and shorter sales cycle offerings such as customer care, but we have yet to see a pickup in higher-value, longer sales cycle offerings.
Our renewal rate in the quarter was 89%, which was at the high end of our target range of 85% to 90% and reflects continued overall good customer retention.
Turning to margin. Segment margin was 8.1%, in line with our expectations for sequential improvement from 7.5% in the second quarter. Margin was down 100 basis points year-over-year, reflecting investments in resources and in our new Services operating model, negative business mix within BPO as well as higher overhead as we work to lean out costs following the ITO divestiture. We continue to expect productivity from operational initiatives and our recent restructuring to yield increasing benefits in the fourth quarter.
I'll now turn to Document Technology. Document Technology revenue in the quarter was down 9% at constant currency. Developing market weakness, including negative currency, accelerated in the third quarter, contributing more than 1/3 of the constant currency revenue decline. Also, contributing to the decline in the third quarter was high-end revenue. After good equipment growth in the second quarter, high-end was weaker in the third quarter, reflecting in part timing of product launches, including our recently announced iGen 5, which would help us drive improvement in the fourth quarter.
From a total printing perspective, combining Document Technology with Document Outsourcing, revenue's been fairly stable, down 5% in the third quarter and down 4% year-to-date at constant currency.
Turning to activity. We saw a strong growth in entry A4 color, driven by new products, relatively stable results in mid-range but weaker installs and mix of products in high-end. Document Technology margin of 12.8% was down year-over-year but within our full year guidance of 11% to 13%. Year-over-year drivers include negative equipment mix given better A4 results and the anticipated higher pension expense, partially offset by lower compensation and benefit expense.
We continue to actively manage our cost base to ensure alignment to revenue trends. So in closing, Doc Tech revenues were slightly lower than expected, but profitability remained strong.
Turning now to cash. Cash flow from operations was $271 million in the quarter, which was lower than prior year cash flow of $595 million. The decline year-over-year reflects lower profit in Document Technology, with the 2 largest drivers being continued negative currency impact and developing markets weakness; lower profits in Services, driven by margin decline as well as the expected loss of cash flow from the ITO business following the divestiture. Additionally, working capital was a use of cash due to timing of vendor payments as well as lower demand in timing of shipments, impacting inventory.
The Health Enterprise charge in the third quarter had a negligible impact on cash in the period, and we anticipate the approximate $225 million of cash outflows will be spread over time.
Moving down the cash flow statement. Investing cash flows were a $206 million use, driven by $65 million spent on CapEx and $153 million on acquisitions. Cash flow from financing was an $888 million use, which included $691 million spent on share repurchases and $90 million used for preferred and common stock dividends. And our cash balance at the end of the quarter was just over $800 million. So cash flow in the third quarter was impacted by lower operating profits as well as working capital timing.
Now I'll review our capital structure. We ended the third quarter with $7.6 billion in debt. Applying 7:1 leverage on customer financing assets, our allocated financing debt at the end of the third quarter was $3.9 billion, leaving core debt of $3.7 billion. In the fourth quarter, we are now anticipating an additional $200 million debt reduction, which will bring our year-end debt level to approximately $7.4 billion, a $350 million debt reduction for the year. This reduction will help offset the impact to our credit metrics from lower earnings and the reduction in our financing assets.
Overall, we continue to manage our capital structure to maintain credit metrics consistent with our investment-grade rating.
I'll now hand it back to Ursula to discuss capital allocation and guidance."

As Kathy just mentioned, we have spent about $200 million on acquisitions year-to-date and we don't anticipate closing any large acquisitions before year-end. We now expect to deploy an additional $200 million of capital toward debt reduction. We will spend $300 million on dividends. And lastly, on share repurchase, we reached our full year target of $1.3 billion in quarter 3, which represents 115 million share reduction -- reduction in shares year-to-date and a 10% reduction of our share count this year.
I will now discuss guidance.
Starting with revenue. We expect improvement in the fourth quarter. But considering current trends, we now expect full year revenue will be down approximately 3% at constant currency, in line with year-to-date results, with Services flat to up 1% and Document Technology down 6% to 7%.
From a margin perspective in Doc Tech, we expect continued strong margins with quarter 4 and full year margins in the middle of our full year range of 11% to 13%. In Services, we anticipate sequential improvement and for margins to be approximately 9% in quarter 4. So we're making progress in Services, but we do not expect to get to the 8.5% margin for the full year.
And for earnings, we expect quarter 4 adjusted EPS to be between $0.28 to $0.30. And for full year, we anticipate being at the low end of our previously guided range of $0.95 to $1.01.
Lastly, we expect free cash flow in the range $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion, with modestly lower operating cash flow of between $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion and CapEx that is now also expected to be lower.
So in summary, for the third quarter, we achieved adjusted earnings in line with our guidance. But we will -- we have come through the 9-month point and we're not satisfied with our performance. We are sharpening our focus on execution across the enterprise. We continue to lead an aggressive agenda to strengthen our offering portfolio and target segments where we are best positioned to compete and differentiate. And across both Services and technology, we are prioritizing investments, taking actions to improve revenue and margin and managing costs in Doc Tech to maintain our profitability.
And as previously mentioned, we are reviewing structural options for the company's business portfolio and capital allocation with the goal of enhancing shareholder value. As we undertake this activity, we are focused on the execution of our strategy and remaining fully committed to our customers, partners, suppliers and employees and to delivering strong financial results.
Finally, before we go to Q&A, as you know, this is Kathy Mikells' last earnings call. I'd like to thank Kathy for her financial leadership and contributions to Xerox during her time with us. Leslie Varon will be stepping in as the interim CFO, a position that she has held previously. Leslie has deep experience and great connections throughout the business, so I know we won't miss a beat on -- with this transition.
With that, let me turn it over to Jennifer."

And our approach there really hasn't changed. So I wouldn't expect any kind of big changes year-over-year in terms of what we're trying to do in pension. And then, obviously, one of the big things that we've got to continue to execute on is just managing working capital. That was a particular headwind for us in this quarter and something that we'd expect actually we'd improve on as we get through our fourth quarter and something we'll be very mindful of as we look forward to 2016.

So what -- and they and we were with us for us to stay in a substantive long-term role as the fiscal agent operator, which is the primary component of our operating revenue in both states. Now what that will mean to us going forward is we will have -- as Ursula briefly mentioned, we'll have some revenue pressure. It's about 1 point on the Services segment revenue dynamics for the next 3 quarters and it was also roughly 1 point -- not quite, but roughly 1 point last quarter. So that's a little bit of a downside. The upside is that we had been very unpredictable. As you know, our Services margins have not been -- we have not been as consistent as we need to be because we had been recognizing more cost to development, would kind of hit the period I&E because of percentage-of-completion accounting. So because of the change that we've made with them, we expect to take that unpredictability out of our model. And we should have year-to-year improvements in 2016 because we were losing money, but we're not already laying out next year's segment model until the January earnings call.

That's one of the things that you know that we think that we need for both our Services and tech business, and we'll continue to make sure that we manage our capital to assure that we fall inside there. That's one. Second is the fragmented nature of the Services market and our, therefore, M&A activities for the future. I mean, one of the things that we will continue to need to do in the Services business is to consolidate some of this fragmentation, particularly in areas that we have strength. And I would suspect -- I would plan to and you should suspect that we'll continue to do that type of activity as we go forward in a business-as-usual kind of manner. I didn't quite get to the $700 million that you got to because we haven't quite done 2016 yet, which I think is what you were looking towards when you were making those numbers, those projections, Ananda. But as I said earlier, I don't think that we see in the business-as-usual mode a lot of change in returning value to shareholders to an M&A structure that continues to strengthen our Services business and to a debt structure that allows us to remain capital investment-grade. So those are the 3 kind of tenets that we're sitting on right now. And that's why I intend to come out as well -- we'll see, if there's anything that changes as we go forward, we'll tell you about it. But it won't be before January, the January call. I hope I answered everything that you had. It was kind of a long question, I hope I got them all."

And we find some good ones, and they come -- when they come, we compete for them and we win some. You saw iPAS and RSA this last quarter, and we'll continue to try to push on that area. We're not going to -- we still have the same disciplined approach. We have a great kind of re-up in that approach with the hiring of a great executive who's a kind of M&A expert. So we'll continue to look at that type of M&A, for sure. And when we look in that type of M&A, if we find something that's even more exciting, we're not going to close our eyes to it. But that's not -- we're not looking for massive companies to buy. We are trying to actually stay in the ranges that we've been talking about, a little bit bigger than small, definitely smaller than large."

And we have a problem right now with the business mix. It's one of the challenges that we had in the third quarter and that we are working hard to try to overcome as we go forward. As we mix more towards customer care, it's a lower-margin business, we're trying to mix up towards more -- towards higher margin, more innovative solutions, while we try to actually innovate in customer care. So the reason why I bring it up is our M&A strategy is going to be towards these types of areas where the margins are stronger, where we don't continue to -- we want to stay a leader in customer care. We don't want to walk away from that business. But we just are not selling enough of the higher-margin businesses -- business areas, and that's one of the things that we have to fix and we haven't quite cracked that nut yet. So we're going to continue to acquire in those areas so that we can actually move away from the more commodity-based customer care implementations."
