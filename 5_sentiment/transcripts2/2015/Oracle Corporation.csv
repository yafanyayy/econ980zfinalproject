I'm going to focus on our non-GAAP results for Q3. I'll then review guidance for Q4 and then turn the call over to Larry and Mark for their comments.As you can imagine, we are very, very pleased with our results as Software and Cloud, Cloud",1097,"Thanks, Ken. I'm going to focus on our non-GAAP results for Q3. I'll then review guidance for Q4 and then turn the call over to Larry and Mark for their comments.
As you can imagine, we are very, very pleased with our results as Software and Cloud, Cloud SaaS and PaaS, total hardware, total revenue and earnings per share were all above the midpoint of my CD guidance. As you probably remember, I didn't provide you as dollar guidance for Q3, given the unusually high volatility in exchange rates. 
The currency headwind ended up being 6% for Software and Cloud revenue as well as total revenue, 7% for total hardware revenue and $0.06 a share -- and $0.06 for earnings per share. Currencies continue to move significantly so my comments today generally reflect constant dollar growth rates and just how we look at the business. 
Cloud SaaS and PaaS revenue was $375 million, up 33% from last year. Bookings were again over 100%, adding to the momentum, which is helping drive SaaS, PaaS revenue growth. Now when bookings turn into revenue depends on many factors but one thing is clear, our momentum in cloud bodes very, very well for the future. 
Cloud Infrastructure as a Service revenue was $155 million, up 32%. Overall, our cloud results were much, much better than expected as we're clearly growing faster than Salesforce. We're more than 3x the size of Workday now.
Software and Cloud revenues were $7.2 billion, up 7% from last year. Software updates and product support revenues drove nearly half of total company revenue at $4.7 billion, up 8% from last year. Attach and renewal rates remain at their usual high levels as our growing installed base of customers continues to power earnings and cash flow. 
New software license revenue was $2 billion while we continue to enable our customers with their ongoing transition to cloud. Looking at GAAP Software and Cloud results by region. The Americas grew 7%, EMEA grew 9% and Asia Pacific grew 4%. Total hardware, including hardware support, grew 5%, with hardware system product revenue of $712 million and hardware support revenue of $587 million. 
Engineered Systems saw double-digit revenue growth on the strength of our product portfolio. Obviously, we continue to gain share against IBM and HP, whose high-end server businesses continue their decline. 
For the company, total revenue for the quarter was $9.3 billion, up 6% from last year. Non-GAAP operating income was $4.2 billion, up 4% from last year. And the operating margin was 46% in constant currency. That we're able to maintain our industry-leading operating margins while growing our cloud business more than 30% is a testimony to the strength of our business model.
The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 22.7% and EPS was $0.68 in U.S. dollars, growing 9% in constant currency. The GAAP tax rate was 20.8%, and GAAP EPS was $0.56 in U.S. dollars. As I mentioned earlier, but for the currency move, EPS would've been $0.06 higher. 
Free cash flow over the last 4 quarters was $14.5 billion. Capital expenditures continue to be a bit higher as we provision cloud orders and build out for the enormous fourth quarter SaaS and PaaS growth we anticipate.
Just to put it into perspective, when you compare the same 9 months last year to the 9 months -- the first 9 months of the year this year, our capital expenditure is up about $350 million. That's all.
We now have over $43 billion in cash and marketable securities. Net of debt, our cash position is approximately $11.5 billion. The short-term deferred revenue balance is $6.4 billion, down slightly due to currency, but in constant dollars, it actually grew 6%. 
short-term deferred revenue is $321 million for SaaS, PaaS and IaaS cloud services. As we said before, we're committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisition, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt and the dividend. In terms of acquisitions, we continue to focus on finding the right companies at the right valuation as both are critically important.
This quarter, we repurchased 46.1 million shares for a total of 2.1 -- $2 billion, excuse me. Over the last 12 months, we have repurchased nearly 200 million shares for a total of $8.1 billion. We've paid out dividends of $2.1 billion for a total that is more than 75% of our free cash flow. And the Board of Directors increased the quarterly dividend 25% today from 12% -- from $0.12 to $0.15 per share.
Now to the guidance. First of all, given the continued high volatility in exchange rate, we expect currency will affect results as we just don't know how much I'm going to again provide constant currency guidance only.
Secondly, our customers are clearly embracing Oracle PaaS faster than we expected which is actually great for us. Just to give you a little bit of insight on how we look at the business. For every $1 million of license we sell, we expect to collect another $1 million from support over 5 years for a total of $2 million. While for every $1 million of PaaS we sell, we actually expect to collect $5 million over 5 years. That's what we're looking at in our business. And though it may have some short-term effects, it's actually already showing up in the revenues.
So here we go. SaaS and PaaS on a non-GAAP basis is expected to grow 26% to 30%. On a GAAP basis, SaaS and PaaS revenue is expected to grow 27% to 31%. Cloud IaaS on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis is expected to grow 29% to 33%. Software and Cloud revenue on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis including SaaS, PaaS, IaaS, new software license and software support, is expected to grow 2% to 6%. 
Hardware systems revenue on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, which includes hardware system products and hardware system support, is expected to be between negative 2% and positive 8%. Total revenue on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis is expected to range from 1% to 6%. 
Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be somewhere between $0.90 and $0.96 in constant currency. GAAP EPS is expected to be somewhere between $0.76 and $0.82 in constant currency. And again, all of my guidance today is in constant currency and assumes a non-GAAP tax rate of 24% and a GAAP tax rate of 23%. Of course, it may end up being different but that's what we've got in our model right now. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Mark for his comments."

I think overall, a very solid quarter for Oracle and a great cloud quarter for Oracle. 
As Safra did, I'll give you numbers in CD. SaaS, PaaS revenue grew 33%. Bookings ARR grew 130%, double last year and up double digits sequentially. Fusion bookings, ERP, HCM and SFA all grew triple digits. Fusion bookings have grown more than 200% every quarter this year. 
We added 800 brand new SaaS customers, nearly 800. Nearly 530 existing customers expanded their cloud services in the quarter; in HCM, 220 new customers; in Customer Experience, 470 new customers; in ERP, 160 new customers. ERP SaaS installed base is multiple the size of Workday. We're adding customers at more then 10x the rate of Workday. Less than 25% of our ERP SaaS wins involve any on-premise Oracle ERP customer, meaning that over 75% are net new to Oracle. I would give you a stat on SAP but we never see them in cloud ERP.
PaaS, more than 400 new PaaS customers in the quarter. Bookings up 200%. Sequentially, Q4 in PaaS is going to be very big. Premise software grew 6%. We expect continued growth. Engineered Systems grew 15% in the quarter. We sold more than 1,000 systems, including over 500 Exadata units booked. competitor results we're taking huge market share. Oracle will be the leader in high-end servers this year.
In wrapping up, our cloud revenue is already above the $2 billion run rate. Our SaaS PaaS pipeline is already large and growing rapidly, and it's growing faster than what you're seeing in the bookings -- [indiscernible] at being the pipeline. We now expect Q4 bookings up $300 million, $50 million [ph] higher than before. 
We also expect FY '15 bookings growth to be greater than 100%. And you probably remember when Larry actually gave 50% growth in bookings as guidance at financial analyst meeting. And we're going to double that amount. Clearly, the migration to cloud is happening faster than we expected, and to Safra's point, that's great news for Oracle, great news for customers and great news for investors. 
And with that, I'm going to turn the call over to Larry."

That's more ERP customers than Workday has acquired in all the years they've been in the cloud business. Not one of our 160 cloud ERP deals was competitive with SAP. As Mark said, we just don't see them in the market. By the end of this quarter, Oracle has sold over 1,000 cloud ERP systems. We are on our way to building the largest ERP business in the cloud.
Oracle now has a cloud revenue run rate of well over $2 billion a year. We're already the world's second-largest SaaS and PaaS company. On our last quarterly conference call, I predicted that in our fiscal year 2016, Oracle would likely sell more SaaS and PaaS new business than salesforce.com. Well, I was way too cautious.
Sorry, let me just back up 1 second, I think this is important. On our last quarterly conference call, I predicted that in our fiscal year 2016, Oracle would likely sell more SaaS and PaaS new business than salesforce.com. I was way too cautious and conservative. Our cloud business is growing a lot faster than even I expected. Our cloud bookings are now growing at over 100% per year, so I'd like to revise my prediction.
I now believe that Oracle will sell more new SaaS and PaaS business than salesforce.com in this current calendar year 2015. It's going to be close, but I think we're going to sell more in the cloud than they do this year. I suspect that might come as a big surprise to a lot of people out there. You won't have to wait very long to find out who's going to win this. With that, I'll turn it back over to the operator."

The most important new feature within the database and sometimes in terms of customer enthusiasm is our in-memory database feature. And that, along with a multitenancy feature, are the 2 pieces that are",612,"Okay. Well, let's start with the 12c adoption rates. The most important new feature within the database and sometimes in terms of customer enthusiasm is our in-memory database feature. And that, along with a multitenancy feature, are the 2 pieces that are really driving 12c adoption to higher rates than anything we've seen in the -- for a very, very long time. So I think people are moving very quickly. Again, it takes years for people to move to the next version of the database. People are very cautious, but they're moving more quickly than historical precedence to adopt 12c for 2 big reasons: one is multitenancy and the other is our in-memory database option. So that's going exceptionally well. The use cases that are spurring adoption of the Oracle Database in the cloud is the very simple fact you can take any workload, any database that you currently have running in your data center and move your database with a push of a button and move your application with a push of a button and run it in the Oracle cloud. Nobody else can do that. If you look at the other PaaS vendors, the second-biggest PaaS vendor -- actually, maybe the biggest PaaS vendor still, I'm not sure break out their number. Salesforce.com PaaS is based on proprietary technology that allows you to extend salesforce.com applications. Our PaaS, our Platform-as-a-Service is based on 2 products: Java, the world's most popular programming language and an industry standard; and the Oracle database, the world's most popular relational database and an industry standard. We have enormous on-premise usage of Java and the Oracle database. And now people can -- don't have to decide where they're going to run things. They can do test and development in the Oracle cloud and run production in on-premise, and then they can decide if they need more capacity. They can go from on-premise into the cloud and back to on-premise. We're the only ones that allows you to move data and workload back and forth between the cloud and on-premise. That's the primary use case we think that's going to drive Oracle PaaS to be the #1 PaaS in the cloud very, very quickly. The other -- the third question is S4/HANA and the cloud. Well, very simply, talk to a lot of people at SAP actually about S4/HANA in the cloud. And people who've recently been at SAP. And you got to understand one thing. This is the same old SAP. This is all written in [indiscernible] there's 30-year-old code in S4 business suite. There's nothing new about this. They're simply hosting it on someone else's computer. I also can't find the website where you log on and try it. Everyone else lets you log on -- lets you log on. You go to a website if you want to buy our stuff, you want to buy SaaS, you want to buy PaaS, you go to website, you get provisioned, and you go. Not so with SAP. This is 30-year-old code renamed S4/HANA. Now they did add a new user interface called VRE, the old code. But that's all they did. They did add another database that they support. They now support, in addition to Oracle and [indiscernible] and IBM DB2 and Microsoft SQL Server, they also support HANA. That's it. They've added one new database, they've added a more modern UI, all the old code in the middle is written in [indiscernible] it's written in It's 30 years old. We don't see them as a cloud competitor. We actually almost never talk about them except when we get a question on the call. That's it."

So let",448,"Sure, I'll start on the competitive environment. I would say that the competitive environment with Workday is different in HR than in ERP EPM. In ERP EPM, our position is extremely strong. I would not call Workday competitive in that market at all. So let's put that aside. In the context of HCM, I think with each subsequent release of HCM, whether release 7, release 8, release 9 and now release 10, we have simply engineered now a better product than Workday. And so I think from an HCM perspective, head-to-head, they're in the United States. Some strong fights, I think, is our awareness the education of our sales force and our references have gotten better. We now win more than half the deals in the United States. Outside the United States, our win rate goes up actually exponentially because of the breadth of our distribution in those markets. So that's sort of I would characterize Workday. Also any deal that comes up that's multi-pillar, so in many cases, you wind up with an ERP competitive environment that than actually many times can drag an HR. So we think competitively, Heather, the fact that we have ERP and EPM in the cloud, in SaaS with a strong lead, also benefits our HCM business as well. So out engineering, out distributed in almost all the world. As I described, big lead in ERP I would not describe Workday as extremely competitive. Salesforce, I think perhaps different. Salesforce is clearly the incumbent in most accounts, not Oracle. We're frankly the guy coming up with a challenger capability. And we now bring a suite of capability with marketing in addition to sales automation. And we do a lot of things that they don't do. We really come to the customer with a different approach. As opposed to trying to help a customer basically report what the Salesforce is bidding on. We actually come to market trying to help Salesforce being our customers sales forces sell more stuff all the way from automating a marketing campaign to the actual process by which they communicate to the customer, get information about the customer and actually go through a whole engineering and selling process with the customer. And this is proven, you've heard with our numbers. Our sales automation solutions in the quarter were superb. Marketing had a fantastic quarter. We are the leader in marketing. We are challenging very aggressively in sales automation, and we expect to give them a run for their money in every sales automation deal in the planet. But our depreciation, Heather, comes from bringing a suite of capability to help sales -- or our customers' sales organization sell."

We made a big announcement almost 10 years ago where we're building all of our applications for the cloud. Now it wasn't called the cloud 10 years ago. It was called SaaS. But we said we're rebuilding everything and the thing called Fusion network going to rebuild our middleware for the cloud, build our applications on top of our cloud middleware and change our database for the cloud, make it multi-tenant, make it in-memory, do all of those things. We started a project 10 years ago to rewrite everything. When Fusion ERP, every single line of code is brand new. Fusion HCM, every single line of the code is brand new. I can go on and on but all of these are completely rewritten for the cloud, as is our -- our database was not completely rewritten, we added specific features to the database to make it work properly in the cloud, the most prominent which is the multitenancy feature. We think we put multitenancy at the right level of the stack in the database rather than multitenancy in the application, which creates real security problems, which I'm not going to go into. But we think we have a huge advantage over these -- some Workday but doesn't have a database. They don't -- Workday kind of built their own database, and that's what you're buying into when you buy Workday. We build our own database, it's called Oracle. We [indiscernible] has its own program and technology. We use the programming technology called Java. So -- and we build everything, everything from scratch. I'm telling you, every single line of code in Fusion HCM is new for the cloud. Every single line of code for Fusion ERP is new for the cloud. And those new cloud applications are based on by far the strongest platform doesn't have a platform that they sell. They have no platform. But the platform that they kind of use internally. Salesforce has a platform also think is competitive with our platform. So you're going have to be very specific as what advantages these small companies think they have over us in the cloud when we have, I think, very clearly the strongest platform based on industry standards and years and years of experience. We've adopted that for the cloud. Give example how strong our cloud platform is. Salesforce.com uses our cloud platform. Netflix and in fact, every single cloud company of size, the top 10, 9 of them use our database in the cloud. Workday is the only one that doesn't. But tell me again advantages they think they have."

And while down, a smaller piece of our hardware portfolio being the M-Series of SPARC. T was down in the quarter, again all offset by the growth we've seen in Engineered Systems. Storage grew in the quarter. We had significant -- a very strong growth in ZFS, if you will, our network attach storage product. That is not a new story, our ZFS growth and I predict that will continue as we go forward. We have just released a new SAN product, FS1 [ph] that came to us through the Pillar acquisition that our engineering team has done a super job for us. And that represents really a whole new storage market for us now to go compete head up against EMC. So I believe going forward, you will see a continuation of storage growth the continuation of ZFS, along with now FS1 [ph] a continued growth in Engineered Systems. And we'll continue to push on refreshing our SPARC base as we have and as we go forward. As it relates to ERP and you asked specifically about international markets, I mean, just for example, in the quarter, just to give you some flavor for this, we closed ERP SaaS deals in Mexico, at Saudi Telecom, at BAE Systems, at Hawaiian Airlines, at KPMG. I mean, these are all certainly very strong brands that are going ERP and ERP and cloud, and at least 75% of what I just named are outside the United States. So we've had very strong -- back to just sort of the cloud context, which probably is the core question. I think I said a couple of quarters ago, we're just going to get better and better at this. And while the numbers are faster than I predicted, and I'm -- I wish I could have predicted them better 2 or 3 quarters ago, our sales force has simply just gotten more productive. They're better educated, better products, and they now have references in virtually every single discipline in Pillar that we sell in almost every country that we sell. And so what's happening, it's very interesting. We're getting better and we're growing faster as we're getting bigger. And it's because of the multitude of these issues that I'm describing that have all now tilted our way after frankly 2, 2.5 years of hard work of getting our customers similar to last question who now know their functional buyer. They know they have the Chief Marketing Officer, they know the chief human resource officer. Our products have now gotten used to be mature, and we've got references and I think now that we add PaaS to our cloud offerings, I probably should've said this earlier, but I've been doing this a long time. And I've really never seen a pipeline grow as fast as our PaaS pipeline has grown. We really released this OpenWorld in October and the speed of our pipeline, what you see the conversion to bookings. I actually -- Safra did see the benefit of the pipeline, and it is just exciting times for Oracle. Back to Ken."

I'll then review guidance for Q4 and then turn the call over to Larry and Mark for their comments.As you can imagine, we are very, very pleased with our results as Software and Cloud, Cloud",1098,"Thanks, Ken. I'm going to focus on our non-GAAP results for Q3. I'll then review guidance for Q4 and then turn the call over to Larry and Mark for their comments.
As you can imagine, we are very, very pleased with our results as Software and Cloud, Cloud SaaS and PaaS, total hardware, total revenue and earnings per share were all above the midpoint of my CD guidance. As you probably remember, I didn't provide U.S. dollar guidance for Q3 given the unusually high volatility in exchange rates. The currency headwind ended up being 6% for Software and Cloud revenue as well as total revenue, 7% for total hardware revenue and $0.06 a share -- and $0.06 for earnings per share. Currencies continue to move significantly, so my comments today generally reflect constant dollar growth rates, which is how we look at the business.
Cloud SaaS and PaaS revenue was $375 million, up 33% from last year. Bookings were again over 100%, adding to the momentum, which is helping drive SaaS, PaaS revenue growth. Now when bookings turn into revenue depends on many factors, but one thing is clear. Our momentum in cloud bodes very, very well for the future. Cloud Infrastructure-as-a-Service revenue was $155 million, up 32%. Overall, our cloud results were much, much better than expected as we're clearly growing faster than Salesforce. We're more than 3x the size of Workday now.
Software and Cloud revenues were $7.2 billion, up 7% from last year. Software updates and product support revenues drove nearly half of total company revenue at $4.7 billion, up 8% from last year. Attach and renewal rates remain at their usual high levels as our growing installed base of customers continues to power earnings and cash flow. New software license revenue was $2 billion, while we continue to enable our customers with their ongoing transition to cloud.
Looking at GAAP Software and Cloud results by region. The Americas grew 7%. EMEA grew 9%, and Asia Pacific grew 4%. Total hardware, including hardware support, grew 5% with hardware system product revenue of $712 million and hardware support revenue of $587 million. Engineered Systems saw double-digit revenue growth on the strength of our product portfolio. Obviously, we continue to gain share against IBM and HP, whose high-end server businesses continue their decline.
For the company, total revenue for the quarter was $9.3 billion, up 6% from last year. Non-GAAP operating income was $4.2 billion, up 4% from last year. And the operating margin was 46% in constant currency. That we're able to maintain our industry-leading operating margins while growing our cloud business more than 30% is a testimony to the strength of our business model.
The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 22.7%, and EPS was $0.68 in U.S. dollars, growing 9% in constant currency. The GAAP tax rate was 20.8%, and GAAP EPS was $0.56 in U.S. dollars. As I mentioned earlier, but for the currency move, EPS would have been $0.06 higher.
Free cash flow over the last 4 quarters was $14.5 billion. Capital expenditures continue to be a bit higher as we provision cloud orders and build out for the enormous fourth quarter SaaS and PaaS growth we anticipate. Just to put it into perspective, when you compare the same 9 months last year to the 9 months -- the first 9 months of the year this year, our capital expenditure is up about $350 million. That's all.
We now have over $43 billion in cash and marketable securities. Net of debt, our cash position is approximately $11.5 billion. The short-term deferred revenue balance is $6.4 billion, down slightly due to currency, but in constant dollars, it actually grew 6%. Within short term, deferred revenue is $321 million for SaaS, PaaS and IaaS cloud services. As we said before, we're committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisition, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt and the dividend. In terms of acquisitions, we continue to focus on finding the right companies at the right valuation as both are critically important.
This quarter, we repurchased 46.1 million shares for a total of $2.1 billion -- $2 billion, excuse me. Over the last 12 months, we have repurchased nearly 200 million shares for a total of $8.1 billion, and we've paid out dividends of $2.1 billion for a total that is more than 75% of our free cash flow. And the Board of Directors increased the quarterly dividend 25% today from 12% -- from $0.12 to $0.15 per share.
Now to the guidance. First of all, given the continued high volatility in exchange rates, expect currency will affect results. But as we just don't know how much, I'm going to again provide constant currency guidance only. Secondly, our customers are clearly embracing Oracle PaaS faster than we expected, which is actually great for us. Just to give you a little bit of insight on how we look at the business. For every $1 million of license we sell, we expect to collect another $1 million from support over 5 years for a total of $2 million. While for every $1 million of PaaS we sell, we actually expect to collect $5 million over 5 years. That's what we're looking at in our business, and though it may have some short-term effects, it's actually already showing up in the revenues.
So here we go. SaaS and PaaS on a non-GAAP basis is expected to grow 26% to 30%. On a GAAP basis, SaaS and PaaS revenue is expected to grow 27% to 31%. Cloud IaaS on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis is expected to grow 29% to 33%. Software and Cloud revenue on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, including SaaS, PaaS, IaaS, new software license and software support, is expected to grow 2% to 6%. Hardware systems revenue on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, which includes hardware system products and hardware system support, is expected to be between negative 2% and positive 8%. Total revenue on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis is expected to range from 1% to 6%.
Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be somewhere between $0.90 and $0.96 in constant currency. GAAP EPS is expected to be somewhere between $0.76 and $0.82 in constant currency. And again, all of my guidance today is in constant currency and assumes a non-GAAP tax rate of 24% and a GAAP tax rate of 23%. Of course, it may end up being different, but that's what we've got in our model right now.
With that, I'll turn it over to Mark for his comments."

Less than 25% of our ERP SaaS wins involve any on-premise Oracle ERP customer, meaning that over 75% are net new to Oracle. I would give you a stat on SAP, but we never see them in cloud ERP.
PaaS, more than 400 new PaaS customers in the quarter. Bookings up 200% sequentially. Q4 in PaaS is going to be very big. Premise software grew 6%. We expect continued growth. Engineered Systems grew 15% in the quarter. We sold more than 1,000 systems, including over 500 Exadata units booked. Given competitor results, we're taking huge market share. Oracle will be the leader in high-end servers this year.
In wrapping up, our cloud revenue is already above the $2 billion run rate. Our SaaS, PaaS pipeline is already large and growing rapidly, and it's growing faster than what you're seeing in the bookings -- at being the pipeline. We now expect Q4 bookings up $300 million, $50 million higher than before. We also expect FY '15 bookings growth to be greater than 100%. And you probably remember when Larry actually gave 50% growth in bookings as guidance at a financial analyst meeting, and we're going to double that amount. Clearly, the migration to cloud is happening faster than we expected, and to Safra's point, that's great news for Oracle, great news for our customers and great news for our investors.
And with that, I'm going to turn the call over to Larry."

Oracle now has a cloud revenue run rate of well over $2 billion a year. We're already the world's second-largest SaaS and PaaS company. On our last quarterly conference call, I predicted that in our fiscal year 2016 Oracle would likely sell more SaaS and PaaS new business than Salesforce.com. Well, I was way too cautious.

I now believe that Oracle will sell more new SaaS and PaaS business than Salesforce.com in this current calendar year 2015. It's going to be close, but I think we're going to sell more in the cloud than they do this year. I suspect that might come as a big surprise to a lot of people out there.

The most important new feature we probably put in the database and sometimes in terms of customer enthusiasm is our in-memory database feature. And that along with a multi-tenancy feature are the 2 piec",630,"Okay. Well, let's start with the 12c adoption rates. The most important new feature we probably put in the database and sometimes in terms of customer enthusiasm is our in-memory database feature. And that along with a multi-tenancy feature are the 2 pieces that are really driving 12c adoption to higher rates than anything we've seen in about -- for a very, very long time. So I think people are moving very quickly. Again, it takes years for people to move to the next version of the database. People are very cautious, but they're moving more quickly than historical precedent to adopt 12c for 2 big reasons: One is multitenancy, and the other is our in-memory database option. So that's going exceptionally well. The use cases that are spurring adoption of the Oracle Database in the cloud is the very simple fact you can take any workload, any database that you currently have running in your data center and move your database with a push of a button and move your application with a push of a button and run it in the Oracle cloud. Nobody else can do that. If you look at the other PaaS vendors, well, the second-biggest PaaS vendor -- well, actually, maybe their the biggest PaaS vendor still, where they don't -- I'm not sure they break out their number. Salesforce.com PaaS is based on proprietary technology that allows you to extend Salesforce.com applications. Our PaaS, our Platform as a Service is based on 2 products: Java, the world's most popular programming language and an industry standard; and the Oracle Database, the world's most popular relational database and an industry standard. We have enormous on-premise usage of Java and the Oracle Database. And now people can -- don't have to decide where they're going to run things. They can do test and development in the Oracle cloud and run production in on-premise, and then they can decide, if they need more capacity, they can go from on-premise into the cloud and back to on-premise. We're the only ones that allows you to move data and workload back and forth between the cloud and on-premise. That's the primary use case, we think, that's going to drive Oracle PaaS to be the #1 PaaS in the cloud very, very quickly. The other -- the third question is S4/HANA and the cloud. Well, very simply, I mean, I talk to a lot of people at SAP actually about S4/HANA in the cloud and people who've recently been at SAP. And you've got to understand one thing. This is the same old SAP. This is all written in ABAP. There's 30-year-old code in S4 business suite. There's nothing new about this. They're simply hosting it on someone else's computer. I also can't find the website where you log on and try it. Everyone else lets you log on. You go to a website. If you want to buy our stuff, you want to buy SaaS, you want to buy PaaS, you go to a website. You get provisioned, and you go. Not so with SAP. This is 30-year-old code renamed S4/HANA. Now they did add a new user interface called Fiori to the old code, but that's all they did. They did add another database that they support. They now support -- in addition to Oracle and Sybase and IBM DB2 and Microsoft SQL Server, they also support HANA. That's it. They've added one new database. They've added a more modern UI. All the old code in the middle is written in ABAP. Ask them. It's written in ABAP. It's 30 years old. We don't see them as a cloud competitor. We actually almost never talk about them except when we get a question on the call. That's it."

I would say that the competitive environment with Workday is different in HR than in ERP, EPM. In ERP, EPM, our position is extremely strong. I would not call Workday competitive in that market at all, so let's put that aside. In the context of HCM, I think with each subsequent release of HCM, whether it have been Release 7, Release 8, Release 9 and now Release 10, we have simply engineered now a better product than Workday. And so I think from an HCM perspective, head to head, they're in the United States. Some strong fights, I think, is our awareness, the education of our sales force, and our references have gotten better. We now win more than half the deals in the United States. Outside the United States, our win rate goes up actually exponentially because of the breadth of our distribution in those markets. So that's sort of how I would characterize Workday. Also, any deal that comes up that's multi-pillar, so in many cases, you wind up with an ERP competitive environment that then actually many times can drag an HR, so we think competitively, Heather, the fact that we have ERP and EPM in the cloud, in SaaS with a strong lead also benefits our HCM business as well. So out engineering, out distributed in almost all the world. As I described, big lead in ERP, EPM, where I would not describe Workday as extremely competitive. Salesforce, I think perhaps different. Salesforce is clearly the incumbent in most accounts, not Oracle. We're, frankly, the guy coming up with a challenger capability, and we now bring a suite of capability with marketing in addition to sales automation. And we do a lot of things that they don't do. We really come to the customer with a, different approach. As opposed to trying to help the customer basically report what the Salesforce is bidding on. We actually come to market trying to help the sales force, being our customers' sales forces, sell more stuff all the way from automating a marketing campaign to the actual process by which they communicate to the customer, get information about the customer and actually go through a whole engineering and selling process with the customer. And this is proven. You've heard it with our numbers. Our sales automation solutions in the quarter were superb. Marketing had a fantastic quarter. We are the leader in marketing. We are challenging very aggressively in sales automation, and we expect to give them a run for their money in every sales automation deal in the planet. But our differentiation, Heather, comes from bringing a suite of capability to help the sales -- or a customer's sales organization sell."

We grew in Exadata, and this is going against, I know you know this, Kash, fairly tough comparisons with the success of Exadata last year. But we had very strong performance on some of our new engineered systems, so it was pretty well dispersed. We had strong growth with SuperCluster in the quarter. We had strong growth in our Oracle Database Appliance. We had good growth in our Big Data Appliance, which is our Hadoop Oracle appliance that we brought to market. Our Zero Data, one of my favorite named products that we have in the company, the Zero Data Loss Recovery Appliance, contributed growth in the quarter. So the suite of products that we brought to market in Engineered Systems as a group had a really strong quarter.

We made a big announcement almost 10 years ago that we're rebuilding all of our applications for the cloud. Now it wasn't called the cloud 10 years ago. It was called SaaS. But we said that we're rebuilding everything and the thing called Fusion network, going to rebuild our middleware for the cloud, build our applications on top of our cloud middleware and change our database for the cloud, make it multi-tenant, make it in-memory, do all of those things. We started a project 10 years ago to rewrite everything. When -- Fusion ERP, every single line of code is brand new. Fusion HCM, every single line of the code is brand new. I can go on and on with all of these -- we -- they're completely rewritten for the cloud as is our -- and our database was not completely rewritten. We added specific features to the database to make it work properly in the cloud, the most prominent which is the multi-tenancy feature. We think we put multitenancy at the right level of the stack in the database rather than multitenancy in the application, which creates real security problems, which I'm not going to go into. But we think we have a huge advantage over these -- someone like Workday that doesn't have a database. They don't -- Workday kind of built their own little database, and that's what you're buying into when you buy Workday. We built our own little database. It's called Oracle. Workday has its own programming technology. We use this programming technology called Java. So -- we -- and we built everything, everything from scratch. I'm telling you, every single line of code in Fusion HCM is new for the cloud. Every single line of code for Fusion ERP is new for the cloud, and those new cloud applications are based on, by far, the strongest platform. Workday doesn't even have a platform that they sell. They have no platform. They have platform that they kind of use internally. Salesforce has a platform that we also think is not competitive with our platform. So you're going have to be very specific as what advantages these small companies think they have over us in the cloud when we have, I think, very clearly the strongest platform based on industry standards and years and years of experience. We've adopted that for the cloud. Give you an example how strong our cloud platform is, Salesforce.com uses our cloud platform. Netflix uses our cloud platform. In fact, every single cloud company of size, the top 10, 9 of them use our database in the cloud. Workday is the only one that doesn't. But tell me again the advantages they think they have."

So manufacturers will run MRP much faster than they used to. People that used to get reports overnight will get those reports instantaneously, so they'll have access to more information. I think there will be -- there are some very interesting applications in terms of security for immediate detection of intrusion. Being able to analyze the data so quickly, we actually are going to do a better job in security. That's one of the big things that we've been working on for some time. I think there are a lot of existing applications that you used to wait overnight for. You'll get that data instantaneously, and then there'll be a host of new applications. But how revolutionary that will be, I think this is going to happen. People will discover these new applications over a fairly long period of time. So as excited as we are about in-memory databases and -- oh, and by -- and we have by far the fastest in-memory database in the world. But again, the first benefit is to make the existing apps run much faster. The second benefit -- and that won't happen right away. The second benefit will trickle in over the years as people -- as smart people discover new ways to build applications they never thought -- that were -- just were impossible before the in-memory database."

Specifically, could you talk about your position today versus 12 months ago in terms of your visibility with actually with the Chief Marketing Officers?

We've added BlueKai. We've added Compendium. We've just added a really nice company in Datalogix and BlueKai, and Datalogix with their data capabilities now differentiate us just not on the marketing automation process and what you do with CMOs and automating that process but also in the underpinning data sets that CMOs get access to. So we have become the biggest and the most popular in the -- in SaaS marketing, and that, frankly, to your point, Kirk, has caused to now as we've done with our sales forces pointed our -- a sales force directly at a buyer, and that buyer is the CMO, very similar to what we do in HR, where we call on the Head of HR. In marketing, we call on the Head of Marketing. And I think the best testimony to our success in our relationships are numbers. Our growth in marketing in the quarter was over 200%. And when you look at our competitors, whether those be Adobe, the acquisition that Salesforce.com made, you just see that we are simply growing faster, and we are taking market share in marketing SaaS. So that was -- that's what I would describe in marketing. You had another question. Would you refresh me on what that was?"

They had a very good quarter in Q3 as they've had over the past several quarters. Obviously, our position in retail was extremely strategic to our customers, and we've now added MICROS, which brought with it a great depth in hospitality and food and beverage. So our retail suite of expertise is now not just in general merchandising but across food and beverage and hospitality as well. We had a very strong quarter in banking, and our expertise now in banking, we've grown our sales force, our ability now to help banks in compliance, in anti-money laundering. Many of the issues that are banking customers are facing today has become a tremendous asset for us. We've had a good quarter, and we continue to have good success in communication. And without going through each one of them, they do give us strong differentiation because when we sell in these industries, we're talking to business buyers, and we're talking to retailers. We're talking to CEOs. We're talking to head of merchandising.

To your point, Engineered Systems, I already went through it. It is now significant part of our hardware portfolio and grew 15% and while down is a smaller piece of our hardware portfolio being the M-Series of SPARC. T was down in the quarter, again, all offset by the growth we've seen in Engineered Systems. Storage grew in the quarter. We had significant -- a very strong growth in ZFS, if you will, our network attach storage product. That is not a new story, our ZFS growth, and I predict that will continue as we go forward. We have just released a new SAN product, FS1 , that came to us through the Pillar acquisition that our engineering team has done super job for us. And that represents, really, a whole new storage market for us now to go compete head up against EMC. So I believe, going forward, you will see a continuation of storage growth, the continuation of ZFS along with now FS1, a continued growth in Engineered Systems. And we'll continue to push refreshing our SPARC base as we have and as we go forward. As it relates to ERP and you asked specifically about international markets, I mean, just for example, in the quarter, just to give you some flavor for this, we closed ERP SaaS deals at Femsa in Mexico, at Saudi Telecom, at BAE Systems, at Hawaiian Airlines, at KPMG. I mean, these are all certainly very strong brands that are going ERP and ERP and cloud, and at least 75% of what I just named are outside the United States. So we've had very strong -- back to just sort of the cloud context, which probably is at the core of the questions. I think I said a couple of quarters ago, we're just going to get better and better at this. And while the numbers are faster than I predicted and I'm -- I wish I could have predicted them better 2 or 3 quarters ago, our sales force has simply just gotten more productive. They're better educated with better products, and they now have references in virtually every single discipline and pillar that we sell in almost every country that we sell. And so what's happening, it's very interesting. We're getting better, and we're growing faster as we're getting bigger. And it's because of a multitude of these issues that I'm describing that have all now tilted our way after, frankly, 2, 2.5 years of hard work of getting our customers, similar to last question, who now know their functional buyer. They know they the head, the Chief Marketing Officer. They know the Chief Human Resource Officer. Our products have now gotten extremely mature, and we've got references. And I think now that we add PaaS to our cloud offerings -- and I probably should have said this earlier, but I've been doing this a long time, and I've really never seen a pipeline grow as fast as our PaaS pipeline has grown. We really released this at OpenWorld in October and the speed of our pipeline, but you see it just in the conversion to bookings. I actually -- Safra and I did see it in the benefit of the pipeline, and it is just exciting times for Oracle. Back to Ken."

I'll then review guidance for Q4 and then turn the call over to Larry and Mark for their comments.As you can imagine, we are very, very pleased with our results as Software and Cloud, Cloud",1098,"Thanks, Ken. I'm going to focus on our non-GAAP results for Q3. I'll then review guidance for Q4 and then turn the call over to Larry and Mark for their comments.
As you can imagine, we are very, very pleased with our results as Software and Cloud, Cloud SaaS and PaaS, total hardware, total revenue and earnings per share were all above the midpoint of my CD guidance. As you probably remember, I didn't provide U.S. dollar guidance for Q3 given the unusually high volatility in exchange rates. The currency headwind ended up being 6% for Software and Cloud revenue as well as total revenue, 7% for total hardware revenue and $0.06 a share -- and $0.06 for earnings per share. Currencies continue to move significantly, so my comments today generally reflect constant dollar growth rates, which is how we look at the business.
Cloud SaaS and PaaS revenue was $375 million, up 33% from last year. Bookings were again over 100%, adding to the momentum, which is helping drive SaaS, PaaS revenue growth. Now when bookings turn into revenue depends on many factors, but one thing is clear. Our momentum in cloud bodes very, very well for the future. Cloud Infrastructure-as-a-Service revenue was $155 million, up 32%. Overall, our cloud results were much, much better than expected as we're clearly growing faster than Salesforce. We're more than 3x the size of Workday now.
Software and Cloud revenues were $7.2 billion, up 7% from last year. Software updates and product support revenues drove nearly half of total company revenue at $4.7 billion, up 8% from last year. Attach and renewal rates remain at their usual high levels as our growing installed base of customers continues to power earnings and cash flow. New software license revenue was $2 billion, while we continue to enable our customers with their ongoing transition to cloud.
Looking at GAAP Software and Cloud results by region. The Americas grew 7%. EMEA grew 9%, and Asia Pacific grew 4%. Total hardware, including hardware support, grew 5% with hardware system product revenue of $712 million and hardware support revenue of $587 million. Engineered Systems saw double-digit revenue growth on the strength of our product portfolio. Obviously, we continue to gain share against IBM and HP, whose high-end server businesses continue their decline.
For the company, total revenue for the quarter was $9.3 billion, up 6% from last year. Non-GAAP operating income was $4.2 billion, up 4% from last year. And the operating margin was 46% in constant currency. That we're able to maintain our industry-leading operating margins while growing our cloud business more than 30% is a testimony to the strength of our business model.
The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 22.7%, and EPS was $0.68 in U.S. dollars, growing 9% in constant currency. The GAAP tax rate was 20.8%, and GAAP EPS was $0.56 in U.S. dollars. As I mentioned earlier, but for the currency move, EPS would have been $0.06 higher.
Free cash flow over the last 4 quarters was $14.5 billion. Capital expenditures continue to be a bit higher as we provision cloud orders and build out for the enormous fourth quarter SaaS and PaaS growth we anticipate. Just to put it into perspective, when you compare the same 9 months last year to the 9 months -- the first 9 months of the year this year, our capital expenditure is up about $350 million. That's all.
We now have over $43 billion in cash and marketable securities. Net of debt, our cash position is approximately $11.5 billion. The short-term deferred revenue balance is $6.4 billion, down slightly due to currency, but in constant dollars, it actually grew 6%. Within short-term deferred revenue is $321 million for SaaS, PaaS and IaaS cloud services. As we said before, we're committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisitions, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt and a dividend. In terms of acquisitions, we continue to focus on finding the right companies at the right valuation as both are critically important.
This quarter, we repurchased 46.1 million shares for a total of $2.1 billion -- $2 billion, excuse me. Over the last 12 months, we have repurchased nearly 200 million shares for a total of $8.1 billion, and we've paid out dividends of $2.1 billion for a total that is more than 75% of our free cash flow. And the Board of Directors increased the quarterly dividend 25% today from 12% -- from $0.12 to $0.15 per share.
Now to the guidance. First of all, given the continued high volatility in exchange rates, we expect currency will affect results. But as we just don't know how much, I'm going to again provide constant currency guidance only. Secondly, our customers are clearly embracing Oracle PaaS faster than we expected, which is actually great for us. Just to give you a little bit of insight on how we look at the business. For every $1 million of license we sell, we expect to collect another $1 million from support over 5 years for a total of $2 million. While for every $1 million of PaaS we sell, we actually expect to collect $5 million over 5 years. That's what we're looking at in our business, and though it may have some short-term effect, it's actually already showing up in the revenues.
So here we go. SaaS and PaaS on a non-GAAP basis is expected to grow 26% to 30%. On a GAAP basis, SaaS and PaaS revenue is expected to grow 27% to 31%. Cloud IaaS on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis is expected to grow 29% to 33%. Software and Cloud revenue on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, including SaaS, PaaS, IaaS, new software license and software support, is expected to grow 2% to 6%. Hardware systems revenue on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, which includes hardware system products and hardware system support, is expected to be between negative 2% and positive 8%. Total revenue on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis is expected to range from 1% to 6%.
Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be somewhere between $0.90 and $0.96 in constant currency. GAAP EPS is expected to be somewhere between $0.76 and $0.82 in constant currency. And again, all of my guidance today is in constant currency and assumes a non-GAAP tax rate of 24% and a GAAP tax rate of 23%. Of course, it may end up being different, but that's what we've got in our model right now.
With that, I'll turn it over to Mark for his comments."

I think, overall, a very solid quarter for Oracle and a great cloud quarter for Oracle.
As Safra did, I'll give you numbers in CD. SaaS, PaaS revenue grew 33%. Bookings ARR grew 130%, double last year and up double digits sequentially. Fusion bookings, ERP, HCM and SFA all grew triple digits. Fusion bookings have grown more than 200% every quarter this year.
We added 800 brand new SaaS customers -- nearly 800. Nearly 530 existing customers expanded their cloud services in the quarter; in HCM, 220 new customers; in Customer Experience, 470 new customers; in ERP, 160 new customers. ERP SaaS installed base is multiples the size of Workday. We're adding customers at more than 10x the rate of Workday. Less than 25% of our ERP SaaS wins involve any on-premise Oracle ERP customer, meaning that over 75% are net new to Oracle. I would give you a stat on SAP, but we never see them in cloud ERP.
PaaS, more than 400 new PaaS customers in the quarter. Bookings up 200% sequentially. Q4 in PaaS is going to be very big. Premise software grew 6%. We expect continued growth. Engineered Systems grew 15% in the quarter. We sold more than 1,000 systems, including over 500 Exadata units booked. Given competitor results, we're taking huge market share. Oracle will be the leader in high-end servers this year.
In wrapping up, our cloud revenue is already above a $2 billion run rate. Our SaaS, PaaS pipeline is already large and growing rapidly, and it's growing faster than what you're seeing in the bookings -- that being the pipeline. We now expect Q4 bookings up $300 million, $50 million higher than before. We also expect FY '15 bookings growth to be greater than 100%. And you probably remember when Larry actually gave 50% growth in bookings as guidance at a financial analyst meeting, and we're going to double that number. Clearly, the migration to cloud is happening faster than we expected, and to Safra's point, that's great news for Oracle, great news for our customers and great news for our investors.
And with that, I'm going to turn the call over to Larry."

People are very cautious, but they're moving more quickly than historical precedent to adopt 12c for 2 big reasons: One is multitenancy, and the other is our in-memory database option. So that's going exceptionally well. The use cases that are spurring adoption of the Oracle Database in the cloud is the very simple fact you can take any workload, any database that you currently have running in your data center and move your database with a push of a button and move your application with a push of a button and run it in the Oracle cloud. Nobody else can do that. If you look at the other PaaS vendors, well, the second-biggest PaaS vendor -- well, actually, maybe their the biggest PaaS vendor still, where they don't -- I'm not sure they break out their number. Salesforce.com PaaS is based on proprietary technology that allows you to extend Salesforce.com applications. Our PaaS, our Platform as a Service is based on 2 products: Java, the world's most popular programming language and an industry standard; and the Oracle Database, the world's most popular relational database and an industry standard. We have enormous on-premise usage of Java and the Oracle Database. And now people can -- don't have to decide where they're going to run things. They can do test and development in the Oracle cloud and run production in on-premise, and then they can decide, if they need more capacity, they can go from on-premise into the cloud and back to on-premise. We're the only ones that allows you to move data and workload back and forth between the cloud and on-premise. That's the primary use case, we think, that's going to drive Oracle PaaS to be the #1 PaaS in the cloud very, very quickly. The other -- the third question is S4/HANA and the cloud. Well, very simply, I mean, I talk to a lot of people at SAP actually about S4/HANA in the cloud and people who'd recently been at SAP. And you've got to understand one thing. This is the same old SAP. This is all written in ABAP. There's 30-year-old code in S4 business suite. There's nothing new about this. They're simply hosting it on someone else's computer. I also can't find the website where you log on and try it. Everyone else lets you log on. You go to a website. If you want to buy our stuff, you want to buy SaaS, you want to buy PaaS, you go to a website. You get provisioned, and you go. Not so with SAP. This is 30-year-old code renamed S4/HANA. Now they did add a new user interface called Fiori to the old code, but that's all they did. They did add another database that they support. They now support -- in addition to Oracle and Sybase and IBM DB2 and Microsoft SQL Server, they also support HANA. That's it. They've added one new database. They've added a more modern UI. All the old code in the middle is written in ABAP. Ask them. It's written in ABAP. It's 30 years old. We don't see them as a cloud competitor. We actually almost never talk about them except when we get a question on the call. That's it."

I would say that the competitive environment with Workday is different in HR than in ERP/EPM. In ERP/EPM, our position is extremely strong. I would not call Workday competitive in that market at all, so let's put that aside. In the context of HCM, I think with each subsequent release of HCM, whether it had been Release 7, Release 8, Release 9 and now Release 10, we have simply engineered now a better product than Workday. And so I think from an HCM perspective, head-to-head there in the United States, some strong fights. I think as our awareness, the education of our sales force, and our references have gotten better. We now win more than half the deals in the United States. Outside the United States, our win rate goes up actually exponentially because of the breadth of our distribution in those markets. So that's sort of how I would characterize Workday. Also, any deal that comes up that's multi-pillar, so in many cases, you wind up with an ERP competitive environment that then actually many times can drag an HR, so we think competitively, Heather, the fact that we have ERP and EPM in the cloud, in SaaS with a strong lead also benefits our HCM business as well. So out engineering, out distributed in almost all the world. As I described, big lead in ERP/EPM, where I would not describe Workday as extremely competitive. Salesforce, I think perhaps different. Salesforce is clearly the incumbent in most accounts, not Oracle. We're, frankly, the guy coming up with a challenger capability, and we now bring a suite of capability with marketing in addition to sales automation. And we do a lot of things that they don't do. We really come to the customer with a different approach. As opposed to trying to help the customer basically report what the sales force is bidding on. We actually come to market trying to help the sales force, meaning our customers' sales forces, sell more stuff all the way from automating a marketing campaign to the actual process by which they communicate to the customer, get information about the customer and actually go through a whole engineering and selling process with the customer. And this is proven. You've heard it with our numbers. Our sales automation solutions in the quarter were superb. Marketing had a fantastic quarter. We are the leader in marketing. We are challenging very aggressively in sales automation, and we expect to give them a run for their money in every sales automation deal in the planet. But our differentiation, Heather, comes from bringing a suite of capability to help the sales -- or our customer's sales organization sell."

It is spread between a solid -- I would say, a solid Exadata quarter all the way around. We grew in Exadata, and this is going against, I know you know this, Kash, fairly tough comparisons with the success of Exadata last year. But we had very strong performance on some of our new engineered systems, so it was pretty well dispersed. We had strong growth in SuperCluster in the quarter. We had strong growth in our Oracle Database Appliance. We had good growth in our Big Data Appliance, which is our Hadoop Oracle appliance that we brought to market. Our Zero Data, one of my favorite named products that we have in the company, the Zero Data Loss Recovery Appliance, contributed growth in the quarter. So the suite of products that we brought to market in Engineered Systems as a group had a really strong quarter. And while some of the numbers are small coming off of a baseline, they all contributed, and they were all growing. And in an aggregate, we grew 15%. So I think our pipelines are up overall, and so we feel great about the quarter Engineered Systems delivered and great about our pipeline."

We made a big announcement almost 10 years ago that we're rebuilding all of our applications for the cloud. Now it wasn't called the cloud 10 years ago. It was called SaaS. But we said that we're rebuilding everything and the thing called Fusion network, going to rebuild our middleware for the cloud, build our applications on top of our cloud middleware and change our database for the cloud, make it multitenant, make it in-memory, do all of those things. We started a project 10 years ago to rewrite everything. When -- Fusion ERP, every single line of code is brand new. Fusion HCM, every single line of the code is brand new. I can go on and on with all of these -- we -- they're completely rewritten for the cloud as is our -- and our database was not completely rewritten. We added specific features to the database to make it work properly in the cloud, the most prominent of which is the multitenancy feature. We think we put multitenancy at the right level of the stack in the database, rather than multitenancy in the application which creates real security problems, which I'm not going to go into. But we think we have a huge advantage over these -- someone like Workday that doesn't have a database. They built -- Workday kind of built their own little database, and that's what you're buying into when you buy Workday. We built our own little database. It's called Oracle. Workday has its own programming technology. We use this programming technology called Java. So -- we -- and we built everything, everything from scratch. I'm telling you, every single line of code in Fusion HCM is new for the cloud. Every single line of code for Fusion ERP is new for the cloud, and those new cloud applications are based on, by far, the strongest platform. Workday doesn't even have a platform that they sell. They have no platform. They have a platform that they kind of use internally. Salesforce has a platform that we also think is not competitive with our platform. So you're going have to be very specific as what advantages these small companies think they have over us in the cloud when we have, I think, very clearly the strongest platform based on industry standards and years and years of experience. We've adapted that for the cloud. Give you an example how strong our cloud platform is, Salesforce.com uses our cloud platform. Netflix uses our cloud platform. In fact, every single cloud company of size, the top 10, 9 of them use our database in the cloud. Workday is the only one that doesn't. But tell me again the advantages they think they have."

To your point, Engineered Systems, I already went through it. It is now a significant part of our hardware portfolio and grew 15% and while down is a smaller piece of our hardware portfolio being the M-Series of SPARC. T was down in the quarter, again, all offset by the growth we've seen in Engineered Systems. Storage grew in the quarter. We had significant -- a very strong growth in ZFS, if you will, our network attached storage product. That is not a new story, our ZFS growth, and I predict that will continue as we go forward. We have just released a new SAN product, FS1, that came to us through the Pillar acquisition that our engineering team has done super job for us. And that represents, really, a whole new storage market for us now to go compete head up against EMC. So I believe, going forward, you will see a continuation of storage growth, the continuation of ZFS along with now FS1, a continued growth in Engineered Systems. And we'll continue to push refreshing our SPARC base as we have and as we go forward. As it relates to ERP and you asked specifically about international markets, I mean, just for example, in the quarter, just to give you some flavor for this, we closed ERP SaaS deals at Femsa in Mexico, at Saudi Telecom, at BAE Systems, at Hawaiian Airlines, at KPMG. I mean, these are all certainly very strong brands that are going ERP and ERP and cloud, and at least 75% of what I just named are outside the United States. So we've had very strong -- back to just sort of the cloud context, which probably is at the core of your questions. I think I said a couple of quarters ago, we're just going to get better and better at this. And while the numbers are faster than I predicted and I'm -- I wish I could have predicted them better 2 or 3 quarters ago, our sales force has simply just gotten more productive. They're better educated with better products, and they now have references in virtually every single discipline and pillar that we sell in almost every country that we sell. And so what's happening, it's very interesting. We're getting bigger, and we're growing faster as we're getting bigger. And it's because of a multitude of these issues that I'm describing that have all now tilted our way after, frankly, 2, 2.5 years of hard work of getting our customers, similar to the last question, who now know their functional buyer. They know they the head, the Chief Marketing Officer. They know the Chief Human Resource Officer. Our products have now gotten extremely mature, and we've got references. And I think now that we add PaaS to our cloud offerings -- and I probably should have said this earlier, but I've been doing this a long time, and I've really never seen a pipeline grow as fast as our PaaS pipeline has grown. We really released this at OpenWorld in October and the speed of our pipeline -- you see it just in the conversion to bookings. I actually -- Safra and I get to see it in the benefit of the pipeline, and it is just exciting times for Oracle. Back to Ken."

I'll then review guidance for Q1 and then turn the call over to Larry and Mark for their comments. 
As you probably remember, I didn't provide U.S. dollar guidance for Q4, given the unusually high volatility in exchange rates. The currency headwind ended up being higher than consensus estimates would reflect, with 8% to Software and Cloud revenue as well as the total company revenue, 9% for hardware revenue and $0.09 for earnings per share. Currencies continue to move significantly and remain unpredictable, so my comments today generally reflect constant dollar growth rates, which is how we look at the business.
We are delighted with our results, with the most important thing being that we dramatically overachieved in the cloud. This is the first Q4 where we had everything together for the cloud. We had the products that we've been working on for decades, the operations, the sales force and the references with many, many happy customers. Having all that in place caused SaaS, PaaS bookings to grow more than 200%, our best ever growth rate for cloud bookings and more than $125 million higher than our own $300 million goal. For most companies, as their business grows, the growth rates go down. In our case, as the business grows, our growth rates are increasing.
So to the numbers. Cloud SaaS and PaaS revenue was 400 -- I'm doing only non-GAAP, with $419 million, up 34% from last year and well above the high end of my guidance. As our cloud bookings growth continues to accelerate, so to will our cloud revenue growth. As I just said, bookings grew more than 200%, further adding to the momentum, which is helping drive SaaS and PaaS growth. 
Now when you translate the $125 million higher from SaaS and PaaS to what had been historically our license business, it probably would have been around $375 million more in license, and it would all have been booked immediately, not ratably over time. So for us, this was actually fantastic news. 
When bookings ultimately turn into revenue, it depends, of course, on many factors but one thing is clear, our momentum in the cloud bodes very well for the future. Combined with Infrastructure as a Service revenue of $160 million, which was up 31%, our total cloud revenue in the quarter was $579 million.
Engineered Systems continued to -- excuse me, sorry. To help you further understand just how well we are doing in the cloud, I thought it would be helpful to compare our cloud billings growth rate to that of our principal cloud competitors. Billings is generally defined as total revenue in the period plus the sequential change in growth deferred revenue. Our practice at Oracle regarding deferred revenue has always been to net out the build but unpaid invoices from our deferred revenue balance on our balance sheet. 
I believe that our cloud competitors follow a practice where they disclose only a growth deferred revenue book balance, not net for uncollected invoices. So we've put up a spreadsheet on our website to show you the same thing for comparability. We've calculated Oracle's cloud billings using our competitors' methodology or the sum of total cloud revenue plus the sequential change in growth deferred revenue. 
What it shows is that billings grew from $468 million in fiscal 2014 fourth quarter to $834 million in this just finished quarter. That's a growth rate of more than 70% in U.S. dollars. And though there may be seasonality to billings numbers, this is dramatically faster than Salesforce's 21% billings growth and Workday's 31% billings growth in their most recently reported quarter. In summary, our cloud business is significantly outpacing the competition.
Now total software revenues were $8.4 billion, with software updates and product support revenues at $4.7 billion, up 8% from last year. Attach and renewal rates remained at their usual high levels as our growing installed base of customers continues to power earnings and cash flow. New software license revenue were $3.1 billion, reflecting the accelerated migration to cloud. The shift to cloud was very pronounced in Europe, where new software license sales were most impacted. But Europe was also our fastest-growing region for both cloud revenue and bookings, as you would expect from the substitution. 
Total hardware, including hardware support, grew 5% with hardware system product revenue of $818 million and hardware support revenue of $590 million. Engineered Systems continue to be strong with double-digit bookings growth, and we continue to take share from IBM and HP.
For the company, total revenue for the quarter was $10.7 billion, up 3% from last year. Non-GAAP operating income was $5 billion and the operating margin was 46%, with currency and MICROS lowering operating margin by 2%. That we're able to maintain our industry-leading operating margins with MICROS and while growing our cloud business dramatically is a testimony to the strength of our business model. 
While we believe our overachievement in cloud bookings will be much more valuable in both revenue and earnings over time, cloud revenue is recognized ratably unlike new license, which is recognized upfront. This shift has the effect of lowering near-term earnings per share but over time will increase it significantly. 
So for example, a $1 million license deal, which would be recognized upfront dropped right to the bottom line, would ultimately result in about $3 million in revenue over 10 years. A $1 million SaaS, PaaS booking -- a SaaS booking results in $10 million over that same time period. I would not trade the cloud revenue for the license revenue, as cloud revenues and cloud bookings mean significantly more in revenues and earnings over time.
The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was at 25.5%, and EPS was $0.78 in U.S. dollars, $0.09 lower due to currency. The GAAP tax rate was 25.4% and the GAAP EPS was $0.62 in U.S. dollars, $0.08 lower due to currency. Both tax rates were significantly higher than my guidance and were the result of multiple factors but generally relate to the mix of earnings between the U.S. and other jurisdictions, with the U.S. being a larger percentage of our quarter in recognized revenue than we forecast.
For the fiscal 2015, total Software and Cloud revenues totaled $29.5 billion, growing 5% in constant currency. Cloud SaaS and PaaS were $1.5 billion, growing 34%. Cloud Infrastructure as a Service was $608 million, growing 36%. New software license was $8.5 billion, and software support was $18.9 billion, growing 8%. Hardware systems revenue was $5.2 billion, growing 1%. Services revenue was $3.5 billion, essentially unchanged from last year. Total revenue grew 4% to $38.3 billion. Our non-GAAP operating margin for the full year was 45%, and non-GAAP earnings per share were $2.77.
Free cash flow over the last 4 quarters was $12.9 billion. Capital expenditures continue to be higher as we provision existing orders and build out SaaS and PaaS -- for SaaS and PaaS growth. As a reminder, our cloud data centers are built using our own Engineered Systems, so while CapEx is a cost to other cloud providers, a good portion of our CapEx is essentially a hardware sale, which we sell as a cloud subscription. 
We now have $54 billion in cash and marketable securities. Net of debt, our cash position is approximately $12.4 billion. The short-term deferred revenue balance is $7.2 billion, up 9% in constant currency. As we've said before, we're committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisitions, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt and a dividend. In terms of acquisitions, we continue to focus on finding the right companies at the right valuation and both are critically important. 
This quarter, we again repurchased 4.6 million shares for a total of $2 billion. Over the last 12 months, we've repurchased more than 193 million shares for a total of $8.1 billion. We paid out dividends of $2.3 billion for a total that is 8% -- 80% of our free cash flow. And the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of 15% -- $0.15 per share.
Now to the guidance. We feel very good about our own performance, but of course, we are keeping an eye on the macro environment, especially abroad. Additionally, given the continued high volatility in exchange rates, we expect currency will affect results, but as of now, we just don't know how much. So I'm going to again provide constant currency guidance, though I would take our results as some idea of what we think what currencies are doing right around that.
Clearly, customers are migrating to Oracle Cloud at even faster rates, and my guidance reflects this accelerating mix shift. Since you we starting the new year, I am going to make some changes in my guidance. I am dropping some things, including smaller components of cloud, and I'm dropping GAAP guidance, which both best match how we look at the business. All of my guidance today is on a non-GAAP basis and in constant currency. 
So here goes. SaaS and PaaS revenue is expected to grow between 39% and 43%. Software and Cloud revenue, including SaaS, PaaS, IaaS, new software license and software support, is expected to grow between 6% and 8%. Total revenue growth is expected to range from 5% to 8%. Non-GAAP EPS in constant currency is expected to be somewhere between $0.56 and $0.59. This assumes a non-GAAP tax rate of 25.5%. Of course, if this quarter is any example, it may end up being very different.
With that, I'll turn it over to Mark."

I think one, Safra told you about the 34% year-on-year SaaS, PaaS revenue growth. That was 12% sequential growth and almost entirely organic. We talked about the billings growth of 70% now faster than Salesforce or Workday. Bookings at $426 million was 200%-plus growth for Q4.
Let me give you some customer numbers. We added 1,217 SaaS customers in the quarter new. 760 customers expanded. By pillar, HCM added 312 new customers in the quarter. 933 for the year, 3x Workday's total customer growth over the last 4 quarters. In Customer Experience, we added 657 customers in Q4, 1,900 -- almost 1,900 for the year. 
In ERP, we added 380 customers in Q4 and 888 [ph] for the year. Our installed base is now almost 1,100 ERP customers in the cloud, nearly 10x the size of Workday. And let me add, we really never see SAP. In PaaS, we added 1,419 customers in Q4. Let me just repeat, that was 1,419 customers in 1 quarter. We booked over $100 million and grew 100% sequentially.
We're now at scale. Our cloud revenue is already above a $2.3 billion run rate. We added $858 million in ARR this year. $858 million, so using the conversion that Safra used a little while ago. That would be almost $2.5 billion in license. And we expect to fill between $1.5 billion and $2 billion in ARR next year. We're now growing faster than both Salesforce and Workday, and we expect revenue growth next year could be as high in SaaS, PaaS as 60%. 
Now I've given you a lot of numbers to reflect on, but when you look at customer accounts, booking, revenue, the result is the same. We're doing what you very rarely ever see happen in our industry. We are getting bigger and our growth rate is expanding. We will be the world's largest enterprise cloud company. With that, let me turn it over to Larry."

Well, Mark gave you a lot of interesting numbers, and I'd like to drill into a couple of them. First, I'd like to look at our sales growth rates of cloud applications, SaaS and platform services, PaaS. I'm intentionally leaving out our cloud infrastructure business so I can do an apples-to-apples comparison with Salesforce.com, which does not sell Infrastructure as a Service.
Okay. Last year in FY '15, as Mark just said, we sold $858 million of new SaaS and PaaS business. About half of that, $426 million, were sold in Q4. That's a year-over-year Q4 sales growth rate of over 200%. More importantly, the $426 million is more SaaS and PaaS new business that has ever been sold by any cloud services company in a single quarter. It's a record. Clearly, our cloud business has entered [indiscernible] growth phase.
This year in FY '16, we plan on selling between $1.5 billion and $2 billion of new SaaS and PaaS business. In other words, we plan to sell at least twice as much as we sold last year. And that's at least 50% more new business than Salesforce.com will sell in their current fiscal year. 
And if we exceed our plan like we did this Q4, we could book twice as much new business at Salesforce.com. No, I don't think that's likely that we'll sell double what Salesforce.com sell but it's definitely possible.
Second, let's look at the impact these record sales rates have on SaaS and PaaS revenue. In Q4 of FY '15, our SaaS and PaaS revenue grew 35% in constant currency. Because our cloud sales had dramatically accelerated, our SaaS and PaaS revenues are planned to grow at 60% in FY '16, unaided by any new acquisitions. So our cloud service -- now, so our cloud business is much bigger than Workday, and we will grow faster than Workday will this year.
Our cloud SaaS and PaaS revenue is still second to Salesforce.com, but we're growing much, much faster than they are. So it won't be long before we pass it. How and why is this happening? Our SaaS growth is due to the rapid acceptance of our new generation of Fusion Applications. We now have over 1,000 Fusion ERP customers, around 10x more than Workday. Mark said that once, I'm going to say it twice, around 10x more than Workday. 
Workday says they never see SAP in the cloud ERP market. That's the one thing Oracle and Workday agree on. It's between us, Oracle and Workday in the mid-market and the high end of the cloud ERP market and we are winning big time. We are the clear #1 in cloud ERP, and we are #1 or #2 in most other SaaS categories, including HCM, sales, servers, marketing EPM, supply chain and so on. We have a lot more SaaS applications than any other enterprise SaaS company.
Our PaaS growth is due to the huge pent-up demand with the Oracle Database and Java Middleware as a Service. Our customers can now move their Oracle databases and Java applications to the cloud with a push of a button. That's why our PaaS business has grown even faster than our SaaS business. Things are good for Oracle in the cloud."

If it's licensed over a 10-year period, you get the $1 million upfront for the license, and you get 20% a year for 10 years. That's another $2 million for over a 10-year period. You get a total of $3 million. And that's after the cost of sales, it's a very profitable business. Most of that $3 million, again after the cost of sales, is profit. In a $1 million SaaS or PaaS deal, you don't get anything upfront but you have to pay the commissions. And then you only get -- and that $1 million deal is worth $10 million or more than 3x as much as the license deal over a 10-year period, over triple the value. But the accounting is entirely different. The accounting you'd take it ratably over that 10-year period, the commission's upfront and recognize the expenses upfront and you get 10 years. Okay. Now so what's the profitability on SaaS and PaaS? It's -- this is going to shock you. It's about the same as license and support. It's stunningly profitable. Infrastructure as a Service is very different. Again, I'm talking about SaaS and PaaS. Infrastructure as a Service, the margins aren't nearly so high. While we make money in the Infrastructure as a Service, but you see what Amazon's profit margins are on Infrastructure as a Service. We think business when you get scale. But SaaS and PaaS is very similar to license. So that $1 million, which turned into something less than $3 million in profit after you get to scale and license, turns into something less than $10 million in profits, say $9 million in profit over the 10-year period of -- that you're providing the service. So it's a much better business for us in terms of revenue margin -- the revenue goes way up, the profits go way up. And the margins are approximately the same."

They're also simply better trained than they were just even 1 year or 2 years ago. And so the combination of this is what's driven the performance in the cloud. And make no mistake about it, there is a keen sales focus on growing our cloud business. Our cloud business is important for all the reasons that we've already talked through. Now one other point that we haven't brought up that I think I'd add to it is when you look at where we're headed with the cloud, we're going into a year now where we now get frankly more of our portfolio available to the cloud.

So -- and then we had sort of server performance that was -- declines in the quarter. And then the growth in the other products that I've described netted to the growth rate that we described. I mean, let's face it, we are the only hardware company growing in the industry. So when you look at the market share numbers, they sort of get to be staggering. We've taken over the -- and this is not a question you asked but I'm going to say it anyway. In the United States, when you look at servers above $15,000, the #1 company in market share now is Oracle. I believe that will occur region by region by region because of the strength of not just our hardware product line but the alignment of our software portfolio with it. So it was a good quarter for us in hardware and I would expect that trend to continue. Very similar to John's question. I don't think we're telling you that there isn't an on-premise market. Please don't take that message from what we described. But I think the fact that you can take a workload from your on-premise data center and now move it seamlessly to the cloud and back and forth to a data center gives us a tremendous advantage. The configuration we have on cloud, the configuration we have on-premise now can be identical. The ability to move workloads back and forth, use that on our hardware and your data center, use that on the very thing hardware perhaps in the clouds, we're the only company in the industry that can do this. And so I think this bodes very well for our hardware business, granted in a declining market. But I believe Oracle will gain market share in that declining market."

I'm going to focus on our non-GAAP results for Q4 and fiscal 2015. I'll then review guidance for Q1 and then turn the call over to Larry and Mark for their comments.
As you probably remember, I didn't provide U.S. dollar guidance for Q4 given the unusually high volatility in exchange rates. The currency headwind ended up being higher than consensus estimates would reflect, with 8% to Software and Cloud revenue as well as the total company revenue, 9% for hardware revenue and $0.09 for earnings per share. Currencies continue to move significantly and remain unpredictable, so my comments today generally reflect constant dollar growth rate, which is how we look at the business.
We are delighted with our results, with the most important thing being that we dramatically overachieved in the Cloud. This is the first Q4 where we had everything together for the Cloud. We had the products that we've been working on for a decade, the operations, the sales force and the references with many, many happy customers. Having all that in place caused SaaS, PaaS bookings to grow more than 200%, our best ever growth rate for Cloud bookings and more than $125 million higher than our own $300 million goal. For most companies, as their business grows, the growth rates go down. In our case, as the business grows, our growth rates are increasing.
So to the numbers. Cloud SaaS and PaaS revenue was 400 -- I'm doing only non-GAAP, with $419 million, up 34% from last year and well above the high end of my guidance. As our cloud bookings growth continues to accelerate, so to will our cloud revenue growth. As I just said, bookings grew more than 200%, further adding to the momentum, which is helping drive SaaS and PaaS growth.
Now when you translate the $125 million higher from SaaS and PaaS to what how it's been historically, our license business, it probably would have been around $375 million more in license, and it would all have been booked immediately, not ratably over time. So for us, this was actually fantastic news.
When bookings ultimately turn into revenue, it depends, of course, on many factors. But one thing is clear, our momentum in the cloud bodes very well for the future. Combined with Infrastructure as a Service revenue of $160 million, which was up 31%, our total cloud revenue in the quarter was $579 million.
Engineered Systems continued to -- excuse me, sorry. To help you further understand just how well we are doing in the cloud, I thought it would be helpful to compare our cloud billings growth rate to that of our principal cloud competitors. Billings is generally defined as total  revenue in the period plus the sequential change in gross deferred revenue. Our practice at Oracle regarding deferred revenue has always been to net out the billed but unpaid invoices from our deferred revenue balance on our balance sheet.
I believe that our cloud competitors follow a practice where they disclose only a gross deferred revenue book balance, not net for uncollected invoices. So we've put up a spreadsheet on our website to show you the same thing for comparability. We've calculated Oracle's cloud billings using our competitors' methodology or the sum of total cloud revenue plus the sequential change in gross deferred revenue.
What it shows is that billings grew from $468 million in fiscal 2014 fourth quarter to $834 million in this just finished quarter. That's a growth rate of more than 70% in U.S. dollars. And though there may be seasonality to billings numbers, this is dramatically faster than Salesforce's 21% billings growth and Workday's 31% billings growth in their most recently reported quarter. In summary, our cloud business is significantly outpacing the competition.
Now total software revenues were $8.4 billion, with software updates and product support revenues at $4.7 billion, up 8% from last year (sic) [quarter]. Attach and renewal rates remained at their usual high levels as our growing installed base of customers continues to power earnings and cash flow. New software license revenue were $3.1 billion, reflecting the accelerated migration to cloud. The shift to cloud was very pronounced in Europe, where new software license sales were most impacted. But Europe was also our fastest-growing region for both cloud revenue and bookings, as you would expect from the substitution.
Total hardware, including hardware support, grew 5% with hardware system product revenue of $818 million and hardware support revenue of $590 million. Engineered Systems continue to be strong with double-digit bookings growth, and we continue to take share from IBM and HP.
For the company, total revenue for the quarter was $10.7 billion, up 3% from last year. Non-GAAP operating income was $5 billion and the operating margin was 46%, with currency and MICROS lowering operating margin by 2%. That we're able to maintain our industry-leading operating margins with MICROS and while growing our cloud business dramatically is a testimony to the strength of our business model.
While we believe our overachievement in cloud bookings will be much more valuable in both revenue and earnings over time, cloud revenue is recognized ratably unlike new license, which is recognized upfront. This shift has the effect of lowering near-term earnings per share but, over time, will increase it significantly.
So for example, a $1 million license deal, which would be recognized upfront drop right to the bottom line, would ultimately result in about $3 million in revenue over 10 years. A $1 million SaaS, PaaS booking -- of SaaS booking results in $10 million over that same time period. I would not trade the cloud revenue for the license revenue, as cloud revenues and cloud bookings mean significantly more in revenues and earnings over time.
The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was at 25.5%, and EPS was $0.78 in U.S. dollars, $0.09 lower due to currency. The GAAP tax rate was 25.4%, and the GAAP EPS was $0.62 in U.S. dollars, $0.08 lower due to currency. Both tax rates were significantly higher than my guidance and were the result of multiple factors but generally relate to the mix of earnings between the U.S. and other jurisdictions, with the U.S. being a larger percentage of our quarter in recognized revenue than we forecast.
For the fiscal 2015, total Software and Cloud revenues totaled $29.5 billion, growing 5% in constant currency. Cloud SaaS and PaaS were $1.5 billion, growing 34%. Cloud Infrastructure as a Service was $608 million, growing 36%. New software license was $8.5 billion, and software support was $18.9 billion, growing 8%. Hardware systems revenue was $5.2 billion, growing 1%. Services revenue was $3.5 billion, essentially unchanged from last year. Total revenue grew 4% to $38.3 billion. Our non-GAAP operating margin for the full year was 45%, and non-GAAP earnings per share were $2.77.
Free cash flow over the last 4 quarters was $12.9 billion. Capital expenditures continue to be higher as we provision existing orders and build out SaaS and PaaS -- for SaaS and PaaS growth. As a reminder, our cloud data centers are built using our own Engineered Systems, so while CapEx is a cost to other cloud providers, a good portion of our CapEx is essentially a hardware sale, which we sell as a cloud subscription.
We now have $54 billion in cash and marketable securities. Net of debt, our cash position is approximately $12.4 billion. The short-term deferred revenue balance is $7.2 billion, up 9% in constant currency. As we've said before, we're committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisitions, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt and a dividend. In terms of acquisitions, we continue to focus on finding the right companies at the right valuation and both are critically important.
This quarter, we again repurchased 4.6 million shares for a total of $2 billion. Over the last 12 months, we've repurchased more than 193 million shares for a total of $8.1 billion. We paid out dividends of $2.3 billion for a total that is 8% -- 80% of our free cash flow. And the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of 15% -- $0.15 per share.
Now to the guidance. We feel very good about our own performance but, of course, we are keeping an eye on the macro environment, especially abroad. Additionally, given the continued high volatility in exchange rates, we expect currency will affect results but, as of now, we just don't know how much. So I'm going to, again, provide constant currency guidance, though I would take our results as some idea for what we think what currencies are doing right around now.
Clearly, customers are migrating to Oracle cloud at even faster rate, and my guidance reflects this accelerating mix shift. Since we are starting a new year, I am going to make some changes in my guidance. I am dropping some things, including smaller components of cloud, and I'm dropping GAAP guidance, which both best match how we look at the business. All of my guidance today is on a non-GAAP basis and in constant currency.
So here it goes. SaaS and PaaS revenue is expected to grow between 39% and 43%. Software and Cloud revenue, including SaaS, PaaS, IaaS, new software license and software support, is expected to grow between 6% and 8%. Total revenue growth is expected to range from 5% to 8%. Non-GAAP EPS in constant currency is expected to be somewhere between $0.56 and $0.59. This assumes a non-GAAP tax rate of 25.5%. Of course, if this quarter is any example, it may end up being very different.
With that, I'll turn it over to Mark."

I think, one, Safra told you about the 34% year-on-year SaaS, PaaS revenue growth, that was 12% sequential growth and almost entirely organic. We talked about the billings growth of 70%, now faster than Salesforce or Workday. Bookings of $426 million was 200%-plus growth for Q4.
Let me give you some customer numbers. We added 1,217 SaaS customers in the quarter, new. 760 customers expanded. By pillar, HCM added 312 new customers in the quarter. 933 for the year, 3x Workday's total customer growth over the last 4 quarters. In Customer Experience, we added 657 customers in Q4, 1,900 -- almost 1,900 for the year.
In ERP, we added 380 customers in Q4 and 888 for the year. Our installed base is now almost 1,100 ERP customers in the cloud, nearly 10x the size of Workday. And let me add, we really never see SAP. In PaaS, we added 1,419 customers in Q4. Let me just repeat, that was 1,419 customers in 1 quarter. We booked over $100 million and grew 100% sequentially.
We're now at scale. Our cloud revenue is already above a $2.3 billion run rate. We added $858 million in ARR this year. $858 million. So using the conversion that Safra used a little while ago, that would be almost $2.5 billion in license. And we expect to fill between $1.5 billion and $2 billion in ARR next year. We're now growing faster than both Salesforce and Workday, and we expect revenue growth next year could be as high in SaaS, PaaS as 60%.
Now I've given you a lot of numbers to reflect on, but when you look at customer accounts, booking, revenue, the result is the same. We're doing what you very rarely ever see happen in our industry. We are getting bigger and our growth rate is expanding. We will be the world's largest enterprise cloud company. With that, let me turn it over to Larry."

Well, Mark gave you a lot of interesting numbers, and I'd like to drill into a couple of them. First, I'd like to look at our sales growth rates of cloud applications, SaaS and platform services, PaaS. I'm intentionally leaving out our cloud infrastructure business so I can do an apples-to-apples comparison with Salesforce.com, which does not sell Infrastructure as a Service.
Okay. Last year, in FY '15, as Mark just said, we sold $858 million of new SaaS and PaaS business. About half of that, $426 million, were sold in Q4. That's a year-over-year Q4 sales growth rate of over 200%. More importantly, the $426 million is more SaaS and PaaS new business that has ever been sold by any cloud services company in a single quarter. It's a record. Clearly, our cloud business has entered a hypergrowth phase.
This year, in FY '16, we plan on selling between $1.5 billion and $2 billion of new SaaS and PaaS business. In other words, we plan to sell at least twice as much as we sold last year. And that's at least 50% more new business than Salesforce.com will sell in their current fiscal year.
And if we exceed our plan like we did this Q4, we could book twice as much new business than Salesforce.com. No, I don't think that's likely that we'll sell double what Salesforce.com sell, but it's definitely possible.
Second, let's look at the impact these record sales rates have on SaaS and PaaS revenue. In Q4 of FY '15, our SaaS and PaaS revenue grew 35% in constant currency. Because our cloud sales had dramatically accelerated, our SaaS and PaaS revenues are planned to grow at 60% in FY '16, unaided by any new acquisitions. So our cloud service -- so our cloud business is much bigger than Workday, and we will grow faster than Workday will this year.
Our cloud SaaS and PaaS revenue is still second to Salesforce.com, but we're growing much, much faster than they are. So it won't be long before we pass them. How and why is this happening? Our SaaS growth is due to the rapid acceptance of our new generation of Fusion applications. We now have over 1,000 Fusion ERP customers, around 10x more than Workday. Mark said that once, I'm going to say it twice, around 10x more than Workday.
Workday says they never see SAP in the cloud ERP market. That's the one thing Oracle and Workday agree on. It's between us, Oracle and Workday, in the mid-market and the high end of the cloud ERP market and we are winning big time. We are the clear #1 in cloud ERP and we are #1 or #2 in most other SaaS categories, including HCM, sales, servers, marketing, EPM, supply chain and so on. We have a lot more SaaS applications than any other enterprise SaaS company.
Our PaaS growth is due to the huge pent-up demand with the Oracle Database and Java Middleware as a Service. Our customers can now move their Oracle databases and Java applications to the cloud with a push of a button, that's why our PaaS business has grown even faster than our SaaS business. Things are good for Oracle in the cloud."

If it's licensed over a 10-year period, you get the $1 million upfront for the license and you get 20% a year for 10 years. That's another $2 million for over a 10-year period, you get a total of $3 million. And after the cost of sales, it's a very profitable business. Most of that $3 million, again, after the cost of sales, is profit. In a $1 million SaaS or PaaS deal, you don't get anything upfront but you have to pay the commissions. And then you only get -- and that $1 million deal is worth $10 million or more than 3x as much as the license deal over a 10-year period, over triple the value. But the accounting is entirely different. The accounting, you take it ratably over that 10-year period, so you have to pay the commission's upfront and recognize the expenses upfront and you get 10 years. Okay, so what's the profitability on SaaS and PaaS? It's -- this is going to shock you, it's about the same as license and support. It's stunningly profitable. Infrastructure as a Service is very different. Again, I'm talking about SaaS and PaaS. Infrastructure as a Service, the margins aren't nearly so high, though we make money in the Infrastructure as a Service. But you can see what Amazon's profit margins are on Infrastructure as a Service, we think it can be a profitable business when you get scale. SaaS and PaaS is very similar to license. So that $1 million, which turned into something less than $3 million in profit after you get to scale in license, turns into something less than $10 million in profits, say, $9 million in profit over the 10-year period of -- that you're providing the service. So it's a much better business for us in terms of revenue, margin -- the revenue goes way up, the profits go way up. And the margins are approximately the same."

And that is an opportunity for us as we maintain our on-prem base but frankly grow our market share through this shift to the cloud. And we can see it, and it's exciting. Remember, John, too, when we win a SaaS application, we gain all the hardware, all the operating systems, all the database and all the middleware. When we gain PaaS, we get all the database, all the operating system and all the hardware as well.

They're also simply better trained than they were just even a year or 2 years ago. And so the combination of this is what's driven the performance in the cloud. And make no mistake about it, there is a keen sales focus on growing our cloud business. Our cloud business is important for all the reasons that we've already talked through. Now one other point that we haven't brought up but I think I'd add to it is when you look at where we're heading with the cloud, we're going into a year now where we now get, frankly, more of our portfolio available in the cloud.

So -- but -- and then we had sort of server performance that was -- declines in the quarter and then the growth in the other products that I've described netted to the growth rate that we described. I mean, let's face it, we are the only hardware company growing in the industry. So when you look at the market share numbers, they sort of get to be staggering. We've taken over the -- and this is not a question you asked, but I'm going to say it anyway, in the United States, when you look at servers above $15,000, the #1 company in market share now is Oracle. I believe that will occur region by region by region because of the strength of not just our hardware product line but the alignment of our software portfolio with it. So it was a good quarter for us in hardware, and I would expect that trend to continue. Very similar to John's question. I don't think we're telling you that there isn't an on-premise market. Please don't take that message from what we described. But I think the fact that you can take a workload from your on-premise data center and now move it seamlessly to the cloud and back and forth to a data center gives us a tremendous advantage. The configuration we have on cloud, the configuration we have on-premise now can be identical. The ability to move workloads back and forth, use that on our hardware and your data center, use that on the very same hardware, perhaps, in the cloud, we're the only company in the industry that can do this. And so I think this bodes very well for our hardware business, granted in a declining market, but I believe Oracle will gain market share in that declining market."

I'm going to focus on our non-GAAP results for Q4 and fiscal 2015.

I'm going to focus on our non-GAAP results for Q4 and fiscal 2015. I'll then review guidance for Q1 and then turn the call over to Larry and Mark for their comments.
As you probably remember, I didn't provide U.S. dollar guidance for Q4 given the unusually high volatility in exchange rates. The currency headwind ended up being higher than consensus estimates would reflect, with 8% to Software and Cloud revenue as well as the total company revenue, 9% for hardware revenue and $0.09 for earnings per share. Currencies continue to move significantly and remain unpredictable, so my comments today generally reflect constant dollar growth rate, which is how we look at the business.
We are delighted with our results, with the most important thing being that we dramatically overachieved in the Cloud. This is the first Q4 where we had everything together for the Cloud. We had the products that we've been working on for a decade, the operations, the sales force and the references with many, many happy customers. Having all that in place caused SaaS, PaaS bookings to grow more than 200%, our best ever growth rate for Cloud bookings and more than $125 million higher than our own $300 million goal. For most companies, as their business grows, the growth rates go down. In our case, as the business grows, our growth rates are increasing.
So to the numbers. Cloud SaaS and PaaS revenue was 400 -- I'm doing only non-GAAP, was $419 million, up 34% from last year and well above the high end of my guidance. As our cloud bookings growth continues to accelerate, so too will our cloud revenue growth. As I just said, bookings grew more than 200%, further adding to the momentum, which is helping drive SaaS and PaaS growth.
Now when you translate the $125 million higher is from SaaS and PaaS to having been historically, our license business, it probably would have been around $375 million more in license, and it would all have been booked immediately, not ratably over time. So for us, this was actually fantastic news.
When bookings ultimately turn into revenue, it depends, of course, on many factors. But one thing is clear, our momentum in the cloud bodes very well for the future. Combined with Infrastructure as a Service revenue of $160 million, which was up 31%, our total cloud revenue in the quarter was $579 million.
Engineered Systems continued to -- excuse me, sorry. To help you further understand just how well we are doing in the cloud, I thought it would be helpful to compare our cloud billings growth rate to that of our principal cloud competitors. Billings is generally defined as total revenue in the period plus the sequential change in gross deferred revenue. Our practice at Oracle regarding deferred revenue has always been to net out the billed but unpaid invoices from our deferred revenue balance on our balance sheet.
I believe that our cloud competitors follow a practice where they disclose only a gross deferred revenue book balance, not net for uncollected invoices. So we've put up a spreadsheet on our website to show you the same thing for comparability. We've calculated Oracle's cloud billings using our competitors' methodology or the sum of total cloud revenue plus the sequential change in gross deferred revenue.
What it shows is that billings grew from $468 million in fiscal 2014 fourth quarter to $834 million in this just finished quarter. That's a growth rate of more than 70% in U.S. dollars. And though there may be seasonality to billings numbers, this is dramatically faster than Salesforce's 21% billings growth and Workday's 31% billings growth in their most recently reported quarter. In summary, our cloud business is significantly outpacing the competition.
Now total software revenues were $8.4 billion, with software updates and product support revenues at $4.7 billion, up 8% from last year (sic) [quarter]. Attach and renewal rates remained at their usual high levels as our growing installed base of customers continues to power earnings and cash flow. New software license revenue were $3.1 billion, reflecting the accelerated migration to cloud. The shift to cloud was very pronounced in Europe, where new software license sales were most impacted. But Europe was also our fastest-growing region for both cloud revenue and bookings, as you would expect from the substitution.
Total hardware, including hardware support, grew 5% with hardware system product revenue of $818 million and hardware support revenue of $590 million. Engineered Systems continue to be strong with double-digit bookings growth, and we continue to take share from IBM and HP.
For the company, total revenue for the quarter was $10.7 billion, up 3% from last year. Non-GAAP operating income was $5 billion and the operating margin was 46%, with currency and MICROS lowering operating margin by 2%. That we're able to maintain our industry-leading operating margins with MICROS and while growing our cloud business dramatically is a testimony to the strength of our business model.
While we believe our overachievement in cloud bookings will be much more valuable in both revenue and earnings over time, cloud revenue is recognized ratably unlike new license, which is recognized upfront. This shift has the effect of lowering near-term earnings per share but, over time, will increase it significantly.
So for example, a $1 million license deal, which would be recognized upfront dropped right to the bottom line, would ultimately result in about $3 million in revenue over 10 years. A $1 million SaaS, PaaS booking -- of SaaS booking results in $10 million over that same time period. I would not trade the cloud revenue for the license revenue, as cloud revenues and cloud bookings mean significantly more in revenues and earnings over time.
The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was at 25.5%, and EPS was $0.78 in U.S. dollars, $0.09 lower due to currency. The GAAP tax rate was 25.4%, and the GAAP EPS was USD 0.62, $0.08 lower due to currency. Both tax rates were significantly higher than my guidance and were the result of multiple factors but generally relate to the mix of earnings between the U.S. and other jurisdictions, with the U.S. being a larger percentage of our quarter in recognized revenue than we forecast.
For the fiscal 2015, total Software and Cloud revenues totaled $29.5 billion, growing 5% in constant currency. Cloud SaaS and PaaS were $1.5 billion, growing 34%. Cloud Infrastructure as a Service was $608 million, growing 36%. New software license was $8.5 billion, and software support was $18.9 billion, growing 8%. Hardware systems revenue was $5.2 billion, growing 1%. Services revenue was $3.5 billion, essentially unchanged from last year. Total revenue grew 4% to $38.3 billion. Our non-GAAP operating margin for the full year was 45%, and non-GAAP earnings per share were $2.77.
Free cash flow over the last 4 quarters was $12.9 billion. Capital expenditures continue to be higher as we provision existing orders and build out SaaS and PaaS -- for SaaS and PaaS growth. As a reminder, our cloud data centers are built using our own Engineered Systems, so while CapEx is a cost to other cloud providers, a good portion of our CapEx is essentially a hardware sale, which we sell as a cloud subscription.
We now have $54 billion in cash and marketable securities. Net of debt, our cash position is approximately $12.4 billion. The short-term deferred revenue balance is $7.2 billion, up 9% in constant currency. As we've said before, we're committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisitions, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt and a dividend. In terms of acquisitions, we continue to focus on finding the right companies at the right valuation and both are critically important.
This quarter, we again repurchased 4.6 million shares for a total of $2 billion. Over the last 12 months, we've repurchased more than 193 million shares for a total of $8.1 billion. We paid out dividends of $2.3 billion for a total that is 8% -- 80% of our free cash flow. And the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of 15% -- $0.15 per share.
Now to the guidance. We feel very good about our own performance but, of course, we are keeping an eye on the macro environment, especially abroad. Additionally, given the continued high volatility in exchange rates, we expect currency will affect results but, as of now, we just don't know how much. So I'm going to, again, provide constant currency guidance, though I would take our results as some idea for what we think what currencies are doing right around now.
Clearly, customers are migrating to Oracle cloud at even faster rate, and my guidance reflects this accelerating mix shift. Since we are starting a new year, I am going to make some changes in my guidance. I am dropping some things, including smaller components of cloud, and I'm dropping GAAP guidance, which both -- best match how we look at the business. All of my guidance today is on a non-GAAP basis and in constant currency.
So here it goes. SaaS and PaaS revenue is expected to grow between 39% and 43%. Software and Cloud revenue, including SaaS, PaaS, IaaS, new software license and software support, is expected to grow between 6% and 8%. Total revenue growth is expected to range from 5% to 8%. Non-GAAP EPS in constant currency is expected to be somewhere between $0.56 and $0.59. This assumes a non-GAAP tax rate of 25.5%. Of course, if this quarter is any example, it may end up being very different.
With that, I'll turn it over to Mark."

I think, one, Safra told you about the 34% year-on-year SaaS, PaaS revenue growth, that was 12% sequential growth and almost entirely organic. We talked about the billings growth of 70%, now faster than Salesforce or Workday. Bookings of $426 million was 200%-plus growth for Q4.
Let me give you some customer numbers. We added 1,217 SaaS customers in the quarter, new. 760 customers expanded. By pillar, HCM added 312 new customers in the quarter, 933 for the year, 3x Workday's total customer growth over the last 4 quarters. In Customer Experience, we added 657 customers in Q4, 1,900 -- almost 1,900 for the year.
In ERP, we added 380 customers in Q4 and 888 for the year. Our installed base is now almost 1,100 ERP customers in the cloud, nearly 10x the size of Workday. And let me add, we really never see SAP. In PaaS, we added 1,419 customers in Q4. Let me just repeat, that was 1,419 customers in 1 quarter. We booked over $100 million and grew 100% sequentially.
We're now at scale. Our cloud revenue is already above a $2.3 billion run rate. We added $858 million in ARR this year. $858 million. So using the conversion that Safra used a little while ago, that would be almost $2.5 billion in license. And we expect to sell between $1.5 billion and $2 billion in ARR next year. We're now growing faster than both Salesforce and Workday, and we expect revenue growth next year could be as high in SaaS, PaaS as 60%.
Now I've given you a lot of numbers to reflect on, but when you look at customer accounts, booking, revenue, the result is the same. We're doing what you very rarely ever see happen in our industry. We are getting bigger and our growth rate is expanding. We will be the world's largest enterprise cloud company. With that, let me turn it over to Larry."

Well, Mark gave you a lot of interesting numbers, and I'd like to drill into a couple of them. First, I'd like to look at our sales growth rates of cloud applications, SaaS and platform services, PaaS. I'm intentionally leaving out our cloud infrastructure business so I can do an apples-to-apples comparison with Salesforce.com, which does not sell Infrastructure as a Service.
Okay. Last year, in FY '15, as Mark just said, we sold $858 million of new SaaS and PaaS business. About half of that, $426 million, was sold in Q4. That's a year-over-year Q4 sales growth rate of over 200%. More importantly, the $426 million is more SaaS and PaaS new business than has ever been sold by any cloud services company in a single quarter. It's a record. Clearly, our cloud business has entered a hypergrowth phase.
This year, in FY '16, we plan on selling between $1.5 billion and $2 billion of new SaaS and PaaS business. In other words, we plan to sell at least twice as much as we sold last year. And that's at least 50% more new business than Salesforce.com will sell in their current fiscal year.
And if we exceed our plan like we did this Q4, we could book twice as much new business than Salesforce.com. Now, I don't think that's likely that we'll sell double what Salesforce.com sells, but it's definitely possible.
Second, let's look at the impact these record sales rates have on SaaS and PaaS revenue. In Q4 of FY '15, our SaaS and PaaS revenue grew 35% in constant currency. Because our cloud sales had dramatically accelerated, our SaaS and PaaS revenues are planned to grow at 60% in FY '16, unaided by any new acquisitions. So our cloud service -- so our cloud business is much bigger than Workday, and we will grow faster than Workday will this year.
Our cloud SaaS and PaaS revenue is still second to Salesforce.com, but we're growing much, much faster than they are. So it won't be long before we pass them. How and why is this happening? Our SaaS growth is due to the rapid acceptance of our new generation of Fusion applications. We now have over 1,000 Fusion ERP customers, around 10x more than Workday. Mark said that once, I'm going to say it twice, around 10x more than Workday.
Workday says they never see SAP in the cloud ERP market. That's the one thing Oracle and Workday agree on. It's between us, Oracle and Workday, in the mid-market and the high end of the cloud ERP market and we are winning big time. We are the clear #1 in cloud ERP and we are #1 or #2 in most other SaaS categories, including HCM, sales, service, marketing, EPM, supply chain and so on. We have a lot more SaaS applications than any other enterprise SaaS company.
Our PaaS growth is due to the huge pent-up demand with the Oracle Database and Java Middleware as a Service. Our customers can now move their Oracle databases and Java applications to the cloud with the push of a button, that's why our PaaS business has grown even faster than our SaaS business. Things are good for Oracle in the cloud."

If it's licensed over a 10-year period, you get the $1 million upfront for the license and you get 20% a year for 10 years. That's another $2 million for over a 10-year period, you get a total of $3 million. And after the cost of sales, it's a very profitable business. Most of that $3 million, again, after the cost of sales, is profit. In a $1 million SaaS or PaaS deal, you don't get anything upfront but you have to pay the commissions. And then you only get -- and that $1 million deal is worth $10 million or more than 3x as much as the license deal over a 10-year period, over triple the value. But the accounting is entirely different. The accounting, you take it ratably over that 10-year period, so you have to pay the commissions upfront and recognize the expenses upfront and you get 10 years. Okay, so what's the profitability on SaaS and PaaS? It's -- this is going to shock you, it's about the same as license and support. It's stunningly profitable. Infrastructure as a Service is very different. Again, I'm talking about SaaS and PaaS. Infrastructure as a Service, the margins aren't nearly so high, though we make money in the Infrastructure as a Service. But you can see what Amazon's profit margins are on Infrastructure as a Service, we think it can be a profitable business when you get scale. But SaaS and PaaS is very similar to license. So that $1 million, which turned into something less than $3 million in profit after you get to scale in license, turns into something less than $10 million in profits, say, $9 million in profit over the 10-year period of -- that you're providing the service. So it's a much better business for us in terms of revenue, margin -- the revenue goes way up, the profits go way up. And the margins are approximately the same."

And that is an opportunity for us as we maintain our on-prem base but frankly grow our market share through this shift to the cloud. And we can see it, and it's exciting. Remember, John, too, when we win a SaaS application, we gain all the hardware, all the operating systems, all the database and all the middleware. When we gain PaaS, we get all the database, all the operating system and all the hardware as well.

You've got, one, frankly, the products are just better. They're just getting better and they're more mature. Our salespeople, we have more of them, and they have longer tenure. They're also simply better trained than they were just even a year or 2 years ago. And so the combination of this is what's driven the performance in the cloud. And make no mistake about it, there is a keen sales focus on growing our cloud business. Our cloud business is important for all the reasons that we've already talked through. Now one other point that we haven't brought up but I think I'd add to it is when you look at where we're heading with the cloud, we're going into a year now where we now get, frankly, more of our portfolio available in the cloud.

So -- but -- and then we had sort of server performance that was -- declines in the quarter and then the growth in the other products that I've described netted to the growth rate that we described. I mean, let's face it, we are the only hardware company growing in the industry. So when you look at the market share numbers, they sort of get to be staggering. We've taken over the -- and this is not a question you asked, but I'm going to say it anyway, in the United States, when you look at servers above $15,000, the #1 company in market share now is Oracle. I believe that will occur region by region by region because of the strength of not just our hardware product line but the alignment of our software portfolio with it. So it was a good quarter for us in hardware, and I would expect that trend to continue. Very similar to John's question. I don't think we're telling you that there isn't an on-premise market. Please don't take that message from what we described. But I think the fact that you can take a workload from your on-premise data center and now move it seamlessly to the cloud and back and forth to a data center gives us a tremendous advantage. The configuration we have on cloud, the configuration we have on-premise now can be identical. The ability to move workloads back and forth, use that on our hardware in your data center, use that on the very same hardware, perhaps, in the cloud, we're the only company in the industry that can do this. And so I think this bodes very well for our hardware business, granted in a declining market, but I believe Oracle will gain market share in that declining market."

If you don't hear me, I may have to reconnect so -- but I do have obviously Ken Bond on the call and Corey West, our Chief Accounting Officer is also, I think, in the room with Larry and Mark. 
I'm going to focus today on our non-GAAP results for Q1. I'll then review guidance for Q2, and I will actually give some guidance for the entire fiscal year. And then I'll turn the call over to Mark and Larry for their comments.
As you know, we didn't provide you a stellar guidance for Q1, given the high volatility in exchange rates we were seeing at the time. As it happened, Q1 currency headwinds were actually 2% worse than we expected. The currency impact for both total revenue and hardware revenue ended up being 9%. And for Software and Cloud revenue was 8%. 
Now we do get benefit on the expense side, but because many of our expenses are in the United States, we get a very small benefit and, of course, our expenses are significantly lower than our revenues, and so our operating income was actually impacted by 12 points. 
Earnings per share was $0.06 lower because of currency, $0.01 worse than we anticipated. With currency still volatile, we will continue to use constant dollar growth rates on our quarterly calls so we can have some measure of consistency and also share with you how we look at the business. 
We've also changed the presentation of our income statement to better reflect how we look at the company now that cloud has become a significant contributor to revenue. Our software business is really 2 parts of 1 business: the on-premise software business, which is steady and growing modestly; and the cloud business that is in a high-growth phase. We thought it made sense to show the components grouped together in our income statement to make it easier to see the progress we are making in the cloud. 
The largest part is on-premise software revenue, which is made up of new software licenses plus software license updates and product support. On-premise software revenue was up 4% for the quarter to $5.8 billion. The largest component is software license updates and product support, which was up 8% for the quarter to $4.7 billion, with attach and renewal rates running at their usual high levels. We expect the on-premise software business to remain steady. Over the full year, I expect we will see modest growth comprised of continued growth in software support revenue that offsets any declines in new software license.
Moving on to cloud. We start with SaaS and PaaS and then add Infrastructure as a Service to report total Cloud revenue, which were up 34%. Within the cloud business, we continue to see excellent momentum in SaaS and PaaS, with bookings growth of 165% this quarter on top of the 54% growth from Q1 of last year. 
SaaS and PaaS revenue was $452 million, up 38% from last year. The triple-digit bookings growth that we have been experiencing will translate into significant acceleration in SaaS and PaaS revenue in the second half of the year. You can also see the coming revenue acceleration of our cloud business in the SaaS and PaaS billings and deferred revenue. SaaS and PaaS billings grew 70% in U.S. dollars this quarter on top of the 100% growth last quarter. Also, the gross deferred revenue balance is now nearly $1 billion and was up more than 100%. We've put the billings numbers up on the website for you to see in detail.
Our significant success in cloud bookings will not only help accelerate our revenue growth, but it will also benefit our margins and earnings over time. Cloud revenue, as you know, is recognized ratably while new license is recognized all upfront. This timing difference has the effect of lowering near-term operating margins and earnings per share but over time will increase both. 
As our SaaS and PaaS bookings have continued to accelerate, capital expenditures for the quarter were higher compared to last year. The bulk of them are largely complete, and you can see this in the $150 million sequential decline in CapEx this quarter. I expect CapEx for this year will be materially lower than last year as we utilize the investments that we have already made. 
We are well aware of the near-term impact to gross margins that this build-out cost has had on the cloud business, and I think that Q4 of last year marks the bottom for SaaS and PaaS gross margins. Q1 cloud gross margins were up slightly on a sequential basis, and I think we'll see another modest improvement in Q2. But as our cloud business scales up, we expect SaaS and PaaS gross margins will be around 60% by Q4 and then 80% over the next 2 years.
The balance of our cloud revenue come from cloud Infrastructure as a Service, which was up 23% to $160 million. The gross margin in this business was up sequentially to a record 45%. While SaaS and PaaS revenue will see much higher growth rate, along with significantly higher gross margins, we expect Infrastructure as a Service revenues will grow at a single-digit rate and maintain a steady margin profile over time.
As I mentioned, there are 2 parts to our software business that can be looked at separately but should really be considered together: the on-premise software business, which will grow modestly and serve as a tremendous base of loyal customers using our leading product; the SaaS and PaaS revenues will grow rapidly and will quickly become a significant contributor to revenues and profit as we help those same customers transform their businesses over time. In total, we will see growth in the total software business begin to increase this year as cloud revenue grows as a percentage of the total software business.
Finally, total hardware revenues grew 6%, which included hardware products revenue of $570 million and hardware support revenue of $559 million. Total revenue for the quarter was up 7% from last year to $8.5 billion. 
Non-GAAP operating income was $3.5 billion and the operating margin was 41%. Sales and cloud investments, along with the integration of MICROS, each impacted operating margins negatively by about 1%. A non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter -- the non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 25%, which was 3.5 points higher than last year. The GAAP tax rate was 24.4%, which was 5 points higher than last year. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.53 in U.S. dollars and GAAP EPS was $0.40 in U.S. dollars. As I said earlier, both were $0.06 lower due to currency. Free cash flow over the last 4 quarters was $11.8 billion.
We now have nearly $56 billion in cash and marketable securities. Net of debt, our cash position is approximately $14 billion. The short-term deferred revenue balance is $9.1 billion, up 10% in constant currency. This quarter, we repurchased more than 75 million shares for a total of $3 billion, up from our fiscal year '15 run rate of $2 billion a quarter. And given current market conditions, we expect to buy even more in Q2. 
The Board of Directors also declared a quarterly dividend of $0.15. Over the last 12 months, we've repurchased more than 220 million shares for a total of $9.1 billion and paid out dividends of $2.4 billion for a total that is nearly 100% of free cash flow.
Now to the guidance. As I mentioned, I'm going to give you guidance for Q2 and then for the whole year. We feel very good about the progress of our cloud transition, and clearly, customers are migrating to the Oracle cloud. Over time, we expect the cloud will result in more revenue and profit for Oracle as we take share from legacy on-premise competitors, other cloud competitors who are limited to point solutions and the labor suppliers who can't possibly offer what we have already built. 
Of course, I am seeing many of the same financial news reports that all of you are about the whole world, and so I think it is still best to be prudent here. Additionally, we expect to see continued volatility in exchange rate and significant currency headwinds. 
I'm going to give you constant currency guidance, but if exchange rates remain the same as they are right now, we expect to see a currency headwind of about 6% on revenue and $0.05 on earnings per share. But again, it could be significantly worse. Maybe if we're lucky, it could be a little bit better. All of my guidance today is on a non-GAAP basis and in constant currency. So here it goes.
SaaS and PaaS revenue is expected to grow 36% to 40%. Cloud IaaS revenue is expected to grow 5% to 9%. Total cloud and on-premise software is expected to grow from 0% to 2%. Total revenue is expected to range from a negative 2 [ph] to a positive 1 [ph] 
Non-GAAP EPS in constant currency is expected to be somewhere between $0.63 and $0.66. Now this assumes a non-GAAP tax rate of 25.5%. Of course, if this quarter is any example, it may end up being different. Looking further out, we expect to see a material acceleration in SaaS and PaaS revenue. As a result, I'm providing full fiscal year guidance for some key items. As before, my guidance on the full year is in constant currency.
SaaS and PaaS revenue is expected to grow around 50%. On-premise software is expected to grow approximately 1%. Total cloud and on-premise software is expected to grow between 3% and 4%. Finally, SaaS and PaaS gross margins are expected to materially improve in the second half and exit the year at around 60%. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Larry and Mark for their comments."

Revenue grew 38% year-on-year, 8% quarter-on-quarter. Billings grew 70%, again growing much faster than Salesforce and Workday. Bookings were USD 191 million, 165% growth. And like I always do, I want to tell you the number of customers we added. We added 612 new SaaS customers in the quarter, brand new logos. 616 expanded their SaaS business with us in the quarter. 
In HCM, it was 166 new customers, more than double what Workday had. In CX, 280 customers. In ERP EPM, it was 200 customers, double last year. That is also more than Workday's lifetime sales. We now have 1,350 customers in our installed base. More than 300 are already live, including 100 that went live in just Q1. 
What's taken Workday 8 quarters to do, we did in 1 quarter. We never say ASAP. PaaS, we added 800 new PaaS customers in the quarter. 2,500 in just 2 quarters. Bookings over $65 million. Now I think we have a shot in Q2 to book more PaaS than we actually did in Q4. I think we have a shot. That's how fast we see our pipeline growing in PaaS.
I'm going to wrap up and then I'm going to [indiscernible] I just want to connect a few dots between what Safra and Larry described on the Oracle SaaS, PaaS cloud. We're currently at a $1.8 billion run rate in revenue. If you include IaaS, it's $2.4 billion. We will book between $1.5 billion and $2 billion in SaaS, PaaS ARR in the fiscal year. 
Gross deferred revenue has grown from $475 million to nearly $1 billion in the year. Billings are growing 70%. Gross margins are headed to 80%. SaaS, PaaS will be a very large and very profitable business for Oracle. 
Now in addition, I just want to give you some brands that we got in the quarter just so you have a feeling for who these -- all these people are that are buying solutions from us. So first, let me get to HCM. A few minutes. CEMEX, they're an Australia Fusion HCM. We replaced Workday at in the quarter. Cypress Semiconductor, GDF Suez, Limited Brands, Nationwide Insurance, Restoration Hardware, Rutgers University. 
We expanded our HCM Cloud at Omnicare, the Navy, Westpac Bank. In ERP EPM, Athena Health, Chicago Sun-Times, these are all new customers by the way. Fox Home Entertainment, U.S. Department of Energy, LendingClub Corp, Lenovo, LG Electronics, Rutgers University. By the way, you'll hear a few names twice, which is because they bought multiple pillars at the same time. 
In sales service cloud, Fox Home Entertainment, Royal Mail, Sallie Mae, SIRIUS XM, Toshiba Medical, Wesfarmers, expansions at CIGNA, Motorola, Nikon, Polycom, Virgin Atlantic, Westpac. 
In our marketing cloud, Aer Lingus, General Mills, James West, Telstra, Verizon, expansions at Booz Allen Hamilton, Forever 21, National Instruments, NetApp, Pier 1 Imports, Public Broadcasting System, Tailor-made Company, Time Inc. I'm going to stop, but I wanted to give you a flavor for not just the number of customers but the quality of brands that are buying from us at the same time.

And we're adding supply chain and manufacturing with this release in ERP. So we have -- there's really nobody with a comprehensive suite of enterprise software products. And now -- and we're able to sell it internationally. So we think we have a huge advantage. I don't know who you consider the competitor in ERP. Again, every quarter, I mean, if Workday is the competitor, every quarter, we sell -- Q1's our smallest quarter and we sold more deals in Q1 than Workday's -- so ERP deals than Workday so since their company began. We do that every single quarter. So our relative strength, I think as Mark said, I think all our pillars are doing well. But on a relative basis, whoever is #2 in ERP, they're a long, long way behind. And by the way, ERP is the largest segment of application in the cloud. That will be just like -- people -- SAP was the leading on-premise application software vendor in the last generation of applications because they were #1 in ERP. The leading vendor -- applications vendor in the cloud this generation will also be whoever wins the ERP work."

When you start running off the names that I've run off in marketing cloud, we are highly differentiated and we're winning. We've done well in B2C, we've done well in B2B. If you add what's now service, I mean, we're starting to see again significant service growth in our service cloud and our Sales Cloud, while again small and very different than ERP, up against a competitor. Our service cloud is showing very strong growth. And so if you looked in each of our pillars, we've added on some really cool structure just to -- we're on a roll here. We've added on a very cool data as a service business. So our data as a service business, which come to us with our BlueKai acquisition and our Datalogix acquisition is now another component of our marketing cloud. And that had tremendous performance in Q1. So it's really a story across sort of all of our pillars. ERP is, of course, exciting because to Larry's point, it's the biggest pillar in terms of total available market and one that has a lot of pull. It pulls a lot of HCM. When we win an ERP, our connect rate of HCM to ERP is pretty high and growing. But the success is broad-based and that's sort of the enthusiasm you hear keep coming from us as we talk about what we see happening across our SaaS business."

And so we've put out of those expenditures and we've started to amortize them. However, in the second half of this year, our capital expenditure numbers are going to be significantly lower, even significantly lower than even this quarter. You'll see, I believe, at least another $100 million decline and then a continuing reduction. And the reason that matters is because what you'll simultaneously be seeing is a massive amount of revenue which can finally be recognized. That is going to start, in true earnest, in the second half of the year, in Q3 and Q4 while simultaneously we will not be adding capacity. In fact, we'll be spending less than we historically have spent on capital expenditures. We'll be back to numbers that you would have looked at and seen in fiscal year '14. So as expenses -- and in addition, you understand, it's not only capital expenditures. It's all sorts of staffing and labor and tools, et cetera, that have all been put in place.

And because we'll have economies of scale, they could not possibly have as individual customers. So really it's all one business. However, more and more, when we provide it as a cloud provider, we are providing the hardware, the software, the labor all in a package. And that gives us a significantly larger amount of their wallet share. Simultaneously, the customer is actually spending less overall because we can supply this package in a very economical way.

And the currency impact of countries that we have been doing very well is not helping. Even though my Latin America team is executing out of the park in constant currency, the devaluation of the different currencies in LAD, for example, are very negatively affecting my U.S. dollar results. Obviously, there is quite a lot going on in Europe in different parts. And both that and currency. I feel that Asia Pacific for us is actually stabilizing. China is not a big country for us historically, so that's less of an issue for us directly. But the countries and businesses that are impacted by the China trade like Australia, Canada, Brazil, those can be at risk. So I'm not an economist. I -- these things are impacted by, especially transactional business like new hardware sales or new license sales are impacted by these original issues. But in general, on-premise software, which is dominated by software updates and product support, customers renew because that is software that is very important to them and is doing the most important work in their companies, governments or nonprofits. And so that is obviously very, very steady for us and continues to do well. But the transactional business is at the same potential risk. However, the cloud momentum is so strong that overall, we expect very significant growth, and that is from contracts already in hand in those cases."

So when we entered the SaaS market, we had a series of promotions, meaning that you would get some time to install. Our strategy was to give you an incentive when you bought that you had time to implement and that promotion had a certain amount of time associated with it. Obviously, that was part of building up our reference base. Secondly, as we built up our reference base, we actually shortened the promotions. So that actually -- it actually went down by half the period of time. The 2 sets of promotions over the last couple of years, just by coincidence, coterminously end at the end of Q2. So the percent of the bookings that were on those types of promotions both end at the end of Q2 of this fiscal year. So that's why one of the reasons in SaaS, why you will see a jump in revenue that also will not be explained by bookings. So again, while you said I couldn't explain Q2 to bookings, you won't be able to explain exactly the alignment of the increase in revenue based on the bookings either because underneath that is promotions. So there are multiple dimensions here. There's this promotion dimension. There's the dimension that Safra described, which is about 1% of our PaaS is metered and 1% of our PaaS is subscription. So there's a couple of different ways you can consume the PaaS. In addition to it, it takes a certain amount of time for us, in some cases, I told you about a win, for example, last quarter at HSBC, a very large ERP in the cloud. It will take us several months to fully provision that ERP for HSBC. So it's those factors together that formulate the conversion of the booking to revenue. More time why we are so confident. We have the contracts, we know the expiration of the promotions. We know exactly when the PaaS expires, and in addition, you see all of that as it relates to deferred on the balance sheet."

Now the promotions over that period of time, call that a 2- or 3-year period time have declined and declined and declined. So   the amount of promotion that's available on our SaaS portfolio is materially smaller than it was 2 years ago and materially smaller than it was 1 year ago. And so what happens is we think the confluence of events really come together in Q3, which is where you see this pop in our revenue. And then from there, you'll begin to see a more ratable alignment of bookings to revenue, sort of save the one point about the PaaS consumption that Safra was making."

If you don't hear me, I may have to reconnect so -- but I do have, obviously, Ken Bond on the call and Corey West, our Chief Accounting Officer, is also, I think, in the room with Larry and Mark.
I'm going to focus today on our non-GAAP results for Q1. I'll then review guidance for Q2, and I will actually give some guidance for the entire fiscal year. And then I'll turn the call over to Mark and Larry for their comments.
As you know, we didn't provide you a stellar guidance for Q1, given the high volatility in exchange rates we were seeing at the time. As it happened, Q1 currency headwinds were actually 2% worse than we expected. The currency impact for both total revenue and hardware revenue ended up being 9%. And for software and cloud revenue, it was 8%.
Now we do get benefit on the expense side, but because many of our expenses are in the United States, we get a very small benefit and, of course, our expenses are significantly lower than our revenues, and so our operating income was actually impacted by 12 points.
Earnings per share was $0.06 lower because of currency, $0.01 worse than we anticipated. With currency still volatile, we will continue to use constant dollar growth rates on our quarterly calls so we can have some measure of consistency and also share with you how we look at the business.
We've also changed the presentation of our income statement to better reflect how we look at the company now that cloud has become a significant contributor to revenue. Our software business is really 2 parts of 1 business: the on-premise software business, which is steady and growing modestly; and the cloud business that is in a high-growth phase. We thought it made sense to show the components grouped together in our income statement to make it easier to see the progress we are making in the cloud.
The largest part is on-premise software revenue, which is made up of new software licenses plus software license updates and product support. On-premise software revenue was up 4% for the quarter to $5.8 billion. The largest component is software license updates and product support, which was up 8% for the quarter to $4.7 billion, with attach and renewal rates running at their usual high levels. We expect the on-premise software business to remain steady. Over the full year, I expect we will see modest growth comprised of continued growth in software support revenue that offsets any declines in new software license.
Moving on to cloud. We start with SaaS and PaaS and then add Infrastructure as a Service to report total cloud revenue, which were up 34%. Within the cloud business, we continue to see excellent momentum in SaaS and PaaS, with bookings growth of 165% this quarter on top of the 54% growth from Q1 of last year.
SaaS and PaaS revenue was $452 million, up 38% from last year. The triple-digit bookings growth that we have been experiencing will translate into significant acceleration in SaaS and PaaS revenue in the second half of the year. You can also see the coming revenue acceleration of our cloud business in the SaaS and PaaS billings and deferred revenue. SaaS and PaaS billings grew 70% in U.S. dollars this quarter on top of the 100% growth last quarter. Also, the gross deferred revenue balance is now nearly $1 billion and was up more than 100%. We've put the billings numbers up on the website for you to see in detail.
Our significant success in cloud bookings will not only help accelerate our revenue growth, but it will also benefit our margins and earnings over time. Cloud revenue, as you know, is recognized ratably while new license is recognized all upfront. This timing difference has the effect of lowering near-term operating margins and earnings per share but, over time, will increase both.
As our SaaS and PaaS bookings have continued to accelerate, capital expenditures for the quarter were higher compared to last year. The bulk of them are largely complete, and you can see this in the $150 million sequential decline in CapEx this quarter. I expect CapEx for this year will be materially lower than last year as we utilize the investments that we have already made.
We are well aware of the near-term impact to gross margins that this build-out cost has had on the cloud business, and I think that Q4 of last year marks the bottom for SaaS and PaaS gross margins. Q1 cloud gross margins were up slightly on a sequential basis, and I think we'll see another modest improvement in Q2. But as our cloud business scales up, we expect SaaS and PaaS gross margins will be around 60% by Q4 and then 80% over the next 2 years.
The balance of our cloud revenue comes from cloud Infrastructure as a Service, which was up 23% to $160 million. The gross margin in this business was up sequentially to a record 45%. While SaaS and PaaS revenue will see much higher growth rate, along with significantly higher gross margins, we expect Infrastructure as a Service revenues will grow at a single-digit rate and maintain a steady margin profile over time.
As I mentioned, there are 2 parts to our software business that can be looked at separately but should really be considered together: the on-premise software business, which will grow modestly and serves as a tremendous base of loyal customers using our leading product; the SaaS and PaaS revenues will grow rapidly and will quickly become a significant contributor to revenues and profit as we help those same customers transform their businesses over time. In total, we will see growth in the total software business begin to increase this year as cloud revenue grows as a percentage of the total software business.
Finally, total hardware revenues grew 6%, which included hardware products revenue of $570 million and hardware support revenue of $559 million. Total revenue for the quarter was up 7% from last year to $8.5 billion.
Non-GAAP operating income was $3.5 billion and the operating margin was 41%. Sales and cloud investments, along with the integration of MICROS, each impacted operating margins negatively by about 1%. A non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter -- the non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 25%, which was 3.5 points higher than last year. The GAAP tax rate was 24.4%, which was 5 points higher than last year. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.53 in U.S. dollars, and GAAP EPS was $0.40 in U.S. dollars. As I said earlier, both were $0.06 lower due to currency. Free cash flow over the last 4 quarters was $11.8 billion.
We now have nearly $56 billion in cash and marketable securities. Net of debt, our cash position is approximately $14 billion. The short-term deferred revenue balance is $9.1 billion, up 10% in constant currency. This quarter, we repurchased more than 75 million shares for a total of $3 billion, up from our fiscal year '15 run rate of $2 billion a quarter. And given current market conditions, we expect to buy even more in Q2.
The Board of Directors also declared a quarterly dividend of $0.15. Over the last 12 months, we've repurchased more than 220 million shares for a total of $9.1 billion and paid out dividends of $2.4 billion for a total that is nearly 100% of free cash flow.
Now to the guidance. As I mentioned, I'm going to give you guidance for Q2 and then for the whole year. We feel very good about the progress of our cloud transition, and clearly, customers are migrating to the Oracle cloud. Over time, we expect the cloud will result in more revenue and profit for Oracle as we take share from legacy on-premise competitors, other cloud competitors who are limited to point solutions and the labor suppliers who can't possibly offer what we have already built.
Of course, I am seeing many of the same financial news reports that all of you are about the whole world, and so I think it is still best to be prudent here. Additionally, we expect to see continued volatility in exchange rate and significant currency headwinds.
I'm going to give you constant currency guidance, but if exchange rates remain the same as they are right now, we expect to see a currency headwind of about 6% on revenue and $0.05 on earnings per share. But again, it could be significantly worse. Maybe if we're lucky, it could be a little bit better. All of my guidance today is on a non-GAAP basis and in constant currency. So here it goes.
SaaS and PaaS revenue is expected to grow 36% to 40%. Cloud IaaS revenue is expected to grow 5% to 9%. Total cloud and on-premise software is expected to grow from 0 to 2%. Total revenue is expected to range from a negative 2 to a positive 1.
Non-GAAP EPS in constant currency is expected to be somewhere between $0.63 and $0.66. Now this assumes a non-GAAP tax rate of 25.5%. Of course, if this quarter is any example, it may end up being different. Looking further out, we expect to see a material acceleration in SaaS and PaaS revenue. As a result, I'm providing full fiscal year guidance for some key items. As before, my guidance on the full year is in constant currency.
SaaS and PaaS revenue is expected to grow around 50%. On-premise software is expected to grow approximately 1%. Total cloud and on-premise software is expected to grow between 3% and 4%. Finally, SaaS and PaaS gross margins are expected to materially improve in the second half and exit the year at around 60%.
With that, I'll turn it over to Larry and Mark for their comments."

By the process of elimination, this is Mark actually speaking. So I thought I'd do 2 things right to Larry's point, tell you about some wins but also give you some facts about the quarter.
Revenue grew 38% year-on-year, 8% quarter-on-quarter. Billings grew 70%, again growing much faster than Salesforce and Workday. Bookings were USD 191 million, 165% growth. And like I always do, I want to tell you the number of customers we added. We added 612 new SaaS customers in the quarter, brand new logos. 616 expanded their SaaS business with us in the quarter.
In HCM, it was 166 new customers, more than double what Workday had. In CX, 280 customers. In ERP EPM, it was 200 customers, double last year. That is also more than Workday's lifetime sales. We now have 1,350 customers in our installed base. More than 300 are already live, including 100 that went live in just Q1.
What's taken Workday 8 quarters to do, we did in 1 quarter. We never see SAP. PaaS, we added 800 new PaaS customers in the quarter. 2,500 in just 2 quarters. Bookings over $65 million. Now I think we have a shot in Q2 to book more PaaS than we actually did in Q4. I think we have a shot. That's how fast we see our pipeline growing in PaaS.
I'm going to wrap up and then I'm going to read you some wins, but I just want to connect a few dots between what Safra and Larry described on the Oracle SaaS, PaaS cloud. We're currently at a $1.8 billion run rate in revenue. If you include IaaS, it's $2.4 billion. We will book between $1.5 billion and $2 billion in SaaS, PaaS ARR in the fiscal year.
Gross deferred revenue has grown from $475 million to nearly $1 billion in the year. Billings are growing 70%. Gross margins are headed to 80%. SaaS, PaaS will be a very large and very profitable business for Oracle.
Now in addition, I just want to give you some brands that we got in the quarter just so you have a feeling for who these -- all these people are that are buying solutions from us. So first, let me get HCM. A few wins. CMiC. They're an Australia Fusion HCM. We replaced Workday at CMiC in the quarter. Cypress Semiconductor, GDF SUEZ, Limited Brands, Nationwide Insurance, Restoration Hardware, Rutgers University. 
We expanded our HCM Cloud at OMNICare, the Navy, Westpac Bank. In ERP EPM, AthenaHealth, Chicago Sun-Times. These are all new customers by the way. Fox Home Entertainment, U.S. Department of Energy, LendingClub Corp, Lenovo, LG Electronics, Rutgers University. By the way, you'll hear a few names twice, which is because they bought multiple pillars at the same time.
In sales service cloud, Fox Home Entertainment, Royal Mail, Sallie Mae, SIRIUS XM, Toshiba Medical, Wesfarmers, expansions at Cigna, Motorola, Nikon, Polycom, Virgin Atlantic, Westpac.
In our marketing cloud, Aer Lingus, General Mills, Jeanswest, Telstra, Verizon, expansions at Booz Allen Hamilton, Forever 21, National Instruments, NetApp, Pier 1 Imports, Public Broadcasting System (sic) [Public Broadcasting Service], TaylorMade Golf Company, Time Inc.

It's now in the cloud in terms of just sheer number of companies, and our pipeline is just full. So ERP, we're highly differentiated. We're way ahead of whoever it is you think is #2. And it's extreme. I think it's a combination, Phil, of what we've talked about before. It's -- our products have done nothing but get better and better and better. We're on now Release 10. Release 11 is now coming out. So our products have gotten better. Our people -- we've got more people that are better trained, and we just have now a lot of go-lives and a lot of references, and that's true across each one of our pillars, Phil."

One is the products that we have are being translated into more and more languages and updated for statutory compliance in more and more countries, so there are more markets we can sell them into.

And now -- and we're able to sell it internationally. So we think we have a huge advantage. I don't know who you consider the competitor in ERP. Again, every quarter -- I mean, if Workday is the competitor, every quarter, we sell -- Q1's our smallest quarter and we sold more deals in Q1 than Workday's sold ERP deals -- than Workday has sold since their company began. We do that every single quarter. So our relative strength -- I think as Mark said, I think all of our pillars are doing well. But on a relative basis, whoever is #2 in ERP, they're a long, long way behind. And by the way, ERP is the largest segment of application in the cloud. That will be just like people -- SAP was the leading on-premise application software vendor in the last generation of applications because they were #1 in ERP.

You add what's now occurred in service, I mean, we're starting to see again significant service growth in our service cloud. And our sales cloud, while, again, small and very different than ERP, up against the big competitor. Our service cloud is showing very strong growth. And so if you look in each of our pillars, we've added on some really cool stuff here just -- well, I'm on a roll here, we've added on a very cool Data as a Service business. So our Data as a Service business, which come to us with our BlueKai acquisition and our Datalogix acquisition, is now another component of our marketing cloud. And that had tremendous performance in Q1. So Phil, it's really a story across sort of all of our pillars. ERP is, of course, exciting because to Larry's point, it's the biggest pillar in terms of total available market and one that has a lot of pull. It pulls a lot of HCM. When we win an ERP, our connect rate of HCM to ERP is pretty high and growing. But the success is broad-based, and that's sort of the enthusiasm you hear keep coming from us as we talk about what we see happening across our SaaS business."

That doesn't mean they don't layer things.

So you really have to look at those 2 businesses added together. And I think that's what Safra's saying in her presentation. You can't look at database on-premise separately from PaaS, or Database as a Service. It's really the sum of those that have to grow. The sum of those have to grow at the top line level and that sum of those have to grow in terms of profitability. And we see the sum -- and we see that happening right now.

I think we are in -- and by the way, to Larry's point, I thought Larry made a great point. We are releasing a lot of new products. It may not -- you may not come across that way, but with the next release, we now release products that are localized for many, many more countries. Markets that frankly we just weren't in given 6 months ago, in addition to the fact that in ERP, we're releasing supply chain manufacturing now so we can now go after manufacturers as well. I've made a comment about what we've added now in marketing in terms of our data cloud, that we now supplemented our marketing cloud with. We have new releases coming in service cloud. So there's just a whole suite of products. I would tell you top of the first, this is a multiyear long, long game. We just happen to be extremely well positioned as the only one who has a suite of products and the only one that has best-of-breed products that are in a suite, that can then combine it, to your point, with a PaaS capability that allows you to extend those applications without destroying the upgradeability of the application suite that you bought. So it's a great match -- our pipeline. A year ago at SAM, I made a statement about the size of our pipeline. And probably nobody remembers it because it seems like a long time ago. Think about since then, our pipeline in SaaS, this is our annualized pipeline, has more than doubled, more than doubled off of a really big number. So now you've got a pipeline scale.

And as I mentioned on the call, our capital expenditure numbers have been very, very large as compared to what we are used to historically. And so we've put out those expenditures and we've started to amortize them. However, in the second half of this year, our capital expenditure numbers are going to be significantly lower, even significantly lower than even this quarter. You'll see, I believe, at least another $100 million decline and then a continuing reduction. And the reason that matters is because what you'll simultaneously be seeing is a massive amount of revenue which can finally be recognized. That is going to start, in true earnest, in the second half of the year, in Q3 and Q4, while simultaneously, we will not be adding capacity. In fact, we'll be spending less than we historically have spent on capital expenditures. We'll be back to numbers that you would have looked at and seen in fiscal year '14. So as expenses -- and in addition, you understand, it's not only capital expenditures. It's all sorts of staffing and labor and tools, et cetera, that have all been put in place. And we will not have to add them while the revenue is going to start flowing both out of the balance sheet, which is extremely apparent, and you will be able to look at it in detail in the Q filing that we should do either at the end of this week or at the beginning of next, and in our new sales.

We look at that as the on-premise business. And that business is steady, growing slightly, very profitable, of course, because we are at scale. We still make a lot of investments in that area. However, you should be thinking about the cloud business as another way for us to offer that same software to our customers in a different way, where we are actually hosting the software and doing a lot more of the labor. And because we'll have economies of scale, they could not possibly have as individual customers. So really it's all one business. However, more and more, when we provide it as a cloud provider, we are providing the hardware, the software, the labor, all in a package. And that gives us a significantly larger amount of their wallet share. Simultaneously, the customer is actually spending less overall because we can supply this package in a very economical way. But also since all of it is our own differentiated intellectual property, we can do it at much higher margins. And the more scale we get, the more profitable we will be. We have been in a startup mode in this whole area. We've done it basically within our profit envelope.

And the currency impact of countries that we have been doing very well is not helping. Even though my Latin America team is executing out of the park in constant currency, the devaluation of the different currencies in LAD, for example, are very negatively affecting my U.S. dollar results. Obviously, there is quite a lot going on in Europe in different parts. And both that and currency. I feel that Asia Pacific for us is actually stabilizing. China is not a big country for us historically, so that's less of an issue for us directly. But the countries and businesses that are impacted by the China trade, like Australia, Canada, Brazil, those can be at risk. So I'm not an economist. I -- these things are impacted by, especially transactional business like new hardware sales or new license sales are impacted by these regional issues. But in general, on-premise software, which is dominated by software updates and product support, customers renew because that is software that is very important to them and is doing the most important work in their companies, governments or nonprofits. And so that is obviously very, very steady for us and continues to do well. But the transactional business is at the same potential risk. However, the cloud momentum is so strong that overall, we expect very significant growth, and that is from contracts already in hand in most cases."

So when we entered the SaaS market, we had a series of promotions, meaning that you would get some time to install. We had -- our strategy was to give you an incentive when you bought, that you had time to then implement and that promotion had a certain amount of time associated with it. Obviously, that was part of building up our reference base. Secondly, as we built up our reference base, we actually shortened the promotions. So that actually -- it actually went down by half the period of time. The 2 sets of promotions over the last couple of years, just by coincidence, coterminously end at the end of Q2. So the percent of the bookings that were on those types of promotions both end at the end of Q2 of this fiscal year. So that's why one of the reasons in SaaS, why you will see a jump in revenue that also will not be explained by bookings. So again, while you said I couldn't explain Q2 to bookings, you won't be able to explain exactly the alignment of the increase in revenue based on the bookings either because underneath it is these promotions. So there are multiple dimensions here. There's this promotion dimension. There's the dimension that Safra described, which is about a percent of our PaaS is metered and a percent of our PaaS is subscription. So there's a couple of different ways you can consume the PaaS. In addition to it, it takes a certain amount of time for us, in some cases -- I told you about a win, for example, last quarter at HSBC, a very large ERP in the cloud win. It will take us several months to fully provision that ERP for HSBC. So it's those factors together that formulate the conversion of the booking to revenue."

Now the promotions over that period of time, call that a 2- or 3-year period of time, have declined and declined and declined. So the amount of promotion that's available on our SaaS portfolio is materially smaller than it was 2 years ago and materially smaller than it was a year ago. And so what happens is these things -- the confluence of events really come together in Q3, which is where you see this pop in our revenue. And then from there, you'll begin to see a more ratable alignment of bookings to revenue, sort of save the one point about the PaaS consumption that Safra was making."

I'm going to focus today on our non-GAAP results for Q1. I'll then review guidance for Q2, and I will actually give some guidance for the entire fiscal year. And then I'll turn the call over to Mark and Larry for their comments.
As you know, we didn't provide you a stellar guidance for Q1, given the high volatility in exchange rates we were seeing at the time. As it happened, Q1 currency headwinds were actually 2% worse than we expected. The currency impact for both total revenue and hardware revenue ended up being 9%. And for software and cloud revenue, it was 8%.
Now we do get benefit on the expense side, but because many of our expenses are in the United States, we get a very small benefit and, of course, our expenses are significantly lower than our revenues, and so our operating income was actually impacted by 12 points.
Earnings per share was $0.06 lower because of currency, $0.01 worse than we anticipated. With currency still volatile, we will continue to use constant dollar growth rates on our quarterly calls so we can have some measure of consistency and also share with you how we look at the business.
We've also changed the presentation of our income statement to better reflect how we look at the company now that cloud has become a significant contributor to revenue. Our software business is really 2 parts of 1 business: the on-premise software business, which is steady and growing modestly; and the cloud business that is in a high-growth phase. We felt it made sense to show the components grouped together in our income statement to make it easier to see the progress we are making in the cloud.
The largest part is on-premise software revenue, which is made up of new software licenses plus software license updates and product support. On-premise software revenue was up 4% for the quarter to $5.8 billion. The largest component is software license updates and product support, which was up 8% for the quarter to $4.7 billion, with attach and renewal rates running at their usual high levels. We expect the on-premise software business to remain steady. Over the full year, I expect we will see modest growth comprised of continued growth in software support revenue that offsets any declines in new software license.
Moving on to cloud. We start with SaaS and PaaS and then add Infrastructure as a Service to report total cloud revenues, which were up 34%. Within the cloud business, we continue to see excellent momentum in SaaS and PaaS, with bookings growth of 165% this quarter on top of the 54% growth from Q1 of last year.
SaaS and PaaS revenue was $452 million, up 38% from last year. The triple-digit bookings growth that we have been experiencing will translate into significant acceleration in SaaS and PaaS revenue in the second half of the year. You can also see the coming revenue acceleration of our cloud business in the SaaS and PaaS billings and deferred revenue. SaaS and PaaS billings grew 70% in U.S. dollars this quarter on top of the 100% growth last quarter. Also, the gross deferred revenue balance is now nearly $1 billion and was up more than 100%. We've put the billings numbers up on the website for you to see in detail.
Our significant success in cloud bookings will not only help accelerate our revenue growth, but it will also benefit our margins and earnings over time. Cloud revenue, as you know, is recognized ratably while new license is recognized all upfront. This timing difference has the effect of lowering near-term operating margins and earnings per share but, over time, will increase both.
As our SaaS and PaaS bookings have continued to accelerate, capital expenditures for the quarter were higher compared to last year. The bulk of them are largely complete, and you can see this in the $150 million sequential decline in CapEx this quarter. I expect CapEx for this year will be materially lower than last year as we utilize the investments that we have already made.
We are well aware of the near-term impact to gross margins that this build-out cost has had on the cloud business, and I think that Q4 of last year marks the bottom for SaaS and PaaS gross margins. Q1 cloud gross margins were up slightly on a sequential basis, and I think we'll see another modest improvement in Q2. But as our cloud business scales up, we expect SaaS and PaaS gross margins will be around 60% by Q4 and then 80% over the next 2 years.
The balance of our cloud revenue comes from cloud Infrastructure as a Service, which was up 23% to $160 million. The gross margin in this business was up sequentially to a record 45%. While SaaS and PaaS revenue will see much higher growth rates, along with significantly higher gross margins, we expect Infrastructure as a Service revenues will grow at a single-digit rate and maintain a steady margin profile over time.
As I mentioned, there are 2 parts to our software business that can be looked at separately but should really be considered together: the on-premise software business, which will grow modestly and serves as a tremendous base of loyal customers using our leading product; the SaaS and PaaS revenues will grow rapidly and will quickly become a significant contributor to revenues and profit as we help those same customers transform their businesses over time. In total, we will see growth in the total software business begin to increase this year as cloud revenue grows as a percentage of the total software business.
Finally, total hardware revenues grew 6%, which included hardware products revenue of $570 million and hardware support revenue of $559 million. Total revenue for the quarter was up 7% from last year to $8.5 billion.
Non-GAAP operating income was $3.5 billion and the operating margin was 41%. Sales and cloud investments, along with the integration of MICROS, each impacted operating margins negatively by about 1%. A non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter -- the non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 25%, which was 3.5 points higher than last year. The GAAP tax rate was 24.4%, which was 5 points higher than last year. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.53 in U.S. dollars, and GAAP EPS was $0.40 in U.S. dollars. As I said earlier, both were $0.06 lower due to currency. Free cash flow over the last 4 quarters was $11.8 billion.
We now have nearly $56 billion in cash and marketable securities. Net of debt, our cash position is approximately $14 billion. The short-term deferred revenue balance is $9.1 billion, up 10% in constant currency. This quarter, we repurchased more than 75 million shares for a total of $3 billion, up from our fiscal year '15 run rate of $2 billion a quarter. And given current market conditions, we expect to buy even more in Q2.
The Board of Directors also declared a quarterly dividend of $0.15. Over the last 12 months, we've repurchased more than 220 million shares for a total of $9.1 billion and paid out dividends of $2.4 billion for a total that is nearly 100% of free cash flow.
Now to the guidance. As I mentioned, I'm going to give you guidance for Q2 and then for the whole year. We feel very good about the progress of our cloud transition, and clearly, customers are migrating to the Oracle cloud. Over time, we expect the cloud will result in more revenue and profit for Oracle as we take share from legacy, on-premise competitors, other cloud competitors who are limited to point solutions and the labor suppliers who can't possibly offer what we have already built.
Of course, I am seeing many of the same financial news reports that all of you are about the whole world, and so I think it is still best to be prudent here. Additionally, we expect to see continued volatility in exchange rates and significant currency headwinds.
I'm going to give you constant currency guidance, but if exchange rates remain the same as they are right now, we expect to see a currency headwind of about 6% on revenue and $0.05 on earnings per share. But again, it could be significantly worse. Maybe if we're lucky, it could be a little bit better. All of my guidance today is on a non-GAAP basis and in constant currency. So here goes.
SaaS and PaaS revenue is expected to grow 36% to 40%. Cloud IaaS revenue is expected to grow 5% to 9%. Total cloud and on-premise software is expected to grow from 0 to 2%. Total revenue is expected to range from a negative 2 to a positive 1.
Non-GAAP EPS in constant currency is expected to be somewhere between $0.63 and $0.66. Now this assumes a non-GAAP tax rate of 25.5%. Of course, if this quarter is any example, it may end up being different. Looking further out, we expect to see a material acceleration in SaaS and PaaS revenue. As a result, I'm providing full fiscal year guidance for some key items. As before, my guidance on the full year is in constant currency.
SaaS and PaaS revenue is expected to grow around 50%. On-premise software is expected to grow approximately 1%. Total cloud and on-premise software is expected to grow between 3% and 4%. Finally, SaaS and PaaS gross margins are expected to materially improve in the second half and exit the year at around 60%.
With that, I'll turn it over to Larry and Mark for their comments."

That's a 90x, not 90%, a 90x increase in our data center capacity in 3 years. We've installed over 40,000 physical devices, 100,000 virtual machines and over 8 petabytes of storage.
We now have in place the physical infrastructure to dramatically expand our cloud customer base. We are entering the rapid growth, scale-out phase of our cloud business. We're adding thousands of new SaaS, PaaS, IaaS and data customers to our existing data centers. With all that customer growth on top of our existing infrastructure, we expect that our cloud margins will double from 40% to 80% over the next 2 years. Mark, it's your turn to tell everybody about all those great customer adds we had during Q1."

By the process of elimination, this is Mark actually speaking. So I thought I'd do 2 things right to Larry's point, tell you about some wins but also give you some facts about the quarter.
Revenue grew 38% year-on-year, 8% quarter-on-quarter. Billings grew 70%, again growing much faster than Salesforce and Workday. Bookings were USD 191 million, 165% growth. And like I always do, I want to tell you the number of customers we added. We added 612 new SaaS customers in the quarter, brand new logos. 616 expanded their SaaS business with us in the quarter.
In HCM, it was 166 new customers, more than double what Workday had. In CX, 280 customers. In ERP EPM, it was 200 customers, double last year. That is also more than Workday's lifetime sales. We now have 1,350 customers in our installed base. More than 300 are already live, including 100 that went live in just Q1.
What's taken Workday 8 quarters to do, we did in 1 quarter. We never see SAP. PaaS, we added 800 new PaaS customers in the quarter. 2,500 in just 2 quarters. Bookings over $65 million. Now I think we have a shot in Q2 to book more PaaS than we actually did in Q4. I think we have a shot. That's how fast we see our pipeline growing in PaaS.
I'm going to wrap up and then I'm going to read you some wins, but I just want to connect a few dots between what Safra and Larry described on the Oracle SaaS, PaaS cloud. We're currently at a $1.8 billion run rate in revenue. If you include IaaS, it's $2.4 billion, we will book between $1.5 billion and $2 billion in SaaS, PaaS ARRs in the fiscal year.
Gross deferred revenue has grown from $475 million to nearly $1 billion in the year. Billings are growing 70%. Gross margins are headed to 80%. SaaS, PaaS will be a very large and very profitable business for Oracle.
Now in addition, I just want to give you some brands that we got in the quarter just so you have a feeling for who these -- all these people are that are buying solutions from us. So first, let me get HCM. A few wins. CMiC. They're an Australia Fusion HCM. We replaced Workday at CMiC in the quarter. Cypress Semiconductor, GDF SUEZ, Limited Brands, Nationwide Insurance, Restoration Hardware, Rutgers University. 
We expanded our HCM Cloud at OMNICare, the Navy, Westpac Bank. In ERP EPM, AthenaHealth, Chicago Sun-Times. These are all new customers by the way. Fox Home Entertainment, U.S. Department of Energy, LendingClub Corp, Lenovo, LG Electronics, Rutgers University. By the way, you'll hear a few names twice, which is because they bought multiple pillars at the same time.
In sales service cloud, Fox Home Entertainment, Royal Mail, Sallie Mae, SIRIUS XM, Toshiba Medical, Wesfarmers, expansions at Cigna, Motorola, Nikon, Polycom, Virgin Atlantic, Westpac.
In our marketing cloud, Aer Lingus, General Mills, Jeanswest, Telstra, Verizon, expansions at Booz Allen Hamilton, Forever 21, National Instruments, NetApp, Pier 1 Imports, Public Broadcasting System (sic) [Public Broadcasting Service], TaylorMade Golf Company, Time Inc. I'm going to stop, but I wanted to give you a flavor for not just the number of customers but the quality of brands that are buying from us at the same time.
Ken, with that, let's take whatever questions anybody's got."

So ERP, we're highly differentiated. We're way ahead of whoever it is you think is #2. And it's extreme. I think it's a combination, Phil, of what we've talked about before. It's -- our products have done nothing but get better and better and better. We're on now Release 10. Release 11 is now coming out. So our products have gotten better.

And now -- and we're able to sell it internationally. So we think we have a huge advantage. I don't know who you consider a competitor in ERP. Again, every quarter -- I mean, if Workday is the competitor, every quarter, we sell -- Q1's our smallest quarter and we sold more deals in Q1 than Workday's sold ERP deals -- than Workday has sold since their company began. We do that every single quarter. So our relative strength -- I think as Mark said, I think all of our pillars are doing well. But on a relative basis, whoever is #2 in the ERP, they're a long, long way behind. And by the way, ERP is the largest segment of applications in the cloud. That will be just like people -- SAP was the leading on-premise application software vendor in the last generation of applications because they were #1 in ERP.

You add what's now occurred in service, I mean, we're starting to see again significant service growth in our service cloud. And our sales cloud, while, again, small and very different than ERP, up against the big competitor our service cloud is showing very strong growth. And so if you look in each of our pillars, we've added on some really cool stuff here just -- while I'm on a roll here, we've added on a very cool Data as a Service business. So our Data as a Service business, which come to us with our BlueKai acquisition and our Datalogix acquisition, is now another component of our marketing cloud. And that had tremendous performance in Q1. So Phil, it's really a story across sort of all of our pillars. ERP is, of course, exciting because to Larry's point, it's the biggest pillar in terms of total available market and one that has a lot of pull. It pulls a lot of HCM. When we win an ERP, our connect rate of HCM to ERP is pretty high and growing. But the success is broad-based, and that's sort of the enthusiasm you hear keep coming from us as we talk about what we see happening across our SaaS business."

That doesn't mean they don't layer things.

So you really have to look at those 2 businesses added together. And I think that's what Safra's saying in her presentation. You can't look at database on-premise separately from PaaS, or Database as a Service. It's really the sum of those that have to grow. The sum of those have to grow at the top line level and that sum of those have to grow in terms of profitability. And we see the sum -- and we see that happening right now.

It may not -- it may not come across that way, but with the next release, we now release products that are localized for many, many more countries. Markets that frankly we just weren't in given 6 months ago, in addition to the fact that in ERP, we're releasing supply chain manufacturing now so we can now go after manufacturers as well. I've made a comment about what we've added now in marketing in terms of our data cloud, that we now supplemented our marketing cloud with. We have new releases coming in service cloud. So there's just a whole suite of products. I would tell you top of the first, this is a multiyear long, long game.

So it's a great match -- our pipeline. A year ago at SAM, I made a statement about the size of our pipeline. And probably nobody remembers it because it seems like a long time ago. Think about since then, our pipeline in SaaS, this is our annualized pipeline, has more than doubled, more than doubled off of a really big number. So now you've got a pipeline scale.

And so we've put out those expenditures and we've started to amortize them. However, in the second half of this year, our capital expenditure numbers are going to be significantly lower, even significantly lower than even this quarter. You'll see, I believe, at least another $100 million decline and then a continuing reduction. And the reason that matters is because what you'll simultaneously be seeing is a massive amount of revenue which can finally be recognized. That is going to start, in true earnest, in the second half of the year, in Q3 and Q4, while simultaneously, we will not be adding capacity. In fact, we'll be spending less than we historically have spent on capital expenditures. We'll be back to numbers that you would have looked at and seen in fiscal year '14. So as expenses -- and in addition, you understand, it's not only capital expenditures. It's all sorts of staffing and labor and tools, et cetera, that have all been put in place.

Safra, how do you view the investment trade-off between the license business and the cloud business because I think it's pretty apparent to us that one business has higher growth but lower margin? And when I parse your comments, it looks like CapEx is going to come down for the cloud business. So are we at a point where the license business has troughed and is not going to decline anymore and that the profit growth of the cloud business will start to add on? And that this year, it sounds like it's the trough in your operating profits. A lot of the other software companies have been attempting to make this model transition, been resetting their numbers for the license piece by their own volition is coming down troughing and then the cloud business starts to pick up. So where is -- how should we look at Oracle in the context of the shift that's happening here?"

Well, first of all, the way we look at the on-premise business, and I'm not sure I'm entirely understanding your question, but there's the new licenses, and of course, our massive installed base of license subscriptions. We look at that as the on-premise business. And that business is steady, growing slightly, very profitable, of course, because we are at scale. We still make a lot of investments in that area. However, you should be thinking about the cloud business as another way for us to offer that same software to our customers in a different way, where we are actually hosting the software and doing a lot more of the labor. And because we'll have economies of scale, they could not possibly have as individual customers so really it's all one business. However, more and more, when we provide it as a cloud provider, we are providing the hardware, the software, the labor, all in a package. And that gives us a significantly larger amount of their wallet share. Simultaneously, the customer is actually spending less overall because we can supply this package in a very economical way. But also since all of it is our own differentiated intellectual property, we can do it at much higher margins. And the more scale we get, the more profitable we will be. We have been in a startup mode in this whole area. We've done it basically within our profit envelope. However, this extremely quick transition, which you are truly seeing the pivot in this fiscal year, which is the reason we're breaking it out for you and really breaking our own rules of guidance where we're actually giving you a full year guidance so you can see how we're coming out of it."

And the currency impact of countries that we have been doing very well is not helping. Even though my Latin America team is executing out of the park in constant currency, the devaluation of the different currencies in LAD, for example, are very negatively affecting my U.S. dollar results. Obviously, there is quite a lot going on in Europe in different parts. And both that and currency. I feel that Asia Pacific for us is actually stabilizing. China is not a big country for us historically, so that's less of an issue for us directly. But the countries and businesses that are impacted by the China trade, like Australia, Canada, Brazil, those can be at risk. So I'm not an economist. I -- these things are impacted by, especially transactional business like new hardware sales or new license sales are impacted by these regional issues. But in general, on-premise software, which is dominated by software updates and product support, customers renew because that is software that is very important to them and is doing the most important work in their companies, governments or nonprofits. And so that is obviously very, very steady for us and continues to do well. But the transactional business is at the same potential risk. However, the cloud momentum is so strong that overall, we expect very significant growth, and that is from contracts already in hand in most cases."

So when we entered the SaaS market, we had a series of promotions, meaning that you would get some time to install. We had -- our strategy was to give you an incentive when you bought, that you had time to then implement and that promotion had a certain amount of time associated with it. Obviously, that was part of building up our reference base. Secondly, as we built up our reference base, we actually shortened the promotions. So that actually -- it actually went down by half the period of time. The 2 sets of promotions over the last couple of years, just by coincidence, coterminously end at the end of Q2. So the percent of the bookings that were on those types of promotions both end at the end of Q2 of this fiscal year. So that's why one of the reasons in SaaS, why you will see a jump in revenue that also will not be explained by bookings. So again, while you said I couldn't explain Q2 to bookings, you won't be able to explain exactly the alignment of the increase in revenue based on the bookings either because underneath it is this promotion. So there are multiple dimensions here. There's this promotion dimension. There's the dimension that Safra described, which is about a percent of our PaaS is metered and a percent of our PaaS is subscription. So there's a couple of different ways you can consume the PaaS. In addition to it, it takes a certain amount of time for us, in some cases -- I told you about a win, for example, last quarter at HSBC, a very large ERP in the cloud win. It will take us several months to fully provision that ERP for HSBC. So it's those factors together that formulate the conversion of the bookings to revenue."

Now the promotions over that period of time, call that a 2- or 3-year period of time, have declined and declined and declined. So the amount of promotion that's available on our SaaS portfolio is materially smaller than it was 2 years ago and materially smaller than it was a year ago. And so what happens is these things -- the confluence of events really come together in Q3, which is where you see this pop in our revenue. And then from there, you'll begin to see a more ratable alignment of bookings to revenue, sort of save the one point about the PaaS consumption that Safra was making."

I'll then review guidance for Q3 and Q4 and turn the call over to Larry and Mark for their comments. 
As you can imagine, we are very pleased with the quarter. Total revenue exceeded my guidance, driven by the combined strength of our cloud business as well as better-than-expected results from the on-premise software business. Earnings per share were also above my guidance, coming in $0.04 better than the midpoint of the constant currency range I provided last quarter. 
Q2 currency headwinds were mostly as expected around 6% in most categories including total revenues. However, the currency effect to earnings per share was $0.06, $0.01 more than my guidance. 
We will continue to use constant dollar growth rates on our quarterly call so we can have some measure of consistency across the quarter as well as to reflect how we measure the business. 
Considering the progress we've made in our transition to the cloud and the subscription business, from now on, I'm going to start with our SaaS and PaaS business. 
We continue to see excellent momentum there with bookings growth of 75% for this quarter on top of the 147% we reported last year. SaaS and PaaS revenue was $487 million, up 38% from last year, 39% in GAAP. Sequentially, SaaS and PaaS revenue grew 8% and we expect the sequential growth next quarter will be even higher. 
The bookings growth that we have been experiencing will now translate into a significant acceleration in SaaS and PaaS revenue growth in Q3 where we can hit 50% revenue growth and in Q4, where it should be even higher. 
You can also see the coming revenue acceleration of our cloud business in the SaaS and PaaS billing and deferred revenue. SaaS and PaaS Billings grew 68% in US dollars this quarter, on top of the 70% growth last quarter. Also, the growth deferred revenue balance is now nearly $1.1 billion and was up 135% in US dollars. We put the billings numbers up on our website for you to see the details. 
The balance of our cloud revenues come from cloud Infrastructure as a Service, which was up 11% to $165 million. While SaaS and PaaS revenue will see much higher growth rates, we expect Infrastructure as a Service revenue growth, which is currently dominated by our hosting business will be moderate for now. 
Total cloud revenues, which is SaaS, PaaS and IaaS were us $652 million, up 30%. 
As our cloud revenue continues -- as our cloud revenue business continues to scale from the growth we are experiencing, it is beginning to benefit on margins as I previously predicted. The Q2 growth margin for SaaS and PaaS was 43%, up from 40% last quarter and will see further improvement in Q3. I also expect the Q4 exit rate growth margin for SaaS and PaaS will be around 55% to 60% and from there, we'll be targeting 80% in fiscal year '18. The growth margin in the IaaS business was up slightly to 45%. 
Capital expenditures for the quarter were $195 million or $251 million lower than Q1. And I expect the cloud-based, cloud related CapEx for the full year will be lower than last year as we utilize the investments we have made. 
On-premise software revenue including new software license and software license updates and product support was unchanged at $6.4 billion. Software license updates and product support revenue was $4.7 billion, up 5% from last year and up 1% sequentially. 
Attached and renewal rates are running at their usual high level. New software license revenue was $1.7 billion, down from last year but a bit better than I expected for the quarter. 
Over the full year, I expect we will see modest growth in our on-premise software revenue, comprised of continued growth and software support that more than offset declines in new software license. 
Finally, total hardware revenue was down 10%, which included hardware products revenue of $573 million and hardware support revenue of $550 million. Total revenue for the quarter was unchanged at $9 billion. Non-GAAP operating income was $3.7 billion and operating margin was 41%. 
I believe that for the fiscal year we are currently in, we are more than halfway through what will turn out to be the trough year for operating income. 
The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 20.4% and the GAAP tax rate was 17.6% as we saw some one time noncash benefit. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.63 in USD and GAAP EPS was $0.51 in USD. As I said earlier, non-GAAP EPS was $0.06 lower due to currency. 
Free cash flow over the last 4 quarters was $11.3 billion. We now have more than $52 billion in cash and marketable securities. Net of debt, our cash position is over $10.4 billion. Short-term deferred revenue balance is $7 billion, up 9% in constant currency. 
This quarter, we repurchased more than 86 million shares for a total of $3.25 billion and over the last 4 years, we have reduced the share outstanding by more than 16%. The Board of Directors also declared a quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share. Over the last 12 months, we have repurchased more than 250 million shares for a total of $10.3 billion and paid out dividends of $2.5 billion for a total that is more than 110% of our free cash flow. 
I'd also like to formally welcome René James to Oracle's board. She's a great addition. 
Now to the guidance. I'm going to give you guidance for Q3 and then, some preliminary guidance for Q4. We feel very good about the progress of our cloud transition and clearly customers are rapidly adopting Oracle. As you know, we are expecting to see a material second half acceleration in our SaaS, PaaS revenue based on our bookings growth and the exploration of customer promotion. My guidance will reflect this, making it easier to see that we are taking share in the industry. 
Since we have a clear trend and disability through the end of the fiscal year, I'm going to give not only Q3 guidance but also some guidance for Q4. My intention is to share with you what we are seeing in our business now that we have line of sight to it. All my guidance today is on a non-GAAP basis and in constant currency. We expect to see continued volatility in exchange rates. I'm going to give you constant currency guidance but if current exchange rates remain the same as they are right now, we expect to see currency headwind of 4% on revenue and $0.03 to EPS, which is significantly less than Q2. 
So on the guidance. SaaS and PaaS revenue is expected to grow between 49% and 53%. Cloud IaaS revenue is expected to grow between 3% to 7%. Total cloud and on-premise software is expected to grow 3% to 4%. 
Total revenue growth is expected to range from 0% to positive 3%. Non-GAAP EPS in constant currency is expected to be somewhere between $0.63 and $0.66. This assumes a non-GAAP tax rate of 25.5%. Of course, if this quarter is any example, it may be -- it may end up being different, probably better. 
Looking further out to Q4, we expect to see continued acceleration in SaaS and PaaS as well as a return to EPS growth, year-over-year. 
My guidance for Q4 is also in constant currency. SaaS and PaaS revenue is expected to grow between 59 -- 65% and 59%. Cloud IaaS revenue is expected to grow 1% to 5%. 
Total cloud and on-premise software is expected to grow between 2% and 4%. Total revenue growth is expected to range from 1% to 3%. 
Non-GAAP EPS in constant currency is expected to be somewhere between $0.83 and $0.86, which is a significant increase compared to last year's $0.78. 
As I've said before, I believe fiscal year 2016 is a trough year for profitability as we move to the cloud. As such, I expect to see strong EPS growth in Q1 and beyond. 
My Q4 EPS guidance assumes the same non-GAAP tax rate as Q3 at 25.5%, but that's probably too early to get a real beat on. 
Finally, SaaS and PaaS growth margins are expected to improve in both Q3 and Q4, exiting the year between 55% and 60%. I will, of course, revisit Q4 guidance with you as part of the Q3 earnings call. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Mark for his comments."

Because our strong cloud bookings deferred revenues lead to revenue acceleration in the second half and next year. 
We'd like [indiscernible] about a 38% year-on-year double-digit growth. Our billings grew 68%. And again, just giving you numbers, Salesforce grew 21% and Workday, 41%. We grew 68%. 
Bookings $284 in USD; in cloud, 75% growth. 
Let me give you some customer numbers. We added 857 new SaaS customers in the quarter. 720 customer expansions. Our installed base is now over 10,000 customers. Over 3,000 of these are Fusion. Almost 50% of our bookings in dollars are now Fusion. 
At HCM, we added 211 customers, growing faster than Workday. CX added [ph] 9 customers. At ERP, we added 311 customers. We're now over 1,500 customers on our installed base. 450 are now live. 5x Workdays, 90. 
ERP and EPM were more than half of our Q2 wins did not have Oracle on-premise apps, meaning that 1 quarter we sold more than new customers than Workday did in its lifetime. 
In PaaS, we added 1,343 new PaaS customers. 4,100 now over the last 12 months. Bookings, $100 million USD and 75% of what we sold is now subscription. [indiscernible] meter 25%, meter are PaaS business is scaling nicely. 
Now, I am going to read you a bunch of names. I just want you to get a context for the sort of brands we closed in the quarter. In ERP, Blue Shield in California; DHL, FDIC; [indiscernible]; Toshiba Mitsubishi Electric, [indiscernible], a very large phone company in France; a very large industrial manufacturing company, perhaps the largest in the world with over $130 billion in revenue. 
In HCM, AAA, Elegant, city of Aspen, crocs. Think of many of these now that I'm naming again beats against Workday, Exelon, Kaiser, McGraw-Hill, Genesis actually, replacement of Workday, Brocade, more HCM; United Nations; Stanford University. 
In CX, [indiscernible], [indiscernible] customer experience; [indiscernible], Expedia, Halliburton, Lufthansa, Maersk, Motorola solutions, Sears, Toshiba Mitsubishi; and United Airlines. 
In PaaS, [indiscernible], IKEA, Kaiser, [indiscernible] motors, Qantas, semantic and Windstream. 
I could've named a lot more. I just wanted to give you a flavor for what we did in the quarter. 
Just to wrap up and connect a few dots for you in the Oracle SaaS, PaaS cloud. We are currently at a $2.6 billion run rate in total cloud revenue. It's likely our quarterly run rate will exit the year around $3.2 billion and we'll grow further after Q1 bookings. We will book roughly a 11 -- 1.5 -- more than $1.5 million [indiscernible] this fiscal year -- $1.5 billion, sorry, thank you. If we continue to book the way we expect, we should see our first $1 billion quarter for SaaS, PaaS revenue next year. 
Gross deferred revenue is now real at $1.1 billion, that is up 135% year-on-year and 9% quarter-on-quarter. Gross margin improved sequentially at SaaS and PaaS, 40% to 43%. We're headed to 60% and then as Safra described to on to 80%.

Oracle is the first company to market a complete cloud ERP suite from midsize and large enterprises. By pioneering this market, we have become the ERP market leader with over 1,500 cloud ERP customers. Cloud ERP is now our fastest-growing SaaS application suite. 
In PaaS, we have differentiated by making it effortless for our hundreds of thousands of customers to move their millions of existing Oracle databases in Java programs to our cloud with the push of a button, thereby obtaining the low cost and ease-of-use of the cloud without having to sacrifice any performance loss or any security degradation. 
We now have highly differentiated, rapidly growing SaaS and PaaS businesses. This coming year, we will deliver a number of innovations in Infrastructure as a Service as well.

So that would tell you, and our business has become scaled enough Ross, just to be clear, that it now it's behaving like a large business begins to in terms of the scale of the funnel, the pipeline, the discipline we have, the conversion rates we have, et cetera. So that would be sort of my view on that. On PaaS, we have had a change to your point of going away from metered to subscription bookings. So the bookings are now the bulk, as I mentioned, 75%, now subscription as opposed to metered. And I would say the usage of our PaaS has increased not significantly but sort of geometrically, meaning that it's gone from when we originally started the usage to jump up over the last 4 or 6 months, I'd say, to where the usage is, extremely high, extremely high in terms of the increase of our usage.

I mentioned because I had a blizzard of names that I may have done myself in the service by mentioning so many names but in the companies we actually, replaced Workday. So imagine in a period of time, Workday sold -- sorry, in HCM, we replaced Workday. So we continue to get better and better and better at HCM and now we're beginning to see a lot of the yields that are what you sell ERP and HCM is attached to the ERP sale. So because of ERP being a, in many ways, a very strategic, very sticky sale, we now see our attach rates moving up and up and up and up which somebody the ERP and then, buy HCM at the same time. The scale of our Fusion products and the reason I gave you that metric for the first time is it's now a very high -- it's now beginning to become a reasonable percent of our total portfolio versus everything that we've got, including marketing which is having a great run, as you know. But I add to at the fact that now, Fusion products which are extremely sticky are almost 50% of our total bookings. So I mean, I can keep going down these metrics for you but I think we're unique in ERP and getting farther ahead. I mean, we're at the point now we're over 1,500 customers. Won't give you a prognostication where we end the end the year but it's going well over 2,000. I guess, I just did. It's going be well over 2,000.

One is in-memory aspect of the database where we now have the fastest in-memory database. And the way you take advantage of that, you pick any existing Oracle application and you run it without change on 12 to 12 2 and it runs much, much faster -- it runs on memory without changing. So other people say, you might will use our memory database, you'll have to rewrite application. In this case, you don't have to rewrite the application. You press the button. We run much faster and by the way, we run faster than competition. So we have a lot of our customers want to take advantage of in-memory acceleration, that's one of the reasons they buy the new version of the database. The other thing is multi-tenancy. They like to do a lot of consolidation. They have a lot of small databases. They like to run on one machine. And you can do that much more efficiently by running the Oracle database with multiple tenants. You consume hardware resources, it's easier to manage, you can back up a whole suite of databases, a group of databases is one. It's fairly automated. So that's the other major reason, we see a rapid uptake. And finally, we're seeing our customers as our PaaS business begins to increase in adoption, that the customers wants to run the latest version of database in the cloud and they want to match that up with the latest version of the database in their data center. They want to run this basically the same technology both in our cloud in their data center and that's one of the unique value propositions that we offer our cloud customers. The same exact technology on-premise and in the cloud. And those things will then coexist for years and years to come. Then the customers are seeking out their versions. We have the latest version in the cloud, they want the latest version on-premise. That's also accelerating the adoption of the database system."

The good news about the ERP or ERP suite is it's still not available. It's just going into other geographies. So with the last release we had, we've now brought on manufacturing and supply chain. We're now releasing the product for sale in some, like for example, in Brazil and some European countries, so we actually get some geographic expansion with the last release we had. So this is actually good news. The strong in this case actually, get stronger. We actually, now have a material number of references. I think I mentioned but I'm going to try again, we are over now 450 customers wide. This is a big, big metric. Our market also expands in a couple ways with ERP, which makes it so important. We get 2 increases on our total available market. One is what you mentioned, the fact that we actually, get to go down market now. And yes, we do have broad market expansion. We get to compete for companies that are otherwise would never have had an IT staff, couldn't have assembled an ERP system. We now get to compete. We also know, remember when we were in the ERP system, we win the hardware, we win everything, we win the whole stack. So our TAM really goes up on 2 -- our total available market on 2 dimensions, the total stack in addition to our ability to compete down market. Now that broad based, that's why I specifically used the names I did. Our success is not unique to midmarket or upmarket. It's really both. I mentioned the name of the biggest -- I didn't mention the name, very, very big telephone company in France, very big industrial company. These are huge companies, at the same time, as we have $50 million companies that are moving to our cloud ERP. So it is broad-based access across geographies but the good news halfway, I think we're just really extorted."

I'll then review guidance for Q3 and Q4 and turn the call over to Larry and Mark for their comments.
As you can imagine, we are very pleased with the quarter. Total revenue exceeded my guidance, driven by the combined strength of our cloud business as well as better-than-expected results from the on-premise software business. Earnings per share were also above my guidance, coming in $0.04 better than the midpoint of the constant currency range I provided last quarter.
Q2 currency headwinds were mostly as expected around 6% in most categories, including total revenues. However, the currency effect to earnings per share was $0.06, $0.01 more than my guidance.
We will continue to use constant dollar growth rates on our quarterly call so we can have some measure of consistency across the quarter as well as to reflect how we measure the business.
Considering the progress we've made in our transition to the cloud and the subscription business, from now on, I'm going to start with our SaaS and PaaS business.
We continue to see excellent momentum there with bookings growth of 75% for this quarter on top of the 147% we reported last year. SaaS and PaaS revenue was $487 million, up 38% from last year, 39% in GAAP. Sequentially, SaaS and PaaS revenue grew 8% and we expect the sequential growth next quarter will be even higher.
The bookings growth that we have been experiencing will now translate into a significant acceleration in SaaS and PaaS revenue growth in Q3 where we could hit 50% revenue growth and in Q4, where it should be even higher.
You can also see the coming revenue acceleration of our cloud business in the SaaS and PaaS Billings and deferred revenue. SaaS and PaaS Billings grew 68% in US dollars this quarter, on top of the 70% growth last quarter. Also, the growth-deferred revenue balance is now nearly $1.1 billion and was up 135% in US dollars. We've put the billings numbers up on our website for you to see the detail.
The balance of our cloud revenues come from cloud Infrastructure as a Service, which was up 11% to $165 million. While SaaS and PaaS revenue will see much higher growth rates, we expect Infrastructure as a Service revenue growth, which is currently dominated by our hosting business, will be more moderate for now.
Total cloud revenues, which is SaaS, PaaS and IaaS were us $652 million, up 30%.
As our cloud revenue continues -- as our cloud revenue business continues to scale from the growth we are experiencing, it is beginning to benefit our margins as I previously predicted. The Q2 growth margin for SaaS and PaaS was 43%, up from 40% last quarter and will see further improvement in Q3. I also expect the Q4 exit rate growth margin for SaaS and PaaS will be around 55% to 60% and from there, we'll be targeting 80% in fiscal year '18. The growth margin in the IaaS business was up slightly to 45%.
Capital expenditures for the quarter were $195 million or $251 million lower than Q1. And I expect the cloud-based, cloud-related CapEx for the full year will be lower than last year as we utilize the investments we have made.
On-premise software revenue, including new software license and software license updates and product support, was unchanged at $6.4 billion. Software license updates and product support revenue was $4.7 billion, up 5% from last year and up 1% sequentially 
Attach and renewal rates are running at their usual high level. New software license revenue was $1.7 billion, down from last year but a bit better than I expected for the quarter. 
Over the full year, I expect we will see modest growth in our on-premise software revenue, comprised of continued growth in software support that more than offset declines in new software license.
Finally, total hardware revenue was down 10%, which included a hardware products revenue of $573 million and hardware support revenue of $550 million. Total revenue for the quarter was unchanged at $9 billion. Non-GAAP operating income was $3.7 billion, and operating margin was 41%.
I believe that for the fiscal year we are currently in, we are more than halfway through what will turn out to have been the trough year for operating income.
The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 20.4% and the GAAP tax rate was 17.6% as we saw some onetime noncash benefit. Non-GAAP EPS was USD 0.63 and GAAP EPS was USD 0.51. As I said earlier, non-GAAP EPS was $0.06 lower due to currency.
Free cash flow over the last 4 quarters was $11.3 billion. We now have more than $52 billion in cash and marketable securities. Net of debt, our cash position is over $10.4 billion. Short-term deferred revenue balance is $7 billion, up 9% in constant currency.
This quarter, we repurchased more than 86 million shares for a total of $3.25 billion and over the last 4 years, we have reduced the share outstanding by more than 16%. The Board of Directors also declared a quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share. Over the last 12 months, we have repurchased more than 250 million shares for a total of $10.3 billion and paid out dividends of $2.5 billion for a total that is more than 110% of our free cash flow.
I'd also like to formally welcome Renee James to Oracle's board. She's a great addition.
Now to the guidance. I'm going to give you guidance for Q3 and then some preliminary guidance for Q4. We feel very good about the progress of our cloud transition and clearly, customers are rapidly adopting Oracle. As you know, we are expecting to see a material second half acceleration in our SaaS and PaaS revenue based on our bookings growth and the exploration of customer promotion. My guidance will reflect this, making it easier to see that we are taking share in the industry.
Since we have a clear trend and visibility through the end of the fiscal year, I'm going to give not only Q3 guidance but also some guidance for Q4. My intention is to share with you what we are seeing in our business now that we have line of sight to it. All my guidance today is on a non-GAAP basis and in constant currency. We expect to see continued volatility in exchange rates. I'm going to give you constant currency guidance but if current exchange rates remain the same as they are right now, we expect to see currency headwind of 4% on revenue and $0.03 to EPS, which is significantly less than Q2. 
So on the guidance. SaaS and PaaS revenue is expected to grow between 49% and 53%. Cloud IaaS revenue is expected to grow between 3% to 7%. Total cloud and on-premise software is expected to grow 3% to 4%.
Total revenue growth is expected to range from 0% to positive 3%. Non-GAAP EPS in constant currency is expected to be somewhere between $0.63 and $0.66. This assumes a non-GAAP tax rate of 25.5%. Of course, if this quarter is any example, it may be -- it may end up being different, probably better.
Looking further out to Q4, we expect to see continued acceleration in SaaS and PaaS as well as a return to EPS growth year-over-year.
My guidance for Q4 is also in constant currency. SaaS and PaaS revenue is expected to grow between 59 -- 65% and 59%. Cloud IaaS revenue is expected to grow 1% to 5%.
Total cloud and on-premise software is expected to grow between 2% and 4%. Total revenue growth is expected to range from 1% to 3%.
Non-GAAP EPS in constant currency is expected to be somewhere between $0.83 and $0.86, which is a significant increase compared to last year's $0.78.
As I've said before, I believe fiscal year 2016 is a trough year for profitability as we move to the cloud. As such, I expect to see strong EPS growth in Q1 and beyond.
My Q4 EPS guidance assumes the same non-GAAP tax rate as Q3 at 25.5%, but that's probably too early to get a real beat on.
Finally, SaaS and PaaS growth margins are expected to improve in both Q3 and Q4, exiting the year between 55% and 60%. I will, of course, revisit Q4 guidance with you as part of the Q3 earnings call.
With that, I'll turn it over to Mark for his comments."

So in the spirit of giving you just a blizzard of numbers, I am going to extend that because our strong cloud bookings and deferred revenue growth will lead to revenue acceleration in the second half and next year.
We'd talked about a 38% year-on-year double-digit growth. Our billings grew 68%. And again, just to give you numbers, Salesforce grew 21% and Workday, 41%. We grew 68%. Bookings USD 284; in cloud, 75% growth.
Let me give you some customer numbers. We added 857 new SaaS customers in the quarter. 720 customer expansions. Our installed base is now over 10,000 customers. Over 3,000 of these are Fusion. And almost 50% of our bookings in dollars are net Fusion.
In HCM, we added 211 customers, growing faster than Workday. CX, 409 customers. In ERP, we added 311 customers. We're now over 1,500 customers in our installed base. 450 are now live. 5x Workdays, 90. 
ERP and EPM, more than half of our Q2 wins did not have Oracle on-premise apps, meaning that at 1 quarter we sold more net new customers than Workday did in its lifetime.
In PaaS, we added 1,343 new PaaS customers. 4,100 now over the last 12 months. Bookings, USD 100 million, and 75% of what we sold is now subscription, non-meter; 25%, meter. Our PaaS business is scaling nicely.
Now, I am going to read you a bunch of names. I just want you to get a context for sort of the brands we closed in the quarter. In ERP, Blue Shield of California; DHL, FDIC; McKesson; Toshiba Mitsubishi Electric, Wipro; a very large phone company in France; a very large industrial manufacturing company, perhaps the largest in the world with over $130 billion of revenue.
In HCM, AAA [ph], ALADIN, City of Aspen, Crocs. Think of many of these now that I'm naming, again, beats against Workday, Exelon; Kaiser; McGraw-Hill; Genesis; actually a replacement of Workday, Brocade. More HCM, the United Nations, Stanford University. 
In CX, Ambev -- CXP and Customer Experience, Ambev, Expedia, Halliburton, Lufthansa, Maersk, Motorola solutions, Sears, Toshiba Mitsubishi; and United Airlines.
In PaaS, Anthem, IKEA, Kaiser, Kia Motors, Maersk, Qantas, Symantec and Windstream.
I could have named a lot more. I just wanted to give you a flavor what we did in the quarter.
Just to wrap up and connect a few dots for you in the Oracle SaaS, PaaS cloud. We are currently at a $2.6 billion run rate in total cloud revenue. It's likely our quarterly run rate will exit the year around $3.2 billion, and we'll grow further after Q1 bookings. We will book roughly 11 -- 1.5 -- more than $1.5 million in ARR this fiscal year -- billion, sorry, thank you, billion. If we continue to book the way we expect, we should see our first $1 billion quarter for SaaS, PaaS revenue next year.
Gross deferred revenue is now real a $1.1 billion, that is up 135% year-on-year, 9% quarter-on-quarter. Gross margin improved sequentially, as Safra described, 40% to 43%. We're headed to 60%, and then as Safra described to on to 80%.
But I'll now turn it over to Larry."

In addition, we also have efficiency gains at all times but that is again because of our larger scale and those are simply economies of scale. But the bulk of it is we are starting to be able to recognize revenues for which we have already invested. As how many points -- I actually -- the impact on operating income for us was quite significant from a currency point of view, but -- hold on I'm doing the math, Q3. I don't know, I've got to actually do it on our margins?

Our pipeline, I think, I mentioned this at Financial Analyst Day, as I'm going to mention it again. Our pipeline -- I can't come up with a better analytical statement than just huge. And so our pipeline now is multiple billions of dollars. Let me give you more color. If I look at the next 6 months, our pipeline of things that are in the next 6 months funnel, you have a multibillion-dollar funnel and our conversion rate is increasing. So that would tell you -- and our business has become scaled enough Ross, just to be clear, that it now is behaving like a large business begins to in terms of the scale of the funnel, the pipeline, the discipline we have, the conversion rates we have, et cetera. So that would be sort of my view on that. On PaaS, we have had a change to your point of going away from metered to subscription bookings. So the bookings are now the bulk, as I mentioned, the 75% now subscription as opposed to metered. And I would say the usage of our PaaS has increased not significantly but sort of geometrically, meaning that it's gone from when we originally started the usage to jump up over the last 4 or 6 months, I'd say, to where the usage is extremely high, extremely high in terms of the increase of our usage. So it's very exciting both on the bookings, the type of bookings and the usage that we're seeing of what's booked."

That in SaaS overall, we are just better overall. We have more people, we're well-trained, our products all have matured, and we have a lot of references. Our position in ERP is just unique. We don't have a competitor per se. I used these metrics to -- against Workday just to describe to you how exponentially far ahead of our sort of only person I can think of that's built a product. Just to be clear in ERP SaaS, I don't ever -- I'm not trying -- Safra might have somebody she knows or Larry might know somebody, I don't see SAP. I'm now in the market a lot. I don't see them. So I don't know what they're working on but it's not ERP SaaS. In HCM, I think we are continue to just get better and better and better. I mentioned because I had a blizzard of names that I may have done myself a dis-service by mentioning so many names. But in a couple of names, we actually, replaced Workday. So imagine in a period of time, Workday -- sorry, in HCM, we replaced Workday. So we continue to get better and better and better at HCM, and now we're beginning to see a lot of deals that are where you sell ERP and HCM is attached to the ERP sale. So because of ERP being a, in many ways, a very strategic, very sticky sale, we now see our attach rates moving up and up and up where somebody buys ERP and they buy HCM at the same time. The scale of our Fusion products, well, the reason I gave you that metric for the first time is it's now a very high -- it's now beginning to become a reasonable percent of our total portfolio versus everything that we've got, including marketing, which is having a great run, as you know. But I add to it the fact that now Fusion products, which are extremely sticky are almost 50% of our total bookings. So I mean, I could -- feel I could keep going down these metrics for you, but I think we're unique in ERP and getting farther ahead. I mean, we're in the point now we're over 1,500 customers. We'll give you a prognostication where we end the year but I -- it's going to be well over 2,000. I guess, it just did. It's going be well over 2,000. We're getting better and better at HCM, we're in a leadership position in marketing. I feel good about where we sit."

One is in-memory aspect of the database, where we now have the fastest in-memory database. And the way you take advantage of that, you take any existing Oracle application and you run it without change on 12 -- 12.2 and it runs much, much -- it runs in-memory without changing. So other people say, we'll use my in-memory database, we have to rewrite the application. In this case, you don't have to rewrite the application. You press the button. We run much faster. And by the way, we run faster than the competition. So we have a lot of our customers want to take advantage of in-memory acceleration, that's one of the reasons they buy the new version of the database. The other thing is multi-tenancy. They like to do a lot of consolidation. They have a lot of small databases. They like to run on one machine. And you can do that much more efficiently by running the Oracle database with multiple tenants. You consume less hardware resources, it's easier to manage, you can back up a whole suite of databases, a group of databases is one. It's fairly automated. So that's the other major reason we see a very rapid uptake. And finally, we're seeing our customers, as our PaaS business begins to increase in adoption, that the customer wants to run the latest version of the database in the cloud and they want to match that up with the latest version of the database in their data center. They want to run this basically the same technology both in our cloud and their data center, and that's one of the unique value propositions that we offer our cloud customers. The same exact technology on-premise and in the cloud. And those things will then coexist for years and years to come. Then the customers are seeking up their versions. We have the latest version in the cloud, they want the latest version on-premise. That's also accelerating the adoption of the database on-premise."

So this is actually good news. The strong, in this case, actually get stronger. We actually, now have a material number of references. I think I mentioned but I'm going to try again, we have over now 450 customers-wide. This is a big, big metric. Our market also expands in a couple ways with ERP, which makes it so important. We get 2 increases on our total available market. One is what you mentioned, the fact that we actually get to go downmarket now. And yes, we do have broad market expansion. We get to compete for companies that otherwise would never have had an IT staff, couldn't have had assembled an ERP system, we now get to compete. We also now, remember when we win an ERP system, we win the hardware, we win everything, we win the whole stack. So our TAM really goes up on 2 -- our total available market on 2 dimensions, the total stack in addition to our ability to compete downmarket. Now that broad base, that's why I specifically used the names I did. Our success is not unique to midmarket or upmarket. It's really both. I mentioned the name of the biggest -- I didn't mention the name, very, very big telephone company in France, very big industrial company. These are huge companies. At the same time, is we have $50 million companies that are moving to our cloud ERP.

I'll then review guidance for Q3 and Q4 and turn the call over to Larry and Mark for their comments.
As you can imagine, we are very pleased with the quarter. Total revenue exceeded my guidance, driven by the combined strength of our cloud business as well as better-than-expected results from the on-premise software business. Earnings per share were also above my guidance, coming in $0.04 better than the midpoint of the constant currency range I provided last quarter.
Q2 currency headwinds were mostly as expected around 6% in most categories, including total revenues. However, the currency effect to earnings per share was $0.06, $0.01 more than my guidance.
We will continue to use constant dollar growth rates on our quarterly call so we can have some measure of consistency across the quarter as well as to reflect how we measure the business.
Considering the progress we've made in our transition to the cloud and the subscription business, from now on, I'm going to start with our SaaS and PaaS business.
We continue to see excellent momentum there with bookings growth of 75% for this quarter on top of the 147% we reported last year. SaaS and PaaS revenue was $487 million, up 38% from last year, 39% in GAAP. Sequentially, SaaS and PaaS revenue grew 8% and we expect the sequential growth next quarter will be even higher.
The bookings growth that we have been experiencing will now translate into a significant acceleration in SaaS and PaaS revenue growth in Q3 where we could hit 50% revenue growth and in Q4, where it should be even higher.
You can also see the coming revenue acceleration of our cloud business in the SaaS and PaaS Billings and deferred revenue. SaaS and PaaS Billings grew 68% in U.S. dollars this quarter, on top of the 70% growth last quarter. Also, the growth-deferred revenue balance is now nearly $1.1 billion and was up 135% in U.S. dollars. We've put the billings numbers up on our website for you to see the detail.
The balance of our cloud revenues come from cloud Infrastructure as a Service, which was up 11% to $165 million. While SaaS and PaaS revenue will see much higher growth rates, we expect Infrastructure as a Service revenue growth, which is currently dominated by our hosting business, will be more moderate for now.
Total cloud revenues, which is SaaS, PaaS and IaaS were us $652 million, up 30%.
As our cloud revenue continues -- as our cloud revenue business continues to scale from the growth we are experiencing, it is beginning to benefit our margins as I previously predicted. The Q2 growth margin for SaaS and PaaS was 43%, up from 40% last quarter and will see further improvement in Q3. I also expect the Q4 exit rate gross margin for SaaS and PaaS will be around 55% to 60% and from there, we'll be targeting 80% in fiscal year '18. The gross margin in the IaaS business was up slightly to 45%.
Capital expenditures for the quarter were $195 million or $251 million lower than Q1. And I expect the cloud-based, cloud-related CapEx for the full year will be lower than last year as we utilize the investments we have made.
On-premise software revenue, including new software license and software license updates and product support, was unchanged at $6.4 billion. Software license updates and product support revenue was $4.7 billion, up 5% from last year and up 1% sequentially 
Attach and renewal rates are running at their usual high level. New software license revenue was $1.7 billion, down from last year but a bit better than I expected for the quarter. 
Over the full year, I expect we will see modest growth in our on-premise software revenue, comprised of continued growth in software support that more than offsets declines in new software license.
Finally, total hardware revenue was down 10%, which included hardware products revenue of $573 million and hardware support revenue of $550 million. Total revenue for the quarter was unchanged at $9 billion. Non-GAAP operating income was $3.7 billion, and operating margin was 41%.
I believe that for the fiscal year we are currently in, we are more than halfway through what will turn out to have been the trough year for operating income.
The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 20.4% and the GAAP tax rate was 17.6% as we saw some onetime noncash benefit. Non-GAAP EPS was USD 0.63 and GAAP EPS was USD 0.51. As I said earlier, non-GAAP EPS was $0.06 lower due to currency.
Free cash flow over the last 4 quarters was $11.3 billion. We now have more than $52 billion in cash and marketable securities. Net of debt, our cash position is over $10.4 billion. Short-term deferred revenue balance is $7 billion, up 9% in constant currency.
This quarter, we repurchased more than 86 million shares for a total of $3.25 billion and over the last 4 years, we have reduced the share outstanding by more than 16%. The Board of Directors also declared a quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share. Over the last 12 months, we have repurchased more than 250 million shares for a total of $10.3 billion and paid out dividends of $2.5 billion for a total that is more than 110% of our free cash flow.
I'd also like to formally welcome Renee James to Oracle's board. She's a great addition.
Now to the guidance. I'm going to give you guidance for Q3 and then some preliminary guidance for Q4. We feel very good about the progress of our cloud transition and clearly, customers are rapidly adopting Oracle. As you know, we are expecting to see a material second half acceleration in our SaaS and PaaS revenue based on our bookings growth and the expiration of customer promotion. My guidance will reflect this, making it easier to see that we are taking share in the industry.
Since we have a clear trend and visibility through the end of the fiscal year, I'm going to give not only Q3 guidance but also some guidance for Q4. My intention is to share with you what we are seeing in our business now that we have line of sight to it. All my guidance today is on a non-GAAP basis and in constant currency. We expect to see continued volatility in exchange rates. I'm going to give you constant currency guidance but if current exchange rates remain the same as they are right now, we expect to see currency headwind of 4% on revenue and $0.03 to EPS, which is significantly less than Q2. 
So on the guidance. SaaS and PaaS revenue is expected to grow between 49% and 53%. Cloud IaaS revenue is expected to grow between 3% to 7%. Total cloud and on-premise software is expected to grow 3% to 4%.
Total revenue growth is expected to range from 0% to positive 3%. Non-GAAP EPS in constant currency is expected to be somewhere between $0.63 and $0.66. This assumes a non-GAAP tax rate of 25.5%. Of course, if this quarter is any example, it may be -- it may end up being different, probably better.
Looking further out to Q4, we expect to see continued acceleration in SaaS and PaaS as well as a return to EPS growth year-over-year.
My guidance for Q4 is also in constant currency. SaaS and PaaS revenue is expected to grow between 59 -- 55% and 59%. Cloud IaaS revenue is expected to grow 1% to 5%.
Total cloud and on-premise software is expected to grow between 2% and 4%. Total revenue growth is expected to range from 1% to 3%.
Non-GAAP EPS in constant currency is expected to be somewhere between $0.83 and $0.86, which is a significant increase compared to last year's $0.78.
As I've said before, I believe fiscal year 2016 is a trough year for profitability as we move to the cloud. As such, I expect to see strong EPS growth in Q1 and beyond.
My Q4 EPS guidance assumes the same non-GAAP tax rate as Q3 at 25.5%, but that's probably too early to get a real beat on.
Finally, SaaS and PaaS gross margins are expected to improve in both Q3 and Q4, exiting the year between 55% and 60%. I will, of course, revisit Q4 guidance with you as part of the Q3 earnings call.
With that, I'll turn it over to Mark for his comments."

So in the spirit of giving you just a blizzard of numbers, I am going to extend that because our strong cloud bookings and deferred revenue growth will lead to revenue acceleration in the second half and next year.
We'd talked about a 38% year-on-year double-digit growth. Our billings grew 68%. And again, just to give you numbers, Salesforce grew 21% and Workday, 41%. We grew 68%. Bookings USD 284; in cloud, 75% growth.
Let me give you some customer numbers. We added 857 new SaaS customers in the quarter. 720 customer expansions. Our installed base is now over 10,000 customers. Over 3,000 of these are Fusion. And almost 50% of our bookings in dollars are net Fusion.
In HCM, we added 211 customers, growing faster than Workday. CX, 409 customers. In ERP, we added 311 customers. We're now over 1,500 customers in our installed base. 450 are now live. 5x Workdays, 90. 
ERP and EPM, more than half of our Q2 wins did not have Oracle on-premise apps, meaning that at 1 quarter we sold more net new customers than Workday did in its lifetime.
In PaaS, we added 1,343 new PaaS customers. 4,100 now over the last 12 months. Bookings, USD 100 million, and 75% of what we sold is now subscription, non-meter; 25%, meter. Our PaaS business is scaling nicely.
Now I am going to read you a bunch of names. I just want you to get a context for sort of the brands we closed in the quarter. In ERP, Blue Shield of California; DHL, FDIC; McKesson; Toshiba Mitsubishi Electric, Wipro; a very large phone company in France; a very large industrial manufacturing company, perhaps the largest in the world with over $130 billion of revenue.
In HCM, AAA [ph], ALADIN, City of Aspen, Crocs. Think of many of these now that I'm naming, again, beats against Workday, Exelon; Kaiser; McGraw-Hill; Genesis; actually a replacement of Workday, Brocade. More HCM, the United Nations, Stanford University. 
In CX, Ambev -- CXP and Customer Experience, Ambev, Expedia, Halliburton, Lufthansa, Maersk, Motorola solutions, Sears, Toshiba Mitsubishi; and United Airlines.
In PaaS, Anthem, IKEA, Kaiser, Kia Motors, Maersk, Qantas, Symantec and Windstream.
I could have named a lot more. I just wanted to give you a flavor what we did in the quarter.
Just to wrap up and connect a few dots for you in the Oracle SaaS, PaaS cloud. We are currently at a $2.6 billion run rate in total cloud revenue. It's likely our quarterly run rate will exit the year around $3.2 billion, and we'll grow further after Q1 bookings. We will book roughly 11 -- 1.5 -- more than $1.5 million in ARR this fiscal year -- billion, sorry, thank you, billion. If we continue to book the way we expect, we should see our first $1 billion quarter for SaaS, PaaS revenue next year.
Gross deferred revenue is now real a $1.1 billion, that is up 135% year-on-year, 9% quarter-on-quarter. Gross margin improved sequentially, as Safra described, 40% to 43%. We're headed to 60%, and then as Safra described on to 80%.
But I'll now turn it over to Larry."

Oracle's strategy is to differentiate our cloud products from our competitors. In SaaS, we differentiate by delivering the industry's most complete suite of cloud applications. In Customer Experience, we offer a CX suite made up of sales, service, marketing, e-commerce and a lot more. And in Human Capital Management, we have an HCM suite made up of human resources, recruiting, training, and so on.
In Enterprise Resource Planning. We are delivering an ERP suite made up of financials, supply chain, manufacturing and all the rest.
Oracle is the first company to market a complete cloud ERP suite from midsize and large enterprises. By pioneering this market, we have become the ERP market leader with over 1,500 cloud ERP customers. Cloud ERP is now our fastest-growing SaaS application suite.
In PaaS, we have differentiated by making it effortless for our hundreds of thousands of customers to move their millions of existing Oracle databases and Java programs to our cloud with a push of a button, thereby obtaining the low cost and ease-of-use of the cloud without having to sacrifice any performance loss or any security degradation.
We now have a highly differentiated, rapidly growing SaaS and PaaS businesses. This coming year, we will deliver a number of innovations in Infrastructure as a Service as well.
We expect that our rapidly growing cloud business will drive Oracle's overall revenue and overall profit growth for years and years to come."

So that would be sort of my view on that. On PaaS, we have had a change to your point of going away from metered to subscription bookings. So the bookings are now the bulk, as I mentioned, the 75% now subscription as opposed to metered. And I would say the usage of our PaaS has increased not significantly but sort of geometrically, meaning that it's gone from when we originally started the usage to jump up over the last 4 or 6 months, I'd say, to where the usage is extremely high, extremely high in terms of the increase of our usage.

So imagine in a period of time, Workday -- sorry, in HCM, we replaced Workday. So we continue to get better and better and better at HCM, and now we're beginning to see a lot of deals that are where you sell ERP and HCM is attached to the ERP sale. So because of ERP being a, in many ways, a very strategic, very sticky sale, we now see our attach rates moving up and up and up where somebody buys ERP and they buy HCM at the same time. The scale of our Fusion products, well, the reason I gave you that metric for the first time is it's now a very high -- it's now beginning to become a reasonable percent of our total portfolio versus everything that we've got, including marketing, which is having a great run, as you know. But I add to it the fact that now Fusion products, which are extremely sticky are almost 50% of our total bookings. So I mean, I could -- feel I could keep going down these metrics for you, but I think we're unique in ERP and getting farther ahead. I mean, we're in the point now we're over 1,500 customers. We'll give you a prognostication where we end the year but I -- it's going to be well over 2,000. I guess, I just did. It's going be well over 2,000.

One is the in-memory aspect of the database, where we now have the fastest in-memory database. And the way you take advantage of that, you take any existing Oracle application and you run it without change on 12 -- 12.2 and it runs much, much -- it runs in-memory without changing. So other people say, we'll use my in-memory database, we have to rewrite the application. In this case, you don't have to rewrite the application. You press the button. We run much faster. And by the way, we run faster than the competition. So we have a lot of our customers want to take advantage of in-memory acceleration, that's one of the reasons they buy the new version of the database. The other thing is multi-tenancy. They like to do a lot of consolidation. They have a lot of small databases. They like to run on one machine. And you can do that much more efficiently by running the Oracle database with multiple tenants. You consume less hardware resources, it's easier to manage, you can back up a whole suite of databases, a group of databases as one. It's thoroughly automated. So that's the other major reason we see a very rapid uptake. And finally, we're seeing our customers, as our PaaS business begins to increase in adoption, that the customer wants to run the latest version of the database in the cloud and they want to match that up with the latest version of the database in their data center. They want to run this basically the same technology both in our cloud and their data center, and that's one of the unique value propositions that we offer our cloud customers. The same exact technology on-premise and in the cloud. And those things will then coexist for years and years to come. Then the customers are syncing up their versions. We have the latest version in the cloud, they want the latest version on-premise. That's also accelerating the adoption of the database on-premise."

The good news about ERP -- our ERP suite is it's still not available. It's just going into other geographies. So with the last release we had, we've now brought on manufacturing and supply chain. We're now releasing the product for sale in some -- like for example, in Brazil, and some European countries. So we actually get some geographic expansion with the last release we had. So this is actually good news. The strong, in this case, actually get stronger. We actually, now have a material number of references. I think I mentioned but I'm going to try again, we have over now 450 customers-wide. This is a big, big metric. Our market also expands in a couple ways with ERP, which makes it so important. We get 2 increases on our total available market. One is what you mentioned, the fact that we actually get to go downmarket now. And yes, we do have broad market expansion. We get to compete for companies that otherwise would never have had an IT staff, couldn't have had assembled an ERP system, we now get to compete. We also now, remember when we win an ERP system, we win the hardware, we win everything, we win the whole stack. So our TAM really goes up on 2 -- our total available market on 2 dimensions, the total stack in addition to our ability to compete downmarket. Now that broad base, that's why I specifically used the names I did. Our success is not unique to mid-market or upmarket. It's really both. I mentioned the name of the biggest -- I didn't mention the name, very, very big telephone company in France, very big industrial company. These are huge companies. At the same time, is we have $50 million companies that are moving to our cloud ERP. So it is broad-based success across geographies but the good news I have for you, I think we're just really getting started."

Total revenue exceeded my guida",1425,"Thanks, Ken. I'm going to focus on our non-GAAP results for Q2. I'll then review guidance for Q3 and Q4 and turn the call over to Larry and Mark for their comments.
As you can imagine, we are very pleased with the quarter. Total revenue exceeded my guidance, driven by the combined strength of our cloud business as well as better-than-expected results from the on-premise software business. Earnings per share were also above my guidance, coming in $0.04 better than the midpoint of the constant currency range I provided last quarter.
Q2 currency headwinds were mostly as expected around 6% in most categories, including total revenues. However, the currency effect to earnings per share was $0.06, $0.01 more than my guidance.
We will continue to use constant dollar growth rates on our quarterly call so we can have some measure of consistency across the quarter as well as to reflect how we measure the business.
Considering the progress we've made in our transition to the cloud and the subscription business, from now on, I'm going to start with our SaaS and PaaS business.
We continue to see excellent momentum there with bookings growth of 75% for this quarter on top of the 147% we reported last year. SaaS and PaaS revenue was $487 million, up 38% from last year, 39% in GAAP. Sequentially, SaaS and PaaS revenue grew 8% and we expect the sequential growth next quarter will be even higher.
The bookings growth that we have been experiencing will now translate into a significant acceleration in SaaS and PaaS revenue growth in Q3 where we could hit 50% revenue growth and in Q4, where it should be even higher.
You can also see the coming revenue acceleration of our cloud business in the SaaS and PaaS Billings in deferred revenue. SaaS and PaaS Billings grew 68% in U.S. dollars this quarter, on top of the 70% growth last quarter. Also, the gross deferred revenue balance is now nearly $1.1 billion and was up 135% in U.S. dollars. We've put the billings numbers up on our website for you to see the detail.
The balance of our cloud revenues come from cloud Infrastructure as a Service, which was up 11% to $165 million. While SaaS and PaaS revenue will see much higher growth rates, we expect Infrastructure as a Service revenue growth, which is currently dominated by our hosting business, will be more moderate for now.
Total cloud revenues, which is SaaS, PaaS and IaaS were us $652 million, up 30%.
As our cloud revenue continues -- as our cloud revenue business continues to scale from the growth we are experiencing, it is beginning to benefit our margins as I previously predicted. The Q2 growth margin for SaaS and PaaS was 43%, up from 40% last quarter and will see further improvement in Q3. I also expect the Q4 exit rate gross margin for SaaS and PaaS will be around 55% to 60% and from there, we'll be targeting 80% in fiscal year '18. The gross margin in the IaaS business was up slightly to 45%.
Capital expenditures for the quarter were $195 million or $251 million lower than Q1. And I expect the cloud-based, cloud-related CapEx for the full year will be lower than last year as we utilize the investments we have made.
On-premise software revenue, including new software license and software license updates and product support, was unchanged at $6.4 billion. Software license updates and product support revenue was $4.7 billion, up 5% from last year and up 1% sequentially 
Attach and renewal rates are running at their usual high level. New software license revenue was $1.7 billion, down from last year but a bit better than I expected for the quarter. 
Over the full year, I expect we will see modest growth in our on-premise software revenue, comprised of continued growth in software support that more than offsets declines in new software license.
Finally, total hardware revenue was down 10%, which included hardware products revenue of $573 million and hardware support revenue of $550 million. Total revenue for the quarter was unchanged at $9 billion. Non-GAAP operating income was $3.7 billion, and operating margin was 41%.
I believe that for the fiscal year we are currently in, we are more than halfway through what will turn out to have been the trough year for operating income.
The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 20.4% and the GAAP tax rate was 17.6% as we saw some onetime noncash benefit. Non-GAAP EPS was USD 0.63 and GAAP EPS was USD 0.51. As I said earlier, non-GAAP EPS was $0.06 lower due to currency.
Free cash flow over the last 4 quarters was $11.3 billion. We now have more than $52 billion in cash and marketable securities. Net of debt, our cash position is over $10.4 billion. Short-term deferred revenue balance is $7 billion, up 9% in constant currency.
This quarter, we repurchased more than 86 million shares for a total of $3.25 billion and over the last 4 years, we have reduced the share outstanding by more than 16%. The Board of Directors also declared a quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share. Over the last 12 months, we have repurchased more than 250 million shares for a total of $10.3 billion and paid out dividends of $2.5 billion for a total that is more than 110% of our free cash flow.
I'd also like to formally welcome Renee James to Oracle's board. She's a great addition.
Now to the guidance. I'm going to give you guidance for Q3 and then some preliminary guidance for Q4. We feel very good about the progress of our cloud transition and clearly, customers are rapidly adopting Oracle. As you know, we are expecting to see a material second half acceleration in our SaaS and PaaS revenue based on our bookings growth and the expiration of customer promotion. My guidance will reflect this, making it easier to see that we are taking share in the industry.
Since we have a clear trend and visibility through the end of the fiscal year, I'm going to give not only Q3 guidance but also some guidance for Q4. My intention is to share with you what we are seeing in our business now that we have line of sight to it. All my guidance today is on a non-GAAP basis and in constant currency. We expect to see continued volatility in exchange rates. I'm going to give you constant currency guidance but if current exchange rates remain the same as they are right now, we expect to see currency headwind of 4% on revenue and $0.03 to EPS, which is significantly less than Q2. 
So on the guidance. SaaS and PaaS revenue is expected to grow between 49% and 53%. Cloud IaaS revenue is expected to grow between 3% to 7%. Total cloud and on-premise software is expected to grow 3% to 4%.
Total revenue growth is expected to range from 0% to positive 3%. Non-GAAP EPS in constant currency is expected to be somewhere between $0.63 and $0.66. This assumes a non-GAAP tax rate of 25.5%. Of course, if this quarter is any example, it may be -- it may end up being different, probably better.
Looking further out to Q4, we expect to see continued acceleration in SaaS and PaaS as well as a return to EPS growth year-over-year.
My guidance for Q4 is also in constant currency. SaaS and PaaS revenue is expected to grow between 59 -- 55% and 59%. Cloud IaaS revenue is expected to grow 1% to 5%.
Total cloud and on-premise software is expected to grow between 2% and 4%. Total revenue growth is expected to range from 1% to 3%.
Non-GAAP EPS in constant currency is expected to be somewhere between $0.83 and $0.86, which is a significant increase compared to last year's $0.78.
As I've said before, I believe fiscal year 2016 is a trough year for profitability as we move to the cloud. As such, I expect to see strong EPS growth in Q1 and beyond.
My Q4 EPS guidance assumes the same non-GAAP tax rate as Q3 at 25.5%, but that's probably too early to get a real beat on.
Finally, SaaS and PaaS gross margins are expected to improve in both Q3 and Q4, exiting the year between 55% and 60%. I will, of course, revisit Q4 guidance with you as part of the Q3 earnings call.
With that, I'll turn it over to Mark for his comments."

So in the spirit of giving you just a blizzard of numbers, I am going to extend that because our strong cloud bookings and deferred revenue growth will lead to revenue acceleration in the second half and next year.
We'd talked about a 38% year-on-year double-digit growth. Our billings grew 68%. And again, just to give you numbers, Salesforce grew 21% and Workday, 41%. We grew 68%. Bookings USD 284; in cloud, 75% growth.
Let me give you some customer numbers. We added 857 new SaaS customers in the quarter. 720 customer expansions. Our installed base is now over 10,000 customers. Over 3,000 of these are Fusion. And almost 50% of our bookings in dollars are net Fusion.
In HCM, we added 211 customers, growing faster than Workday. CX, 409 customers. In ERP, we added 311 customers. We're now over 1,500 customers in our installed base. 450 are now live. 5x Workdays, 90. 
ERP and EPM, more than half of our Q2 wins did not have Oracle on-premise apps, meaning that at 1 quarter we sold more net new customers than Workday did in its lifetime.
In PaaS, we added 1,343 new PaaS customers. 4,100 now over the last 12 months. Bookings, USD 100 million, and 75% of what we sold is now subscription, non-meter; 25%, meter. Our PaaS business is scaling nicely.
Now I am going to read you a bunch of names. I just want you to get a context for sort of the brands we closed in the quarter. In ERP, Blue Shield of California; DHL, FDIC; McKesson; Toshiba Mitsubishi Electric, Wipro; a very large phone company in France; a very large industrial manufacturing company, perhaps the largest in the world with over $130 billion of revenue.
In HCM, AAA, Allergan, City of Aspen, Crocs. Think of many of these now that I'm naming, again, beats against Workday, Exelon; Kaiser; McGraw-Hill; Genesis; actually a replacement of Workday, Brocade. More HCM, the United Nations, Stanford University. 
In CX, Ambev -- CXP and Customer Experience, Ambev, Expedia, Halliburton, Lufthansa, Maersk, Motorola solutions, Sears, Toshiba Mitsubishi; and United Airlines.
In PaaS, Anthem, IKEA, Kaiser, Kia Motors, Maersk, Qantas, Symantec and Windstream.
I could have named a lot more. I just wanted to give you a flavor what we did in the quarter.
Just to wrap up and connect a few dots for you in the Oracle SaaS, PaaS cloud. We are currently at a $2.6 billion run rate in total cloud revenue. It's likely our quarterly run rate will exit the year around $3.2 billion, and we'll grow further after Q1 bookings. We will book roughly 11 -- 1.5 -- more than $1.5 million in ARR this fiscal year -- billion, sorry, thank you, billion. If we continue to book the way we expect, we should see our first $1 billion quarter for SaaS, PaaS revenue next year.
Gross deferred revenue is now nearly $1.1 billion, that is up 135% year-on-year, 9% quarter-on-quarter. Gross margin improved sequentially, as Safra described, 40% to 43%. We're headed to 60%, and then as Safra described on to 80%.

Oracle's strategy is to differentiate our cloud products from our competitors. In SaaS, we differentiate by delivering the industry's most complete suite of cloud applications. In Customer Experience, we offer a CX suite made up of sales, service, marketing, e-commerce and a lot more. And in Human Capital Management, we have an HCM suite made up of human resources, recruiting, training, and so on.
In Enterprise Resource Planning. We are delivering an ERP suite made up of financials, supply chain, manufacturing and all the rest.
Oracle is the first company to market a complete cloud ERP suite from midsize and large enterprises. By pioneering this market, we have become the ERP market leader with over 1,500 cloud ERP customers. Cloud ERP is now our fastest-growing SaaS application suite.
In PaaS, we have differentiated by making it effortless for our hundreds of thousands of customers to move their millions of existing Oracle databases and Java programs to our cloud with a push of a button, thereby obtaining the low cost and ease-of-use of the cloud without having to sacrifice any performance loss or any security degradation.
We now have a highly differentiated, rapidly growing SaaS and PaaS businesses. This coming year, we will deliver a number of innovations in Infrastructure as a Service as well.
We expect that our rapidly growing cloud business will drive Oracle's overall revenue and overall profit growth for years and years to come."

I mean, this is going to be a steep ramp in -- I'm just trying to figure out how much of this is just based simply on this sort of top line growth you're going to see as the sales promotions sort of end and you start to see the top line growth that's going to happen. Or how much of it, if there's any, just due to increased efficiencies as you move along. And then, on the operating margin side, I realize you don't hedge the income statement, but was this due -- like, could it -- like, what would have been the impact on excluding foreign exchange effects?"

As we scale, this is absolutely in the area where it is inevitable that we -- that this improves. In addition, we also have efficiency gains at all times but that is again because of our larger scale and those are simply economies of scale. But the bulk of it is we are starting to be able to recognize revenues for which we have already invested.

Our pipeline, I think, I mentioned this at Financial Analyst Day, as I'm going to mention it again. Our pipeline -- I can't come up with a better analytical statement than just huge. And so our pipeline now is multiple billions of dollars. Let me give you more color. If I look at the next 6 months, our pipeline of things that are in the next 6 months funnel, you have a multibillion-dollar funnel and our conversion rate is increasing. So that would tell you -- and our business has become scaled enough Ross, just to be clear, that it now is behaving like a large business begins to in terms of the scale of the funnel, the pipeline, the discipline we have, the conversion rates we have, et cetera. So that would be sort of my view on that. On PaaS, we have had a change to your point of going away from metered to subscription bookings. So the bookings are now the bulk, as I mentioned, the 75% now subscription as opposed to metered. And I would say the usage of our PaaS has increased not significantly but sort of geometrically, meaning that it's gone from when we originally started the usage to jump up over the last 4 or 6 months, I'd say, to where the usage is extremely high, extremely high in terms of the increase of our usage. So it's very exciting both on the bookings, the type of bookings and the usage that we're seeing of what's booked."

That in SaaS overall, we are just better overall. We have more people, we're well-trained, our products all have matured, and we have a lot of references. Our position in ERP is just unique. We don't have a competitor per se. I used these metrics to -- against Workday just to describe to you how exponentially far ahead of our sort of only person I can think of that's built a product. Just to be clear in ERP SaaS, I don't ever -- I'm not trying -- Safra might have somebody she knows or Larry might know somebody, I don't see SAP. I'm out in the market a lot. I don't see them. So I don't know what they're working on but it's not ERP SaaS. In HCM, I think we are continue to just get better and better and better. I mentioned because I had a blizzard of names that I may have done myself a dis-service by mentioning so many names. But in a couple of days, we actually, replaced Workday. So imagine in a period of time, Workday -- sorry, in HCM, we replaced Workday. So we continue to get better and better and better at HCM, and now we're beginning to see a lot of deals that are where you sell ERP and HCM is attached to the ERP sale. So because of ERP being a, in many ways, a very strategic, very sticky sale, we now see our attach rates moving up and up and up where somebody buys ERP and they buy HCM at the same time. The scale of our Fusion products, well, the reason I gave you that metric for the first time is it's now a very high -- it's now beginning to become a reasonable percent of our total portfolio versus everything that we've got, including marketing, which is having a great run, as you know. But I add to it the fact that now Fusion products, which are extremely sticky are almost 50% of our total bookings. So I mean, I could -- feel I could keep going down these metrics for you, but I think we're unique in ERP and getting farther ahead. I mean, we're in the point now we're over 1,500 customers. We'll give you a prognostication where we end the year but I -- it's going to be well over 2,000. I guess, I just did. It's going be well over 2,000. We're getting better and better at HCM, we're in a leadership position in marketing. I feel good about where we sit."

One is the in-memory aspect of the database, where we now have the fastest in-memory database. And the way you take advantage of that, you take any existing Oracle application and you run it without change on 12 -- 12.2 and it runs much, much -- it runs in-memory without changing. So other people say, we'll use my in-memory database, we have to rewrite the application. In this case, you don't have to rewrite the application. You press the button. We run much faster. And by the way, we run faster than the competition. So we have a lot of our customers want to take advantage of in-memory acceleration, that's one of the reasons they buy the new version of the database. The other thing is multi-tenancy. They like to do a lot of consolidation. They have a lot of small databases. They like to run on one machine. And you can do that much more efficiently by running the Oracle database with multiple tenants. You consume less hardware resources, it's easier to manage, you can back up a whole suite of databases, a group of databases as one. It's thoroughly automated. So that's the other major reason we see a very rapid uptake. And finally, we're seeing our customers, as our PaaS business begins to increase in adoption, that the customer wants to run the latest version of the database in the cloud and they want to match that up with the latest version of the database in their data center. They want to run this basically the same technology both in our cloud and their data center, and that's one of the unique value propositions that we offer our cloud customers. The same exact technology on-premise and in the cloud. And those things will then coexist for years and years to come. Then the customers are syncing up their versions. We have the latest version in the cloud, they want the latest version on-premise. That's also accelerating the adoption of the database on-premise."

So this is actually good news. The strong, in this case, actually get stronger. We actually, now have a material number of references. I think I mentioned but I'm going to try again, we have over now 450 customers-wide. This is a big, big metric. Our market also expands in a couple ways with ERP, which makes it so important. We get 2 increases on our total available market. One is what you mentioned, the fact that we actually get to go downmarket now. And yes, we do have broad market expansion. We get to compete for companies that otherwise would never have had an IT staff, couldn't have had assembled an ERP system, we now get to compete.
