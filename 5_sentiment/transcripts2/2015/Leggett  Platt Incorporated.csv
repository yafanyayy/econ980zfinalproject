Good morning, and thank you for participating on our call. 2014 was a record year, and we're pleased to have ended on a very strong notes. Full year sales from continuing operations grew 9% from a combination of strong organic growth in many of our major businesses and acquisitions. Fourth quarter sales grew 11%, with same-location sales up 6% and acquisitions adding 5%. 
While demand in the majority of our markets improved in 2014, we also benefited from the continued shift in bedding to Comfort Core springs, new adjustable bed programs that ramped up during the year and ongoing content gains and new program awards on Automotive. Importantly, nearly all of our businesses have seen positive sales momentum as we begin 2015. 
Full year adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations were a record $1.78, up 19% versus the adjusted $1.50 we earned in 2013. Full year earnings largely benefited from higher sales. Fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations grew to $0.41, up from the adjusted $0.38 per share in the fourth quarter of the prior year. 
Earnings in the current quarter benefited from sales growth and lower LIFO expense, but this was partially offset by a higher adjusted tax rate and higher-than-expected stock compensation expense that resulted in large part from the significant increase in Leggett share price versus the market since late October. Matt will discuss this further in his comments.
Our adjusted EBIT and EBIT [ph] margin improved for both the fourth quarter and full year, largely due to strong sales growth. We ended the year with adjusted EBIT margin at 10.2%, up 60 basis points over the full year 2013. 
From a reported GAAP earnings perspective, the fourth quarters in both years were impacted by large unusual items. In the fourth quarter of 2014, we recognized an additional $0.21 per share litigation accrual. This charge reduced fourth quarter earnings from continuing operations by $0.09 per share, and earnings from discontinued operations by $0.12 per share. By far, the largest portion of the accrual is for the foam antitrust cases. We believe the accrual is sufficient to resolve all the pending foam antitrust cases. 
In the fourth quarter of 2014, we recognized a $67 million or $0.31 per share noncash charge related to the goodwill and intangible assets of our Commercial Vehicle Products business. 
A major component of our strategy since 2007 has been the optimization of our portfolio of businesses by increasing the investments in businesses that have strong competitive advantage and reducing our exposure to businesses and markets that are less attractive. 
In 2014, we made good progress on both fronts. We acquired 3 Tempur Sealy innerspring plants, invested in machinery to support the significant growth of Comfort Core innersprings, expanded our operations in China to support rapid growth of our Automotive business and acquired a small German-based designer of motion furniture components. 
In early November, we also completed the divestiture of the majority of our Store Fixtures operations, and continued to pursue the sale of the 2 remaining facilities in that business. The divestiture resulted in a $0.03 per share loss that was recognized in discontinued operations during the fourth quarter.
We assessed our overall performance by comparing our total shareholder return to that of peer companies on a rolling 3-year basis. Our target is to achieve TSR in the top 1/3 of the S&P 500 over the long term, which we believe will require an average TSR of 12% to 15% per year. For the 3-year period that ended on December 31, 2014, we generated compound annual TSR of 28% per year, which placed us within the top quarter of the S&P 500. Our stock price increased 38% during the year from about $31 to $43, with much of the increase occurring in the fourth quarter. Assuming dividends are reinvested, 2014 TSR was 43%, which ranks in the top 7% of the S&P 500. 
I'll now turn the call over to Karl, who will provide some additional segment comments."

Most of our businesses continue to perform extremely well on the fourth quarter, and we ended the year very strong. 
In the Residential Furnishings segment, fourth quarter total sales increased 21%, same-location sales increased 12% with each of the major businesses growing. 
Excluding acquisitions, U.S. spring component dollars increased 18%, innerspring unit volume grew 13% with the Comfort Core premium category of 59% during the quarter. Box per unit volume increased 9%. 
Sales grew 4% in International Spring, primarily for market share gains and increased Comfort Core sales in Europe. Excluding acquisitions, furniture components sales increased 8% in the fourth quarter, volume and our Sealy and sofa sleepers business grew 8%, and motion hardware unit volume increased 14%. 
Adjustable bed units grew 127% in the quarter from a combination of new programs and strength in ongoing customer programs. Sales also increased meaningfully in fabric converting, geo components and carpet underlay. 
Fourth quarter segment EBIT was negatively impacted by a $22 million litigation accrual. Excluding this charge, adjusted EBIT increased, and EBIT margin was essentially flat with fourth quarter of 2013. The benefit from higher sales during the quarter was partially offset by increased stock compensation expense of $10 million.
Full-year total sales in the segment grew 13%, with same-location sales up 9%. Adjusted EBIT for the year increased 27%, and adjusted EBIT margins improved 110 basis points versus 2013, and in 2014 at 9.7%.
In the Commercial Fixturing & Components segment, same-location sales increased 15% in the fourth quarter. Sales grew in the quarter from the improved market demand in our Work Furniture business, EBIT increased slightly with a benefit from higher sales, largely offset by higher stock compensation expense. 
For the full year, total sales in the segment grew 7%. EBIT for the year increased 21%, and EBIT margin improved. 
Segment margins continued to be below our target level due to a number of factors, including underutilized capacity and operational challenges with the Chinese joint venture. 
With industry demands still depressed from lower business and government spending, our plants continue to operate well below optimal utilization levels. While cost reductions have been implemented over the past few years, we are working to identify more opportunities to improve efficiency. In addition, our business development activities are focused on identifying opportunities to improve our sales mix through higher valued products. 
In the Industrial Materials segment, fourth quarter same-location sales increased 5%, primarily from higher unit volume within our wire operations that was largely driven by strong bedding demand. EBIT and EBIT margin increased with the benefit from higher sales in other smaller factors, partially offset by higher stock compensation expense of $3 million. 
Full year total sales in the segment increased 3%, primarily from acquisitions. Same-location sales were down slightly. EBIT and EBIT margins for the year decreased primarily from reduced metal margins and weather-related costs and the inefficiencies early in the year. 
In the Specialized Products segment, same-location sales grew 5% in the fourth quarter. Automotive sales increased 13% versus a strong fourth quarter of 2013 from a combination of expanded content, participation in new vehicle platforms and demand strength in North America and Asia. This growth was partially offset by an 18% sales decrease in Commercial Vehicle Products. 
Machinery sales were essentially flat during the quarter. The segment's EBIT and EBIT margin increased versus 2013, primarily due to the nonrecurrence of last year's CVP impairment charge. Operationally, EBIT and EBIT margin increased in the current quarter, with a benefit from higher sales, partially offset by higher stock compensation expense of $4 million. 
For the full year, total sales in this segment grew 9%. Adjusted EBIT for the year increased 26% and adjusted EBIT margins improved 180 basis points versus 2013, ending 2014 at 13.6%. 
I'll now turn the call back over to Matt, who will discuss some of the additional financial details, along with our outlook for 2015."
30760,282217042,752253,"Leggett & Platt, Incorporated, Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Jan 30, 2015",2015-01-30,"Earnings Calls","Leggett & Platt, Incorporated","Executives","Thanks, Karl, and good morning, everyone. While as you have already heard, fourth quarter earnings were impacted by an unusually high accrual was related to our stock-based incentive compensation plans, which in total, represented $18 million [ph] or $0.0",863,"Thanks, Karl, and good morning, everyone. While as you have already heard, fourth quarter earnings were impacted by an unusually high accrual was related to our stock-based incentive compensation plans, which in total, represented $18 million [ph] or $0.08 per share. Approximately 2/3 of this cost was due to the significant increase in our relative TSR performance late in the year, and our share price increased from approximately $35 to $43 during the fourth quarter. The remainder of the higher cost was driven by recent strong growth in operating margin improvement in many of our businesses. 
In accordance with GAAP, we record our incentive compensation accruals each quarter to reflect the related performance metrics. For the TSR-based incentive plan, we measure our TSR performance over 3-year period compared to a 320 member peer group. For the 3-year measurement period that ended in 2014, our relative TSR through the end of September was at roughly the midpoint of the peer group. As a result, we had accrued for 2 and 3 quarter years, assuming an estimated payout of approximately 71% of the incentive targets. 
Our fourth quarter increase in share price and relative TSR moved us into the top third of the peer group and caused the payout percentage to more than double. Consequently, all of the incremental cost for the entire 3-year period occurred and was duly recognized in the fourth quarter. A significant adjustment was also required for the 3-year period that will conclude in 2015. At the end of December, we were delivering top third TSR performance for that measurement period as well. 
In 2014, our stock compensation expense for all programs totaled $48 million.  Nearly half of which was recognized in the fourth quarter. Our forecast for 2015 anticipates total cost of approximately $44 million at the current share price, and assuming our relative TSR does not change. If our TSR moves into a lower performance level in relation to the peer group, then we will reduce our accruals for open measurement periods to reflect the corresponding lower payout estimates. 
Now on to a few other topics. Operating cash flow was, once again, seasonally strong in the fourth quarter at $166 million. For the full year, we generated operating cash of $382 million. We ended the year with working capital at an unusually low 7.9% of annualized sales. The third and fourth quarter litigation accruals caused a sizable increase in current liabilities by year-end. 
Excluding this accrual, working capital was 10.3% of annualized sales. In November, we declared a quarterly dividend of $0.31 per share, and 2014 marked our 43rd consecutive annual dividend increase at a compound annual growth rate of 13%. At yesterday's closing price of $45.7, our current yield is 2.8%, which is one of the highest dividend yields among the 54 companies that comprise the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats. 
We repurchased 700,000 shares of our stock in the fourth quarter at an average price of $41.14, and issued 1 million shares, largely for employee option exercises. 
For the year, we purchased 5.4 million shares at an average price of $33.76, and issued 3.9 million shares. 
Our financial base remains valid strong, and this gives us considerable flexibility when making capital and investment decision. We ended the year with net debt to net capital of 31.5%, which is comfortably within our long-standing targeted range of 30% to 40%. 
In 2015, we again expect strong sales growth, which should lead to another year of record earnings per share from continuing operations. As we announced yesterday, we expect 2015 earnings from continuing operations to be between $1.90 and $2.10 per share. With improving demand, market share gains and recent acquisitions, sales from continuing operations are expected to be $3.9 billion to 4.1 billion. This range represents a 3% to 8% increase, which is our $3.78 billion of sales from continuing operations in 2014. 
Based upon this guidance range, we currently expect a full-year EBIT margin between 10.7% and 11.2%. We expect to again generate operating cash flow of approximately $350 million in 2015. Dividends should required about $170 million of cash and capital expenditures should approximate $120 million for the year. 
We continue to make investments to support growth in business and product lines where sales are strong and for efficiency improvement and maintenance. Our incentive plans emphasize returns on capital, which include net fixed assets and working capital. This emphasis, we believe, helps ensure that we're efficiently utilizing our asset base and investing capital dollars where the highest term potential exist. 
Consistent with our stated priorities for the use of excess cash flow, we will prudently buyback our stock, bear in mind our level of cash generation, other potential opportunities to strategically global company and the overall outlook for the general economy. We have outstanding authorization from the board to repurchase up the 10 million shares issued year. However, no specific repurchase commitments or timetable has been established. We current expect to issue between 2 million and 3 million shares in 2015, primarily from employee stock option exercises, and repurchase an amount that least offset the shares issued. 
With those comments, I'll turn it back over to Dave Haffner."

Scrap is a little bit of a challenge for us, and our outlook has changed pretty dramatically in the last 30 days. This crap traded up about $5 from December to early January. And now, the expectation for February crap prices is down about $30 a ton, which ballparks 10%. Whta's driving that forecasted scrap deflation is significant availability of U.S. scrap. Iron ore cost that are falling pretty dramatically around the world and then currency exchange rates. The impact of that is probably more -- will be more significant on the flat products because of the availability of both Russian and Chinese flat steel products. Again, scraps driving that currency exchange issues also enter into the flat steel products. From a wire rod perspective, there's less availability of high carbon rod around the world that's of quality enough to utilize in our products or our customer's or competitor's products. The low carbon is somewhat protected now because of commerce's finding the guilt of antidumping claims by the U.S. wire rod producers, specifically low carbon. They've labeled levied duties effective mid-December of between 100% and 200%, depending on the importer of those products. But rod will probably deflate some because of the co-relation to scrap.  Now the impact on Leggett is there maybe, depending on how scrap actually does trade, some pricing pressure on some of other products, there'll probably be a lag of 30 to 60 -- really, 60 to 90 days, which will pressure selling prices, pressure margin dollars, but actually should have a positive impact on margin percentage. And for those of you that are trying to quarterize our guidance, this is probably a bit of a headwind to the first quarter because we, again, if crap falls off, we will have revalue our rod, our wire inventories and our flat product inventories so that evaluation will be a headwind to our EBIT and the respective benefit or the LIFO benefit based on GAAP accounting, we won't book that benefit and tell each one of the quarter's end based on a year end 2015 forecast. So the pain is upfront, the remedy is spread equally amongst the remaining quarters of the year."

But as the year progress, we saw those unit volumes continue to expand. And by the end of the year, again, we were at the run rate that was extremely high.

Working capital is a key piece, so what does move around based upon was happening in those various categories, and operations has done a superb job in the last several years of freeing up a lot of capital in that regard. As you heard, if you adjust for the year-end accruals relative to the litigation, we were trending at about a 10% working capital level of investments. You would anticipate that that would be about the level of investment this coming year as sales continue to grow, which, therefore, means we would use some cash in working capital at that sort of gearing in 2015. And then specifically relative to the accruals that we have taken on the litigation, we would then anticipate that most of that activity will take place in 2015, but of course, that's , once again, is hard to predict.

Full year sales from continuing operations grew 9% from a combination of strong organic growth in many of our major businesses and acquisitions. Fourth quarter sales grew 11%, with same-location sales up 6% and acquisitions adding 5%. 
While demand in the majority of our markets improved in 2014, we also benefited from the continued shift in bedding to Comfort Core springs, new adjustable bed programs that ramped up during the year and ongoing content gains and new program awards on Automotive. Importantly, nearly all of our businesses are seeing positive sales momentum as we begin 2015. 
Full year adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations were a record $1.78, up 19% versus the adjusted $1.50, we earned in 2013. Full year earnings largely benefited from higher sales. Fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations grew to $0.41, up from an adjusted $0.38 per share in the fourth quarter of the prior year. 
Earnings in the current quarter benefited from sales growth and lower LIFO expense, but this was partially offset by a higher adjusted tax rate and higher-than-expected stock compensation expense that resulted in large part from the significant increase in Leggett share price versus the market since late October. Matt will discuss this further in his comments.
Our adjusted EBIT and EBIT margin improved for both the fourth quarter and full year, largely due to strong sales growth. We ended the year with adjusted EBIT margin at 10.2%, up 60 basis points over the full year 2013. 
From a reported GAAP earnings perspective, the fourth quarters in both years were impacted by large unusual items. In the fourth quarter of 2014, we recognized an additional $0.21 per share litigation accrual. This charge reduced fourth quarter earnings from continuing operations by $0.09 per share, and earnings from discontinued operations by $0.12 per share. By far, the largest portion of the accrual is for the Foam Antitrust cases. We believe the accrual is sufficient to resolve all the pending Foam Antitrust cases. 
In the fourth quarter of 2013, we recognized a $67 million or $0.31 per share noncash charge, related to the goodwill and intangible assets of our Commercial Vehicle Products business. 
A major component of our strategy since 2007 has been the optimization of our portfolio of businesses by increasing investments in businesses that possess strong competitive advantage and reducing our exposure to businesses and markets that are less attractive. 
In 2014, we made good progress on both fronts. We acquired 3 Tempur Sealy innerspring plants, invested in machinery to support the significant growth of Comfort Core innersprings, expanded our operations in China to support rapid growth of our Automotive business and acquired a small German-based designer of motion furniture components. 
In early November, we also completed the divestiture of the majority of our Store Fixtures operations, and continued to pursue the sale of the 2 remaining facilities in that business. The divestiture resulted in a $0.03 per share loss, that was recognized in discontinued operations, during the fourth quarter.
We assess our overall performance by comparing our total shareholder return to that of peer companies on a rolling 3-year basis. Our target is to achieve TSR in the top 1/3 of the S&P 500, over the long term, which we believe will require an average TSR of 12% to 15% per year. For the 3-year period that ended on December 31, 2014, we generated compound annual TSR of 28% per year, which placed us within the top quarter of the S&P 500. Our stock price increased 38% during the year from about $31 to $43, with much of the increase occurring in the fourth quarter. Assuming dividends are reinvested, 2014 TSR was 43%, which ranks in the top 7% of the S&P 500. 
I'll now turn the call over to Karl, who will provide some additional segment comments."

In the Residential Furnishings segment, fourth quarter total sales increased 21%. Same-location sales increased 12%, with each of the major businesses growing. 
Excluding acquisitions, U.S. Spring component dollars increased 18%. Innerspring unit volume grew 13%, with the Comfort Core premium category up 59% during the quarter. Boxspring unit volume increased 9%. 
Sales grew 4% in International Spring, primarily from market share gains and increased Comfort Core sales in Europe. Excluding acquisitions, furniture components sales increased 8% in the fourth quarter. Volume in our seating and sofa sleeper businesses grew 8%, and motion hardware unit volume increased 14%. 
Adjustable Bed units grew 127% in the quarter from a combination of new programs and strength in ongoing customer programs. Sales also increased meaningfully in fabric converting, geo components and carpet underlay. 
Fourth quarter segment EBIT was negatively impacted by a $22 million litigation accrual. Excluding this charge, adjusted EBIT increased, and EBIT margin was essentially flat with fourth quarter of 2013. The benefit from higher sales during the quarter was partially offset by increased stock compensation expense of $10 million.
Full-year total sales in the segment grew 13%, with same-location sales up 9%. Adjusted EBIT for the year increased 27%, and adjusted EBIT margins improved 110 basis points versus 2013, ending 2014 at 9.7%.
In the Commercial Fixturing & Components segment, same-location sales increased 15% in the fourth quarter. Sales grew in the quarter from improved market demand in our Work Furniture business. EBIT increased slightly with the benefit from higher sales, largely offset by higher stock compensation expense. 
For the full year, total sales in the segment grew 7%. EBIT for the year increased 21%, and EBIT margin improved. 
Segment margins continued to be below our target level due to a number of factors, including underutilized capacity and operational challenges with a Chinese joint venture. 
With industry demands still depressed from lower business and government spending, our plants continue to operate well below optimal utilization levels. While cost reductions have been implemented over the past few years, we are working to identify more opportunities to improve efficiency. In addition, our business development activities are focused on identifying opportunities to improve our sales mix through higher-valued products. 
In the Industrial Materials segment, fourth quarter same-location sales increased 5%, primarily from higher unit volume, within our wire operations, that was largely driven by strong bedding demand. EBIT and EBIT margin increased with the benefit from higher sales in other smaller factors, partially offset by higher stock compensation expense of $3 million. 
Full year total sales in the segment increased 3%, primarily from acquisitions. Same-location sales were down slightly. EBIT and EBIT margins for the year decreased, primarily from reduced metal margins and weather-related costs and inefficiencies, early in the year. 
In the Specialized Products segment, same-location sales grew 5% in the fourth quarter. Automotive sales increased 13% versus a strong fourth quarter of 2013, from a combination of expanded content, participation in new vehicle platforms and demand strength in North America and Asia. This growth was partially offset by an 18% sales decrease in Commercial Vehicle Products. 
Machinery sales were essentially flat during the quarter. The segment's EBIT and EBIT margin increased versus 2013, primarily due to the nonrecurrence of last year's CVP impairment charge. Operationally, EBIT and EBIT margin increased in the second quarter -- in the current quarter, with a benefit from higher sales, partially offset by higher stock compensation expense of $4 million. 
For the full year, total sales in this segment grew 9%. Adjusted EBIT for the year increased 26% and adjusted EBIT margins improved 180 basis points versus 2013, ending 2014 at 13.6%. 
I'll now turn the call, back over to Matt, who will discuss some of the additional financial details, along with our outlook for 2015."
30760,282217042,752584,"Leggett & Platt, Incorporated, Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Jan 30, 2015",2015-01-30,"Earnings Calls","Leggett & Platt, Incorporated","Executives","Thanks, Karl, and good morning, everyone. While as you have already heard, fourth quarter earnings were impacted by an unusually high accrual, related to our stock-based incentive compensation plans, which in total, represented $80 million or $0.08 per sh",865,"Thanks, Karl, and good morning, everyone. While as you have already heard, fourth quarter earnings were impacted by an unusually high accrual, related to our stock-based incentive compensation plans, which in total, represented $80 million or $0.08 per share. Approximately 2/3 of this cost was due to the significant increase in our relative TSR performance, late in the year, as our share price increased from approximately $35 to $43 during the fourth quarter. The remainder of the higher cost was driven by recent strong growth in operating margin improvement in many of our businesses. 
In accordance with GAAP, we report our incentive compensation accruals each quarter to reflect the related performance metrics. For the TSR-based incentive plan, we measure our TSR performance over 3-year period compared to a 320-member peer group. For the 3-year measurement period that ended in 2014, our relative TSR through the end of September was at roughly the midpoint of the peer group. As a result, we had accrued for our 2 and 3 quarter years, assuming an estimated payout of approximately 71% of the incentive target. 
Our fourth quarter increase in share price and relative TSR, moved us into the top third of the peer group and caused the payout percentage to more than double. Consequently, all of the incremental costs for the entire 3-year period occurred and was duly recognized in the fourth quarter. A significant adjustment was also required for the 3-year period that will conclude in 2015. At the end of December, we were delivering top third TSR performance for that measurement period as well. 
In 2014, our stock compensation expense for all programs totaled $48 million.  Nearly, half of which was recognized in the fourth quarter. Our forecast for 2015 anticipates total cost of approximately $44 million at the current share price, and assuming our relative TSR does not change. If our TSR moves into a lower performance level in relation to the peer group, then we will reduce our accruals for open measurement periods to reflect the corresponding lower payout estimates. 
Now on to a few other topics. Operating cash flow was, once again, seasonally strong in the fourth quarter at $166 million. For the full year, we generated operating cash of $382 million. We ended the year with working capital at an unusually low 7.9% of annualized sales. The third and fourth quarter litigation accruals caused a sizable increase in current liabilities by year end. 
Excluding this accrual, working capital was 10.3% of annualized sales. In November, we declared a quarterly dividend of $0.31 per share, and 2014 marked our 43rd consecutive annual dividend increase at a compound annual growth rate of 13%. At yesterday's closing price of $45.07, our current yield is 2.8%, which is one of the highest dividend yields among the 54 companies that comprise the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats. 
We repurchased 700,000 shares of our stock in the fourth quarter at an average price of $41.14, and issued 1 million shares, largely for employee option exercises. 
For the year, we purchased 5.4 million shares at an average price of $33.76, and issued 3.9 million shares. 
Our financial base remains very strong, and this gives us considerable flexibility when making capital and investment decisions. We ended the year with net debt to net capital at 31.5%, which is comfortably within our long-standing targeted range of 30% to 40%. 
In 2015, we again expect strong sales growth, which should lead to another year of record earnings per share from continuing operations. As we announced yesterday, we expect 2015 earnings from continuing operations to be between $1.90 and $2.10 per share. With improving demand, market share gains and recent acquisitions, sales from continuing operations are expected to be $3.9 billion to $4.1 billion. This range represents a 3% to 8% increase versus our $3.78 billion of sales from continuing operations in 2014. 
Based upon this guidance range, we currently expect a full year EBIT margin between 10.7% and 11.2%. We expect to again, generate operating cash flow of approximately $350 million in 2015. Dividends should require about $170 million of cash, and capital expenditures should approximate $120 million for the year. 
We continue to make investments to support growth in business and product lines, where sales are strong, and for efficiency improvement in maintenance. Our incentive plans emphasize returns on capital, which include net fixed assets and working capital. This emphasis, we believe, helps ensure that we're efficiently utilizing our asset base and investing capital dollars, where the highest term potential exist. 
Consistent with our stated priorities for the use of excess cash flow, we will prudently buyback our stock, bearing in mind our level of cash generation, other potential opportunities to strategically grow the company and the overall outlook for the general economy. We have a standing authorization from the board to repurchase up the 10 million shares each year. However, no specific repurchase commitment or timetable has been established. We currently expect to issue between 2 million and 3 million shares in 2015, primarily from employee stock option exercises, and repurchase an amount that at least offsets the shares issued. 
With those comments, I'll turn it back over to Dave Haffner."

Scrap is a little bit of a challenge for us, and our outlook has changed pretty dramatically in the last 30 days. The scrap traded up about $5 from December to early January. And now, the expectation for February scrap prices is down about $30 a ton, which ballparks 10%. What's driving that forecasted scrap deflation is significant availability of U.S. scrap. Iron ore cost that are falling pretty dramatically around the world and then currency exchange rates. The impact of that is probably more -- will be more significant on the flat products because of availability of both Russian and Chinese flat steel products. Again, scrap is driving that currency exchange issues also enter into the flat steel products. From a rod -- from a wire rod perspective, there is less availability of high carbon rod around the world that's of quality enough to utilize in our products, or our customers or competitors products. The low carbon is somewhat protected now because of commerce's finding of guilt of antidumping claims by the U.S. wire rod producers, specifically low carbon. They've levied duties effective mid-December of between 100% and 200%, depending on the importer of those products. But rod will probably deflate some because of the co-relation to scrap.  Now the impact on Leggett is there maybe, depending on how scrap actually does trade, some pricing pressure on some of our products, there'll probably be a lag of 30 to 60 -- really, 60 to 90 days, which will pressure selling prices, pressure margin dollars, but actually should have a positive impact on margin percentage. And for those of you that are trying to quarterize our guidance, this is probably a bit of a headwind to the first quarter because we, again, if scrap falls off, we will have to revalue our rod, our wire inventories and our flat product inventories, so that revaluation will be a headwind to our EBIT and the respective benefit or the LIFO benefit, based on GAAP accounting, we won't book that benefit and tell each one of the quarters end, based on a year end 2015 forecast. So the pain is upfront, the remedy is spread equally amongst the remaining quarters of the year."

If you take the midpoint of our guidance for a net earnings contribution, that's a pretty straightforward number, something in the neighborhood of $280 million, if you assume we have 140 million shares out. Our D&A this coming year should be about $120 million. The working capital is a key piece, so what does move around based upon what's happening in those various categories, and operations has done a superb job in the last several years of freeing up a lot of capital in that regard. As you heard, would you adjust for the year end accruals, relative to the litigation? We were trending at about a 10% working capital level of investment. We would anticipate that, that would be about the level of investment this coming year as sales continue to grow, which, therefore, means we would use some cash in working capital at that sort of gearing in 2015. And then specifically relative to the accruals that we have taken on the litigation, we would anticipate that most of that activity would take place in 2015, but of course, that, once again, is hard to predict. If you store all that together, and we continue to feel very good that about $350 million, with a hope to do better than that, should be the working operating cash flow assumptions you should have in your models."

As it relates to currency that from a transactional perspective, we do a pretty darn good job of matching manufacturing and manufacturing cost in the geography of consumption, and then augment that by a pretty rigorous hedging program. Our finance folks, operations forks work really well together to adequately hedge ourselves. From a translational perspective, we did an analysis just the other day on currency exchange rates that are current. So just 2 days ago. The impact on Automotive, which is our most internationally diverse business, is about $25 million in topline and about $2.5 million here from an EBIT perspective. If you multiply that by 2, it's probably too aggressive for the rest of the company just because of auto being, like I said, the most geographically dispersed.

Full year sales from continuing operations grew 9% from a combination of strong organic growth in many of our major b",667,"Good morning, and thank you for participating in our call. 2014 was a record year, and we're pleased to have ended on a very strong note. Full year sales from continuing operations grew 9% from a combination of strong organic growth in many of our major businesses and acquisitions. Fourth quarter sales grew 11%, with same-location sales up 6% and acquisitions adding 5%. 
While demand in the majority of our markets improved in 2014, we also benefited from the continued shift in bedding to Comfort Core springs, new adjustable bed programs that ramped up during the year and ongoing content gains and new program awards on Automotive. Importantly, nearly all of our businesses are seeing positive sales momentum as we begin 2015. 
Full year adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations were a record $1.78, up 19% versus the adjusted $1.50, we earned in 2013. Full year earnings largely benefited from higher sales. Fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations grew to $0.41, up from an adjusted $0.38 per share in the fourth quarter of the prior year. 
Earnings in the current quarter benefited from sales growth and lower LIFO expense, but this was partially offset by a higher adjusted tax rate and higher-than-expected stock compensation expense that resulted in large part from the significant increase in Leggett share price versus the market since late October. Matt will discuss this further in his comments.
Our adjusted EBIT and EBIT margin improved for both the fourth quarter and full year, largely due to strong sales growth. We ended the year with adjusted EBIT margin at 10.2%, up 60 basis points over the full year 2013. 
From a reported GAAP earnings perspective, the fourth quarters in both years were impacted by large unusual items. In the fourth quarter of 2014, we recognized an additional $0.21 per share litigation accrual. This charge reduced fourth quarter earnings from continuing operations by $0.09 per share, and earnings from discontinued operations by $0.12 per share. By far, the largest portion of the accrual is for the Foam Antitrust cases. We believe the accrual is sufficient to resolve all the pending Foam Antitrust cases. 
In the fourth quarter of 2013, we recognized a $67 million or $0.31 per share noncash charge, related to the goodwill and intangible assets of our Commercial Vehicle Products business. 
A major component of our strategy since 2007 has been the optimization of our portfolio of businesses by increasing investments in businesses that possess strong competitive advantage and reducing our exposure to businesses and markets that are less attractive. 
In 2014, we made good progress on both fronts. We acquired 3 Tempur Sealy innerspring plants, invested in machinery to support the significant growth of Comfort Core innersprings, expanded our operations in China to support rapid growth of our Automotive business and acquired a small German-based designer of motion furniture components. 
In early November, we also completed the divestiture of the majority of our Store Fixtures operations, and continued to pursue the sale of the 2 remaining facilities in that business. The divestiture resulted in a $0.03 per share loss that was recognized in discontinued operations, during the fourth quarter.
We assess our overall performance by comparing our total shareholder return to that of peer companies on a rolling 3-year basis. Our target is to achieve TSR in the top 1/3 of the S&P 500, over the long term, which we believe will require an average TSR of 12% to 15% per year. For the 3-year period that ended on December 31, 2014, we generated compound annual TSR of 28% per year, which placed us within the top quarter of the S&P 500. Our stock price increased 38% during the year from about $31 to $43, with much of the increase occurring in the fourth quarter. Assuming dividends are reinvested, 2014 TSR was 43%, which ranks in the top 7% of the S&P 500. 
I'll now turn the call over to Karl, who will provide some additional segment comments."

In the Residential Furnishings segment, fourth quarter total sales increased 21%. Same-location sales increased 12%, with each of the major businesses growing. 
Excluding acquisitions, U.S. Spring component dollars increased 18%. Innerspring unit volume grew 13%, with the Comfort Core premium category up 59% during the quarter. Boxspring unit volume increased 9%. 
Sales grew 4% in International Spring, primarily from market share gains and increased Comfort Core sales in Europe. Excluding acquisitions, furniture components sales increased 8% in the fourth quarter. Volume in our seating and sofa sleeper businesses grew 8%, and motion hardware unit volume increased 14%. 
Adjustable Bed units grew 127% in the quarter from a combination of new programs and strength in ongoing customer programs. Sales also increased meaningfully in fabric converting, geo components and carpet underlay. 
Fourth quarter segment EBIT was negatively impacted by a $22 million litigation accrual. Excluding this charge, adjusted EBIT increased, and EBIT margin was essentially flat with fourth quarter of 2013. The benefit from higher sales during the quarter was partially offset by increased stock compensation expense of $10 million.
Full-year total sales in the segment grew 13%, with same-location sales up 9%. Adjusted EBIT for the year increased 27%, and adjusted EBIT margins improved 110 basis points versus 2013, ending 2014 at 9.7%.
In the Commercial Fixturing & Components segment, same-location sales increased 15% in the fourth quarter. Sales grew in the quarter from improved market demand in our Work Furniture business. EBIT increased slightly with the benefit from higher sales, largely offset by higher stock compensation expense. 
For the full year, total sales in the segment grew 7%. EBIT for the year increased 21%, and EBIT margin improved. 
Segment margins continued to be below our target level due to a number of factors, including underutilized capacity and operational challenges with a Chinese joint venture. 
With industry demands still depressed from lower business and government spending, our plants continue to operate well below optimal utilization levels. While cost reductions have been implemented over the past few years, we are working to identify more opportunities to improve efficiency. In addition, our business development activities are focused on identifying opportunities to improve our sales mix through higher-valued products. 
In the Industrial Materials segment, fourth quarter same-location sales increased 5%, primarily from higher unit volume, within our wire operations, that was largely driven by strong bedding demand. EBIT and EBIT margin increased with the benefit from higher sales in other smaller factors, partially offset by higher stock compensation expense of $3 million. 
Full year total sales in the segment increased 3%, primarily from acquisitions. Same-location sales were down slightly. EBIT and EBIT margins for the year decreased, primarily from reduced metal margins and weather-related costs and inefficiencies, early in the year. 
In the Specialized Products segment, same-location sales grew 5% in the fourth quarter. Automotive sales increased 13% versus a strong fourth quarter of 2013, from a combination of expanded content, participation in new vehicle platforms and demand strength in North America and Asia. This growth was partially offset by an 18% sales decrease in Commercial Vehicle Products. 
Machinery sales were essentially flat during the quarter. The segment's EBIT and EBIT margin increased versus 2013, primarily due to the nonrecurrence of last year's CVP impairment charge. Operationally, EBIT and EBIT margin increased in the second quarter -- in the current quarter, with a benefit from higher sales, partially offset by higher stock compensation expense of $4 million. 
For the full year, total sales in this segment grew 9%. Adjusted EBIT for the year increased 26% and adjusted EBIT margins improved 180 basis points versus 2013, ending 2014 at 13.6%. 
I'll now turn the call, back over to Matt, who will discuss some of the additional financial details, along with our outlook for 2015."
30760,282217042,752650,"Leggett & Platt, Incorporated, Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Jan 30, 2015",2015-01-30,"Earnings Calls","Leggett & Platt, Incorporated","Executives","Thanks, Karl, and good morning, everyone. While as you have already heard, fourth quarter earnings were impacted by an unusually high accrual, related to our stock-based incentive compensation plans, which in total, represented $80 million or $0.08 per sh",865,"Thanks, Karl, and good morning, everyone. While as you have already heard, fourth quarter earnings were impacted by an unusually high accrual, related to our stock-based incentive compensation plans, which in total, represented $80 million or $0.08 per share. Approximately 2/3 of this cost was due to the significant increase in our relative TSR performance, late in the year, as our share price increased from approximately $35 to $43 during the fourth quarter. The remainder of the higher cost was driven by recent strong growth in operating margin improvement in many of our businesses. 
In accordance with GAAP, we report our incentive compensation accruals each quarter to reflect the related performance metrics. For the TSR-based incentive plan, we measure our TSR performance over 3-year period compared to a 320-member peer group. For the 3-year measurement period that ended in 2014, our relative TSR through the end of September was at roughly the midpoint of the peer group. As a result, we had accrued for our 2 and 3 quarter years, assuming an estimated payout of approximately 71% of the incentive target. 
Our fourth quarter increase in share price and relative TSR, moved us into the top third of the peer group and caused the payout percentage to more than double. Consequently, all of the incremental costs for the entire 3-year period occurred and was duly recognized in the fourth quarter. A significant adjustment was also required for the 3-year period that will conclude in 2015. At the end of December, we were delivering top third TSR performance for that measurement period as well. 
In 2014, our stock compensation expense for all programs totaled $48 million.  Nearly, half of which was recognized in the fourth quarter. Our forecast for 2015 anticipates total cost of approximately $44 million at the current share price, and assuming our relative TSR does not change. If our TSR moves into a lower performance level in relation to the peer group, then we will reduce our accruals for open measurement periods to reflect the corresponding lower payout estimates. 
Now on to a few other topics. Operating cash flow was, once again, seasonally strong in the fourth quarter at $166 million. For the full year, we generated operating cash of $382 million. We ended the year with working capital at an unusually low 7.9% of annualized sales. The third and fourth quarter litigation accruals caused a sizable increase in current liabilities by year end. 
Excluding this accrual, working capital was 10.3% of annualized sales. In November, we declared a quarterly dividend of $0.31 per share, and 2014 marked our 43rd consecutive annual dividend increase at a compound annual growth rate of 13%. At yesterday's closing price of $45.07, our current yield is 2.8%, which is one of the highest dividend yields among the 54 companies that comprise the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats. 
We repurchased 700,000 shares of our stock in the fourth quarter at an average price of $41.14, and issued 1 million shares, largely for employee option exercises. 
For the year, we purchased 5.4 million shares at an average price of $33.76, and issued 3.9 million shares. 
Our financial base remains very strong, and this gives us considerable flexibility when making capital and investment decisions. We ended the year with net debt to net capital at 31.5%, which is comfortably within our long-standing targeted range of 30% to 40%. 
In 2015, we again expect strong sales growth, which should lead to another year of record earnings per share from continuing operations. As we announced yesterday, we expect 2015 earnings from continuing operations to be between $1.90 and $2.10 per share. With improving demand, market share gains and recent acquisitions, sales from continuing operations are expected to be $3.9 billion to $4.1 billion. This range represents a 3% to 8% increase versus our $3.78 billion of sales from continuing operations in 2014. 
Based upon this guidance range, we currently expect a full year EBIT margin between 10.7% and 11.2%. We expect to again, generate operating cash flow of approximately $350 million in 2015. Dividends should require about $170 million of cash, and capital expenditures should approximate $120 million for the year. 
We continue to make investments to support growth in business and product lines, where sales are strong, and for efficiency improvement in maintenance. Our incentive plans emphasize returns on capital, which include net fixed assets and working capital. This emphasis, we believe, helps ensure that we're efficiently utilizing our asset base and investing capital dollars, where the highest term potential exists. 
Consistent with our stated priorities for the use of excess cash flow, we will prudently buyback our stock, bearing in mind our level of cash generation, other potential opportunities to strategically grow the company and the overall outlook for the general economy. We have a standing authorization from the board to repurchase up the 10 million shares each year. However, no specific repurchase commitment or timetable has been established. We currently expect to issue between 2 million and 3 million shares in 2015, primarily from employee stock option exercises, and repurchase an amount that at least offsets the shares issued. 
With those comments, I'll turn it back over to Dave Haffner."

Scrap is a little bit of a challenge for us, and our outlook has changed pretty dramatically in the last 30 days. The scrap traded up about $5 from December to early January. And now, the expectation for February scrap prices is down about $30 a ton, which ballparks 10%. What's driving that forecasted scrap deflation is significant availability of U.S. scrap. Iron ore costs that are falling pretty dramatically around the world and then currency exchange rates. The impact of that is probably more -- will be more significant on the flat products because of availability of both Russian and Chinese flat steel products. Again, scrap is driving that currency exchange issues also enter into the flat steel products. From a rod -- from a wire rod perspective, there is less availability of high carbon rod around the world that's of quality enough to utilize in our products, or our customers or competitors products. The low carbon is somewhat protected now because of commerce's finding of guilt of antidumping claims by the U.S. wire rod producers, specifically low carbon. They've levied duties effective mid-December of between 100% and 200%, depending on the importer of those products. But rod will probably deflate some because of the correlation to scrap.  Now the impact on Leggett is there maybe, depending on how scrap actually does trade, some pricing pressure on some of our products, there'll probably be a lag of 30 to 60 -- really, 60 to 90 days, which will pressure selling prices, pressure margin dollars, but actually should have a positive impact on margin percentage. And for those of you that are trying to quarterize our guidance, this is probably a bit of a headwind to the first quarter because we, again, if scrap falls off, we will have to revalue our rod or bill it, our wire inventories and our flat product inventories, so that revaluation will be a headwind to our EBIT and the respective benefit or the LIFO benefit, based on GAAP accounting, we won't book that benefit until each one of the quarters end, based on a year end 2015 forecast. So the pain is upfront, the remedy is spread equally amongst the remaining quarters of the year."

The working capital is a key piece, so what does move around based upon what's happening in those various categories, and operations has done a superb job in the last several years of freeing up a lot of capital in that regard. As you heard, would you adjust for the year end accruals, relative to the litigation? We were trending at about a 10% working capital level of investment. We would anticipate that, that would be about the level of investment this coming year as sales continue to grow, which, therefore, means we would use some cash in working capital at that sort of gearing in 2015. And then specifically relative to the accruals that we have taken on the litigation, we would anticipate that most of that activity would take place in 2015, but of course, that, once again, is hard to predict. You stir all that together, and we continue to feel very good that about $350 million, with a hope to do better than that, should be the working operating cash flow assumptions you should have in your models."

As it relates to currency that from a transactional perspective, we do a pretty darn good job of matching manufacturing and manufacturing cost in the geography of consumption, and then augment that by a pretty rigorous hedging program. Our finance folks, operations folks work really well together to adequately hedge ourselves. From a translational perspective, we did an analysis just the other day on currency exchange rates that are current. So just 2 days ago. The impact on Automotive, which is our most internationally diverse business, is about $25 million in topline and about $2.5 million here from an EBIT perspective. If you multiply that by 2, it's probably too aggressive for the rest of the company just because of auto being, like I said, the most geographically dispersed.

Full year sales from continuing operations grew 9% from a combination of strong organic growth in many of our major businesses and acquisitions. Fourth quarter sales grew 11%, with same-location sales up 6% and acquisitions adding 5%. 
While demand in the majority of our markets improved in 2014, we also benefited from the continued shift in bedding to Comfort Core springs, new adjustable bed programs that ramped up during the year and ongoing content gains and new program awards on Automotive. Importantly, nearly all of our businesses are seeing positive sales momentum as we begin 2015. 
Full year adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations were a record $1.78, up 19% versus the adjusted $1.50, we earned in 2013. Full year earnings largely benefited from higher sales. Fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations grew to $0.41, up from an adjusted $0.38 per share in the fourth quarter of the prior year. 
Earnings in the current quarter benefited from sales growth and lower LIFO expense, but this was partially offset by a higher adjusted tax rate and higher-than-expected stock compensation expense that resulted in large part from the significant increase in Leggett share price versus the market since late October. Matt will discuss this further in his comments.
Our adjusted EBIT and EBIT margin improved for both the fourth quarter and full year, largely due to strong sales growth. We ended the year with adjusted EBIT margin at 10.2%, up 60 basis points over the full year 2013. 
From a reported GAAP earnings perspective, the fourth quarters in both years were impacted by large unusual items. In the fourth quarter of 2014, we recognized an additional $0.21 per share litigation accrual. This charge reduced fourth quarter earnings from continuing operations by $0.09 per share, and earnings from discontinued operations by $0.12 per share. By far, the largest portion of the accrual is for the Foam Antitrust cases. We believe the accrual is sufficient to resolve all the pending Foam Antitrust cases. 
In the fourth quarter of 2013, we recognized a $67 million or $0.31 per share noncash charge, related to the goodwill and intangible assets of our Commercial Vehicle Products business. 
A major component of our strategy since 2007 has been the optimization of our portfolio of businesses by increasing investments in businesses that possess strong competitive advantage and reducing our exposure to businesses and markets that are less attractive. 
In 2014, we made good progress on both fronts. We acquired 3 Tempur Sealy innerspring plants, invested in machinery to support the significant growth of Comfort Core innersprings, expanded our operations in China to support rapid growth of our Automotive business and acquired a small German-based designer of motion furniture components. 
In early November, we also completed the divestiture of the majority of our Store Fixtures operations, and continued to pursue the sale of the 2 remaining facilities in that business. The divestiture resulted in a $0.03 per share loss that was recognized in discontinued operations, during the fourth quarter.
We assess our overall performance by comparing our total shareholder return to that of peer companies on a rolling 3-year basis. Our target is to achieve TSR in the top 1/3 of the S&P 500, over the long term, which we believe will require an average TSR of 12% to 15% per year. For the 3-year period that ended on December 31, 2014, we generated compound annual TSR of 28% per year, which placed us within the top quarter of the S&P 500. Our stock price increased 38% during the year from about $31 to $43, with much of the increase occurring in the fourth quarter. Assuming dividends are reinvested, 2014 TSR was 43%, which ranks in the top 7% of the S&P 500. 
I'll now turn the call over to Karl, who will provide some additional segment comments."

In the Residential Furnishings segment, fourth quarter total sales increased 21%. Same-location sales increased 12%, with each of the major businesses growing. 
Excluding acquisitions, U.S. Spring component dollars increased 18%. Innerspring unit volume grew 13%, with the Comfort Core premium category up 59% during the quarter. Boxspring unit volume increased 9%. 
Sales grew 4% in International Spring, primarily from market share gains and increased Comfort Core sales in Europe. Excluding acquisitions, furniture components sales increased 8% in the fourth quarter. Volume in our seating and sofa sleeper businesses grew 8%, and motion hardware unit volume increased 14%. 
Adjustable Bed units grew 127% in the quarter from a combination of new programs and strength in ongoing customer programs. Sales also increased meaningfully in fabric converting, geo components and carpet underlay. 
Fourth quarter segment EBIT was negatively impacted by a $22 million litigation accrual. Excluding this charge, adjusted EBIT increased, and EBIT margin was essentially flat with fourth quarter of 2013. The benefit from higher sales during the quarter was partially offset by increased stock compensation expense of $10 million.
Full-year total sales in the segment grew 13%, with same-location sales up 9%. Adjusted EBIT for the year increased 27%, and adjusted EBIT margins improved 110 basis points versus 2013, ending 2014 at 9.7%.
In the Commercial Fixturing & Components segment, same-location sales increased 15% in the fourth quarter. Sales grew in the quarter from improved market demand in our Work Furniture business. EBIT increased slightly with the benefit from higher sales, largely offset by higher stock compensation expense. 
For the full year, total sales in the segment grew 7%. EBIT for the year increased 21%, and EBIT margin improved. 
Segment margins continued to be below our target level due to a number of factors, including underutilized capacity and operational challenges with a Chinese joint venture. 
With industry demands still depressed from lower business and government spending, our plants continue to operate well below optimal utilization levels. While cost reductions have been implemented over the past few years, we are working to identify more opportunities to improve efficiency. In addition, our business development activities are focused on identifying opportunities to improve our sales mix through higher-valued products. 
In the Industrial Materials segment, fourth quarter same-location sales increased 5%, primarily from higher unit volume, within our wire operations, that was largely driven by strong bedding demand. EBIT and EBIT margin increased with the benefit from higher sales in other smaller factors, partially offset by higher stock compensation expense of $3 million. 
Full year total sales in the segment increased 3%, primarily from acquisitions. Same-location sales were down slightly. EBIT and EBIT margins for the year decreased, primarily from reduced metal margins and weather-related costs and inefficiencies, early in the year. 
In the Specialized Products segment, same-location sales grew 5% in the fourth quarter. Automotive sales increased 13% versus a strong fourth quarter of 2013, from a combination of expanded content, participation in new vehicle platforms and demand strength in North America and Asia. This growth was partially offset by an 18% sales decrease in Commercial Vehicle Products. 
Machinery sales were essentially flat during the quarter. The segment's EBIT and EBIT margin increased versus 2013, primarily due to the nonrecurrence of last year's CVP impairment charge. Operationally, EBIT and EBIT margin increased in the second quarter -- in the current quarter, with a benefit from higher sales, partially offset by higher stock compensation expense of $4 million. 
For the full year, total sales in this segment grew 9%. Adjusted EBIT for the year increased 26% and adjusted EBIT margins improved 180 basis points versus 2013, ending 2014 at 13.6%. 
I'll now turn the call, back over to Matt, who will discuss some of the additional financial details, along with our outlook for 2015."

While as you have already heard, fourth quarter earnings were impacted by an unusually high accrual, related to our stock-based incentive compensation plans, which in total, represented $80 million or $0.08 per share. Approximately 2/3 of this cost was due to the significant increase in our relative TSR performance, late in the year, as our share price increased from approximately $35 to $43 during the fourth quarter. The remainder of the higher cost was driven by recent strong growth in operating margin improvement in many of our businesses. 
In accordance with GAAP, we report our incentive compensation accruals each quarter to reflect the related performance metrics. For the TSR-based incentive plan, we measure our TSR performance over 3-year period compared to a 320-member peer group. For the 3-year measurement period that ended in 2014, our relative TSR through the end of September was at roughly the midpoint of the peer group. As a result, we had accrued for our 2 and 3 quarter years, assuming an estimated payout of approximately 71% of the incentive target. 
Our fourth quarter increase in share price and relative TSR, moved us into the top third of the peer group and caused the payout percentage to more than double. Consequently, all of the incremental costs for the entire 3-year period occurred and was duly recognized in the fourth quarter. A significant adjustment was also required for the 3-year period that will conclude in 2015. At the end of December, we were delivering top third TSR performance for that measurement period as well. 
In 2014, our stock compensation expense for all programs totaled $48 million.  Nearly, half of which was recognized in the fourth quarter. Our forecast for 2015 anticipates total cost of approximately $44 million at the current share price, and assuming our relative TSR does not change. If our TSR moves into a lower performance level in relation to the peer group, then we will reduce our accruals for open measurement periods to reflect the corresponding lower payout estimates. 
Now on to a few other topics. Operating cash flow was, once again, seasonally strong in the fourth quarter at $166 million. For the full year, we generated operating cash of $382 million. We ended the year with working capital at an unusually low 7.9% of annualized sales. The third and fourth quarter litigation accruals caused a sizable increase in current liabilities by year end. 
Excluding this accrual, working capital was 10.3% of annualized sales. In November, we declared a quarterly dividend of $0.31 per share, and 2014 marked our 43rd consecutive annual dividend increase at a compound annual growth rate of 13%. At yesterday's closing price of $45.07, our current yield is 2.8%, which is one of the highest dividend yields among the 54 companies that comprise the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats. 
We repurchased 700,000 shares of our stock in the fourth quarter at an average price of $41.14, and issued 1 million shares, largely for employee option exercises. 
For the year, we purchased 5.4 million shares at an average price of $33.76, and issued 3.9 million shares. 
Our financial base remains very strong, and this gives us considerable flexibility when making capital and investment decisions. We ended the year with net debt to net capital at 31.5%, which is comfortably within our long-standing targeted range of 30% to 40%. 
In 2015, we again expect strong sales growth, which should lead to another year of record earnings per share from continuing operations. As we announced yesterday, we expect 2015 earnings from continuing operations to be between $1.90 and $2.10 per share. With improving demand, market share gains and recent acquisitions, sales from continuing operations are expected to be $3.9 billion to $4.1 billion. This range represents a 3% to 8% increase versus our $3.78 billion of sales from continuing operations in 2014. 
Based upon this guidance range, we currently expect a full year EBIT margin between 10.7% and 11.2%. We expect to again, generate operating cash flow of approximately $350 million in 2015. Dividends should require about $170 million of cash, and capital expenditures should approximate $120 million for the year. 
We continue to make investments to support growth in business and product lines, where sales are strong, and for efficiency improvement in maintenance. Our incentive plans emphasize returns on capital, which include net fixed assets and working capital. This emphasis, we believe, helps ensure that we're efficiently utilizing our asset base and investing capital dollars, where the highest term potential exists. 
Consistent with our stated priorities for the use of excess cash flow, we will prudently buyback our stock, bearing in mind our level of cash generation, other potential opportunities to strategically grow the company and the overall outlook for the general economy. We have a standing authorization from the board to repurchase up the 10 million shares each year. However, no specific repurchase commitment or timetable has been established. We currently expect to issue between 2 million and 3 million shares in 2015, primarily from employee stock option exercises, and repurchase an amount that at least offsets the shares issued. 
With those comments, I'll turn it back over to Dave Haffner."

Scrap is a little bit of a challenge for us, and our outlook has changed pretty dramatically in the last 30 days. The scrap traded up about $5 from December to early January. And now, the expectation for February scrap prices is down about $30 a ton, which ballparks 10%. What's driving that forecasted scrap deflation is significant availability of U.S. scrap. Iron ore costs that are falling pretty dramatically around the world and then currency exchange rates. The impact of that is probably more -- will be more significant on the flat products because of availability of both Russian and Chinese flat steel products. Again, scrap is driving that currency exchange issues also enter into the flat steel products. From a rod -- from a wire rod perspective, there is less availability of high carbon rod around the world that's of quality enough to utilize in our products, or our customers or competitors’ products. The low carbon is somewhat protected now because of commerce's finding of guilt of antidumping claims by the U.S. wire rod producers, specifically low carbon. They've levied duties effective mid-December of between 100% and 200%, depending on the importer of those products. But rod will probably deflate some because of the correlation to scrap.  Now the impact on Leggett is there maybe, depending on how scrap actually does trade, some pricing pressure on some of our products, there'll probably be a lag of 30 to 60 -- really, 60 to 90 days, which will pressure selling prices, pressure margin dollars, but actually should have a positive impact on margin percentage. And for those of you that are trying to quarterize our guidance, this is probably a bit of a headwind to the first quarter because we, again, if scrap falls off, we will have to revalue our rod or bill it, our wire inventories and our flat product inventories, so that revaluation will be a headwind to our EBIT and the respective benefit or the LIFO benefit, based on GAAP accounting, we won't book that benefit until each one of the quarters end, based on a year end 2015 forecast. So the pain is upfront, the remedy is spread equally amongst the remaining quarters of the year."

The working capital is a key piece, so what does move around based upon what's happening in those various categories, and operations has done a superb job in the last several years of freeing up a lot of capital in that regard. As you heard, would you adjust for the year end accruals, relative to the litigation? We were trending at about a 10% working capital level of investment. We would anticipate that, that would be about the level of investment this coming year as sales continue to grow, which, therefore, means we would use some cash in working capital at that sort of gearing in 2015. And then specifically relative to the accruals that we have taken on the litigation, we would anticipate that most of that activity would take place in 2015, but of course, that, once again, is hard to predict.

If scrap does trade down in February like the market expects, there will be some impact on our pricing, but it should be a positive again, from a margin percentage perspective. It's very difficult to forecast steel cost into the back half of the year right now. But all in all, I would expect that they will end the year, somewhat impossibly significantly lower than they ended 2014. As it relates to currency that from a transactional perspective, we do a pretty darn good job of matching manufacturing and manufacturing cost in the geography of consumption, and then augment that by a pretty rigorous hedging program. Our finance folks, operations folks work really well together to adequately hedge ourselves. From a translational perspective, we did an analysis just the other day on currency exchange rates that are current. So just 2 days ago. The impact on Automotive, which is our most internationally diverse business, is about $25 million in topline and about $2.5 million here from an EBIT perspective. If you multiply that by 2, it's probably too aggressive for the rest of the company just because of auto being, like I said, the most geographically dispersed. So we'll see those rates would really change every day, every minute. So -- but it currency is a bit of a headwind."

Yesterday, we reported record first quarter results from continuing operations, and are very pleased to maintain the strong performance with, which we ended 2014.Sales increased 10% in the first",551,"Good morning, and thank you for participating in our call. Yesterday, we reported record first quarter results from continuing operations, and are very pleased to maintain the strong performance with, which we ended 2014.
Sales increased 10% in the first quarter from a combination of strong unit volume growth and acquisitions. Currency translation impacts and raw material-related price decreases offset a portion of these gains.
We continue to benefit from the shift in bidding to Comfort Core Springs. New Adjustable Bed programs like ramp up last year and ongoing content gains and new program awards in Automotive. Importantly, nearly all of our businesses experienced volume growth in the first quarter.
Earnings per share from continuing operations were also a first quarter record at $0.50 per share, up 32% from the $0.38 per share, we earned in the first quarter of 2014. Earnings benefited from strong unit volume growth, pricing discipline and operational improvements in certain businesses, partially offset by a $6 million impairment charge, associated with our industrial still to be in operation. EBIT increased 30%, and EBIT margin improved to a 11.6%, up 180 basis points over first quarter last year.
We completed 1 acquisition during the first quarter, which is a European private-label manufacturer of high-end upholstered furniture for office, commercial and other settings.
This business is complementary to our existing North American private-label operation and allows us to support our work furniture customers as they expand globally.
We assess our overall performance by comparing our total shareholder return to that of peer companies on a rolling 3-year basis. Our targets is to achieve TSR in the top 1/3 of the S&P 500 over the long-term., which we believe will require an average TSR of 12% to 15% per year.
For the 3-year period that will and/or December 31, 2015, we have so far generated compound annual TSR of 28% per year, which places us in the top 34% of the S&P 500.
Now before Carl comments on the individual segments performance, for the quarter, I would like to take a minute to discuss the change in our segment structure that occurred during the first quarter. Because of the recent divestiture of the majority of the Store Fixtures business, along with the retirement of a Joe  who is the President of the Industrial Material Segment, our management organizational structure and all related internal reporting changed during the first quarter.
The Adjustable Bed and Fashion Bed businesses were moved from Residential Furnishings to commercial products. The aerospace business was moved from Industrial Materials to Specialized Products. And the machinery operations, which produces wire forming equipment primary for legacy international use was more from session Specialized Products to Residential Furnishings.
Perry Davis continues as President of Residential Furnishings. Dennis Park, continues as President of Commercial Products. Jack Crusa is now President of both Specialized Products and Industrial Materials.
We revised the prior year financial data for each of the segments to allow for comparison with ongoing results. These revisions only effect segment information there've been no changes to previously reported consolidated financial statements. You will find all of these details including an overview of the revised segment structure on our website and in the 8-K that be filed on April 16. 
And now, I'll turn the call over to Karl Glassman."

Most of our businesses continue to perform extremely well during the first quarter, and all 4 segments posted volume growth. In the residential furnishings segment, first quarter total sales increased 18%. Same location sales increased 10% from strong unit volume growth, partially offset by currency translation impacts. Excluding acquisitions, U.S. Spring component dollar sales increased 14%. Innerspring unit volume grew 15%, with Comfort Core of 66% during the quarter. Boxspring unit volume increased 8%.
Sales decreased 3% in International Spring, with strong volume growth of 11%, more than offset by currency translation impacts. Excluding acquisitions, furniture components sales increased 4% in the first quarter. Sales in our seating and sofa sleeper businesses grew 2%, and motion hardware unit volume increased 14%. Sales also increased converting, Geo Components, and corporate cushion. 
First quarter EBIT increased with the benefit from higher sales and pricing discipline, partially offset by the nonrecurrence of last year's $4 million building gain.
EBIT margin in the quarter also reflected the impact of higher Adjustable Bed pass through sales and acquired innerspring facilities both of which have lower than segment average of margins.
In the commercial product segment, first quarter total sales increased 21%, including the Work Furniture acquisition that Dave mentioned earlier. Same location sales increased 17%, primarily from continued strong demand in adjustable bed. Unit volume in that business increased 87% during the first quarter. Fashion Bed sales grew 7%. Work Furniture, same location sales were essentially flat with 3% volume growth offset by currency translation impact. EBIT and EBIT margin increased modestly in the first quarter due to higher sales.
We are rapidly expanding production capacity in our Adjustable Bed business to support continued strong demand in that category. Work Furniture margins improved slightly versus the prior year, but continue to be well, below target levels due to our unrealized capacity and poor performance in our Chinese joint venture operations.
In the industrial materials segment, first quarter sales increased 6% primarily from higher unit volume within our drawn wire operations, driven by strong bedding demand. Partially offset by steel related price decreases.
EBIT was flat and EBIT margin decreased slightly with the benefit from higher unit volume offset by a $6 million impairment charge related to the steel tubing business. In the Specialized Products segment, first quarter sales grew 6%. Automotive sales increased 8%, very strong volume growth of approximately 15%, partially offset by currency translation impact.
Modest volume growth in aerospace was more than offset by currency translation or a slight sales decrease in the quarter. Machinery sales were up 5% and CVP sales decreased slightly.
The segment's EBIT and EBIT margin grew primarily due to higher volume and operational improvements in several parts of the segment, including aerospace, where we continue to benefit from integration of the European operations that we acquired in 2013.
I'll now turn the call over to Matt Flanigan, who will discuss some of the additional financial details along with our outlook for 2015."

Consistent with our normal seasonality and our internal forecast, operating cash flow in the first quarter was $32 million. Cash flow increased $52 million versus the first quarter of last year due to higher earnings and a smaller increase in working capital, primarily in accounts receivable.
Adjusted working capital as a percentage of sales was 10.1% at the end of the first quarter.
Excluding the litigation accruals that we recorded in 2014, which are included in current liabilities, working capital was a more seasonally normal 12.3% of annualized sales.
In February, we declared a quarterly dividend of $0.31 per share and extended our record of consecutive annual dividend increases to 44 years, at a compound annual growth rate of 13%.
Yesterday's closing price of $42.47 per share the current yield is 2.9%. One of the highest dividend yields among the 52 companies that comprise the S&P 500's dividend aristocrats.
We repurchased 1.5 million shares of our stock in the first quarter at an average price of $44.53 and issued 1.5 million shares, largely for employee benefit plans in option exercises.
Our financial base remains very strong and this gives us considerable flexibility when making capital and investment decisions. We ended the quarter with net debt to net capital at 35.3%, comfortably within our long-standing targeted range of 30% to 40%.
For the full year 2015, we again, expect strong unit volume growth, which should lead to another year of record earnings per share from continuing operations. As we announced yesterday, we are raising the low end of our prior guidance, and now anticipate 2015 earnings from continuing operations of $1.95 to $2.10 per share. Our expectations for sales is unchanged at $3.9 billion to $4.1 billion this range represents a 3% to 8% increase versus our reported $3.78 billion of sales in 2014.
As was the case in the first quarter, we expect full year volume growth and acquisitions to be partially offset by currency translation impact in raw material-related price decreases. Based upon this guidance range, we currently expect a full year EBIT margin between 11% and 11.5%, which would be our highest EBIT margin level since the year 2000.
We expect our operating cash to exceed $350 million in 2015. Dividends should require about $170 million of cash and capital expenditures should approximate $120 million.
We continue to make investments to support growth in businesses and product lines where sales are strong, aim for efficiency improvement and maintenance. Our incentive plans emphasize returns on capital, which include net fixed assets and working capital. This emphasis, we believe, helps ensure that we're efficiently utilizing our asset base and investing capital dollars, where the highest return potential exists.
As has been our practice, after funding dividends, and capital expenditures, remaining cash flow will be prioritized toward competitively advantaged acquisitions.
Potential acquisitions must meet stringent strategic and financial criteria. Should no acquisitions come to fruition and excess cash flow is available, we have a standing authorization from the Board of Directors to repurchase up to 10 million shares each year. No specific repurchase commitment or timetable has been established., however, we currently expect to repurchase between 3 million and 5 million shares in 2015, and issue approximately 3 million shares. Primarily for an employee benefit plans and option exercises.
With those comments, I'll now turn the call back over to Dave Haffner."

Derisking the start of that operation there, the automotive people, they operated a very nice, very successful facility for a number of years. So they're managing the production of that product and then shipping it across the border to El Paso, where the adjustable bed folks take position.
So, the facility is in production. It's ahead of its pro forma. We also have started a relatively small facility at here in Joplin more associated with initial production of new product runs. So, it's allowing us to run all of our R&D launches into a production environment before we put them into the 2 larger manufacturing facilities, which is the hysterically we had to do that in Georgetown.

So, it will be interesting. We're pretty confident that we're near bottom. Because of the normal lag that we've spoken to, both on an inflationary and deflationary cycle. We've said that in an inflationary environment, expect about a 60-day lag, and in a deflationary environment, expect about the 90-day lag. The spreads in the first quarter were actually better than they where in the fourth quarter of last year. But those  spreads or metal margin really compress a little bit in the second quarter.

So we feel good about the progress. We will get some uplift as is just now, starting to shift their new product line.

We are as we said, out of capacity from an adjustable perspective, we're adding capacity from an Automotive perspective everyday.

As Matt mentioned in his commentary, our acquisition criteria are significantly more stringent than they've ever been in the past. And so we're looking at a lot of businesses that we decide to pass on for various reasons, strategic or otherwise. But this particular acquisition, being a private label manufacturer is one that I and Karl, Matt and many of us in the company are strong components of, especially, due to the fact that our current North American private-label business does so well. Performs a very, very good service for some of our key customers, and makes a very fair return for our shareholders.
Many of our North American customers have an interest in expanding globally. And, so, it was either a matter of acquisition or greenfielding another business similar to our business here in the United States.
And then, synergistically, some of trio lines customers and other European customers of ours are interested in growing their market here in North America. And doing so through private-label initiatives. And had asked us to consider that.
So it was very fortuitous. The individual that and his sister that were the owners of the business are very young people, very energetic, and enthusiastic, and we're -- we believe, we've got an outstanding group of people associated with this acquisition.  But, it passed all of the screens that we use for strategic and financial return on invested capital, et cetera, and, simultaneously, met 2 of those long-term strategy goals, both here in North America and in other parts of the world associated with private-label growth."

Yesterday, we reported record first quarter results from continuing operations, and are very pleased to have maintained the strong performance with which we ended 2014.
Sales increased 10% in the first quarter from a combination of strong unit volume growth and acquisitions. Currency translation impacts and raw material-related price decreases offset a portion of these gains.
We continue to benefit from the shift in bedding in to Comfort Core Springs, new Adjustable Bed programs that ramped up last year and ongoing content gains and new program awards in Automotive. Importantly, nearly all of our businesses experienced volume growth in the first quarter.
Earnings per share from continuing operations were also a first quarter record at $0.50 per share, up 32% from the $0.38 per share we earned in the first quarter of 2014. Earnings benefited from strong unit volume growth, pricing discipline and operational improvements in certain businesses, partially offset by $6 million impairment charge, associated with our industrial steel tubing operation. EBIT increased 30%, and EBIT margin improved to 11.6%, up 180 basis points over first quarter last year.
We completed one acquisition during the first quarter, which is a European private label manufacturer of high-end upholstered furniture for office, commercial and other settings.
This business is complementary to our existing North American private label operation and allows us to support our work furniture customers as they expand globally.
We assess our overall performance by comparing our total shareholder return to that of peer companies on a rolling 3-year basis. Our target is to achieve TSR in the top 1/3 of the S&P 500 over the long-term, which we believe will require an average TSR of 12% to 15% per year.
For the 3-year period that will end on December 31, 2015, we have, so far, generated compound annual TSR of 28% per year, which places us in the top 34% of the S&P 500.
Now before Karl comments on the individual segment's performance for the quarter, I'd like to take a minute to discuss the change in our segment structure that occurred during the first quarter. Because of the recent divestiture of the majority of the Store Fixtures business, along with the retirement of a Joe Downes, who is the President of the Industrial Material Segment, our management organizational structure and all related internal reporting changed during the first quarter.
The Adjustable Bed and Fashion Bed businesses were moved from Residential Furnishings to Commercial products. The Aerospace business was moved from Industrial Materials to Specialized Products. And the steel machinery operations, which produces wire forming equipment, primarily for legacy international use, was moved from Specialized Products to Residential Furnishings.
Perry Davis continues as President of Residential Furnishings. Dennis Park continues as President of Commercial Products. Jack Crusa is now President of both Specialized Products and Industrial Materials.
We've revised the prior year financial data for each of the segments to allow for comparison with ongoing results. These revisions only affect segment information. There have been no changes to previously reported consolidated financial statements. You will find all of these details, including an overview of the revised segment structure, on our website and in the 8-K that we filed on April 16. 
And now, I'll turn the call over to Karl Glassman."

Most of our businesses continue to perform extremely well during the first quarter, and all 4 segments posted volume growth. In the Residential Furnishings segment, first quarter total sales increased 18%. Same-location sales increased 10% from strong unit volume growth partially offset by currency translation impacts. Excluding acquisitions, U.S. Spring component dollar sales increased 14%. Innerspring unit volume grew 15%, with Comfort Core of 66% during the quarter. Boxspring unit volume increased 8%.
Sales decreased 3% in International Spring, with strong volume growth of 11% more than offset by currency translation impacts. Excluding acquisitions, Furniture component sales increased 4% in the first quarter. Sales in our seating and sofa sleeper businesses grew 2%, and motion hardware unit volume increased 14%. Sales also increased in Fabric Converting, Geo Components, and Carpet Cushion. 
First quarter EBIT increased with the benefit from higher sales and pricing discipline, partially offset by the non-reoccurrence (sic) [non-recurrence] of last year's $4 million building gain.
EBIT margin in the quarter also reflected the impact of higher Adjustable Bed pass-thru sales and acquired innerspring facilities, both of which have lower than segment average margins.
In the Commercial Products segment, first quarter total sales increased 21%, including the Work Furniture acquisition that Dave mentioned earlier. Same location sales increased 17%, primarily from continued strong demand in Adjustable Bed. Unit volume in that business increased 87% during the first quarter. Fashion Bed sales grew 7%. Work Furniture same location sales were essentially flat, with 3% volume growth offset by currency translation impact. EBIT and EBIT margin increased modestly in the first quarter due to higher sales.
We are rapidly expanding production capacity in our Adjustable Bed business to support continued strong demand in that category. Work Furniture margins improved slightly versus the prior year, but continue to be well below target levels due to unrealized capacity and poor performance in our Chinese joint venture operations.
In the Industrial Materials segment, first quarter sales increased 6% primarily from higher unit volume within our drawn wire operations driven by strong bedding demand, partially offset by steel related price decreases.
EBIT was flat, and EBIT margin decreased slightly with the benefit from higher unit volume offset by a $6 million impairment charge related to the Steel Tubing business. 
In the Specialized Products segment, first quarter sales grew 6%. Automotive sales increased 8%, a very strong volume growth of approximately 15%, partially offset by currency translation impact.
Modest volume growth in Aerospace was more than offset by currency translation or a slight sales decrease in the quarter. Machinery sales were up 5% and CVP sales declined slightly.
The segment's EBIT and EBIT margin grew primarily due to higher volume and operational improvements in several parts of the segment, including Aerospace, where we continue to benefit from integration of the European operations that we acquired in 2013.
I'll now turn the call over to Matt Flanigan, who will discuss some of the additional financial details along with our outlook for 2015."

Consistent with our normal seasonality and our internal forecast, operating cash flow in the first quarter was $32 million. Cash flow increased $52 million versus the first quarter of last year due to higher earnings and a smaller increase in working capital, primarily in accounts receivable.
Adjusted working capital as a percentage of sales was 10.1% at the end of the first quarter.
Excluding the litigation accruals that we recorded in 2014, which are included in current liabilities, working capital was a more seasonally normal 12.3% of annualized sales.
In February, we declared a quarterly dividend of $0.31 per share and extended our record of consecutive annual dividend increases to 44 years at a compound annual growth rate of 13%.
At yesterday's closing price of $42.47 per share, the current yield is 2.9%, one of the highest dividend yields among the 52 companies that comprise the S&P 500's Dividend Aristocrats.
We repurchased 1.5 million shares of our stock in the first quarter at an average price of $44.53 and issued 1.5 million shares, largely for employee benefit plans and option exercises.
Our financial base remains very strong, and this gives us considerable flexibility when making capital and investment decisions. We ended the quarter with net debt to net capital at 35.3%, comfortably within our long-standing targeted range of 30% to 40%.
For the full year 2015, we again expect strong unit volume growth which should lead to another year of record earnings per share from continuing operations. As we announced yesterday, we are raising the low end of our prior guidance, and now anticipate 2015 earnings from continuing operations of $1.95 to $2.10 per share. Our expectation for sales is unchanged at $3.9 billion to $4.1 billion. This range represents a 3% to 8% increase versus our reported $3.78 billion of sales in 2014.
As was the case in the first quarter, we expect full year volume growth and acquisitions to be partially offset by currency translation impact in raw material-related price decreases. Based upon this guidance range, we currently expect a full year EBIT margin between 11% and 11.5%, which would be our highest EBIT margin level since the year 2000.
We expect our operating cash to exceed $350 million in 2015. Dividends should require about $170 million of cash, and capital expenditure should approximate $120 million.
We continue to make investments to support growth in businesses and product lines where sales are strong and for efficiency improvement and maintenance. Our incentive plans emphasize returns on capital, which include net fixed assets and working capital. This emphasis, we believe, helps ensure that we're efficiently utilizing our asset base and investing capital dollars where the highest return potential exists.
As has been our practice, after funding dividends and capital expenditures, remaining cash flow will be prioritized toward competitively advantaged acquisitions.
Potential acquisitions must meet stringent, strategic and financial criteria. Should no acquisitions come to fruition and if excess cash flow is available, we have a standing authorization from the Board of Directors to repurchase up to 10 million shares each year. No specific repurchase commitment or timetable has been established. However, we currently expect to repurchase between 3 million and 5 million shares in 2015 and issue approximately 3 million shares, primarily for employee benefit plans and option exercises.
With those comments, I'll now turn the call back over to Dave Haffner."

So it'll be interesting. We're pretty confident that we're near bottom. The -- because of the normal lag that we've spoken to, both on an inflationary and a deflationary cycle, we've said that in an inflationary environment, expect about a 60-day lag, and a deflationary environment, expect about the 90-day lag. The spreads in the first quarter were actually better than they where in the fourth quarter of last year, but those spreads or metal margin will compress a little bit in the second quarter.
Now as we transfer products into the rest of the segment from rod-to-wire perspective and then into components, we would expect some expansion of those margins because of the lag at that level.

EBIT increased by a fairly notable amount on that volume improvement. We do think that we're hitting our long-term expressed 25% to 35% incremental margin on that -- on the volume that we're getting.

So we feel good about the progress. We will get some uplift as Sealy is just now starting to ship their new product line.

Many of our North American customers have an interest in expanding globally. And so it was either a matter of acquisition or greenfielding another business similar to our genesis business here in the United States.
And then synergistically, some of trio lines customers and other European customers of ours are interested in growing their market here in North America and doing so through private-label initiatives and had asked us to consider that.
So it was very fortuitous. The individual that -- and his sister that were the owners of the business are very young people, very energetic and enthusiastic, and we're -- we believe we've got an outstanding group of people associated with this acquisition.

Yesterday, we reported record first quarter results from continuing operations and are very pleased to have maintained the strong performance with which we ended 2014.
Sales increased 10% in the first quarter from a combination of strong unit volume growth and acquisitions. Currency translation impacts and raw-material-related price decreases offset a portion of these gains.
We continue to benefit from the shift in bedding to Comfort Core springs, new Adjustable Bed programs that ramped up last year and ongoing content gains and new program awards in Automotive. Importantly, nearly all of our businesses experienced volume growth in the first quarter.
Earnings per share from continuing operations were also a first quarter record at $0.50 per share, up 32% from the $0.38 per share we earned in the first quarter of 2014. Earnings benefited from strong unit volume growth, pricing discipline and operational improvements in certain businesses partially offset by a $6 million impairment charge associated with our industrial steel tubing operation. EBIT increased 30% and EBIT margin improved to 11.6%, up 180 basis points over first quarter last year.
We completed one acquisition during the first quarter, which is a European private label manufacturer of high-end upholstered furniture for office, commercial and other settings.
This business is complementary to our existing North American private label operation and allows us to support our work furniture customers as they expand globally.
We assess our overall performance by comparing our total shareholder return to that of peer companies on a rolling 3-year basis. Our target is to achieve TSR in the top 1/3 of the S&P 500 over the long term, which we believe will require an average TSR of 12% to 15% per year.
For the 3-year period that will end on December 31, 2015, we have so far generated compound annual TSR of 28% per year, which places us in the top 34% of the S&P 500.
Now before Karl comments on the individual segments' performance for the quarter, I'd like to take a minute to discuss the change in our segment structure that occurred during the first quarter. Because of the recent divestiture of the majority of the Store Fixtures business along with the retirement of Joe Downes, who is the President of the Industrial Material segment, our management organizational structure and all related internal reporting changed during the first quarter.
The Adjustable Bed and Fashion Bed businesses were moved from Residential Furnishings to Commercial Products. The Aerospace business was moved from Industrial Materials to Specialized Products. And the steel machinery operation, which produces wire forming equipment primarily for Leggett's internal use, was moved from Specialized Products to Residential Furnishings.
Perry Davis continues as President of Residential Furnishings. Dennis Park continues as President of Commercial Products. Jack Crusa is now President of both Specialized Products and Industrial Materials.
We've revised the prior year financial data for each of the segments to allow for comparison with ongoing results. These revisions only affect segment information. There've been no changes to previously reported consolidated financial statements. You will find all of these details, including an overview of the revised segment structure, on our website and in the 8-K that we filed on April 16. 
And now, I'll turn the call over to Karl Glassman."

In the Residential Furnishings segment, first quarter total sales increased 18%. Same-location",497,"Thank you, Dave, and good morning. Most of our businesses continue to perform extremely well during the first quarter, and all 4 segments posted volume growth. In the Residential Furnishings segment, first quarter total sales increased 18%. Same-location sales increased 10% from strong unit volume growth partially offset by currency translation impacts. Excluding acquisitions, U.S. Spring component dollar sales increased 14%. Innerspring unit volume grew 15% with Comfort Core up 66% during the quarter. Boxspring unit volume increased 8%.
Sales decreased 3% in International Spring with strong volume growth of 11% more than offset by currency translation impacts. Excluding acquisitions, Furniture component sales increased 4% in the first quarter. Sales in our seating and sofa sleeper businesses grew 2%, and motion hardware unit volume increased 14%. Sales also increased in Fabric Converting, Geo Components, and Carpet Cushion. 
First quarter EBIT increased with the benefit from higher sales and pricing discipline, partially offset by the nonreoccurrence of last year's $4 million building gain.
EBIT margin in the quarter also reflected the impact of higher Adjustable Bed pass-through sales and acquired innerspring facilities, both of which have lower than segment average margins.
In the Commercial Products segment, first quarter total sales increased 21%, including the Work Furniture acquisition that Dave mentioned earlier. Same-location sales increased 17% primarily from continued strong demand in Adjustable Bed. Unit volume in that business increased 87% during the first quarter. Fashion Bed sales grew 7%. Work Furniture same-location sales were essentially flat with 3% volume growth offset by currency translation impact. EBIT and EBIT margin increased modestly in the first quarter due to higher sales.
We are rapidly expanding production capacity in our Adjustable Bed business to support continued strong demand in that category. Work Furniture margins improved slightly versus the prior year but continue to be well below target levels due to unrealized capacity and poor performance in our Chinese joint venture operations.
In the Industrial Materials segment, first quarter sales increased 6% primarily from higher unit volume within our Drawn Wire operations driven by strong bedding demand partially offset by steel-related price decreases.
EBIT was flat and EBIT margin decreased slightly with the benefit from higher unit volume offset by a $6 million impairment charge related to the Steel Tubing business. 
In the Specialized Products segment, first quarter sales grew 6%. Automotive sales increased 8%, a very strong volume growth of approximately 15% partially offset by currency translation impact.
Modest volume growth in Aerospace was more than offset by currency translation or a slight sales decrease in the quarter. Machinery sales were up 5% and CVP sales declined slightly.
The segment's EBIT and EBIT margin grew primarily due to higher volume and operational improvements in several parts of the segment, including Aerospace, where we continue to benefit from integration of the European operations that we acquired in 2013.
I'll now turn the call over to Matt Flanigan, who will discuss some of the additional financial details along with our outlook for 2015."
30760,291742475,800784,"Leggett & Platt, Incorporated, Q1 2015 Earnings Call, May 01, 2015",2015-05-01,"Earnings Calls","Leggett & Platt, Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Karl, and good morning, everyone.Consistent with our normal seasonality and our internal forecast, operating cash flow in the first quarter was $32 million. Cash flow increased $52 million versus the first quarter of last year due to higher e",567,"Thank you, Karl, and good morning, everyone.
Consistent with our normal seasonality and our internal forecast, operating cash flow in the first quarter was $32 million. Cash flow increased $52 million versus the first quarter of last year due to higher earnings and a smaller increase in working capital primarily in accounts receivable.
Adjusted working capital as a percentage of sales was 10.1% at the end of the first quarter.
Excluding the litigation accruals that we recorded in 2014, which are included in current liabilities, working capital was a more seasonally normal 12.3% of annualized sales.
In February, we declared a quarterly dividend of $0.31 per share and extended our record of consecutive annual dividend increases to 44 years at a compound annual growth rate of 13%.
At yesterday's closing price of $42.47 per share, the current yield is 2.9%, one of the highest dividend yields among the 52 companies that comprise the S&P 500's Dividend Aristocrats.
We repurchased 1.5 million shares of our stock in the first quarter at an average price of $44.53 and issued 1.5 million shares largely for employee benefit plans and option exercises.
Our financial base remains very strong, and this gives us considerable flexibility when making capital and investment decisions. We ended the quarter with net debt to net capital at 35.3% comfortably within our longstanding targeted range of 30% to 40%.
For the full year 2015, we again expect strong unit volume growth, which should lead to another year of record earnings per share from continuing operations. As we announced yesterday, we are raising the low end of our prior guidance, and now anticipate 2015 earnings from continuing operations of $1.95 to $2.10 per share. Our expectation for sales is unchanged at $3.9 billion to $4.1 billion. This range represents a 3% to 8% increase versus our reported $3.78 billion of sales in 2014.
As was the case in the first quarter, we expect full year volume growth and acquisitions to be partially offset by currency translation impact in raw-material-related price decreases. Based upon this guidance range, we currently expect a full year EBIT margin between 11% and 11.5%, which would be our highest EBIT margin level since the year 2000.
We expect operating cash to exceed $350 million in 2015. Dividends should require about $170 million of cash, and capital expenditure should approximate $120 million.
We continue to make investments to support growth in businesses and product lines where sales are strong and for efficiency improvement and maintenance. Our incentive plans emphasize returns on capital, which include net fixed assets and working capital. This emphasis, we believe, helps ensure that we're efficiently utilizing our asset base and investing capital dollars where the highest return potential exists.
As has been our practice, after funding dividends and capital expenditures, remaining cash flow will be prioritized toward competitively advantaged acquisitions.
Potential acquisitions must meet stringent, strategic and financial criteria. Should no acquisitions come to fruition and if excess cash flow is available, we have a standing authorization from the Board of Directors to repurchase up to 10 million shares each year. No specific repurchase commitment or timetable has been established. However, we currently expect to repurchase between 3 million and 5 million shares in 2015 and issue approximately 3 million shares primarily for employee benefit plans and option exercises.
With those comments, I'll now turn the call back over to Dave Haffner."

So they're managing the production of that product and then shipping it across the border to El Paso, where the Adjustable Bed folks take possession. So the facility is in production yet ahead of its pro forma. We also have started a relatively small facility at here in Joplin that's more associated with initial production of new product runs. So we're -- it's allowing us to run all of our R&D launches into a production environment before we put them into the 2 larger manufacturing facilities.

But it's offset by currency and raw material so that our same-location sales change was just a little bit less than that. EBIT increased by a fairly notable amount on that volume improvement. We do think that we're hitting our long-term expressed 25% to 35% incremental margin on that -- on the volume that we're getting.

It's taken us a little longer than we expected because the volumes are greater than we expected. The macro market is just pretty darn strong. So we feel good about the progress. We will get some uplift as Sealy is just now starting to ship their new product line.

Many of our North American customers have an interest in expanding globally. And so it was either a matter of acquisition or greenfield-ing another business similar to our Genesis business here in the United States. And then synergistically, some of trio lines' customers and other European customers of ours are interested in growing their market here in North America and doing so through private label initiatives and had asked us to consider that. So it was very fortuitous. The individual that -- and his sister that were the owners of this business are very young people, very energetic and enthusiastic, and we're -- we believe we've got an outstanding group of people associated with this acquisition.

But we are expecting substantial growth, substantial top line, and simultaneously, there are some synergies here as well as some new business that is going to be priced a little bit differently than what we've done in the past, which will also enhance the margins. So I know that's sort of a mealy-mouthed answer to your question, but it's really a combination of continued meaningful growth rate and relatively straightforward margin enhancement."

Good morning, and thank you for participating in our call. Yesterday, we reported record second quarter results from continuing operations and I'm very pleased to have extended our string of strong quarterly results that began in the second quarter of last year. Sales increased 4% in the quarter. Higher unit volume and acquisitions added 9% to year-over-year sales growth. These gains were partially offset by raw material-related price decreases and currency translation impact, which combined reduced sales by 5%. We continue to benefit from the shift in bedding to comfort core springs, new Adjustable Bed programs that ramped up last year and ongoing content gains and new program awards in Automotive. Importantly, nearly all of our businesses experienced volume growth in the quarter versus strong prior year comparisons with sales having grown 9% in the second quarter of last year. Earnings per share from continuing operations were also a second quarter record at $0.53 per share, up 10% from the $0.48 per share we earned in the second quarter of 2014. Earnings benefited primarily from higher unit volumes and pricing discipline, partially offset by a higher effective tax rate. 
EBIT increased 17% and EBIT margin improved to 12%, up 130 basis points over second quarter last year. This was the highest quarterly margin that we've achieved in 15 years and reflects the improvements that we've made to our business portfolio and cost structure as well as the strong market positions of our current businesses. 
Since the recession in 2009, we've spoken about the earnings leverage from incremental volume produced utilizing excess capacity. With market share gains and higher market demand, our capacity utilization has increased. The margin improvements that we have realized over the past few years reflects, in part, that higher utilization. We still have available capacity to accommodate the additional volume in many of our businesses but there's less today than just a few quarters ago. In certain of our businesses and product lines, we have little to no capacity left and we are investing meaningful capital dollars to support continued growth. 
In automotive, we are expanding capacity to support new programs that will begin production in 2016 and later years. In bedding, we are investing rapidly in equipment that we build on our own Swiss operation to support our tremendous growth in comfort core, which we expect to continue for the next few years. In Adjustable Bed, which operated a single large location just a year ago, we're adding new locations to broaden our geographic scope and expect to be operating four facilities in North America by the end of this year. We are very pleased to be making these investments since they are directly associated with our expectation for continued meaningful growth in some of our strongest performing businesses. 
We assess our overall performance by comparing our total shareholder return to that of peer companies on a rolling 3-year basis. Our target is to achieve TSR in the top 1/3 of the S&P 500 over the long term, which we believe will require an average TSR of 12% to 15% per year. For the 3-year period that ended on December 31, 2014, we have so far generated compound annual TSR of 31% per year, which places us in the top 20% of the S&P 500. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Karl Glassman. Karl?"

Most of our businesses continued to perform extremely well during the second quarter. In the Residential Furnishings segment, second quarter total sales increased 10%, same-location sales increased 3% with 7% unit volume",565,"Thank you, Dave, and good morning. Most of our businesses continued to perform extremely well during the second quarter. In the Residential Furnishings segment, second quarter total sales increased 10%, same-location sales increased 3% with 7% unit volume growth, partially offset by raw material-related price decreases and currency translation impact. Sales trends for the major businesses and product categories excluding acquisitions, deflation and currency, were as follows: U.S. Spring and component dollar sales increased 15%; inner spring unit volume grew 17%, with comfort core of 71% during the quarter; upspring unit volume increased 7%; International Spring sales grew 6%; furniture component sales increased 2%, with sales in the seating and sofa sleeper businesses up 6% and motion hardware unit volume up 2%. Sales also increased in Fabric Converting and components while volume was down slightly in Carpet Cushion. 
Segment EBIT increased slightly in the quarter, but EBIT margin declined with a benefit from higher unit volume largely offset by other factors, including increased performance-based compensation expense. EBIT margin also reflects the impact of higher adjustable bid passthrough sales and acquired facilities, both of which have lower than segment average margins. 
In the Commercial Products segment, second quarter total sales increased 28%, same-location sales increased 18%, primarily from continued strong demand in Adjustable Bed. Unit volume in that business increased 81% during the quarter. Fashion bed sales were 12%, Work Furniture same-location sales decreased 5% in the second quarter, reflecting currency translation impact, lower volume in our Chinese operations and a less favorable product mix. Unit volume in North America was up slightly. 
In early March, we acquired a European private label manufacturer of high end upholstered furniture for office, commercial and other settings. This business is complementary to our North American private label operation that allows us to support our Work Furniture customers as they expand globally. This acquisition added 10% to the segment sales growth during the second quarter. The segment's EBIT and EBIT margin increased in the second quarter, primarily due to higher sales. As Dave mentioned, we are rapidly expanding production capacity in our Adjustable Bed business to support continued strong demand in that category. 
In the Industrial Materials segment, second quarter sales decreased 9%, entirely from steel-related price reductions. Unit volumes were roughly flat, with growth in Drawn Wire driven by strong bedding demand, offset by lower trade sales from our rod mill. A softer steel market and scheduled equipment upgrades at the rod mill resulted in fewer trade shipments, as was expected, versus the second quarter of last year. EBIT and EBIT margin increased significantly during the quarter, primarily due to cost reductions and pricing discipline. 
In the Specialized Products segment, second quarter sales were flat, with an approximate 5% volume improvement offset by currency translation impact. Excluding currency changes, automotive sales increased 11%. Aerospace sales grew 10%, and machinery sales were up 13% during the quarter. These sales gains we're partially offset by very soft demand in CVP, with second quarter volume in that business down 20%, largely due to an industry change related to marketing programs for commercial vehicles. 
The segment's EBIT and EBIT margin grew slightly, with the benefit from higher volume largely offset by increased performance-based compensation expense and several smaller factors. 
I'll now turn the call over to Matt Flanigan, who will discuss some additional financial details along with our outlook for the full year."

Consistent with our normal seasonality and our internal forecast, operating cash flow in the second quarter was $95 million, down slightly from the same quarter last year. For the 6 months of the year, operating cash flow increased $44 million or 52% to $127 million due to higher earnings and a smaller increase in working capital, which was primarily related to accounts receivable. Adjusted working capital, as a percentage of sales, was 9.9% at the end of the second quarter. Excluding the phone litigation accruals, which are included in current liabilities, working capital was a more seasonally normal 11.6% of annualized sales. 
In May, we declared a quarterly dividend of $0.31 per share. 2015 marks our 44th consecutive annual dividend increase and a compound annual growth rate of 13%. At yesterday's closing price of $50.22, the current yield is 2.5%. 
We repurchased 1.2 million shares of our stock in the second quarter at an average price of $48.04, and issued 200,000 shares, largely for employee benefit plans and option exercises. Our financial base remains very strong and this gives us considerable flexibility when making capital and investment decisions. We ended the quarter with net debt to net capital at 36%, comfortably within our long-standing targeted range of 30% to 40%. We also monitor debt-to-EBITDA, which is another typical financial metric. And at the end of the second quarter, debt was 1.9x our trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA. 
For the full year 2015, we continued to expect strong unit volume growth and margin improvement, which should lead to another year of record earnings per share from continuing operations. As we announced yesterday, we increased our guidance and now anticipate 2015 earnings from continuing operations of $2 to $2.15 per share. Our prior EPS range was $1.95 to $2.10. We also increased the low end of our prior sales guidance and now expect full year sales of $3.95 billion to $4.1 billion. This revised sales [indiscernible] represents a 4% to 8% increase over 2014 and includes an approximately 5% impact from price deflation and currency translation. Based upon this guidance, we now anticipate a full year EBIT margin between 11.3% and 11.6%, which would be our highest EBIT margin level since the year 2000. We again expect operating cash flow to exceed $350 million in 2015. Dividends should require about $170 million of cash and capital expenditures should approximate $120 million for the year. 
As has been our practice, after funding dividends and capital expenditures, remaining cash flow will be prioritized toward competitively advantaged acquisitions. Potential acquisitions must meet stringent strategic and financial criteria. Should no acquisitions come to fruition, and if excess cash flow is available, we have a standing authorization from the board to repurchase up to 10 million shares each year. No specific repurchase commitment or timetable has been established. However, we currently expect to repurchase between 3 million and 5 million shares in 2015 and issue approximately 2.5 million shares, primarily for employee benefit plans and option exercises. 
With those comments, I'll now turn the call back over to Dave Haffner."

And then -- and actually, from a market perspective, there was probably $40 of those increases were obtained. And now, the current forecast based on some softening prices in iron ore that, which is highly correlated to scrap or should I say, vice versa, scrap is highly correlated to irone ore pricing, that we should expect some scrap deflation in August, probably in the range of $15 a ton. So I thought we were at bottom of deflationary cycle starting to see some recovery, that doesn't look to be the case. All that commentary was on long products. On flat products, we believe that we'll see another maybe 10% deflation during the third quarter as compared to second quarter. So we're uncertain."

We're seeing some recovery in Europe, which is a good thing, year-on-year growth. There certainly is a little bit of a step back in China but that has been primarily in passenger cars. The SUV demand continues to grow. We have significantly more demand in each SUV than we due in the passenger cars side of things.

Some available capacity in our home furniture components business will always have some capacity there because there's always a trade-off between Asian demand and North American demand.

But there's been such fundamental change in the portfolio mix over the last few years. And in that process, we become -- I know you've read and I've heard you say this, we become a lot more definitive on how we spend our capital, our shareholders capital. And going forward, we still have a couple of businesses. They're not significant problems at this point, but a couple of businesses such as the mechanical tubing and the CVP portion of our business that are likely to find their way to somebody else's ownership. But going forward, we intend to use the same techniques that we used in the last 7 or 8 years to grow, I mean, we may grew a little quicker than we had anticipated, these things pick up. But our margins will continue to go up. Don't know what the end all there in margins is, I think it will be very difficult to get to 14%, but because of the mix of businesses. But certainly, we have line of sight through 13%. So we got outstanding people running each of our business units. We're stronger today than we've been in really 15 or 20 years.

Good morning, and thank you for participating in our call. Yesterday, we reported record second quarter results from continuing operations, and I'm very pleased to have extended our string of strong quarterly results that began in the second quarter of last year. Sales increased 4% in the quarter. Higher unit volume and acquisitions added 9% to year-over-year sales growth. These gains were partially offset by raw material-related price decreases and currency translation impact, which, combined, reduced sales by 5%. We continue to benefit from the shift in bedding to Comfort Core springs, new Adjustable Bed programs that ramped up last year and ongoing content gains and new program awards in Automotive. Importantly, nearly all of our businesses experienced volume growth in the quarter versus strong prior year comparisons, with sales having grown 9% in the second quarter of last year. Earnings per share from continuing operations were also a second quarter record at $0.53 per share, up 10% from the $0.48 per share we earned in the second quarter of 2014. Earnings benefited primarily from higher unit volumes and pricing discipline, partially offset by a higher effective tax rate.
EBIT increased 17% and EBIT margin improved to 12%, up 130 basis points over second quarter last year. This was the highest quarterly margin that we've achieved in 15 years and reflects the improvements that we've made to our business portfolio and cost structure as well as the strong market positions of our current businesses.
Since the recession in 2009, we've spoken about the earnings leverage from incremental volume produced utilizing excess capacity. With market share gains and higher market demand, our capacity utilization has increased. The margin improvement that we have realized over the past few years reflects, in part, that higher utilization. We still have available capacity to accommodate additional volume in many of our businesses, but there is less today than just a few quarters ago. In certain of our businesses and product lines, we have little to no capacity left, and we are investing meaningful capital dollars to support continued growth.
In Automotive, we are expanding capacity to support new programs that will begin production in 2016 and later years. In bedding, we are investing rapidly in equipment that we build on our own Swiss operation to support the tremendous growth in Comfort Core, which we expect to continue for the next few years. In Adjustable Bed, which operated a single large location just a year ago, we are adding new locations to broaden our geographic scope and expect to be operating four facilities in North America by the end of this year. We are very pleased to be making these investments since they are directly associated with our expectation for continued meaningful growth in some of our strongest-performing businesses.
We assess our overall performance by comparing our total shareholder return to that of peer companies on a rolling 3-year basis. Our target is to achieve TSR in the top 1/3 of the S&P 500 over the long term, which we believe will require an average TSR of 12% to 15% per year. For the 3-year period that ended on December 31, 2014 [ph], we have so far generated compound annual TSR of 31% per year, which places us in the top 20% of the S&P 500.
Now I'll turn the call over to Karl Glassman. Karl?"

In the Residential Furnishings segment, second quarter total sales increased 10%. Same-location sales increased 3% with 7% unit volume growth, partially offset by raw material-related price decreases and currency translation impact. Sales trends for the major businesses and product categories, excluding acquisitions, deflation and currency, were as follows: U.S. Spring component dollar sales increased 15%; innerspring unit volume grew 17%, with Comfort Core up 71% during the quarter; Boxspring unit volume increased 7%; International Spring sales grew 6%; furniture component sales increased 2%, with sales in the seating and sofa sleeper businesses up 6% and motion hardware unit volume up 2%. Sales also increased in Fabric Converting and Geo Components, while volume was down slightly in Carpet Cushion.
Segment EBIT increased slightly in the quarter, but EBIT margin declined with a benefit from higher unit volume, largely offset by other factors, including increased performance-based compensation expense. EBIT margin also reflects the impact of higher adjustable bid passthrough sales and acquired facilities, both of which have lower-than-segment average margins.
In the Commercial Products segment, second quarter total sales increased 28%. Same-location sales increased 18%, primarily from continued strong demand in Adjustable Bed. Unit volume in that business increased 81% during the quarter. Fashion Bed sales grew 12%, Work Furniture same-location sales decreased 5% in the second quarter, reflecting currency translation impact, lower volume in our Chinese operation and a less favorable product mix. Unit volume in North America was up slightly.
In early March, we acquired a European private label manufacturer of high-end upholstered furniture for office, commercial and other settings. This business is complementary to our North American private label operation that allows us to support our Work Furniture customers as they expand globally. This acquisition added 10% to the segment sales growth during the second quarter. The segment's EBIT and EBIT margin increased in the second quarter, primarily due to higher sales. As Dave mentioned, we are rapidly expanding production capacity in our Adjustable Bed business to support continued strong demand in that category.
In the Industrial Materials segment, second quarter sales decreased 9%, entirely from steel-related price reductions. Unit volumes were roughly flat, with growth in Drawn Wire, driven by strong bedding demand, offset by lower trade sales from our rod mill. A softer steel market and scheduled equipment upgrades at the rod mill resulted in fewer trade shipments, as was expected, versus the second quarter of last year. EBIT and EBIT margin increased significantly during the quarter, primarily due to cost reductions and pricing discipline.
In the Specialized Products segment, second quarter sales were flat, with an approximate 5% volume improvement, offset by currency translation impact. Excluding currency changes, Automotive sales increased 11%; Aerospace sales grew 10%; and Machinery sales were up 13% during the quarter. These sales gains were partially offset by very soft demand in CVP, with second quarter volume in that business down 20%, largely due to an industry change related to marketing programs for commercial vehicles.
The segment's EBIT and EBIT margin grew slightly, with a benefit from higher volume, largely offset by increased performance-based compensation expense and several smaller factors.
I'll now turn the call over to Matt Flanigan, who will discuss some additional financial details along with our outlook for the full year."

Consistent with our normal seasonality and our internal forecast, operating cash flow in the second quarter was $95 million, down slightly from the same quarter last year. For the 6 months of the year, operating cash flow increased $44 million or 52% to $127 million due to higher earnings and a smaller increase in working capital, which was primarily related to accounts receivable. Adjusted working capital, as a percentage of sales, was 9.9% at the end of the second quarter. Excluding the foam litigation accruals, which are included in current liabilities, working capital was a more seasonally normal 11.6% of annualized sales.
In May, we declared a quarterly dividend of $0.31 per share. 2015 marks our 44th consecutive annual dividend increase at a compound annual growth rate of 13%. At yesterday's closing price of $50.22, the current yield is 2.5%.
We repurchased 1.2 million shares of our stock in the second quarter at an average price of $48.04 and issued 200,000 shares, largely for employee benefit plans and option exercises. Our financial base remains very strong, and this gives us considerable flexibility when making capital and investment decisions. We ended the quarter with net-debt-to-net-capital at 36%, comfortably within our longstanding targeted range of 30% to 40%. We also monitor debt-to-EBITDA, which is another typical financial metric. And at the end of the second quarter, debt was 1.9x our trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA.
For the full year 2015, we continue to expect strong unit volume growth and margin improvement, which should lead to another year of record earnings per share from continuing operations. As we announced yesterday, we increased our guidance and now anticipate 2015 earnings from continuing operations of $2 to $2.15 per share. Our prior EPS range was $1.95 to $2.10. We also increased the low end of our prior sales guidance and now expect full year sales of $3.95 billion to $4.1 billion. This revised sales guidance represents a 4% to 8% increase over 2014 and includes an approximate 5% impact from raw material-related price deflation and currency translation. Based upon this guidance, we now anticipate a full year EBIT margin between 11.3% and 11.6%, which would be our highest EBIT margin level since the year 2000. We again expect operating cash flow to exceed $350 million in 2015. Dividends should require about $170 million of cash, and capital expenditures should approximate $120 million for the year.
As has been our practice, after funding dividends and capital expenditures, remaining cash flow will be prioritized toward competitively advantaged acquisitions. Potential acquisitions must meet stringent strategic and financial criteria. Should no acquisitions come to fruition, and if excess cash flow is available, we have a standing authorization from the board to repurchase up to 10 million shares each year. No specific repurchase commitment or timetable has been established. However, we currently expect to repurchase between 3 million and 5 million shares in 2015 and issue approximately 2.5 million shares, primarily for employee benefit plans and option exercises.
With those comments, I'll now turn the call back over to Dave Haffner."

And then -- and actually, from a market perspective, there was -- probably $40 of those increases were obtained. And now, the current forecast, based on some softening prices in iron ore that -- which is highly correlated to scrap, or I should say vice versa, scrap is highly correlated iron ore pricing, that we expect some scrap deflation in August, probably in the range of $15 a ton. So I thought we were at bottom of deflationary cycle, starting to see some recovery, that doesn't look to be the case. All that commentary was on long products. On flat products, we believe that we'll see another maybe 10% deflation during the third quarter as compared to second quarter though we're uncertain."

I thought it might take us to $4.2 billion to get back to $2 and so we were able to get there a little bit earlier on revenue.

And in that process, we've become -- I know you've read and kind of heard us say this, we've become a lot more definitive on how we spend our capital -- or our shareholders' capital. And going forward, we still have a couple of businesses, they're not significant problems at this point. But a couple of businesses such as the mechanical tubing and the CVP portion of our business, that are likely to find their way to somebody else's ownership. But going forward, we intend to use the same techniques that we've used in the last 7 or 8 years to grow. We may grow a little quicker than we had anticipated, these things pick up. But our margins will continue to go up, don't know what the end-all there in margins is. I think it would be very difficult to get to 14% but -- because of the mix of businesses, but certainly, we have a line of sight through 13%.

          Thank you, Dave. Good morning, and thank you for participating in our call. Yesterday, we reported record second quarter results from continuing operations, and I'm very pleased to have extended our string of strong quarterly results that began in the second quarter of last year. Sales increased 4% in the quarter. Higher unit volume and acquisitions added 9% to year-over-year sales growth. These gains were partially offset by raw material-related price decreases and currency translation impact, which, combined, reduced sales by 5%. We continue to benefit from the shift in bedding to Comfort Core springs, new Adjustable Bed programs that ramped up last year and ongoing content gains and new program awards in Automotive. Importantly, nearly all of our businesses experienced volume growth in the quarter versus strong prior year comparisons, with sales having grown 9% in the second quarter of last year. Earnings per share from continuing operations were also a second quarter record at $0.53 per share, up 10% from the $0.48 per share we earned in the second quarter of 2014. Earnings benefited primarily from higher unit volumes and pricing discipline, partially offset by a higher effective tax rate.
          EBIT increased 17% and EBIT margin improved to 12%, up 130 basis points over second quarter last year. This was the highest quarterly margin that we've achieved in 15 years and reflects the improvements that we've made to our business portfolio and cost structure as well as the strong market positions of our current businesses.
          Since the recession in 2009, we've spoken about the earnings leverage from incremental volume produced utilizing excess capacity. With market share gains and higher market demand, our capacity utilization has increased. The margin improvement that we have realized over the past few years reflects, in part, that higher utilization. We still have available capacity to accommodate additional volume in many of our businesses, but there is less today than just a few quarters ago. In certain of our businesses and product lines, we have little to no capacity left, and we are investing meaningful capital dollars to support continued growth.
          In Automotive, we are expanding capacity to support new programs that will begin production in 2016 and later years. In bedding, we are investing rapidly in equipment that we build on our own Swiss operation to support the tremendous growth in Comfort Core, which we expect to continue for the next few years. In Adjustable Bed, which operated a single large location just a year ago, we are adding new locations to broaden our geographic scope and expect to be operating four facilities in North America by the end of this year. We are very pleased to be making these investments since they are directly associated with our expectation for continued meaningful growth in some of our strongest-performing businesses.
          We assess our overall performance by comparing our total shareholder return to that of peer companies on a rolling 3-year basis. Our target is to achieve TSR in the top 1/3 of the S&P 500 over the long term, which we believe will require an average TSR of 12% to 15% per year. For the 3-year period that ended on December 31, 2015, we have so far generated compound annual TSR of 31% per year, which places us in the top 20% of the S&P 500.
          Now I'll turn the call over to Karl Glassman. Karl?"

          Thank you, Dave, and good morning. Most of our businesses continued to perform extremely well during the second quarter. In the Residential Furnishings segment, second quarter total sales increased 10%. Same-location sales increased 3% with 7% unit volume growth, partially offset by raw material-related price decreases and currency translation impact. Sales trends for the major businesses and product categories, excluding acquisitions, deflation and currency, were as follows: U.S. Spring component dollar sales increased 15%; innerspring unit volume grew 17%, with Comfort Core up 71% during the quarter; Boxspring unit volume increased 7%; International Spring sales grew 6%; furniture component sales increased 2%, with sales in the seating and sofa sleeper businesses up 6% and motion hardware unit volume up 2%. Sales also increased in Fabric Converting and Geo Components, while volume was down slightly in Carpet Cushion.
          Segment EBIT increased slightly in the quarter, but EBIT margin declined with a benefit from higher unit volume, largely offset by other factors, including increased performance-based compensation expense. EBIT margin also reflects the impact of higher adjustable bid passthrough sales and acquired facilities, both of which have lower-than-segment average margins.
          In the Commercial Products segment, second quarter total sales increased 28%. Same-location sales increased 18%, primarily from continued strong demand in Adjustable Bed. Unit volume in that business increased 81% during the quarter. Fashion Bed sales grew 12%, Work Furniture same-location sales decreased 5% in the second quarter, reflecting currency translation impact, lower volume in our Chinese operation and a less favorable product mix. Unit volume in North America was up slightly.
          In early March, we acquired a European private label manufacturer of high-end upholstered furniture for office, commercial and other settings. This business is complementary to our North American private label operation that allows us to support our Work Furniture customers as they expand globally. This acquisition added 10% to the segment sales growth during the second quarter. The segment's EBIT and EBIT margin increased in the second quarter, primarily due to higher sales. As Dave mentioned, we are rapidly expanding production capacity in our Adjustable Bed business to support continued strong demand in that category.
          In the Industrial Materials segment, second quarter sales decreased 9%, entirely from steel-related price reductions. Unit volumes were roughly flat, with growth in Drawn Wire, driven by strong bedding demand, offset by lower trade sales from our rod mill. A softer steel market and scheduled equipment upgrades at the rod mill resulted in fewer trade shipments, as was expected, versus the second quarter of last year. EBIT and EBIT margin increased significantly during the quarter, primarily due to cost reductions and pricing discipline.
          In the Specialized Products segment, second quarter sales were flat, with an approximate 5% volume improvement, offset by currency translation impact. Excluding currency changes, Automotive sales increased 11%; Aerospace sales grew 10%; and Machinery sales were up 13% during the quarter. These sales gains were partially offset by very soft demand in CVP, with second quarter volume in that business down 20%, largely due to an industry change related to marketing programs for commercial vehicles.
          The segment's EBIT and EBIT margin grew slightly, with the benefit from higher volume, largely offset by increased performance-based compensation expense and several smaller factors.
          I'll now turn the call over to Matt Flanigan, who will discuss some additional financial details along with our outlook for the full year."

          Thanks, Karl, and good morning, everyone. Consistent with our normal seasonality and our internal forecast, operating cash flow in the second quarter was $95 million, down slightly from the same quarter last year. For the 6 months of the year, operating cash flow increased $44 million or 52% to $127 million due to higher earnings and a smaller increase in working capital, which was primarily related to accounts receivable. Adjusted working capital, as a percentage of sales, was 9.9% at the end of the second quarter. Excluding the foam litigation accruals, which are included in current liabilities, working capital was a more seasonally normal 11.6% of annualized sales.
          In May, we declared a quarterly dividend of $0.31 per share. 2015 marks our 44th consecutive annual dividend increase at a compound annual growth rate of 13%. At yesterday's closing price of $50.22, the current yield is 2.5%.
          We repurchased 1.2 million shares of our stock in the second quarter at an average price of $48.04 and issued 200,000 shares, largely for employee benefit plans and option exercises. Our financial base remains very strong, and this gives us considerable flexibility when making capital and investment decisions. We ended the quarter with net-debt-to-net-capital at 36%, comfortably within our longstanding targeted range of 30% to 40%. We also monitor debt-to-EBITDA, which is another typical financial metric. And at the end of the second quarter, debt was 1.9x our trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA.
          For the full year 2015, we continue to expect strong unit volume growth and margin improvement, which should lead to another year of record earnings per share from continuing operations. As we announced yesterday, we increased our guidance and now anticipate 2015 earnings from continuing operations of $2 to $2.15 per share. Our prior EPS range was $1.95 to $2.10. We also increased the low end of our prior sales guidance and now expect full year sales of $3.95 billion to $4.1 billion. This revised sales guidance represents a 4% to 8% increase over 2014 and includes an approximate 5% impact from raw material-related price deflation and currency translation. Based upon this guidance, we now anticipate a full year EBIT margin between 11.3% and 11.6%, which would be our highest EBIT margin level since the year 2000. We again expect operating cash flow to exceed $350 million in 2015. Dividends should require about $170 million of cash, and capital expenditures should approximate $120 million for the year.
          As has been our practice, after funding dividends and capital expenditures, remaining cash flow will be prioritized toward competitively advantaged acquisitions. Potential acquisitions must meet stringent strategic and financial criteria. Should no acquisitions come to fruition, and if excess cash flow is available, we have a standing authorization from the board to repurchase up to 10 million shares each year. No specific repurchase commitment or timetable has been established. However, we currently expect to repurchase between 3 million and 5 million shares in 2015 and issue approximately 2.5 million shares, primarily for employee benefit plans and option exercises.
          With those comments, I'll now turn the call back over to Dave Haffner."

          Keith, this is Karl. Our forecast has changed a little bit in the last 30 days. 30 days, we would have told you that, based on about a $15 a ton inflation in scrap from April through May, that we would see continued price re-inflation. In the market, there was a $15 to $25 a ton increase in wire and rod announced for June 1 and then another $25 for July 1. And then -- and actually, from a market perspective, there was -- probably $40 of those increases were obtained. And now, the current forecast, based on some softening prices in iron ore that -- which is highly correlated to scrap, or I should say vice versa, scrap is highly correlated to iron ore pricing, that we expect some scrap deflation in August, probably in the range of $15 a ton. So I thought we were at bottom of deflationary cycle, starting to see some recovery, that doesn't look to be the case. All that commentary was on long products. On flat products, we believe that we'll see another maybe 10% deflation during the third quarter as compared to second quarter though we're uncertain."

We're continuing to be fortunate enough to continue to get new automotive awards that allow us to re-invest in those long-term programs. As I said earlier, in the answer to Dan, I don't believe we're near the end of the cycle from a Comfort Core expansion perspective. The category of Adjustable Beds, to Dennis' point, the category is growing 30%, independent of program wins, so we're really bullish. As long as the economy stays well, stays strong, we're ready and willing to invest. There's about a $30 million annual call on just maintenance capital, so that's a given. It's hard to forecast, but we love those investments. Our people do a great job of getting a return on it."

You just broke all of DeSonier's rules. From a capacity -- available capacity perspective, as you know, as you make reference, we used to talk in terms of $400 million. Today, we believe that number is south of $200 million, probably in the range of $150 million, we're going to update that analysis internally. The areas of available capacity, at this point, are primarily in places like Work Furniture. There's a little bit available capacity in some of our International Spring. I assure you there's capacity in Brazil today. Some available capacity in our home furniture components business. We'll always have some capacity there because there's always a trade-off between Asian demand and North American demand. Those would be the biggest areas. CVPs, a place where there's a lot of capacity, some of that we're taking offline now. The answer to the Sealy plants is, we've been fortunate in that the demand has been greater than the pro forma that our people developed. And we just anniversary-ed the acquisition of those component facilities. The growth of unit demand and then their switch to Comfort Core has put us in a position, where we're continuing to run the vast majority of those assets. We just don't know. We expect that demand will continue to hold. We are ahead of our financial pro forma pretty significantly. Our people are doing a great job of executing in a demand environment, where we're so pushed for capacity that we probably push some of our people to their elastic limit, so we need to continue to bring on capacity. But we're pleased with that acquisition. But to the -- back to the point of my prepared remarks, it is dilutive to residential margins, as we originally forecasted."

          Fred, thanks for reminding me of my statement. I, obviously, didn't expect the economy to do what it did when I made that statement, and it was basic algebra. I thought it might take us to $4.2 billion to get back to $2 and so we were able to get there a little bit earlier on revenue. But there's been such fundamental change in the portfolio mix over the last few years. And in that process, we've become -- I know you've read and kind of heard us say this, we've become a lot more definitive on how we spend our capital -- or our shareholders' capital. And going forward, we still have a couple of businesses, they're not significant problems at this point. But a couple of businesses such as the mechanical tubing and the CVP portion of our business, that are likely to find their way to somebody else's ownership. But going forward, we intend to use the same techniques that we've used in the last 7 or 8 years to grow. We may grow a little quicker than we had anticipated, these things pick up. But our margins will continue to go up, don't know what the end-all there in margins is. I think it would be very difficult to get to 14% but -- because of the mix of businesses, but certainly, we have a line of sight through 13%. So we've got outstanding people running each of our business units. We're stronger today than we've been in really 15 or 20 years. And I think the operating and strategic profile that we've put together will serve us well for the next several years."

Good morning, and thank you for participating in our call. Yesterday, we reported record second quarter results from continuing operations, and I'm very pleased to have extended our string of strong quarterly results that began in the second quarter of last year. Sales increased 4% in the quarter. Higher unit volume and acquisitions added 9% to year-over-year sales growth. These gains were partially offset by raw material-related price decreases and currency translation impact, which, combined, reduced sales by 5%. We continue to benefit from the shift in bedding to Comfort Core springs, new Adjustable Bed programs that ramped up last year and ongoing content gains and new program awards in Automotive. Importantly, nearly all of our businesses experienced volume growth in the quarter versus strong prior year comparisons, with sales having grown 9% in the second quarter of last year. Earnings per share from continuing operations were also a second quarter record at $0.53 per share, up 10% from the $0.48 per share we earned in the second quarter of 2014. Earnings benefited primarily from higher unit volumes and pricing discipline, partially offset by a higher effective tax rate.
EBIT increased 17% and EBIT margin improved to 12%, up 130 basis points over second quarter last year. This was the highest quarterly margin that we've achieved in 15 years and reflects the improvements that we've made to our business portfolio and cost structure as well as the strong market positions of our current businesses.
Since the recession in 2009, we've spoken about the earnings leverage from incremental volume produced utilizing excess capacity. With market share gains and higher market demand, our capacity utilization has increased. The margin improvement that we have realized over the past few years reflects, in part, that higher utilization. We still have available capacity to accommodate additional volume in many of our businesses, but there is less today than just a few quarters ago. In certain of our businesses and product lines, we have little to no capacity left, and we are investing meaningful capital dollars to support continued growth.
In Automotive, we are expanding capacity to support new programs that will begin production in 2016 and later years. In bedding, we are investing rapidly in equipment that we build on our own Swiss operation to support the tremendous growth in Comfort Core, which we expect to continue for the next few years. In Adjustable Bed, which operated a single large location just a year ago, we are adding new locations to broaden our geographic scope and expect to be operating four facilities in North America by the end of this year. We are very pleased to be making these investments since they are directly associated with our expectation for continued meaningful growth in some of our strongest-performing businesses.
We assess our overall performance by comparing our total shareholder return to that of peer companies on a rolling 3-year basis. Our target is to achieve TSR in the top 1/3 of the S&P 500 over the long term, which we believe will require an average TSR of 12% to 15% per year. For the 3-year period that ended on December 31, 2015, we have so far generated compound annual TSR of 31% per year, which places us in the top 20% of the S&P 500.
Now I'll turn the call over to Karl Glassman. Karl?"

In the Residential Furnishings segment, second quarter total sales increased 10%. Same-location sales increased 3% with 7% unit volume growth, partially offset by raw material-related price decreases and currency translation impact. Sales trends for the major businesses and product categories, excluding acquisitions, deflation and currency, were as follows: U.S. Spring component dollar sales increased 15%; innerspring unit volume grew 17%, with Comfort Core up 71% during the quarter; Boxspring unit volume increased 7%; International Spring sales grew 6%; furniture component sales increased 2%, with sales in the seating and sofa sleeper businesses up 6% and motion hardware unit volume up 2%. Sales also increased in Fabric Converting and Geo Components, while volume was down slightly in Carpet Cushion.
Segment EBIT increased slightly in the quarter, but EBIT margin declined with a benefit from higher unit volume, largely offset by other factors, including increased performance-based compensation expense. EBIT margin also reflects the impact of higher adjustable bid pass-through sales and acquired facilities, both of which have lower-than-segment average margins.
In the Commercial Products segment, second quarter total sales increased 28%. Same-location sales increased 18%, primarily from continued strong demand in Adjustable Bed. Unit volume in that business increased 81% during the quarter. Fashion Bed sales grew 12%, Work Furniture same-location sales decreased 5% in the second quarter, reflecting currency translation impact, lower volume in our Chinese operation and a less favorable product mix. Unit volume in North America was up slightly.
In early March, we acquired a European private label manufacturer of high-end upholstered furniture for office, commercial and other settings. This business is complementary to our North American private label operation that allows us to support our Work Furniture customers as they expand globally. This acquisition added 10% to the segment sales growth during the second quarter. The segment's EBIT and EBIT margin increased in the second quarter, primarily due to higher sales. As Dave mentioned, we are rapidly expanding production capacity in our Adjustable Bed business to support continued strong demand in that category.
In the Industrial Materials segment, second quarter sales decreased 9%, entirely from steel-related price reductions. Unit volumes were roughly flat, with growth in Drawn Wire, driven by strong bedding demand, offset by lower trade sales from our rod mill. A softer steel market and scheduled equipment upgrades at the rod mill resulted in fewer trade shipments, as was expected, versus the second quarter of last year. EBIT and EBIT margin increased significantly during the quarter, primarily due to cost reductions and pricing discipline.
In the Specialized Products segment, second quarter sales were flat, with an approximate 5% volume improvement, offset by currency translation impact. Excluding currency changes, Automotive sales increased 11%; Aerospace sales grew 10%; and Machinery sales were up 13% during the quarter. These sales gains were partially offset by very soft demand in CVP, with second quarter volume in that business down 20%, largely due to an industry change related to marketing programs for commercial vehicles.
The segment's EBIT and EBIT margin grew slightly, with the benefit from higher volume, largely offset by increased performance-based compensation expense and several smaller factors.
I'll now turn the call over to Matt Flanigan, who will discuss some additional financial details along with our outlook for the full year."

Consistent with our normal seasonality and our internal forecast, operating cash flow in the second quarter was $95 million, down slightly from the same quarter last year. For the 6 months of the year, operating cash flow increased $44 million or 52% to $127 million due to higher earnings and a smaller increase in working capital, which was primarily related to accounts receivable. Adjusted working capital, as a percentage of sales, was 9.9% at the end of the second quarter. Excluding the foam litigation accruals, which are included in current liabilities, working capital was a more seasonally normal 11.6% of annualized sales.
In May, we declared a quarterly dividend of $0.31 per share. 2015 marks our 44th consecutive annual dividend increase at a compound annual growth rate of 13%. At yesterday's closing price of $50.22, the current yield is 2.5%.
We repurchased 1.2 million shares of our stock in the second quarter at an average price of $48.04 and issued 200,000 shares, largely for employee benefit plans and option exercises. Our financial base remains very strong, and this gives us considerable flexibility when making capital and investment decisions. We ended the quarter with net-debt-to-net-capital at 36%, comfortably within our longstanding targeted range of 30% to 40%. We also monitor debt-to-EBITDA, which is another typical financial metric. And at the end of the second quarter, debt was 1.9x our trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA.
For the full year 2015, we continue to expect strong unit volume growth and margin improvement, which should lead to another year of record earnings per share from continuing operations. As we announced yesterday, we increased our guidance and now anticipate 2015 earnings from continuing operations of $2 to $2.15 per share. Our prior EPS range was $1.95 to $2.10. We also increased the low end of our prior sales guidance and now expect full year sales of $3.95 billion to $4.1 billion. This revised sales guidance represents a 4% to 8% increase over 2014 and includes an approximate 5% impact from raw material-related price deflation and currency translation. Based upon this guidance, we now anticipate a full year EBIT margin between 11.3% and 11.6%, which would be our highest EBIT margin level since the year 2000. We again expect operating cash flow to exceed $350 million in 2015. Dividends should require about $170 million of cash, and capital expenditures should approximate $120 million for the year.
As has been our practice, after funding dividends and capital expenditures, remaining cash flow will be prioritized toward competitively advantaged acquisitions. Potential acquisitions must meet stringent strategic and financial criteria. Should no acquisitions come to fruition, and if excess cash flow is available, we have a standing authorization from the board to repurchase up to 10 million shares each year. No specific repurchase commitment or timetable has been established. However, we currently expect to repurchase between 3 million and 5 million shares in 2015 and issue approximately 2.5 million shares, primarily for employee benefit plans and option exercises.
With those comments, I'll now turn the call back over to Dave Haffner."

And then -- and actually, from a market perspective, there was -- probably $40 of those increases were obtained. And now the current forecast, based on some softening prices in iron ore that -- which is highly correlated to scrap, or I should say vice versa, scrap is highly correlated to iron ore pricing, that we expect some scrap deflation in August, probably in the range of $15 a ton. So I thought we were at bottom of deflationary cycle, starting to see some recovery, that doesn't look to be the case. All that commentary was on long products. On flat products, we believe that we'll see another maybe 10% deflation during the third quarter as compared to second quarter though we're uncertain."

We're seeing some recovery in Europe, which is a good thing, year-on-year growth. There certainly is a little bit of a step-back in China, but that has been primarily in passenger cars. The SUV demand continues to grow. We have significantly more demand in each SUV than we do in the passenger car side of things.

I thought it might take us to $4.2 billion to get back to $2 and so we were able to get there a little bit earlier on revenue. But there's been such fundamental change in the portfolio mix over the last few years. And in that process, we've become -- I know you've read and kind of heard us say this, we've become a lot more definitive on how we spend our capital -- or our shareholders' capital. And going forward, we still have a couple of businesses, they're not significant problems at this point. But a couple of businesses such as the mechanical tubing and the CVP portion of our business, that are likely to find their way to somebody else's ownership. But going forward, we intend to use the same techniques that we've used in the last 7 or 8 years to grow. We may grow a little quicker than we had anticipated, these things pick up. But our margins will continue to go up, don't know what the end-all there in margins is. I think it would be very difficult to get to 14% but -- because of the mix of businesses, but certainly, we have a line of sight through 13%. So we've got outstanding people running each of our business units. We're stronger today than we've been in really 15 or 20 years. And I think the operating and strategic profile that we've put together will serve us well for the next several years."

We continue to be extremely pleased with our performance this year, and again reported strong quarterly results from continuing operations. During the third quarter, we achieved record levels of sales, EBIT and earnings per share. Sales from continuing operations were $1.01 billion and increased 1% over the prior year. Higher unit volume and acquisitions added 7% to year-over-year sales growth. These gains were largely offset by raw material-related price decreases and currency impacts, which combined to reduce sales by 6%. We continue to benefit from the shift in bedding to Comfort Core springs, strong growth of Adjustable Beds and ongoing content gains in new program awards in automotive. Importantly, nearly all of our businesses again experienced volume growth in the quarter versus strong prior-year compressions, with sales having grown 14% in the third quarter of last year. Third quarter earnings per share were a record $0.67, up $0.31 from the $0.51 of adjusted EPS from continuing operations reported in the third quarter last year. Earnings grew primarily from higher unit volume and pricing discipline. EBIT increased 33% when compared to last year's adjusted EBIT and EBIT margin improved to 14%, up 330 basis points over third quarter last year. We assess our overall performance by comparing our total shareholder return to that of peer companies on a rolling three-year basis. Our target is to achieve TSR in the top 1/3 of the S&P 500 over the long term, which we believe will require an average TSR of 12% to 15% per year for the 3-year period that will end on December 31, 2015, we have so far generated a compounded annual TSR of 23% per year, which places us in the top 29% of the S&P 500.

Margins improved in all 4 segments and unit volumes grew in most of our major businesses. However, commodity deflation and currency impact continue to mask some of the sales growth. In the Residential Furnishings segment, third quarter total sales decreased to 1%. Same location sales decreased 2% with 5% unit volume growth more than offset by raw material-related price decreases and currency impact. Sales trends for the major businesses and product categories, excluding acquisitions, deflation and currency were as follows: U.S. Spring component dollar sales increase 7%, innerspring unit volume grew 4% with Comfort Core up 37% during the quarter; unit volume increased 3%; international spring sales grew 6%; furniture component sales increased 8% with sales in the seating and business up 15%; and motion hardware unit volume up 6%. Sales also increased in fabric and components, while volume was down marginally in Carpet Cushion. Segment EBIT and EBIT margin increased in the quarter due to the non-reoccurrence of last year's home litigation expense. Excluding this prior-year charge, EBIT improved slightly with the benefit from higher unit volume, largely offset by FIFO impact and several smaller factors. EBIT margin in the segment is also affected by higher adjustable bed sales at lower than segment average margins. In the commercial product segment, third quarter total sales increased 26%. Same location sales grew 15%, primarily from continued strong performance in our Adjustable Bed and Fashion Bed businesses. Adjustable Bed unit volume increased 55% during the quarter. Work Furniture same location sales were down slightly in the third quarter, primarily from currency impact. Unit volume in our North American Work Furniture business was up marginally. 
In early March, we acquired a European private label manufacturer of high-end upholstered furniture for office, commercial and other settings. This business is complimentary to our North American private label operation and allows us to support our Work Furniture customers as they expand globally. This acquisition added 11% to the second sales growth during the third quarter. The Commercial Products segment EBIT and EBIT margin increased in the third quarter, primarily due to higher sales and improved operational efficiency. 
In the Industrial Materials segment, third quarter sales decreased 14%, largely from steel-related price reductions. Unit volumes decreased slightly with growth and Drawn Wire more than offset by lower trade sales from our rod mill. EBIT and EBIT margin increased during the quarter, primarily due to cost reductions. 
In the Specialized Products segment, third quarter sales increased 5% with an approximate 10% volume improvement, partially offset by current currency impact. Excluding currency changes, automotive sales increased 13%, aerospace grew 3%, machinery sales were up 8% and CVP grew 7%. The segment's EBIT and EBIT margin also improved, primarily reflecting higher unit volume and the non-reoccurrence of last year's litigation accrual. I will now turn the call over to Matt."

Operating cash flow in the third quarter was $130 million. For the first 9 months of 2015, operating cash flow was $257 million, an increase of $41 million or 19% over the prior year, primarily due to higher earnings. Adjusted working capital as a percentage of sales was 9.4% at the end of the third quarter. Excluding last year's foam litigation accruals, some of which are still on our balance sheet and included in liabilities, working capital was a very low 10.5% of annualized sales. In August, we increased the quarterly dividend to $0.32 per share. In 2015 44 consecutive annual dividend increase at a compound annual growth rate of 13%. And yesterday's closing price of $44.64, our current yield is 2.9%. We repurchased 900,000 shares of our stock in the third quarter at an average price of $45.61 and issued 200,000 shares, largely for employee benefit plans and option exercises. Our financial base remains very strong, and this gives us considerable flexibility when making capital and investment decisions. We ended the quarter with net debt to net capital at 36%, comfortably within our long-standing targeted range of 30% to 40%. We also monitored debt-to-EBITDA. At the end of the third quarter our debt was 1.7x our trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA. 
Given our strong third quarter results, we are raising our full year 2015 EPS guidance and now anticipate record earnings from continuing operations of $2.15 to $2.25 per share. Our prior EPS range was $2. to $2.15. With ongoing raw material-related price deflation and currency impact, we're lowering sales guidance to a range of $3.92 billion to $3.98 billion. This revised sales range represents a 4% to 5% increase over 2014, and includes an approximate 5% negative impact from deflation and currency. Based upon this guidance, we now anticipate a full year EBIT margin between 11.9% and 12.3%, which would be our highest level since 1999. We expect operating cash flow to exceed $375 million in 2015, dividends should require about $170 million of cash and capital expenditures should approximate $110 million for the year. As has been our practice, after funding dividends and capital expenditures, remaining cash flow will be prioritized toward competitively advantaged acquisitions. Potential acquisitions must meet stringent strategic and financial criteria. Should no acquisitions come to fruition, and if excess cash flow is available, we have a standing authorization from the board to repurchase up to 10 million shares each year. No specific repurchase commitment or timetable has been established; however, we currently expect to repurchase about 4 million shares in 2015 and issue approximately 2.2 million shares, primarily for employee benefit plans and option exercises. 
Regarding 2016 outlook. Sales growth, excluding possible acquisitions or divestitures is expected to be in the mid-single digits next year. We anticipate continued strong unit volume growth in many of our product categories. But this will likely be partially offset by commodity-related price deflation since steel prices have continued to decline throughout 2015. Full year EBIT margin is expected to be roughly in line with 2015 as the margin benefit from higher unit volume next year is likely to be offset by the non-recurrence of the 2015 pricing lag. This framework assumes that commodity prices will stabilize their current levels. As is our practice, we will issue formal 2016 sales and EPS guidance when we announce our fourth quarter results on February 1. With those comments, I will now turn the call back over to Dave Haffner."

The consumer continues to be pretty confident. The confidence are a little choppy. Housing, same thing. That we continue to see housing growth, again month-to-month might be a little choppy, but the trends are positive in both ways. So we feel pretty darn good.

We continue to be extremely pleased with our performance this year, and again reported strong quarterly results from continuing operations. During the third quarter, we achieved record levels of sales, EBIT and earnings per share. Sales from continuing operations were $1.01 billion and increased 1% over the prior year. Higher unit volume and acquisitions added 7% to year-over-year sales growth. These gains were largely offset by raw material-related price decreases and currency impact, which combined to reduce sales by 6%. We continue to benefit from the shift in bedding to Comfort Core springs, strong growth of Adjustable Beds and ongoing content gains in new program awards in automotive. Importantly, nearly all of our businesses again experienced volume growth in the quarter versus strong prior-year comparisons, with sales having grown 14% in the third quarter of last year. Third quarter earnings per share were a record $0.67, up 31% from the $0.51 of adjusted EPS from continuing operations reported in the third quarter last year. Earnings grew primarily from higher unit volume and pricing discipline. EBIT increased 33% when compared to last year's adjusted EBIT and EBIT margin improved to 14%, up 330 basis points over third quarter of last year. We assess our overall performance by comparing our total shareholder return to that of peer companies on a rolling 3-year basis. Our target is to achieve TSR in the top 1/3 of the S&P 500 over the long term, which we believe will require an average TSR of 12% to 15% per year. For the 3-year period that will end on December 31, 2015, we have so far generated compound annual TSR of 23% per year, which places us in the top 29% of the S&P 500. I will now turn the call over to Karl."

Margins improved in all 4 segments and unit volumes grew in most of our major businesses. However, commodity deflation and currency impact continue to mask some of the sales growth. In the Residential Furnishings segment, third quarter total sales decreased to 1%. Same-location sales decreased 2% with 5% unit volume growth more than offset by raw material-related price decreases and currency impact. Sales trends for the major businesses and product categories, excluding acquisitions, deflation and currency were as follows: U.S. Spring component dollar sales increased 7%, innerspring unit volume grew 4% with Comfort Core up 37% during the quarter; Boxspring unit volume increased 3%; International Spring sales grew 6%; furniture component sales increased 8% with sales in the seating and sofa sleeper business up 15%; and motion hardware unit volume up 6%. Sales also increased in Fabric Converting and Geo Components, while volume was down marginally in Carpet Cushion. 
Segment EBIT and EBIT margin increased in the quarter due to the non-reoccurrence of last year's foam litigation expense. Excluding this prior-year charge, EBIT improved slightly with the benefit from higher unit volume, largely offset by FIFO impact and several smaller factors. EBIT margin in the segment is also affected by higher Adjustable Bed passthrough sales at lower than segment average margins. 
In the Commercial Product segment, third quarter total sales increased 26%. Same-location sales grew 15%, primarily from continued strong performance in our Adjustable Bed and Fashion Bed businesses. Adjustable Bed unit volume increased 55% during the quarter. Work Furniture, same-location sales were down slightly for the -- in the third quarter, primarily from currency impact. Unit volume in our North American Work Furniture business was up marginally. 
In early March, we acquired a European private label manufacturer of high-end upholstered furniture for office, commercial and other settings. This business is complementary to our North American private label operation and allows us to support our Work Furniture customers as they expand globally. This acquisition added 11% to the segment sales growth during the third quarter. The Commercial Products segment EBIT and EBIT margin increased in the third quarter, primarily due to higher sales and improved operational efficiency.
In the Industrial Materials segment, third quarter sales decreased 14%, largely from steel-related price reductions. Unit volume decreased slightly with growth in Drawn Wire more than offset by lower trade sales from our rod mill. EBIT and EBIT margin increased during the quarter, primarily due to cost reductions.
In the Specialized Products segment, third quarter sales increased 5% with an approximate 10% volume improvement, partially offset by currency impact. Excluding currency changes, Automotive sales increased 13%, Aerospace grew 3%, Machinery sales were up 8% and CVP grew 7%. The segment's EBIT and EBIT margin also improved, primarily reflecting higher unit volume and the non-reoccurrence of last year's litigation accrual. I will now turn the call over to Matt."

Operating cash flow in the third quarter was $130 million. For the first 9 months of 2015, operating cash flow was $257 million, an increase of $41 million or 19% over the prior year, primarily due to higher earnings. Adjusted working capital as a percentage of sales was 9.4% at the end of the third quarter. Excluding last year's foam litigation accruals, some of which are still on our balance sheet and included in current liabilities, working capital was a very low 10.5% of annualized sales. In August, we increased the quarterly dividend to $0.32 per share. And 2015 marks our 44th consecutive annual dividend increase at a compound annual growth rate of 13%. And yesterday's closing price of $44.64, our current yield is 2.9%. We repurchased 900,000 shares of our stock in the third quarter at an average price of $45.61 and issued 200,000 shares, largely for employee benefit plans and option exercises. Our financial base remains very strong, and this gives us considerable flexibility when making capital and investment decisions. We ended the quarter with net-debt-to-net-capital at 36%, comfortably within our long-standing targeted range of 30% to 40%. We also monitored debt-to-EBITDA. At the end of the third quarter, our debt was 1.7x our trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA. 
Given our strong third quarter results, we are raising our full year 2015 EPS guidance and now anticipate record earnings from continuing operations of $2.15 to $2.25 per share. Our prior EPS range was $2 to $2.15. 
With ongoing raw material-related price deflation and currency impact, we're lowering sales guidance to a range of $3.92 billion to $3.98 billion. This revised sales range represents a 4% to 5% increase over 2014, and includes an approximate 5% negative impact from deflation and currency. Based upon this guidance, we now anticipate a full year EBIT margin between 11.9% and 12.3%, which would be our highest level since 1999. 
We expect operating cash flow to exceed $375 million in 2015, dividends should require about $170 million of cash and capital expenditures should approximate $110 million for the year. As has been our practice, after funding dividends and capital expenditures, remaining cash flow will be prioritized toward competitively advantaged acquisitions. Potential acquisitions must meet stringent strategic and financial criteria. Should no acquisitions come to fruition, and if excess cash flow is available, we have a standing authorization from the board to repurchase up to 10 million shares each year. No specific repurchase commitment or timetable has been established; however, we currently expect to repurchase about 4 million shares in 2015 and issue approximately 2.2 million shares, primarily for employee benefit plans and option exercises.
Regarding 2016 outlook. Sales growth, excluding possible acquisitions or divestitures is expected to be in the mid-single digits next year. We anticipate continued strong unit volume growth in many of our product categories. But this will likely be partially offset by commodity-related price deflation since steel prices have continued to decline throughout 2015. Full year EBIT margin is expected to be roughly in line with 2015 as the margin benefit from higher unit volume next year is likely to be offset by the non-recurrence of the 2015 pricing lag. This framework assumes that commodity prices will stabilize their current levels. As is our typical practice, we will issue formal 2016 sales and EPS guidance when we announced our fourth quarter results on February 1. With those comments, I will now turn the call back over to Dave Haffner."

So as steel has continued to deflate through the year, really started in the fourth quarter of '14, that there is, at the rod and wire level, there is a shorter than 90-day lag. At the component level, it averages about 90 days. So based on what we know today, and forecasting steel pricing is a guess at this point. But we expect that some time in the first quarter of next year, that everything will levelize. I keep thinking that steel, can we get any different and scrap costs can't fall anymore. And you heard what I said about October deflation. But at some point, Keith, you've read a lot of information out of China. Even the Chinese admit that they are not making money in the steel industry. It's a tough business right now. If it wasn't for our connectivity to value-added products, it would be challenging for us. So it will all true up, we think, some time, in the first or second quarter of next year, John, but I just frankly don't know."

But we're underutilized in commercials, particularly Work Furniture. But the trends are probably more positive there than any place else. And then we have to start to separate the segments, in that we're probably fully, fully utilized in Bedding Components right now. If you think in terms of the investment that we've made in Comfort Core, but we are underutilized in some of the open coil products because there is a switch out. We don't expect to be utilized in those open core. So it's variable. The trend is positive in all the segments. I don't feel a significant need to add capacity in most of our business units with the exception of Automotive, where we're dealing with significant growth rates and specifically Comfort Core, as it relates to bedding.

And in terms of working capital trends, you shouldn't see anything any differently than what has been a very good management of those categories. I will mention one thing, the litigation accrual, we've talked a lot about. At the end of last year, we had about $90 million approximately on our balance sheet. By the end of this year, we'll have about $40 million, then we'll probably still be on our balance sheet.

We continue to be extremely pleased with our performance this year, and again reported strong quarterly results from continuing operations. During the third quarter, we achieved record levels of sales, EBIT and earnings per share. Sales from continuing operations were $1.01 billion and increased 1% over the prior year. Higher unit volume and acquisitions added 7% to year-over-year sales growth. These gains were largely offset by raw material-related price decreases and currency impact, which combined to reduce sales by 6%. We continue to benefit from the shift in bedding to Comfort Core springs, strong growth of Adjustable Beds and ongoing content gains in new program awards in automotive. Importantly, nearly all of our businesses again experienced volume growth in the quarter versus strong prior-year comparisons, with sales having grown 14% in the third quarter of last year. Third quarter earnings per share were a record $0.67, up 31% from the $0.51 of adjusted EPS from continuing operations reported in the third quarter last year. Earnings grew primarily from higher unit volume and pricing discipline. EBIT increased 33% when compared to last year's adjusted EBIT and EBIT margin improved to 14%, up 330 basis points over third quarter of last year. We assess our overall performance by comparing our total shareholder return to that of peer companies on a rolling 3-year basis. Our target is to achieve TSR in the top 1/3 of the S&P 500 over the long term, which we believe will require an average TSR of 12% to 15% per year. For the 3-year period that will end on December 31, 2015, we have so far generated compound annual TSR of 23% per year, which places us in the top 29% of the S&P 500.

Margins improved in all four segments and unit volumes grew in most of our major businesses. However, commodity deflation and currency impact continue to mask some of the sales growth. In the Residential Furnishings segment, third quarter total sales decreased 1%. Same-location sales decreased 2% with 5% unit volume growth more than offset by raw material-related price decreases and currency impact. Sales trends for the major businesses and product categories, excluding acquisitions, deflation and currency were as follows: U.S. Spring component dollar sales increased 7%, innerspring unit volume grew 4% with Comfort Core up 37% during the quarter; Boxspring unit volume increased 3%; International Spring sales grew 6%; furniture component sales increased 8% with sales in the seating and sofa sleeper business up 15%; and motion hardware unit volume up 6%. Sales also increased in Fabric Converting and Geo Components, while volume was down marginally in Carpet Cushion. 
Segment EBIT and EBIT margin increased in the quarter due to the non-reoccurrence of last year's foam litigation expense. Excluding this prior-year charge, EBIT improved slightly with the benefit from higher unit volume, largely offset by FIFO impact and several smaller factors. EBIT margin in the segment is also affected by higher Adjustable Bed passthrough sales at lower than segment average margins. 
In the Commercial Product segment, third quarter total sales increased 26%. Same-location sales grew 15%, primarily from continued strong performance in our Adjustable Bed and Fashion Bed businesses. Adjustable Bed unit volume increased 55% during the quarter. Work Furniture, same-location sales were down slightly for the -- in the third quarter, primarily from currency impact. Unit volume in our North American Work Furniture business was up marginally. 
In early March, we acquired a European private label manufacturer of high-end upholstered furniture for office, commercial and other settings. This business is complementary to our North American private label operation and allows us to support our Work Furniture customers as they expand globally. This acquisition added 11% to the segment sales growth during the third quarter. The Commercial Products segment EBIT and EBIT margin increased in the third quarter, primarily due to higher sales and improved operational efficiency.
In the Industrial Materials segment, third quarter sales decreased 14%, largely from steel-related price reductions. Unit volume decreased slightly with growth in Drawn Wire more than offset by lower trade sales from our rod mill. EBIT and EBIT margin increased during the quarter, primarily due to cost reductions.
In the Specialized Products segment, third quarter sales increased 5% with an approximate 10% volume improvement, partially offset by currency impact. Excluding currency changes, Automotive sales increased 13%, Aerospace grew 3%, Machinery sales were up 8% and CVP grew 7%. The segment's EBIT and EBIT margin also improved, primarily reflecting higher unit volume and the non-reoccurrence of last year's litigation accrual. I will now turn the call over to Matt."

Operating cash flow in the third quarter was $130 million. For the first 9 months of 2015, operating cash flow was $257 million, an increase of $41 million or 19% over the prior year, primarily due to higher earnings. Adjusted working capital as a percentage of sales was 9.4% at the end of the third quarter. Excluding last year's foam litigation accruals, some of which are still on our balance sheet and included in current liabilities, working capital was a very low 10.5% of annualized sales. In August, we increased the quarterly dividend to $0.32 per share. And 2015 marks our 44th consecutive annual dividend increase at a compound annual growth rate of 13%. At yesterday's closing price of $44.64, our current yield is 2.9%. We repurchased 900,000 shares of our stock in the third quarter at an average price of $45.61 and issued 200,000 shares, largely for employee benefit plans and option exercises. Our financial base remains very strong, and this gives us considerable flexibility when making capital and investment decisions. We ended the quarter with net-debt-to-net-capital at 36%, comfortably within our long-standing targeted range of 30% to 40%. We also monitored debt-to-EBITDA. At the end of the third quarter, our debt was 1.7x our trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA. 
Given our strong third quarter results, we are raising our full year 2015 EPS guidance and now anticipate record earnings from continuing operations of $2.15 to $2.25 per share. Our prior EPS range was $2 to $2.15. 
With ongoing raw material-related price deflation and currency impact, we're lowering sales guidance to a range of $3.92 billion to $3.98 billion. This revised sales range represents a 4% to 5% increase over 2014, and includes an approximate 5% negative impact from deflation and currency. Based upon this guidance, we now anticipate a full year EBIT margin between 11.9% and 12.3%, which would be our highest level since 1999. 
We expect operating cash flow to exceed $375 million in 2015, dividends should require about $170 million of cash and capital expenditures should approximate $110 million for the year. As has been our practice, after funding dividends and capital expenditures, remaining cash flow will be prioritized toward competitively advantaged acquisitions. Potential acquisitions must meet stringent strategic and financial criteria. Should no acquisitions come to fruition, and if excess cash flow is available, we have a standing authorization from the board to repurchase up to 10 million shares each year. No specific repurchase commitment or timetable has been established; however, we currently expect to repurchase about 4 million shares in 2015 and issue approximately 2.2 million shares, primarily for employee benefit plans and option exercises.
Regarding 2016 outlook. Sales growth, excluding possible acquisitions or divestitures is expected to be in the mid-single digits next year. We anticipate continued strong unit volume growth in many of our product categories. But this will likely be partially offset by commodity-related price deflation since steel prices have continued to decline throughout 2015. Full year EBIT margin is expected to be roughly in line with 2015 as the margin benefit from higher unit volume next year is likely to be offset by the non-recurrence of the 2015 pricing lag. This framework assumes that commodity prices will stabilize their current levels. As is our typical practice, we will issue formal 2016 sales and EPS guidance when we announced our fourth quarter results on February 1. With those comments, I will now turn the call back over to Dave Haffner."

We think that the market is probably only 5% penetrated from an attachment rates of all mattresses produced. But there's probably a 50% attachment rate currently at the ultra premium price points. I know those producers expect that they will grow that. But the middle price points, the promotional price points, will probably never have an adjustable bed associated with them. But the high price points, will continue to see growth. They're -- everything -- virtually every mattress sold above $599 is now adjustable friendly, giving the consumer much more choice.

And in terms of working capital trends, you shouldn't see anything any differently than what has been a very good management of those categories. I will mention one thing, the litigation accrual, we've talked a lot about. At the end of last year, we had about $90 million approximately on our balance sheet. By the end of this year, we'll have about $40 million, that will probably still be on our balance sheet. So the timing of when that rolls off, as a current liability, is just a notable phenomenon, if you will, on our cash flow, both this year and next year.

We continue to be extremely pleased with our performance this year, and again reported strong quarterly results from continuing operations. During the third quarter, we achieved record levels of sales, EBIT and earnings per share. Sales from continuing operations were $1.01 billion and increased 1% over the prior year. Higher unit volume and acquisitions added 7% to year-over-year sales growth. These gains were largely offset by raw material-related price decreases and currency impact, which combined to reduce sales by 6%. We continue to benefit from the shift in bedding to Comfort Core springs, strong growth of Adjustable Beds and ongoing content gains in new program awards in automotive. Importantly, nearly all of our businesses again experienced volume growth in the quarter versus strong prior-year comparisons, with sales having grown 14% in the third quarter of last year. Third quarter earnings per share were a record $0.67, up 31% from the $0.51 of adjusted EPS from continuing operations reported in the third quarter last year. Earnings grew primarily from higher unit volume and pricing discipline. EBIT increased 33% when compared to last year's adjusted EBIT and EBIT margin improved to 14%, up 330 basis points over third quarter of last year. We assess our overall performance by comparing our total shareholder return to that of peer companies on a rolling 3-year basis. Our target is to achieve TSR in the top 1/3 of the S&P 500 over the long term, which we believe will require an average TSR of 12% to 15% per year. For the 3-year period that will end on December 31, 2015, we have so far generated compound annual TSR of 23% per year, which places us in the top 29% of the S&P 500.

Margins improved in all 4 segments and unit volumes grew in most of our major businesses. However, commodity deflation and currency impact continue to mask some of the sales growth. In the Residential Furnishings segment, third quarter total sales decreased 1%. Same-location sales decreased 2% with 5% unit volume growth more than offset by raw material-related price decreases and currency impact. Sales trends for the major businesses and product categories, excluding acquisitions, deflation and currency were as follows: U.S. Spring component dollar sales increased 7%, innerspring unit volume grew 4% with Comfort Core up 37% during the quarter; Boxspring unit volume increased 3%; International Spring sales grew 6%; furniture component sales increased 8% with sales in the seating and sofa sleeper business up 15%; and motion hardware unit volume up 6%. Sales also increased in Fabric Converting and Geo Components, while volume was down marginally in Carpet Cushion. 
Segment EBIT and EBIT margin increased in the quarter due to the non-reoccurrence of last year's foam litigation expense. Excluding this prior-year charge, EBIT improved slightly with the benefit from higher unit volume, largely offset by FIFO impact and several smaller factors. EBIT margin in the segment is also affected by higher Adjustable Bed passthrough sales at lower than segment average margins. 
In the Commercial Product segment, third quarter total sales increased 26%. Same-location sales grew 15%, primarily from continued strong performance in our Adjustable Bed and Fashion Bed businesses. Adjustable Bed unit volume increased 55% during the quarter. Work Furniture, same-location sales were down slightly for the -- in the third quarter, primarily from currency impact. Unit volume in our North American Work Furniture business was up marginally. 
In early March, we acquired a European private label manufacturer of high-end upholstered furniture for office, commercial and other settings. This business is complementary to our North American private label operation and allows us to support our Work Furniture customers as they expand globally. This acquisition added 11% to the segment sales growth during the third quarter. The Commercial Products segment EBIT and EBIT margin increased in the third quarter, primarily due to higher sales and improved operational efficiency.
In the Industrial Materials segment, third quarter sales decreased 14%, largely from steel-related price reductions. Unit volume decreased slightly with growth in Drawn Wire more than offset by lower trade sales from our rod mill. EBIT and EBIT margin increased during the quarter, primarily due to cost reductions.
In the Specialized Products segment, third quarter sales increased 5% with an approximate 10% volume improvement, partially offset by currency impact. Excluding currency changes, Automotive sales increased 13%, Aerospace grew 3%, Machinery sales were up 8% and CVP grew 7%. The segment's EBIT and EBIT margin also improved, primarily reflecting higher unit volume and the non-reoccurrence of last year's litigation accrual. I will now turn the call over to Matt."

Operating cash flow in the third quarter was $130 million. For the first 9 months of 2015, operating cash flow was $257 million, an increase of $41 million or 19% over the prior year, primarily due to higher earnings. Adjusted working capital as a percentage of sales was 9.4% at the end of the third quarter. Excluding last year's foam litigation accruals, some of which are still on our balance sheet and included in current liabilities, working capital was a very low 10.5% of annualized sales. In August, we increased the quarterly dividend to $0.32 per share. And 2015 marks our 44th consecutive annual dividend increase at a compound annual growth rate of 13%. At yesterday's closing price of $44.64, our current yield is 2.9%. We repurchased 900,000 shares of our stock in the third quarter at an average price of $45.61 and issued 200,000 shares, largely for employee benefit plans and option exercises. Our financial base remains very strong, and this gives us considerable flexibility when making capital and investment decisions. We ended the quarter with net-debt-to-net-capital at 36%, comfortably within our long-standing targeted range of 30% to 40%. We also monitored debt-to-EBITDA. At the end of the third quarter, our debt was 1.7x our trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA. 
Given our strong third quarter results, we are raising our full year 2015 EPS guidance and now anticipate record earnings from continuing operations of $2.15 to $2.25 per share. Our prior EPS range was $2 to $2.15. 
With ongoing raw material-related price deflation and currency impact, we're lowering sales guidance to a range of $3.92 billion to $3.98 billion. This revised sales range represents a 4% to 5% increase over 2014, and includes an approximate 5% negative impact from deflation and currency. Based upon this guidance, we now anticipate a full year EBIT margin between 11.9% and 12.3%, which would be our highest level since 1999. 
We expect operating cash flow to exceed $375 million in 2015, dividends should require about $170 million of cash and capital expenditures should approximate $110 million for the year. As has been our practice, after funding dividends and capital expenditures, remaining cash flow will be prioritized toward competitively advantaged acquisitions. Potential acquisitions must meet stringent strategic and financial criteria. Should no acquisitions come to fruition, and if excess cash flow is available, we have a standing authorization from the board to repurchase up to 10 million shares each year. No specific repurchase commitment or timetable has been established; however, we currently expect to repurchase about 4 million shares in 2015 and issue approximately 2.2 million shares, primarily for employee benefit plans and option exercises.
Regarding 2016 outlook. Sales growth, excluding possible acquisitions or divestitures is expected to be in the mid-single digits next year. We anticipate continued strong unit volume growth in many of our product categories. But this will likely be partially offset by commodity-related price deflation since steel prices have continued to decline throughout 2015. Full year EBIT margin is expected to be roughly in line with 2015 as the margin benefit from higher unit volume next year is likely to be offset by the non-recurrence of the 2015 pricing lag. This framework assumes that commodity prices will stabilize their current levels. As is our typical practice, we will issue formal 2016 sales and EPS guidance when we announced our fourth quarter results on February 1. With those comments, I will now turn the call back over to Dave Haffner."
