Good morning, and welcome to Precision Castparts' Earnings Conference Call for the Third Quarter of 2015. Here with me today are Chairman and CEO, Mark Donegan; and Executive Vice President and CFO, Shawn Hagel. A portion of today's presentation contains forward-looking statements that are based on our best view of the commercial environment and of our businesses as we see them today. Those factors can change, so we ask that you interpret them in that light. We identified the principal risks and uncertainties that affect our performance on Page 2 of today's presentation and in our Form 10-K and other SEC filings. 
Mark will start off our call today with a review of our financial results for the third quarter, including a more complete discussion of the items covered in our preliminary release of last week, discuss our plans for the initiation of an annual guidance program and then, update you on our latest view for fiscal '15 and '16. Mark, Shawn and I will then be available for your questions. 
You will note several enhancements that we've made this quarter to our press release and slides. These changes are designed to improve their usability and support our discussion today and investors' understanding of our businesses. We view these changes as a complement to our initiation of a comprehensive annual guidance program, which Mark will discuss in more detail. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Mark."

Looking at the company in total, our sales are up 5% versus last year, going from roughly $2.3 billion last year to $2.46 billion this year. Our operating income increased 2%, going from $655 million last year to $670 million this year. And o",1822,"Thanks, Jay. Looking at the company in total, our sales are up 5% versus last year, going from roughly $2.3 billion last year to $2.46 billion this year. Our operating income increased 2%, going from $655 million last year to $670 million this year. And our operating margins decreased 80 basis points, going from 28% last year to 27.2% this year. All this generated an EPS increase of 5% versus last year, going from $2.94 last year to $3.09 this year.
If I look at the key components. On sales, year-on-year, our aerospace sales are up 6% versus last year. Our large commercial, we did see strong growth of 7%. And this does include the negative impact from a single customer, continued demand change that impacted these by roughly 3 percentage points. We also saw an increase in demand from both regional and biz jet, and our military was basically flat as it has been.
In power, overall, our demand was up 2%. We saw strong IGT demand up by 7%. Our extruded pipe was down by 15%. The primary driver for this was the extended time to bring our Forged complex back up and the upgrade that we did in the back half of Q2 that carried into inefficiencies in the early half of Q3. And with the dynamics in the marketplace, our oil and gas sales were down 7%.
Our general industrial sales overall for the company were up 4%. The primary driver of business is we certainly are looking for products to put over our Forged assets to make sure that we were doing everything we can to overcome some of the negative headwinds we faced in the very back half of Q3. 
This gives us a reported of growth of 5%. Included in this is $20 million of currency headwind. Our acquisitions accounted for 3% of our growth, and this gave us an overall organic growth rate of 2% for the quarter.
If I look operationally. On the plus side, we saw solid leverage on the growth in both Investment Cast and airframe. But the real impact to our business was a negative drag from the volume changes, mainly our Forged Products and oil and gas, the slower rate of achieving our production rates from the press upgrade and the ongoing demand Jay from this single customer changing their demand on us.
If I move up the company, I look on to the segments and I begin the Investment Cast Products. Our sales are up 4% versus last year, going from $609 million last year to $632 million this year. Our operating income increased 5% going from $218 million last year to $229 million this year. And our margins expanded 40 basis points, going from 35.8% last year to 36.2% this year.
In cast products, if I look at sales, overall, our aerospace sales are up 3% with large commercial up 2%. We did see an increase in regional and biz jet in this segment. Our military, again, was stable at kind of the depressed levels we're at right now. On power sales, they were up by 9% versus last year. Our IGT sales are up 10%, which is kind of the difference than where the market is at this point in time. Our general industrial was down 8%, but this is on a very small baseline.
Operationally, we saw a strong utilization of our fixed assets. We continued to use and leverage our low-cost operations. So in the quarter, we continue to drive to some of our offshore operations as well as some of the other ones we have inside the continental U.S. And we saw -- saw solid incremental margins of greater than 40%.
If I look forward to Investment Cast Products, and in this segment and aerospace, it's almost all engine volume. If I look at where we are today, this segment is basically at rate and has been at rate on the major programs. However, this does exclude the single customer that's continued to change the demand downwards. There is acceleration coming in this market. That will be driven by the rate increases on the 787 as well as the 350 moving up into larger production quantities in the next 2 years. The rate increases on the narrow-body re-engining will have A double impact for us. We will get the benefit of the rate increase, and we will get a multiplier based on our content on share that's already been won on the re-engining. So as these programs come through, the new re-engining will have a double impact for this segment.
In power, we continue to see growth through fiscal year '16, driven by our content on the new platforms and the higher spares activity.
Moving on to cast and on Forged. Overall, our sales were up 2% versus last year, going from roughly $1 billion last year to $1.03 billion this year. Our operating income decreased 7%, going from $257 million last year to $239 million this year. Our margins decreased 230 basis points, going from 25.5% last year to 23.2% this year.
If I look at the key drivers in Forged Products, overall, our aerospace sales were up by 1%. But this includes, again, this segment got hit squarely with the majority of the year-over-year change in demand from the destocking. This negatively impacted the growth rate of this segment by roughly 6 percentage points. This was across Wyman, SMC and TIMET. It was both on our direct shipments to this OEM and on the raw materials into other component manufacturers who supplied the customer that are also seeing the change. 
Our power is down by roughly 5% overall. We saw lower extruded pipe sales, again, mainly due to the daily of getting our production rates back up from upgrade. We saw weaker oil and gas activity, and it really accelerated in the back half of the quarter. upgrade. And we did see a slight increase in IGT in the OEMs. Different from Investment Cast, the content change is relatively similar on the programs in Forged, whereas gas has that accelerating content in their programs. 
And general industrial was up 14% in this segment versus last year. And again, that was driven to put the volume across our fixed assets. And to round it all out, we had $10 million of higher metal pricing.
Operationally, I think it falls in 2 categories. We certainly had replacement over the last year of the commercial and military aero and oil and gas with general industrial, and it was a conscious effort to go and move that volume across our asset. And we did have the inefficiencies in the early half of Q3 bringing back our pipe complex back online and up to production volumes.
If I look forward in Forged Products, as with Investment Cast Products on the components side, our base aero demand is in alignment with the current rates, but this does exclude the single customer we are below current rates. They do have the same step-ups coming as we move through fiscal year '16. The 787 rate increase in the A350, and in this segment, we will benefit from both the engine and the airframe on those platform upgrades. And in the narrow-body re-engining, as with cast, Forged got a narrow-body contract this point that change over to the new engine. So you'll get the -- again, the multiplying effect of the rate increases, along with our content increase versus what programs they'll be replacing. And as the cast products, you're assuming flat military sales.
In power, we are expecting to see uncertainty in oil and gas. I think it's falling into a couple of categories. The distribution sales, I think, will remain soft. There was certainly a lot of pullback as we exited our Q3 as they're trying to see what demand will come on them. So I think we're looking at 2 quarters, certainly of softness in the distribution. On the major projects, we saw a number of them put on hold. We were in final negotiations on some large projects, not been canceled, but decision point has been pushed to the right. But I think over the medium and long term, again, there is share that is available that we were in good position to win prior to this change. And it's also a desire of the industry to move to the higher-performance alloys. And these alloys have been out in the field that are through their small introductory and in test and were getting ready to go into larger quantities.
Finally, on airframe Products, overall, our sales are up 11% versus last year, going from $722 million last year to $798 million this year. Our operating income increased 12%, going from $216 million last year to $241 million this year. And our margins expanded 30 basis points, going from 29.9% last year to 30.2% this year.
If you look at key drivers, our aerospace sales overall were up 13%. Our large commercial was up 17%. We saw solid contribution from ADI and Permaswage, and our military sales were down slightly. Our general industrial sales in this segment were down 12%. Again, it's on a much smaller base. Main driver for that is our auto sales in Brazil and the pulp and paper segment of our business that's in this segment also.
Operationally, our base fasteners businesses had very strong performance. And both ADI and Permaswage contributed in 2 different ways. First of all, the base performance coming in at the time, when it came in, it was at a lower -- it was dilutive to us. But they have done extremely well and are accelerating the performance through our integration process. And I think these businesses, over the long haul, have great upside for us.
If I look forward, looking at the fasteners, we have strong demand on us now. We will have to accelerate our output to support the demand as the rate increases come through. And there are additional share opportunities that are available for us to work on now that will begin in calendar year '16.
Aerostructures. We are aligned at today's current rates. From there, we'll have to support the rate increases on the 787. The A350, with the addition of the ADI, is a very strong program for us. And is that moves into greater production rates, that's going to be a strong contributor into this segment.
We also have already won contracts from the OEMs as we went through last half of last year and the beginning of this year that during their outsource, we have equipment that has been an order and in our fiscal year fiscal Q1 and Q2 of '16. That will allow us to ramp up and support that demand as they move into the back half of '16.
With that, I'll move it over to Shawn."

I want to take a couple of minutes to update you on the substantial enhancement to our investment communication program. You're well aware that PCC has seen significant growth over the past decade, and with that growth certainly has come complexity. We've become more vertically integrated, expanded our product and customer reach and added new manufacturing technologies. We recognize, I recognize, that this complexity can present a challenge for shareholders and analysts to understand and to translate into expected financial results. I also understand our obligation to you to reconcile our expectations for the financial performance of the business with yours.
To support this process, we will be starting an annual guidance program beginning our Q4 fiscal year '15 call in May. The initial look at each fiscal year will come on our fourth quarter call, and then, we will update the outlook at each quarterly earnings call.
I'd like to also provide an update on how we're thinking about fiscal year '16 as well as give you some comments on fiscal year '15 so that you have a starting reference point as we shift to discuss '16.
So for fiscal year '15, we expect EPS to be the range of $12.80 to $12.90. Supporting this view is the Q4 shipment that was deferred from December, a full quarter of availability from the assets we upgraded in Q3. 
There are 2 end market assumptions we have made. First, we are assuming lower demand in our oil and gas markets with Q4 shipments that are lower than we experienced in Q3 as we are assuming December's tough conditions persist through all of Q4. Second, we are assuming that a single customer who was then destocking continues that activity and that demand steps down from Q3 to Q4 PCC adjusts to the latest build forecast.
We will present to you our to you our complete view of fiscal year '16 in our Q4 call in May. But I also wanted to provide an update to you on how we see calendar year '16 shaping up at this time.  Since we originally offered our fiscal year '16 framework, there have been several factors that have been positive to the plan, but also several factors that have been negative. 
On the positive side, we have seen greater integration performance from acquisitions. This includes ADI, Permaswage, TIMET and a number of those that came before us -- before that that are still in their accelerated process.  Secondly, we are seeing IGT demand growth that was not originally contemplated in the outlook, reflecting our success integrating share on new programs and -- new equipment.  Lastly, we have benefited from the constant a sense of operational efficiencies. Investment Cast margin expansion on stable revenues is just on example of this intensity.  Lastly, we've been able to return over $1.3 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases. 
However, on the negative side, we have had substantial erosion on our military activity as seen in lower spares activity, program wind-downs and slower-than-expected production ramps. We're also now in the midst of a reduction in demand from our oil and gas markets. Additionally, we have noted the persistent destocking by an important aero engines customer, which now approaches 2 years in duration.  Lastly, a strong U.S. dollar creates a translation headwind for a number of our operations, and benchmark interest rates used for pension plan calculations have continued to move lower. 
We will be providing a thorough look at fiscal year '16 as part of our issuance of formal guidance in May. For now, the net of all these positives and negative factors now lead us to conclude that our fiscal year '16 results will be below previously stated EPS targets of $15.50 to $16.50 after including cash deployment. However, we expect our fiscal year '16 EPS will demonstrate growth over '15, driven by effective leverage of IGT market share, aerospace rate increases, initial production of next-generation engines and strong cash generation and deployment to acquisitions and share repurchase. We will have complete discussion of the dynamics in our guidance presentation in May. And with that, we'll open it up to questions."

What I will tell you is that we have the ability to crosscheck a number of different ways.

We have products in almost all of our -- whether it's structural castings or whether it's TIMET or Wyman-Gordon, we have product where we are the only solution on that particular application.

I think that between the 35 lost volume and the year-end dynamics and push that we always see, you're probably in that $50 million, $60 million worth of revenue that we kind of got hit with the headwind. And then, the oil and gas was probably somewhere in the vicinity of additional $20 million on the very back side of the equation. So we also saw, again, that single customer sequentially in that segment was $15 million to $20 million, so it was not a small number sequentially. So those were the primary drivers. Now what you saw us do is we did a lot of replacement with the best we could replacing going to that general industrial to keep the assets busy. So as we saw these events kind of occurring in mid-quarter, we started reacting the best we could do. So as I think of going forward, the end of the year destocking, that product's gone. That basically goes in the first week of January. our -- I do want it -- it didn't come up. Our Forged complex was fully operational to rate as we entered the end of November and fully into December, and it was performing at the upgrade. So the asset itself was up and performing and we expected to get. So I'd say that one certainly comes back. The oil and gas, we only saw 1 month of that erosion. I think that we'll see, to some degree, kind of 3 months of that coming into Q4 as we -- I think we're going to get hit by the distributors still fussing and waiting to see what happens. And It's going to take them 1 or 2 quarters to get their feet underneath them. So I think that the big changes there were just in middle change out to the general industrial. I mean, general industrial for us is a commodity. it Is -- it gets treated like a commodity. So a pound of general industrial for us does not generally -- the value that a pound of oil and gas or a pound of aerospace or a pound of military, it just does not have the same value to it."

So it was not a small number. So Boeing is coming in, and we are seeing that growth. Now there's still more to come as we move through '16. So to answer your first question, yes. Certainly, the oil and gas for us was going to be a growth driver with profit margins that are more representative of the aerospace, especially the nickel.

So it was a certainly long horizon. And so I think number one, the first mistake was looking out, at the time, 3 years to say what we think this business can do. There's a lot of dynamics that can change. So number one, certainly, the -- it will not be looking out that far. So we will target and we will go after a year. For the most part, if you look at our base, let's take aerospace for a minute, if you look at aerospace, I think we have a very good line of sight excluding what we've seen in this one destocking event. But if I look at the other engine manufacturers and the airframe, I think that we do have good clarity in terms of what they're going to do. If you look at some of the both new programs, I think there is clarity now with 350, what the 350 is going to do. It's probably, that had some of the biggest question marks. So I think that if you look at that side of our business, schedules are starting to predict pretty well. So I think now starting to say going out a year, I think that's a much more reasonable time frame for us to look at. I think -- the other thing you'll see us do is we will provide what assumptions, so we'll have to make some assumptions on things like oil and gas. So I think that we will clarify as we communicate to you where we think some of that volatility may exist in terms of those assumptions. It will then be incumbent on us to either validate our assumptions were right, they were better or worse. So I think that this whole -- our whole mindset will now be clear to what do we -- what is more solid against what is the risk, and then, confirming where that risk is or what assumptions we're making. Now we're confirming on a 3-month snapshot how's that year going to play out. So I think that we'll be able to give a -- it's just a totally different dynamic, I think, from this standpoint."

But there is a -- there are a number of platforms and parts where we are the sole source. And there are condition in part in TIMET where it's just the only solution, period. Those are the ones that we aligned and say, ""okay, this overall riding demand is -- the change isgoing from a number to a lower number."" And as that matching up to this sole source only solutions. Once we financed that, yes, we can then translate that over to where there a competition and extrapolate out what's happening to our share from that standpoint. So that's how that gets us. And I know for a fact today that we do have these sole source positions. So that's what we've been using.  In terms of the overall, I'd say that if you look at kind of the latest engine, kind of that new narrow-body re-engining and our -- that combined assets of this Precision Castparts, and we try to work with our customer to go with a combined assets. I know you're talking about assets that are completing terms of structural castings, large, small, titanium, nickel. You're going across both alloy sides so it's nickel, titanium, you're going across turbine blades, full capability. We're going into the fastest side of the equation and in some cases, -- going into machining. So we have sent with that full complement of assets, which there are other people out there that have pieces of it but -- complement. And the result of certainly the latest awards are that we got a share and the value content higher than we've gotten in the previous engine. So competition is needed, competition is out there, competition is okay. But I think that this set of assets, all in, ti-aluminide, that's got to bring that one up too. So bringing these full complement of assets, it's not just adding 1 or 2. You can have a casting asset, but if you don't have the ability to make material for it, you don't get the benefit of that. You can have a titanium asset that you be don't have a nickel assets, it doesn't help you and vice versa. If you have the forging asset, but you can't make nickel material, it doesn't necessarily help yet that standpoint. So that's how we look at it. And again, I think the award that we get at the beginning says that at least to date is still a -- again, underlying.  I don't -- you have a single plant we go out and say, no, we're doing great."" And then, you go back to that manufacturing drumbeat that just drives after it. So I think all that put in, yes."

So do I think we have a aerospace -- that's an example, do I think we have a very clear line of sight of what the market is doing? Absolutely. But when you start saying there are dynamics different from the marketplace that are driving it, now it becomes, to some degree, you've got to follow the customer because they're doing something different from the market. I don't know how you start second guessing a customer. I'd tell you when we try to second guess a customer, it could get us in trouble either away. Either we can get a situation that we've guessed wrong that we said that they're going to need it, and we build, build, build, and they haven't needed it. And we second guess and don't build, and we get them in a world of hurt. So I'd say is there way? There's always way to look at something better. So I, sitting here on this job, your question is there. Do I need to continue to search for something to try to better anticipate this? Yes, I need to search, and we will continue. But if I look of the rest of the market, plus or minus 3%, it's playing out in terms of aerospace. It's playing out pretty much on the commercial.

So I look at for the most part, obviously in our Airframe Products and our castings, that doesn't -- so you are correct in assuming a bunch -- you had a number of assumptions I think are valid. Number one, yes, we will aggressively go after product that utilizes our assets while we're waiting for what we would want the core assets to come back. So we do what we do will continue to do that. And that goes both nickel and titanium. There are titanium opportunities that we have been very aggressive going after that typically TIMET wouldn't gone after. Now there cost structure is drastically different than it was 1.5 years, 2 years ago. So -- it puts them at least a better position to go get. But when you start going after general industrial, yes, you start getting margin compression. The way we look at it is would we take something that would have 0 value to the company and just putting across the asset? No, we would do that. we would walk away from that. When you look at some of that effectively helps absorb all of variable, plus fixed, plus SG&A? Yes, we would look at doing that. Obviously, we wouldn't take a whole quarter's worth  to that business, but we would look to balance out something. What we don't want is we don't want idle assets. We don't want to keep them operating at a horrible inefficiency. And we also believe that some of this is not a permanent change if you look at some of the aerospace. We also know we've got growth coming. So let me take TIMET for an example. We know what's coming in aifrrame. We know the contracts we've got the opportunity we have in the future.

Stubborn  whatever you call it. But let me just kind of back up. The fact that we go after that cost side of the equation, so pricing doesn't necessarily mean static pricing or we've not seen inflation. We have been, to our customer, a deflationary cost supplier for a long time. So let there be no mistake, we are not sitting getting price increases and have not gotten as an average for many, many, many years. So deflation is a way of life. It is what you have to do. And now when you look at businesses or contracts, what we look at is what we assume we can do on cost takeout. And again, that goes across all of -- so we could be utilization, machining, facilities, whatever the case maybe. But we look of the value to the business. We look at the volume we're trying to get. And general, we understand our customers are going to get some of that, and our shareholders are going to get some of that, and our employees are going to get some of that. So there's this -- again, if I go back Partnering for Success where was this big pullback by Partnering for Success, we did have -- we give you an opportunity to go in, for example, and kind of balance of the customer needs alone what we need and you're right, volume. But we have been a deflationary company. So Partnering for Success are we -- reasonable deflation is something that we should deal with and something that's different to answer your question, it's no. It's a concentrate of white light for us, and it's going to be a constant way of life going forward it is balancing because we have some part of that obviously be have obviously -- price of that product that we did price down but customers look at the totality that's how I'd of our beloved our business.

Looking at the company in total, our sales are up 5% versus last year, going from roughly $2.3 billion last year to $2.46 billion this year. Our operating income increased 2%, going from $655 million last year to $670 million this year. And o",1823,"Thanks, Jay. Looking at the company in total, our sales are up 5% versus last year, going from roughly $2.3 billion last year to $2.46 billion this year. Our operating income increased 2%, going from $655 million last year to $670 million this year. And our operating margins decreased 80 basis points, going from 28% last year to 27.2% this year. All this generated an EPS increase of 5% versus last year, going from $2.94 last year to $3.09 this year.
If I look at the key components. On sales, year-on-year, our aerospace sales are up 6% versus last year. Our large commercial, we did see strong growth of 7%, and this does include the negative impact from a single customer, continued demand change that impacted these by roughly 3 percentage points. We also saw an increase in demand from both regional and biz jet, and our military was basically flat as it has been.
In power, overall, our demand was up 2%. We saw strong IGT demand up by 7%. Our extruded pipe was down by 15%. The primary driver for this was the extended time to bring our Forged complex back up and the upgrade that we did in the back half of Q2 that carried into inefficiencies in the early half of Q3, and with the dynamics going in the marketplace, our oil and gas sales were down 7%.
Our general industrial sales, overall, for the company were up 4%. The primary driver for this is we certainly were looking for product to put over our Forged assets to make sure that we were doing everything we can to overcome some of the negative headwinds we faced in the very back half of Q3. This gives us a reported of growth of 5%. Included in this is $20 million of currency headwind. Our acquisitions accounted for 3% of our growth, and this gave us an overall organic growth rate of 2% for the quarter.
If I look operationally. On the plus side, we saw solid leverage on the growth in both Investment Cast and Airframe, but the real impact to our business was the negative drag from the volume changes, mainly in our Forged Products and oil and gas, the slower rate of achieving our production rates from the press upgrade and the ongoing demand from the single customer changing their demand on us.
If I move up to company and look on to the segments, and I begin with Investment Cast Products, our sales are up 4% versus last year, going from $609 million last year to $632 million this year. Our operating income increased 5%, going from $218 million last year, $229 million this year, and our margins expanded 40 basis points, going from 35.8% last year, 36.2% this year.
In cast products, if I look at sales, overall, our aerospace sales are up 3% with large commercial up 2%. We did see an increase in regional and biz jet in this segment. Our military, again, was stable at kind of the depressed levels we're at right now. On power sales, they were up by 9% versus last year. Our IGT sales are up 10%, which is kind of a difference than where the market is at this point in time. Our general industrial was down 8%, but this is on a very small baseline.
Operationally, we saw strong utilization of our fixed assets. We continued to use and leverage our low-cost operations. So in the quarter, we continue to drive to some of our offshore operations as well as some of the other ones we have inside the continental U.S. and we saw solid incremental margins of greater than 40%.
If I look forward in Investment Cast Products, and in this segment in aerospace, it's almost all engine volume. If I look at where we are today, this segment is basically at rate and has been at rate on the major programs. However, this does exclude the single customer that's continued to change the demand downwards. There is acceleration coming in this market. That will be driven by the rate increases on the 787 as well as the 350 moving up into larger production quantities in the next 2 years. The rate increases on the narrow-body re-engining will have a double impact for us. We will get the benefit of the rate increase, and we will get a multiplier based on our content on share that's already been won on the re-engining. So as these programs come through, the new re-engining will have a double impact for this segment. In power, we continue to see growth through fiscal year '16, driven by our content on the new platforms and the higher spares activity.
Moving on to cast and on Forged. Overall, our sales were up 2% versus last year, going from roughly $1 billion last year to $1.03 billion this year. Our operating income decreased 7%, going from $257 million last year to $239 million this year. Our margins decreased 230 basis points, going from 25.5% last year to 23.2% this year.
If I look at the key drivers in Forged Products, overall, our aerospace sales were up by 1%, but this includes -- again, this segment got hit squarely with the majority of the year-over-year change in demand from the destocking. This negatively impacted the growth rate of this segment by roughly 6 percentage points. This was across Wyman, SMC and TIMET. It was both on our direct shipments to this OEM and on the raw materials into other component manufacturers who supply their customers are also seeing the change. 
Our power is down by roughly 5% overall. We saw lower extruded pipe sales, again, mainly due to the delay of getting our production rates back up from the upgrade. We saw weaker oil and gas activity, and it really accelerated in the back half of the quarter, and we did see a slight increase in IGT in the OEMs. Different from Investment Cast, the content change is relatively similar on the programs in Forged, whereas Cast has that accelerating content on their programs. And general industrial was up 14% in this segment versus last year. And again, that was driven to put the volume across our fixed assets. And to round it all out, we had $10 million of higher metal pricing.
Operationally, I think it falls in 2 categories. We certainly had the replacement compared to last year of the commercial and military aero and oil and gas with general industrial. It was a conscious effort to go and move that volume across our assets, and we did have the inefficiencies in the early half of Q3, bringing back our pipe complex back online and up to production volumes.
If I look forward in Forged Products, as with Investment Cast Products on the components side, our base aero demand is in alignment with the current rates, but this does exclude the single customer. We are below current rates. They do have the same step-ups coming as we move through fiscal year '16, the 787 rate increase in the A350, and in this segment, we will benefit from both the engine and the airframe on those platform upgrades. In the narrow-body re-engining, as with cast, Forged got a narrow-body contract to support that change over to the new engine. So you'll get the -- again, the multiplying effect of the rate increases, along with our content increase versus what programs they'll be replacing, and as with cast products, we are assuming flat military sales.
In power, we are expecting to see uncertainty in the oil and gas. I think it's falling into a couple of categories. The distribution sales, I think, will remain soft. There was certainly a lot of pullback as we exited our Q3, as they're trying to see what demand will come on them. So I think we're looking at 2 quarters, certainly, of softness in the distribution. On the major projects, we saw a number of them put on hold. We were in final negotiation on some large projects, not been canceled. The decision point has been pushed to the right. But I think over the medium and long term, again, there is share that is available that we were in good position to win prior to this change, and there's also been a desire of the industry to move to the higher-performance alloys, and these alloys have been out in the field that are through their small introductory and in test, and were getting ready to go into larger quantities.
Finally, on Airframe Products, overall, our sales are up 11% versus last year, going from $722 million last year to $798 million this year. Our operating income increased 12%, going from $216 million last year to $241 million this year, and our margins expanded 30 basis points, going from 29.9% last year to 30.2% this year.
If I look at the key drivers, our aerospace sales, overall, were up 13%. Our large commercial was up 17%. We saw solid contribution from ADI and Permaswage, and our military sales were down slightly. Our general industrial sales in this segment were down 12%. Again, it's on a much smaller base. Main driver for that is our auto sales in Brazil and the pulp and paper segment of our business that's in this segment also.
Operationally, our base fasteners businesses had very strong performance, and both ADI and Permaswage contributed in 2 different ways. First of all, the base performance coming in at the time, when it came in, it was at a lower -- it was dilutive to us, but they have done extremely well, and are accelerating their performance through our integration process. And I think these businesses, over the long haul, have great upside for us.
If I look forward, looking at the fasteners, we have strong demand on us that now we will have to accelerate our output to support the demand as the rate increases come through, and there are additional share opportunities that are available for us to work on now that will begin in calendar year '16.
Aerostructures. We are aligned at today's current rates. From there, we'll have to support the rate increases on the 787. The A350, with the addition of ADI, is a very strong program for us, and as that moves into greater production rates, that's going to be a strong contributor into this segment.
We also have already won contracts from the OEMs as we went through last half of last year in the beginning of this year that during their outsource, we have equipment that has been an order and arrives in our fiscal year -- fiscal Q1 and Q2 of '16. That will allow us to ramp up and support that demand as we move into the back half of '16.
With that, I'll move it over to Shawn."

I want to take a couple of minutes to update you on substantial enhancement to our investment communication program. You are well aware that PCC has seen significant growth over the past decade, and with that growth certainly has come complexity. We've become more vertically integrated, expanded our product and customer reach, and added new manufacturing technologies. We recognize, I recognize, that this complexity can present a challenge for shareholders and analysts to understand and to translate into expected financial results. We also understand our obligation to you to reconcile our expectations for the financial performance of the business with yours. To support this process, we will be starting an annual guidance program beginning our Q4 fiscal year '15 call in May. The initial look at each fiscal year will come on our fourth quarter call, and then we will update the outlook at each quarterly earnings call.
I'd like to also provide an update on how we're thinking about fiscal year '16, as well as give you some comments on fiscal year '15, so that you have a starting reference point as we shift to discuss '16. So for fiscal year '15, we expect EPS to be in the range of $12.80 to $12.90. Supporting this view is the Q4 shipment that was deferred from December, a full quarter of availability from the assets we upgraded in Q3. 
There are 2 end market assumptions we have made. First, we are assuming lower demand in our oil and gas markets with Q4 shipments that are lower than we experienced in Q3, as we are assuming December's tough conditions persist through all of Q4. Second, we are assuming that a single customer who was been destocking continues that activity, and that demand steps down from Q3 to Q4, as PCC adjusts to the latest build forecast.
We will present to you our to you our complete view of fiscal year '16 on our Q4 call in May, but I also wanted to provide an update to caliber you on how we see calendar year '16 shaping up at this time. Since we originally offered our fiscal year '16 framework, there have been several factors that have been positive to the plan, but also several factors that have been negative. 
On the positive side, we have seen great integration performance from acquisitions. This includes ADI, Permaswage, TIMET and a number of those that came before that that are still in their accelerated process.  Secondly, we are seeing IGT demand growth that was not originally contemplated in the outlook, reflecting our success in winning share on new programs on -- on new equipment.  Lastly, we have benefited from the constant attention to operational efficiencies. Investment Cast margin expansion on stable revenues is just one example of this intensity.  Lastly, we've been able to return over $1.3 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases. 
However, on the negative side, we have had substantial erosion on our military activity, as seen in lower spares activity, program wind-downs and slower-than-expected production ramps. We're also now in the midst of a reduction in demand from our oil and gas markets. Additionally, we have noted the persistent destocking by an important aero engines customer, which now approaches 2 years in duration.  Lastly, a strong U.S. dollar creates a translation headwind for a number of our operations, and benchmark interest rates used for pension plan calculations have continued to move lower. 
We will be providing a thorough look at fiscal year '16 as part of our issuance of formal guidance in May. For now, the net of all these positives and negative factors now lead us to conclude that our fiscal year '16 results will be below previously stated EPS targets of $15.50 to $16.50 after including cash deployment. However, we expect our fiscal year '16 EPS will demonstrate growth over '15, driven by effective leverage of IGT market share, aerospace build rate increases, initial production of next-generation engines and strong cash generation and deployment to acquisitions and share repurchase. We will have a complete discussion of the dynamics during our initial guidance presentation in May, and with that, we'll open it up to questions."

We have products in almost all of our -- whether it's structural castings or whether it's TIMET or Wyman-Gordon, we have products where we are the only solution on that particular application.

But looking at what's sitting in front of us in the M&A opportunity as well as what we think we can do in share repurchase, I think, again, for the next 12 months, I think that's kind of where we want to be."

I think that between the 35 lost volume and the -- kind of that year-end dynamics and push that we always see, you're probably in that $50 million, $60 million worth of revenue that we kind of got hit with the headwind, and then that oil and gas was probably somewhere in the vicinity of additional $20 million on the very back side of the equation. So we also saw, again, that single, the customer sequentially in that segment was $15 million to $20 million, so it was not a small number sequentially. So those were the primary drivers. Now what you saw us do is we did a lot of replacement with the best we could replacing going to that general industrial to keep the assets busy. So as we saw these events kind of occurring in mid-quarter, we started reacting the best we could do. So as I think of, going forward, the end of the year destocking, that product's gone. That basically goes the first week of January. Our -- I do want -- it didn't come up. Our Forged complex was fully operational tool rate as we entered the end of November and fully into December, and it was performing at the upgrade. So the asset itself was up and performing at what we expected to get. So I'd say that one certainly comes back. The oil and gas, we only saw 1 month of that erosion. I think that we'll see, to some degree, kind of 3 months of that coming into Q4 as we -- I think we're going to get hit by the distributors still pausing and waiting to see what happens. And it's going to take them 1 or 2 quarters to get their feet underneath them. So I think that's the big changes there were just in -- and then they change out to the general industrial. I mean, general industrial for us is a commodity. It is -- it gets treated like a commodity. So a pound of general industrial for us does not generate the value that a pound of oil and gas or a pound of aerospace or a pound of military. It just does not have the same value to it."

So it was not a small number. So Boeing is coming in, and we are seeing that growth. Now there's still more to come as we move through '16. So to answer your first question, yes. Certainly, the oil and gas for us was going to be a growth driver with profit margins that are more representative of the aerospace, especially as it came to nickel. So yes, I would say that, overall, as that pausing occurs, you will probably see more people in the nickel market fighting for what's available in other product, and I would say that, that would certainly hold true in SMC."

There's a lot of dynamics that can change. So number one, certainly, the -- it will not be looking out that far. So we will target and we will go after a year. For the most part, if you look at our base, let's take aerospace for a minute, if you look at aerospace, I think we have a very good line of sight excluding what we've seen in this one destocking event. But if I look at the other engine manufacturers and the airframe, I think that we do have good clarity in terms of what they're going to do. If you look at some of the both new programs, I think that there is good clarity now in the 350, what the 350 is going to do. It's probably then one that had some of the biggest question marks. So I think that if you look at that side of our business, schedules are starting to predict pretty well. So I think now starting to say going out a year, I think that's a much more reasonable time frame for us to look at. I think -- the other thing you'll see us do is we will provide what assumptions -- so we'll have to make some assumptions on things like oil and gas. So I think that we will clarify as we communicate to you where we think some of that volatility may exist in terms of those assumptions. It will then be incumbent on us to either validate that our assumptions were right. They were better or worse. So I think that this whole -- our whole mindset will now be clear to what do we -- what is more solid against what is the risk, and in confirming where that risk is or what assumptions we're making. Now we're confirming on a 3-month snapshot how's that year going to play out. So I think that we'll be able to give a -- it's just a totally different dynamic, I think, from that standpoint."

But there is a -- there are a number of platforms and parts where we are the sole source. And there are conditions in part in TIMET where it's just the only solution, period. Those are the ones that we can sit and aligned and say, ""Okay, this overall riding demand, this is leading it. The change is going from a number to a lower number. And is that matching up to this sole source or only solutions?"" Once we finance that, yes, we can then translate that over to where there are -- or is there a competition and extrapolate out what's happening from the share from that standpoint. So that's how that gets us. And I know for a fact today that we do have these sole-source positions. So that's what we've been using. In terms of the overall, I'd say that if you look at kind of the latest engine, the kind of that new narrow-body re-engining and our -- the combined assets of Precision Castparts. And we've tried to work with our customer to go with the combined assets. And now you're talking about assets that are complete in terms of structural castings, large, small, titanium, nickel. You're going across both alloyed types, nickel, titanium. You're going across turbine blades, full capability. We're going into the fastest side of the equation. And in some cases, we're even going into machining. So we have sat with that full complement of assets, which -- there are other people out there that have pieces of it, but nobody has that [ph] complement. And the result of certainly the latest awards are that we got a share and a value of content higher than we've gotten in the previous engine. So competition is needed, competition is out there, competition is okay. But I think that this set of assets, all in, ti-aluminide, I forgot to bring that one up too, so bringing this full complement of assets, it's just not adding 1 or 2. You can have a casting asset, but if you don't have the ability to make material for it, you don't get the benefit of that. You can have a titanium asset, but if you don't have a nickel assets, it doesn't help you or vice versa. If you have a forging asset, but you can't make nickel material, it doesn't necessarily help you at that standpoint. So that's how we look at it. And again, I think the award that we got and have been getting says that, at least to date, it's still a -- again, underlying all of that, it's -- I don't -- without a single plant that you will go out to and says, ""Oh, we're doing great."" So it's that -- and then you come back to that manufacturing drum beat that just drives after it. So I think all that put in..."

So we have to balance that concept out with any activities we enter into in Q4 or beyond. So I just want to make sure that, that's the first step of this equation. We have committed to and we will continue to eliminate dilution. That is a small number, I realized. But that's something that we have committed to and we have an ongoing program to manage that. Then what we do is we look at where we are relative to M&A activities because as Mark mentioned, those are, first and foremost, our priority. So we look at our activities and what our options are and timing that we believe those to come through.

The one thing I will say overall, if I go back -- man, when I started 30 years ago and kind of hit the spots every 5 or 10 years, and I look at what signals we got and what clarity was, whether it was spare parts or whatever it is, the accuracy of the industry, for the most part, has been pretty reasonable. If I look at the framers, the fact that they are now stepping up or coming down with 1 year to 2 years' notice, the signals themselves are playing out reasonable. And typically, what we do, and we do, do this, we crosscheck airframe to engines to parts to alloy. And that goes on every quarter at our operations. What becomes difficult when we have a customer -- and it's happened over time -- that as other dynamics that are driving them from the marketplace. So do I think we have -- I'm using the aerospace as an example. Do I think we have a very clear line of sight of what the market is doing? Absolutely. But when you start saying there are dynamics different from the marketplace that are driving it, now it becomes -- to some degree, you got to follow the customer because they're doing something different from the market. I don't know how you start second guessing a customer. So I'd tell you, when we try to second guess a customer, it can get us into trouble either way. Either we can get a situation that we've guessed wrong that we said that they're going to need it, and we build, build, build and they haven't needed it, or we second guess and don't build and we get them in a world of hurt. So I'd say that -- is there a way to -- there's always a way to look at something better. So I -- sitting here on this job, your question is fair. Do I need to continue to search for something to try to better anticipate this? Yes, I need to search and we will continue. But if I look at the rest of the market, plus or minus 3%, it's playing out -- in terms of aerospace, it's playing out pretty much on the commercial. The military, I'll tell you that, that's one that we got to get a better understanding of because it has changed from what it used to be from our standpoint.

So if I look at -- for the most part, obviously, in our Airframe Products and our castings, that doesn't -- so you are correct in assuming a bunch -- you had a number of assumptions that, I think, are valid. Number one, yes, we will aggressively go after product that utilizes our assets while we're waiting for -- what we would want the core assets to come back. So we do what we do and will continue to do that. And that goes both nickel and titanium. There are titanium opportunities that we have been very aggressive going after that typically TIMET wouldn't have gone after. Now their cost structure is drastically different than it was 1.5 years, 2 years ago. So they -- it puts them in at least a better position to go get. But when you start going in at general industrial, yes, you start getting margin compression. The way we look at it is, would we take something that would have 0 value to the company and just putting air across the asset? No, we wouldn't do that. We would walk away from that. When we look at some that effectively helps absorb all variable plus fixed, plus SG&A, yes, we would look at doing that. Obviously, we wouldn't take a whole quarter's worth to that business, but we would look to balance out something. What we don't want is we don't want to idle assets. We don't want to keep them operating at a horrible inefficiency. And we also believe that some of this is not a permanent change if you look at some of the aerospace. We also know we get growth coming. So let me take TIMET for an example. We know what's coming in airframe. We know the contracts we got and we know the opportunity we have on it in the future. Will I replace, in a short term, some of that softness? Yes, I will. I'll do that. Would it compress the margins? It will. Is there going to be -- are we just going to take stuff endlessly?

I'm thinking along the lines of just TIMET not maybe coming through as strong as you would've thought or just market share that you would assume that you're not getting.

You can -- stubborn, you can call it whatever you want to call it. But let me just kind of back up. The fact that we go after that cost side of the equation, so pricing doesn't necessarily mean static pricing or we've not seen inflation. We have been, to our customer, a deflationary supplier for a long time. So let there be no mistake, we are not sitting getting price increases and have not gotten on, as an average, for many, many, many years. So deflation is a way of life. It is what you have to do. Now when you look at businesses or contracts, what we look at is what we assume we can do on cost takeout. Then again, that goes across all over us, so it could be revert utilization, machining in our own facilities, whatever the case may be, but we look at the value to the business. We look at the volume we're trying to get. And in general, we understand our customers are going to get some of that and our shareholders are going to get some of that and our employees are going to get some of that. So there's this -- again, if I go back even to Partnering for Success where it was this big pullback right by the Partnering for Success, I mean, we have viewed and continue to view it as, for example, an opportunity to go in and kind of balance what the customer needs along what we need and you're right, volume. But we have been a deflationary company. So are we -- reasonable deflation is -- that's something that we will deal with. And is it something that's different? To answer that question, it's -- no, it's just been a constant way of life for us, and it's going to be a constant way of life moving forward. And it's balancing because we have some parts that obviously we could probably move price up and we have product that we got to move price down on, but when we sit with our customers and look in totality, that's kind of -- we look at our business. But no, I'm not -- I don't think something new is coming in. This is all -- we've now -- you've been an inflationary supplier, and now you're going to be deflationary.

Looking at the company in total, our sales are up 5% versus last year, going from roughly $2.3 billion last year to $2.46 billion this year. Our operating income increased 2%, going from $655 million last year to $670 million this year. And o",1833,"Thanks, Jay. Looking at the company in total, our sales are up 5% versus last year, going from roughly $2.3 billion last year to $2.46 billion this year. Our operating income increased 2%, going from $655 million last year to $670 million this year. And our operating margins decreased 80 basis points, going from 28% last year to 27.2% this year. All this generated an EPS increase of 5% versus last year, going from $2.94 last year to $3.09 this year.
If I look at the key components. On sales, year-on-year, our aerospace sales were up 6% versus last year. Our large commercial, we did see strong growth of 7%, and this does include the negative impact from a single-customer continued demand change that impacted these by roughly 3 percentage points. We also saw an increase in demand from both regional and biz jet, and our military was basically flat, as it has been.
In power, overall, our demand was up 2%. We saw strong IGT demand, up by 7%. Our extruded pipe was down by 15%. The primary driver for this was the extended time to bring our forge complex back up from the upgrade that we did in the back half of Q2 that carried into inefficiencies in the early half of Q3. And with the dynamics going on in the marketplace, our oil and gas sales were down 7%.
Our general industrial sales, overall, for the company were up 4%. The primary driver for this is we certainly were looking for product to put over our Forged assets to make sure that we were doing everything we can to overcome some of the negative headwinds we faced in the very back half of Q3. This gives us a reported of growth of 5%. Included in this is $20 million of currency headwind. Our acquisitions accounted for 3% of our growth, and this gave us an overall organic growth rate of 2% for the quarter.
If I look operationally. On the plus side, we saw solid leverage on the growth in both Investment Cast and Airframe, but the real impact to our business was a negative drag from the volume changes, mainly in our Forged Products and oil and gas; the slower rate of achieving our production rates from the press upgrade; and the ongoing demand from the single customer changing their demand on us.
If I move up the company, I look onto the segments, and I begin with Investment Cast Products. Our sales were up 4% versus last year, going from $609 million last year to $632 million this year. Our operating income increased 5%, going from $218 million last year to $229 million this year. And our margins expanded 40 basis points, going from 35.8% last year to 36.2% this year.
In Cast Products, if I look at sales overall, our aerospace sales were up 3% with large commercial up 2%. We did see an increase in regional and biz jet in this segment. Our military, again, was stable at the kind of the depressed levels we're at right now. On power sales, they were up by 9% versus last year. Our IGT sales were up 10%, which is kind of a difference than where the market is at this point in time. Our general industrial was down 8%, but this is on a very small baseline.
Operationally, we saw strong utilization of our fixed assets. We continued to use and leverage our low-cost operations. So in the quarter, we continued to drive to some of our offshore operations as well as some of the other ones we have inside the continental U.S., and we saw solid incremental margins of greater than 40%.
If I look forward in Investment Cast Products. And in this segment in aerospace, it's almost all engine volume. If I look at where we are today, this segment is basically at rate and has been at rate on the major programs. However, this does exclude the single customer that's continued to change the demand downwards. There is acceleration coming in this market that will be driven by the rate increases on the 787 as well as the 350 moving up into larger production quantities in the next 2 years. The rate increases on the narrow-body re-engining will have a double impact for us. We will get the benefit of the rate increase, and we will get a multiplier based on our content on share that's already been won on the re-engining. So as these programs come through, the new re-engining will have a double impact for this segment. In power, we continue to see growth through fiscal year '16 driven by our content on the new platforms and the higher spares activity.
Moving on to Cast and on to Forged. Overall, our sales were up 2% versus last year, going from roughly $1 billion last year to $1.03 billion this year. Our operating income decreased 7%, going from $257 million last year to $239 million this year. Our margins decreased 230 basis points, going from 25.5% last year to 23.2% this year.
If I look at the key drivers in Forged Products, overall, our aerospace sales were up by 1%, but this includes -- again, this segment got hit squarely with the majority of the year-over-year change in demand from the destocking. This negatively impacted the growth rate of this segment by roughly 6 percentage points. This was across Wyman, SMC and TIMET. It was both on our direct shipments to this OEM and on the raw materials into other component manufacturers who supply their customers are also seeing the change. 
Our power is down by roughly 5% overall. We saw lower extruded pipe sales, again, mainly due to the delay of getting our production rates back up from the upgrade. We saw weaker oil and gas activity, and it really accelerated in the back half of the quarter. And we did see a slight decrease on IGT and the OEMs different from Investment Cast. The content change is relatively similar on the programs in Forged, whereas Cast has that accelerating content on their programs. In general, industrial was up 14% in this segment versus last year. And again, that was driven to put the volume across our fixed assets. And to round it all out, we had $10 million of higher metal pricing.
Operationally, I think it falls into 2 categories. We certainly had the replacement compared to last year of the commercial and military aero and oil and gas with general industrial. It was a conscious effort to go and move that volume across our assets, and we did have the inefficiencies in the early half of Q3, bringing back our pipe complex back online and up to production volumes.
If I look forward in Forged Products, as with Investment Cast Products, on the components side, our base aero demand is in alignment with the current rates, but this does exclude the single customer we are below current rates. They do have the same step-ups coming as we move through fiscal year '16, the 787 rate increase and the A350. And in this segment, we will benefit from both the engine and the airframe on those platform upgrades. In the narrow-body re-engining, as with Cast, Forged got a strong dollar contract to support that changeover to the new engine. So you'll get the -- again, the multiplying effect of the rate increases, along with our content increase versus what programs they'll be replacing. And as with Cast Products, we are assuming flat military sales.
In power, we are expecting to see uncertainty in the oil and gas. I think it's falling into a couple of categories. The distribution sales, I think, will remain soft. There was certainly a lot of pullback as we exited our Q3 as they're trying to see what demand will come on them. So I think we're looking at 2 quarters, certainly, of softness in the distribution. On the major projects, we saw a number of them put on hold. We were in final negotiation on some large projects, not been canceled. The decision point has been pushed to the right. But I think over the medium and long term, again, there is share that is available that we were in good position to win prior to this change, and there's also been a desire of the industry to move to the higher-performance alloys, and these alloys have been out in the field that have -- through their small introductory and in test, and we're getting ready to go into larger quantities.
Finally, on Airframe Products, overall, our sales were up 11% versus last year, going from $722 million last year to $798 million this year. Our operating income increased 12%, going from $216 million last year to $241 million this year. And our margins expanded 30 basis points, going from 29.9% last year to 30.2% this year.
If I look at the key drivers. Our aerospace sales, overall, were up 13%. Our large commercial was up 17%. We saw solid contribution from ADI and Permaswage, and our military sales were down slightly. Our general industrial sales in this segment were down 12%. Again, it's on a much smaller base. The main driver for that is our auto sales in Brazil and the pulp and paper segment of our business that's in this segment also.
Operationally, our base fastener businesses had very strong performance, and both ADI and Permaswage contributed in 2 different ways. First of all, the base performance coming in -- and at the time, when it came in, it was at a lower -- it was dilutive to us, but they have done extremely well and are accelerating their performance through our integration process. And I think these businesses, over the long haul, have great upside for us.
If I look forward. Looking at the fasteners, we have strong demand on us that's now. We will have to accelerate our output to support the demand as the rate increases come through. And there are additional share opportunities that are available for us that we're working on now that would begin in calendar year '16.
Aerostructures. We are aligned at today's current rates. From there, we'll have to support the rate increases on the 787. The A350, with the addition of ADI, is a very strong program for us. And as that moves into greater production rates, that's going to be a strong contributor into this segment.
We also have already won contracts from the OEMs as we went through last half of last year and the beginning of this year, that -- during their outsource. We have the equipment that has been an order and arrives in our fiscal year -- fiscal Q1 and Q2 of '16. That will allow us to ramp up and support that demand as we move into the back half of '16.
With that, I'll move it over to Shawn."

I want to take a couple of minutes to update you on substantial enhancement to our investment communication program. You are well aware that PCC has seen significant growth over the past decade, and with that growth certainly has come complexity. We've become more vertically integrated, expanded our product and customer reach and added new manufacturing technologies. We recognize, I recognize, that this complexity can present a challenge for shareholders and analysts to understand and to translate into expected financial results. We also understand our obligation to you to reconcile our expectations for the financial performance of the business with yours. To support this process, we will be starting an annual guidance program beginning our Q4 fiscal year '15 call in May. The initial look at each fiscal year will come on our fourth quarter call, and then we will update the outlook at each quarterly earnings call.
I'd like to also provide an update on how we're thinking about fiscal year '16, as well as give you some comments on fiscal year '15 so that you have a starting reference point as we shift to discuss '16. So for fiscal year '15, we expect EPS to be in the range of $12.80 to $12.90. Supporting this view is the Q4 shipment that was deferred from December, a full quarter of availability from the assets we upgraded in Q3. 
There are 2 end market assumptions we have made. First, we are assuming lower demand in our oil and gas markets with Q4 shipments that are lower than we experienced in Q3, as we are assuming December's tough conditions persist through all of Q4. Second, we are assuming that a single customer who was been destocking continues that activity and that demand steps down from Q3 to Q4 as PCC adjusts to the latest build forecast.
We will present to you our complete view of fiscal year '16 on our Q4 call in May. But I also wanted to provide an update to calibrate you on how we see fiscal year '16 shaping up at this time. Since we originally offered our fiscal year '16 framework, there have been several factors that have been positive to the plan but also several factors that have been negative. 
On the positive side, we have seen great integration performance from our acquisitions. This includes ADI, Permaswage, TIMET and a number of those that came before that, that are still in their accelerated process. Secondly, we are seeing IGT demand growth that was not originally contemplated in the outlook reflecting our success in winning share on new programs and on the generation -- on new equipment.  Lastly, we have benefited from the constant attention to operational efficiencies. Investment Cast margin expansion on stable revenues is just one example of this intensity. Lastly, we've been able to return over $1.3 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases. 
However, on the negative side, we have had substantial erosion on our military activity, as seen in lower spares activity, program wind-downs and slower-than-expected production ramps. We're also now in the midst of a reduction in demand from our oil and gas markets. Additionally, we have noted the persistent destocking by an important aero engine customer, which now approaches 2 years in duration. Lastly, the strong U.S. dollar creates a translation headwind for a number of our operations, and benchmark interest rates used for pension plan calculations have continued to move lower. 
We will be providing a thorough look at fiscal year '16 as part of our issuance of formal guidance in May. For now, the net of all these positives and negative factors now leads us to conclude that our fiscal year '16 results will be below previously stated EPS targets of $15.50 to $16.50 after including cash deployment. However, we expect our fiscal year '16 EPS will demonstrate growth over '15 driven by effective leverage of IGT market share, aerospace build rate increases, initial production of next-generation engines and strong cash generation and deployment to acquisitions and share repurchase. We will have a complete discussion of the dynamics during our initial guidance presentation in May. And with that, we'll open it up to questions."

What I will tell you is that we have the ability to crosscheck a number of different ways. The demand that comes out to us is not -- or the signals are not necessarily POs. They are a demand signal that's sent out to basically all of our plants and our customers that we support other component manufacturers. We have product in almost all of our -- whether it's structural castings or whether it's TIMET or Wyman-Gordon, we have products where we are the only solution on that particular application. So we can match what the -- over the higher demand signals are against that product to see if that matches, and then we can translate that to other products where there may be other competition that's out there. I'll tell you that, in those positions where we are the only solution, they matched almost identical to what we're seeing in terms of the overall drive-down in schedules."

I think we're very committed and you'll see us staying very committed to share repurchase. So I'd say, for the foreseeable future, those would be the 2 dynamics that we want to go after.

I think that between the $35 million lost volume and the -- kind of that year-end dynamics and push that we always see, you're probably in that $50 million, $60 million worth of revenue that we kind of got hit with the headwind. And then that oil and gas was probably somewhere in the vicinity of additional $20 million on the very back side of the equation. So we also saw, again, that single customer sequentially in that segment was $15 million to $20 million, so it was not a small number sequentially. So those were the primary drivers. Now what you saw us do is we did a lot of replacement or the best we could replacing going into that general industrial to keep the assets busy. So as we saw these events kind of occurring in mid-quarter, we started reacting the best we could. So as I think of, going forward, the end of the year destocking, that product's gone. That basically goes the first week of January. Our -- I do want -- it didn't come up. Our forge complex was fully operational to rate as we entered the end of November and fully into December, and it was performing at the upgraded. So the asset itself was up and performing at what we expected to get. So I'd say that one certainly comes back. The oil and gas, we only saw 1 month of that erosion. I think that we'll see, to some degree, kind of 3 months of that coming into Q4 as we -- I think we're going to get hit by the distributors still pausing and waiting to see what happens. And it's going to take them 1 or 2 quarters to get their feet underneath them. So I think that's the big changes there were just in -- and then the change-out to the general industrial. I mean, general industrial for us is a commodity. It is -- it gets treated like a commodity. So a pound of general industrial for us does not generate the value that a pound of oil and gas or a pound of aerospace or a pound of military, it just does not have the same value to it."

That single destocking across the whole thing was between $40 million and $50 million, so it was not a small number. So Boeing is coming in, and we are seeing that growth. Now there's still more to come as we move through '16. So to answer your first question, yes. Certainly, the oil and gas for us was going to be a growth driver with profit margins that are more representative of the aerospace, especially as it came to nickel. So yes, I would say that, overall, as that pausing occurs, you will probably see more people in the nickel market fighting for what's available in other product, and I would say that, that would certainly hold true in SMC."

So it was a -- certainly a long horizon. So I think, number one, the first mistake was looking out, at the time, 3 years to say what we think this business can do. There's a lot of dynamics that can change. So number one, certainly, the -- it will not be looking out that far. So we will target and we will go after a year. For the most part, if you look at our base -- let's stick to aerospace for a minute, if you look at aerospace, I think we have a very good line of sight, excluding what we've seen in this one destocking event. But if I look at the other engine manufacturers and the airframe, I think that we do have good clarity in terms of what they're going to do. If you look at some of the both new programs, I think that there is good clarity now on the 350, what the 350 is going to do. That's probably the one that had some of the biggest question marks. So I think that if you look at that side of our business, schedules are starting to predict pretty well. So I think now starting to say going out a year, I think that's a much more reasonable time frame for us to look at. I think -- the other thing you'll see us do is we will provide what assumptions -- so we'll have to make some assumptions on things like oil and gas. So I think that we will clarify as we communicate to you where we think some of that volatility may exist in terms of those assumptions. It will then be incumbent on us to either validate that our assumptions were right, they were better or worse. So I think that this whole -- our whole mindset will now be clearer to what do we -- what is more solid against what is the risk and confirming where that risk is or what assumptions we're making. Now we're confirming on a 3-month snapshot how's that year going to play out. So I think that we'll be able to give a -- it's just a totally different dynamic, I think, from that standpoint."

And is that matching up to these sole source or only solutions?"" Once we find the answer to that is yes, we can then translate that over to where there are -- or is there a competition and extrapolate out what's happening from the share from that standpoint. So that's how that gets us. And I know for a fact today that we do have these sole-source positions. So that's what we've been using.

So we have sat with that full complement of assets, which -- there are other people out there that have pieces of it, but nobody has that complement. And the result of certainly the latest awards are that we got a share and a value of content higher than we've gotten in the previous engine. So competition is needed, competition is out there, competition is okay. But I think that this set of assets, all-in -- ti-aluminide, I forgot to bring that one up too -- so bringing this full complement of assets, it's just not having 1 or 2. You can have a casting asset, but if you don't have the ability to make material for it, you don't get the benefit of that. You can have a titanium asset, but if you don't have a nickel asset, it doesn't help you, or vice versa. If you have a forging asset, but you can't make nickel material, it doesn't necessarily help you from that standpoint. So that's how we look at it. And again, I think the award that we got and have been getting says that, at least to date, it's still a -- again, underlying all of that is -- I don't -- there's not a single plant that you will go out to and says, ""Oh, we're doing great."" So it's that -- and then you come back to that manufacturing drum beat that just drives after it. So I think all that put in..."

The one thing I will say, overall, if I go back -- man, when I started 30 years ago and kind of hit the spots every 5 or 10 years, and I look at what signals we got and what the clarity was, whether it was spare parts or whatever it is, the accuracy of the industry, for the most part, has been pretty reasonable. If I look at the framers, the fact that they are now stepping up or coming down with 1 year to 2 years' notice, the signals themselves are playing out reasonable. And typically, what we do, and we do, do this, we crosscheck airframe to engines to parts to alloy. And that goes on every quarter at our operations. What becomes difficult when we have a customer, and it's happened over time, that is other dynamics that are driving them from the marketplace. So do I think we have -- using the aerospace as an example, do I think we have a very clear line of sight of what the market is doing? Absolutely. But when you start saying there are dynamics different from the marketplace that are driving it, now it becomes -- to some degree, you've got to follow the customer because they're doing something different from the market. I don't know how you start second-guessing a customer. I'd tell you, when we try to second-guess a customer, it can get us into trouble either way. Either we can get a situation that we've guessed wrong that we said that they're going to need it, and we build, build, build, and they haven't needed it; or we second-guess and don't build and we get them in a world of hurt. So I'd say that -- is there a way to -- there's always a way to look at something better. So I -- sitting here in this job, your question is fair. Do I need to continue to search for something to try to better anticipate this? Yes, I need to search, and we will continue. But if I look at the rest of the market, plus or minus 3%, it's playing out -- in terms of aerospace, it's playing out pretty much on the commercial. The military, I'll tell you that, that's one that we got to get a better understanding of because it has changed from what it used to be from our standpoint.

Number one, yes, we will aggressively go after product that utilizes our assets while we're waiting for what we would want the core assets to come back. So we do what we do and will continue to do that. And that goes both nickel and titanium. There are titanium opportunities that we have been very aggressive going after that typically TIMET would have never gone after. Now their cost structure is drastically different than it was 1.5 years, 2 years ago. So they -- it puts them in at least a better position to go get. But when you start going into general industrial, yes, you start getting margin compression. The way we look at it is, would we take something that would have 0 value to the company and just putting air across the asset? No, we wouldn't do that. We would walk away from that. Would we look at some that effectively helps absorb all variable plus fixed, plus SG&A? Yes, we would look at doing that. Obviously, we wouldn't take a whole quarter's worth to that business, but we would look to balance out something. What we don't want is we don't want to idle assets. We don't want to keep them operating at a horrible inefficiency. And we also believe that some of this is not a permanent change if you look at some of the aerospace. We also know we've got growth coming. So let me take TIMET for an example. We know what's coming in airframe. We know the contracts we got, and we know the opportunity we have out in the future.

Stubborn, you can call it whatever you want to call it. But let me just kind of back up. The fact that we go after that cost side of the equation, so pricing doesn't necessarily mean static pricing or we've not seen deflation, we have been, to our customer, a deflationary supplier for a long time. So let there be no mistake, we are not sitting, getting price increases and have not gotten, as an average, for many, many, many years. So deflation is a way of life. It is what you have to do. Now when we look at businesses or contracts, what we look at is what we assume we can do on cost takeout. And again, that goes across all of our -- so it could be revert utilization, machining on our own facilities, whatever the case may be, but we look at the value to the business. We look at the volume we're trying to get. And in general, we understand that our customers are going to get some of that and our shareholders are going to get some of that and our employees are going to get some of that. So there's this -- again, if I go back even to Partnering for Success where there was this big pullback for everybody, the Partnering for Success, I mean, we have viewed and continue to view it as, for example, an opportunity to go in and kind of balance what the customer needs along what we need, and you're right, volume. But we have been a deflationary company. So are we -- reasonable deflation, is that something that we will deal with, and is it something that's different? The answer to that question is no. It's just been a constant way of life for us, and it's going to be a constant way of life moving forward. And it is balancing because we have some products that, obviously, we could probably move price up, and we have product that we then move price down on, but when we sit with our customers and look in totality, that's kind of the way we look at our business. But no, I'm not -- I don't think something new is coming in and says, oh, we're now -- you've been an inflationary supplier, and now you're going to be deflationary.

Looking at the company in total, our sales are up 5% versus last year, going from roughly $2.3 billion last year to $2.46 billion this year. Our operating income increased 2%, going from $655 million last year to $670 million this year. And o",1833,"Thanks, Jay. Looking at the company in total, our sales are up 5% versus last year, going from roughly $2.3 billion last year to $2.46 billion this year. Our operating income increased 2%, going from $655 million last year to $670 million this year. And our operating margins decreased 80 basis points, going from 28% last year to 27.2% this year. All this generated an EPS increase of 5% versus last year, going from $2.94 last year to $3.09 this year.
If I look at the key components. On sales, year-on-year, our aerospace sales were up 6% versus last year. Our large commercial, we did see strong growth of 7%, and this does include the negative impact from a single-customer continued demand change that impacted these by roughly 3 percentage points. We also saw an increase in demand from both regional and biz jet, and our military was basically flat, as it has been.
In power, overall, our demand was up 2%. We saw strong IGT demand, up by 7%. Our extruded pipe was down by 15%. The primary driver for this was the extended time to bring our forge complex back up from the upgrade that we did in the back half of Q2 that carried into inefficiencies in the early half of Q3. And with the dynamics going on in the marketplace, our oil and gas sales were down 7%.
Our general industrial sales, overall, for the company were up 4%. The primary driver for this is we certainly were looking for product to put over our Forged assets to make sure that we were doing everything we can to overcome some of the negative headwinds we faced in the very back half of Q3. This gives us a reported of growth of 5%. Included in this is $20 million of currency headwind. Our acquisitions accounted for 3% of our growth, and this gave us an overall organic growth rate of 2% for the quarter.
If I look operationally. On the plus side, we saw solid leverage on the growth in both Investment Cast and Airframe, but the real impact to our business was a negative drag from the volume changes, mainly in our Forged Products and oil and gas; the slower rate of achieving our production rates from the press upgrade; and the ongoing demand from the single customer changing their demand on us.
If I move up the company, I look onto the segments, and I begin with Investment Cast Products. Our sales were up 4% versus last year, going from $609 million last year to $632 million this year. Our operating income increased 5%, going from $218 million last year to $229 million this year. And our margins expanded 40 basis points, going from 35.8% last year to 36.2% this year.
In Cast Products, if I look at sales overall, our aerospace sales were up 3% with large commercial up 2%. We did see an increase in regional and biz jet in this segment. Our military, again, was stable at the kind of the depressed levels we're at right now. On power sales, they were up by 9% versus last year. Our IGT sales were up 10%, which is kind of a difference than where the market is at this point in time. Our general industrial was down 8%, but this is on a very small baseline.
Operationally, we saw strong utilization of our fixed assets. We continued to use and leverage our low-cost operations. So in the quarter, we continued to drive to some of our offshore operations as well as some of the other ones we have inside the continental U.S., and we saw solid incremental margins of greater than 40%.
If I look forward in Investment Cast Products. And in this segment in aerospace, it's almost all engine volume. If I look at where we are today, this segment is basically at rate and has been at rate on the major programs. However, this does exclude the single customer that's continued to change the demand downwards. There is acceleration coming in this market that will be driven by the rate increases on the 787 as well as the 350 moving up into larger production quantities in the next 2 years. The rate increases on the narrow-body re-engining will have a double impact for us. We will get the benefit of the rate increase, and we will get a multiplier based on our content on share that's already been won on the re-engining. So as these programs come through, the new re-engining will have a double impact for this segment. In power, we continue to see growth through fiscal year '16 driven by our content on the new platforms and the higher spares activity.
Moving on to Cast and on to Forged. Overall, our sales were up 2% versus last year, going from roughly $1 billion last year to $1.03 billion this year. Our operating income decreased 7%, going from $257 million last year to $239 million this year. Our margins decreased 230 basis points, going from 25.5% last year to 23.2% this year.
If I look at the key drivers in Forged Products, overall, our aerospace sales were up by 1%, but this includes -- again, this segment got hit squarely with the majority of the year-over-year change in demand from the destocking. This negatively impacted the growth rate of this segment by roughly 6 percentage points. This was across Wyman, SMC and TIMET. It was both on our direct shipments to this OEM and on the raw materials into other component manufacturers who supply their customers are also seeing the change. 
Our power is down by roughly 5% overall. We saw lower extruded pipe sales, again, mainly due to the delay of getting our production rates back up from the upgrade. We saw weaker oil and gas activity, and it really accelerated in the back half of the quarter. And we did see a slight decrease on IGT and the OEMs different from Investment Cast. The content change is relatively similar on the programs in Forged, whereas Cast has that accelerating content on their programs. In general, industrial was up 14% in this segment versus last year. And again, that was driven to put the volume across our fixed assets. And to round it all out, we had $10 million of higher metal pricing.
Operationally, I think it falls into 2 categories. We certainly had the replacement compared to last year of the commercial and military aero and oil and gas with general industrial. It was a conscious effort to go and move that volume across our assets, and we did have the inefficiencies in the early half of Q3, bringing back our pipe complex back online and up to production volumes.
If I look forward in Forged Products, as with Investment Cast Products, on the components side, our base aero demand is in alignment with the current rates, but this does exclude the single customer we are below current rates. They do have the same step-ups coming as we move through fiscal year '16, the 787 rate increase and the A350. And in this segment, we will benefit from both the engine and the airframe on those platform upgrades. In the narrow-body re-engining, as with Cast, Forged got a strong dollar contract to support that changeover to the new engine. So you'll get the -- again, the multiplying effect of the rate increases, along with our content increase versus what programs they'll be replacing. And as with Cast Products, we are assuming flat military sales.
In power, we are expecting to see uncertainty in the oil and gas. I think it's falling into a couple of categories. The distribution sales, I think, will remain soft. There was certainly a lot of pullback as we exited our Q3 as they're trying to see what demand will come on them. So I think we're looking at 2 quarters, certainly, of softness in the distribution. On the major projects, we saw a number of them put on hold. We were in final negotiation on some large projects, not been canceled. The decision point has been pushed to the right. But I think over the medium and long term, again, there is share that is available that we were in good position to win prior to this change, and there's also been a desire of the industry to move to the higher-performance alloys, and these alloys have been out in the field that have -- through their small introductory and in test, and we're getting ready to go into larger quantities.
Finally, on Airframe Products, overall, our sales were up 11% versus last year, going from $722 million last year to $798 million this year. Our operating income increased 12%, going from $216 million last year to $241 million this year. And our margins expanded 30 basis points, going from 29.9% last year to 30.2% this year.
If I look at the key drivers. Our aerospace sales, overall, were up 13%. Our large commercial was up 17%. We saw solid contribution from ADI and Permaswage, and our military sales were down slightly. Our general industrial sales in this segment were down 12%. Again, it's on a much smaller base. The main driver for that is our auto sales in Brazil and the pulp and paper segment of our business that's in this segment also.
Operationally, our base fastener businesses had very strong performance, and both ADI and Permaswage contributed in 2 different ways. First of all, the base performance coming in -- and at the time, when it came in, it was at a lower -- it was dilutive to us, but they have done extremely well and are accelerating their performance through our integration process. And I think these businesses, over the long haul, have great upside for us.
If I look forward. Looking at the fasteners, we have strong demand on us that's now. We will have to accelerate our output to support the demand as the rate increases come through. And there are additional share opportunities that are available for us that we're working on now that would begin in calendar year '16.
Aerostructures. We are aligned at today's current rates. From there, we'll have to support the rate increases on the 787. The A350, with the addition of ADI, is a very strong program for us. And as that moves into greater production rates, that's going to be a strong contributor into this segment.
We also have already won contracts from the OEMs as we went through last half of last year and the beginning of this year, that -- during their outsource. We have the equipment that has been an order and arrives in our fiscal year -- fiscal Q1 and Q2 of '16. That will allow us to ramp up and support that demand as we move into the back half of '16.
With that, I'll move it over to Shawn."

I want to take a couple of minutes to update you on substantial enhancement to our investment communication program. You are well aware that PCC has seen significant growth over the past decade, and with that growth certainly has come complexity. We've become more vertically integrated, expanded our product and customer reach and added new manufacturing technologies. We recognize, I recognize, that this complexity can present a challenge for shareholders and analysts to understand and to translate into expected financial results. We also understand our obligation to you to reconcile our expectations for the financial performance of the business with yours. To support this process, we will be starting an annual guidance program beginning our Q4 fiscal year '15 call in May. The initial look at each fiscal year will come on our fourth quarter call, and then we will update the outlook at each quarterly earnings call.
I'd like to also provide an update on how we're thinking about fiscal year '16, as well as give you some comments on fiscal year '15 so that you have a starting reference point as we shift to discuss '16. So for fiscal year '15, we expect EPS to be in the range of $12.80 to $12.90. Supporting this view is the Q4 shipment that was deferred from December, a full quarter of availability from the assets we upgraded in Q3. 
There are 2 end market assumptions we have made. First, we are assuming lower demand in our oil and gas markets with Q4 shipments that are lower than we experienced in Q3, as we are assuming December's tough conditions persist through all of Q4. Second, we are assuming that a single customer who was been destocking continues that activity and that demand steps down from Q3 to Q4 as PCC adjusts to the latest build forecast.
We will present to you our complete view of fiscal year '16 on our Q4 call in May. But I also wanted to provide an update to calibrate you on how we see fiscal year '16 shaping up at this time. Since we originally offered our fiscal year '16 framework, there have been several factors that have been positive to the plan but also several factors that have been negative. 
On the positive side, we have seen great integration performance from our acquisitions. This includes ADI, Permaswage, TIMET and a number of those that came before that, that are still in their accelerated process. Secondly, we are seeing IGT demand growth that was not originally contemplated in the outlook reflecting our success in winning share on new programs and on the generation -- on new equipment.  Lastly, we have benefited from the constant attention to operational efficiencies. Investment Cast margin expansion on stable revenues is just one example of this intensity. Lastly, we've been able to return over $1.3 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases. 
However, on the negative side, we have had substantial erosion on our military activity, as seen in lower spares activity, program wind-downs and slower-than-expected production ramps. We're also now in the midst of a reduction in demand from our oil and gas markets. Additionally, we have noted the persistent destocking by an important aero engine customer, which now approaches 2 years in duration. Lastly, the strong U.S. dollar creates a translation headwind for a number of our operations, and benchmark interest rates used for pension plan calculations have continued to move lower. 
We will be providing a thorough look at fiscal year '16 as part of our issuance of formal guidance in May. For now, the net of all these positives and negative factors now leads us to conclude that our fiscal year '16 results will be below previously stated EPS targets of $15.50 to $16.50 after including cash deployment. However, we expect our fiscal year '16 EPS will demonstrate growth over '15 driven by effective leverage of IGT market share, aerospace build rate increases, initial production of next-generation engines and strong cash generation and deployment to acquisitions and share repurchase. We will have a complete discussion of the dynamics during our initial guidance presentation in May. And with that, we'll open it up to questions."

They are a demand signal that's sent out to basically all of our plants and our customers that we support other component manufacturers. We have product in almost all of our -- whether it's structural castings or whether it's TIMET or Wyman-Gordon, we have products where we are the only solution on that particular application.

I think that between the $35 million lost volume and the -- kind of that year-end dynamics and push that we always see, you're probably in that $50 million, $60 million worth of revenue that we kind of got hit with the headwind. And then that oil and gas was probably somewhere in the vicinity of additional $20 million on the very back side of the equation. So we also saw, again, that single customer sequentially in that segment was $15 million to $20 million, so it was not a small number sequentially. So those were the primary drivers. Now what you saw us do is we did a lot of replacement or the best we could replacing going into that general industrial to keep the assets busy. So as we saw these events kind of occurring in mid-quarter, we started reacting the best we could. So as I think of, going forward, the end of the year destocking, that product's gone. That basically goes the first week of January. Our -- I do want -- it didn't come up. Our forge complex was fully operational to rate as we entered the end of November and fully into December, and it was performing at the upgraded. So the asset itself was up and performing at what we expected to get. So I'd say that one certainly comes back. The oil and gas, we only saw 1 month of that erosion. I think that we'll see, to some degree, kind of 3 months of that coming into Q4 as we -- I think we're going to get hit by the distributors still pausing and waiting to see what happens. And it's going to take them 1 or 2 quarters to get their feet underneath them. So I think that's the big changes there were just in -- and then the change-out to the general industrial. I mean, general industrial for us is a commodity. It is -- it gets treated like a commodity. So a pound of general industrial for us does not generate the value that a pound of oil and gas or a pound of aerospace or a pound of military, it just does not have the same value to it."

Now there's still more to come as we move through '16. So to answer your first question, yes. Certainly, the oil and gas for us was going to be a growth driver with profit margins that are more representative of the aerospace, especially as it came to nickel. So yes, I would say that, overall, as that pausing occurs, you will probably see more people in the nickel market fighting for what's available in other product, and I would say that, that would certainly hold true in SMC."

There's a lot of dynamics that can change. So number one, certainly, the -- it will not be looking out that far. So we will target and we will go after a year. For the most part, if you look at our base -- let's stick to aerospace for a minute, if you look at aerospace, I think we have a very good line of sight, excluding what we've seen in this one destocking event. But if I look at the other engine manufacturers and the airframe, I think that we do have good clarity in terms of what they're going to do. If you look at some of the both new programs, I think that there is good clarity now on the 350, what the 350 is going to do. That's probably the one that had some of the biggest question marks. So I think that if you look at that side of our business, schedules are starting to predict pretty well. So I think now starting to say going out a year, I think that's a much more reasonable time frame for us to look at. I think -- the other thing you'll see us do is we will provide what assumptions -- so we'll have to make some assumptions on things like oil and gas. So I think that we will clarify as we communicate to you where we think some of that volatility may exist in terms of those assumptions. It will then be incumbent on us to either validate that our assumptions were right, they were better or worse. So I think that this whole -- our whole mindset will now be clearer to what do we -- what is more solid against what is the risk and confirming where that risk is or what assumptions we're making. Now we're confirming on a 3-month snapshot how's that year going to play out. So I think that we'll be able to give a -- it's just a totally different dynamic, I think, from that standpoint."

But there is a -- there are a number of platforms and parts where we are the sole source. And there are conditions in parts in TIMET where it's just the only solution, period. Those are the ones that we can sit in a line and say, ""Okay, this overall riding demand, this is leading it. The change is going from a number to a lower number. And is that matching up to these sole source or only solutions?"" Once we find the answer to that is yes, we can then translate that over to where there are -- or is there a competition and extrapolate out what's happening from the share from that standpoint. So that's how that gets us. And I know for a fact today that we do have these sole-source positions. So that's what we've been using. In terms of the overall, I'd say that if you look at kind of the latest engine, the kind of that new narrow-body re-engining and our -- the combined assets of Precision Castparts, and we've tried to work with our customer to go with the combined assets. And now you're talking about assets that are complete in terms of structural castings, large, small, titanium, nickel. You're going across both alloy types, nickel, titanium. You're going across turbine blades, full capability. We're going into the faster side of the equation. And in some cases, we're even going into machining. So we have sat with that full complement of assets, which -- there are other people out there that have pieces of it, but nobody has that complement. And the result of certainly the latest awards are that we got a share and a value of content higher than we've gotten in the previous engine. So competition is needed, competition is out there, competition is okay. But I think that this set of assets, all-in -- ti-aluminide, I forgot to bring that one up too -- so bringing this full complement of assets, it's just not having 1 or 2. You can have a casting asset, but if you don't have the ability to make material for it, you don't get the benefit of that. You can have a titanium asset, but if you don't have a nickel asset, it doesn't help you, or vice versa. If you have a forging asset, but you can't make nickel material, it doesn't necessarily help you from that standpoint. So that's how we look at it. And again, I think the award that we got and have been getting says that, at least to date, it's still a -- again, underlying all of that is -- I don't -- there's not a single plant that you will go out to and says, ""Oh, we're doing great."" So it's that -- and then you come back to that manufacturing drum beat that just drives after it. So I think all that put in..."

The one thing I will say, overall, if I go back -- man, when I started 30 years ago and kind of hit the spots every 5 or 10 years, and I look at what signals we got and what the clarity was, whether it was spare parts or whatever it is, the accuracy of the industry, for the most part, has been pretty reasonable. If I look at the framers, the fact that they are now stepping up or coming down with 1 year to 2 years' notice, the signals themselves are playing out reasonable. And typically, what we do, and we do, do this, we crosscheck airframe to engines to parts to alloy. And that goes on every quarter at our operations. What becomes difficult when we have a customer, and it's happened over time, that is other dynamics that are driving them from the marketplace. So do I think we have -- using the aerospace as an example, do I think we have a very clear line of sight of what the market is doing? Absolutely. But when you start saying there are dynamics different from the marketplace that are driving it, now it becomes -- to some degree, you've got to follow the customer because they're doing something different from the market. I don't know how you start second-guessing a customer. I'd tell you, when we try to second-guess a customer, it can get us into trouble either way. Either we can get a situation that we've guessed wrong that we said that they're going to need it, and we build, build, build, and they haven't needed it; or we second-guess and don't build and we get them in a world of hurt. So I'd say that -- is there a way to -- there's always a way to look at something better. So I -- sitting here in this job, your question is fair. Do I need to continue to search for something to try to better anticipate this? Yes, I need to search, and we will continue. But if I look at the rest of the market, plus or minus 3%, it's playing out -- in terms of aerospace, it's playing out pretty much on the commercial.

I think what our answer to this point is that, again, based on the side-by-side analysis of the parts where there are share lines versus the parts that are sole source, we're seeing those move in tandem, which suggest that there is not a shift on the parts where there is a share line.

But at the same time, the margins there are a little bit less. So could you help us think about -- obviously, higher dollar profits are most important, but margins will be pressured here a little bit. So how do you weigh those opportunities?

So if I look at -- for the most part, obviously, in our Airframe Products and our castings, that doesn't -- so you are correct in assuming a bunch -- you had a number of assumptions that, I think, are valid. Number one, yes, we will aggressively go after product that utilizes our assets while we're waiting for what we would want the core assets to come back. So we do what we do and will continue to do that. And that goes both nickel and titanium. There are titanium opportunities that we have been very aggressive going after that typically TIMET would have never gone after. Now their cost structure is drastically different than it was 1.5 years, 2 years ago. So they -- it puts them in at least a better position to go get. But when you start going into general industrial, yes, you start getting margin compression. The way we look at it is, would we take something that would have 0 value to the company and just putting air across the asset? No, we wouldn't do that. We would walk away from that. Would we look at some that effectively helps absorb all variable plus fixed, plus SG&A? Yes, we would look at doing that. Obviously, we wouldn't take a whole quarter's worth to that business, but we would look to balance out something. What we don't want is we don't want to idle assets. We don't want to keep them operating at a horrible inefficiency. And we also believe that some of this is not a permanent change if you look at some of the aerospace. We also know we've got growth coming. So let me take TIMET for an example. We know what's coming in airframe. We know the contracts we got, and we know the opportunity we have out in the future. Will I replace, in a short term, some of that softness? Yes, I will. I'll do that. Would it compress the margins? It will. Is it going to be -- are we just going to take stuff endlessly? No, we won't. We -- as you can well imagine, we tend to pay very close attention to that. But overall, we will go get things to utilize our assets."

Now when we look at businesses or contracts, what we look at is what we assume we can do on cost takeout. And again, that goes across all of our -- so it could be revert utilization, machining on our own facilities, whatever the case may be, but we look at the value to the business. We look at the volume we're trying to get. And in general, we understand that our customers are going to get some of that and our shareholders are going to get some of that and our employees are going to get some of that. So there's this -- again, if I go back even to Partnering for Success where there was this big pullback for everybody, the Partnering for Success, I mean, we have viewed and continue to view it as, for example, an opportunity to go in and kind of balance what the customer needs along what we need, and you're right, volume. But we have been a deflationary company. So are we -- reasonable deflation, is that something that we will deal with, and is it something that's different? The answer to that question is no. It's just been a constant way of life for us, and it's going to be a constant way of life moving forward. And it is balancing because we have some products that, obviously, we could probably move price up, and we have product that we then move price down on, but when we sit with our customers and look in totality, that's kind of the way we look at our business. But no, I'm not -- I don't think something new is coming in and says, oh, we're now -- you've been an inflationary supplier, and now you're going to be deflationary. We've been deflationary as long as I've been sitting in this job and before."

Portions of today's presentation contain forward-looking statements that are based on our current view of the commercial environment and our businesses. The factors that determine those outcomes can change, and we have to interpret any forward-looking statements in that light. We identified the principal risks and uncertainties that effect our performance on Page 2 of today's presentation and in our Form 10-K and other SEC filings. 
In today's presentation, the company will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures is available in the appendix of the presentation slides, which have been posted to our website at www.precast.com/investors/presentations.
We will be making some enhancements to the structure of our call today. Mark will start with an overview of the fourth quarter. And then, Shawn will cover the financial results in more detail, followed by a discussion of the charges we announced on April 15 as well as our guidance for fiscal year '16. Mark will then have some closing comments, including regarding PCC's capital allocation and M&A framework. Mark, Shawn and I will be then available for your questions. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Mark."

If I look at Q4, certainly it was dominated by a very challenging oil and gas pipe market. That's primarily centered in our Forged Products segment. We had sharp declines in volume, price and mix, all 3 in the same quarter, and this was related to our customers' very cautious buying through their uncertainties and their outlook and demand.
As you'd expect, in response to these dynamics, we addressed not only today's tough market conditions, but our future outlook. We right-sized the operations. We made quick headcount adjustments in our affected operations. We accounted for exiting underperforming investments, and this is mainly our partnership in the Chengde JV, and we adjusted inventory valuations in our exposed businesses. I think we outlined our costs much better moving forward, more than we have been in the last 2 or 3 quarters.
Oil and gas, we see positive trends developing in our Commercial Aero with the future ramp-ups coming in the 787, both narrow bodies, and the A350 ramping up through this year and into the next that goes into higher rates of production. And we will continue to see increasing activity on the new engine program supporting both the A320 Neo and the 737 Max.
IGT continues to be a strong growth driver for us. Primary driver in that is our position on the H-class turbines. We still have market dynamics for key components of a the strong year-on-year margin expansion in Investment Cast and airfames. 
In the quarter, we also were active in our cash deployment. We bought $729 million of our own stock, bringing fiscal year '15 total to $1.6 billion.  You've also seen this morning that the board of directors has authorized an additional $2 billion of stock repurchase, which we expect to complete in the next 12 to 18 months.
From here, we are very focused on executing against our first annual guidance for fiscal year '16, which Shawn will cover shortly. We see a number of routes for sustains value creation both for fiscal year '16 and beyond.
So with that, I'll turn it over to Shawn."

I'll be discussing our consolidated fourth quarter results. Sales of just over $2.5 billion were down 1% reported and flat organically on a constant-currency basis. This reflects good growth in the aerospace and IGT power",2612,"Thanks, Mark. Moving to Slide 4. I'll be discussing our consolidated fourth quarter results. Sales of just over $2.5 billion were down 1% reported and flat organically on a constant-currency basis. This reflects good growth in the aerospace and IGT power markets, offset by strong double-digit declines in the oil and gas and pipe markets. 
Adjusted consolidated segment operating income, which excludes the restructuring and asset impairments, decreased 13% to $624 million, resulting in margin compression of 360 basis points to 24.9%.  This is primarily due to an unfavorable mix of oil and gas related sales available to us in the quarter, and the impact from the inability to move inventory due to lower oil price and distributor demand and a mix shift within the quarter to lower-end products.  As you'll see in the next several slides, we did have good leverage volume in both investment cast and airframe products, reflecting cost improvement initiatives, in addition to continued acquisition integration performance from the operations we've en acquired over the last several years.
Adjusted earnings per share, which excludes of asset impairment and restructuring charges in the quarter, was $2.94 per share, down 10% from last year and included the impact from a lower share count.
As Mark mentioned, we returned $729 million of cash to shareholders, repurchasing nearly 3.5 million shares under our existing share authorization. This reduced our outstanding share count by nearly 3%.
Our aerospace sales were higher by 2%, but by 4% when you exclude the continued impact from the single customer destocking that we discussed for the past several quarters.
In power, IGT was 2% higher, but up low double digits in the Investment Cast Products as we will discussed in the next page. Pipe and oil and gas sales were lower by close to 20% as our customers moderated their buying due to lower drilling demand.
Currency was a nearly $50 million negative year-over-year impact to sales, and this drove a $10 million negative to operating income over the same period.  Total organic sales were flat year-over-year on a constant-currency basis, but this does include roughly 3% of combined negative impact from the single customer destocking we have discussed previously and the oil and gas decline.
Moving to Slide 5 and Investment Cast Products. We saw sales increase 1% to $648 million, driven by another quarter of strong growth in IGT volume. This was partially offset by large commercial aerospace sales and general industrial and other. 
There are several items I'd like to point out on this slide. Large OEM Commercial Aero activity was fairly stable, which represents about 80% of the aerospace sales in this segment, while spares sales moved lower. Regional and business jet sales continue to trend higher and military demand was once again stable. We continue to look at this as a good outcome after sequestration-impacted declines in fiscal 2014 and much of fiscal 2015.
IGT activity continues to benefit from our success in securing positions on latest generation of high-efficiency turbines and was higher by over 10%.
Investment Cast Products incremental margins were 40% year-over-year, driving operating income by 4%. This reflected higher IGT volumes and the continued strong performance on cost control.  From an end market perspective, Investment Cast Products is well positioned to benefit from a strong install base and the growth in high-efficiency IGTs. 
In aerospace, the narrow-body re-engining programs continue to progress well. And we expect to see increased levels of activity in our facilities to support the ramp of these programs in fiscal 2016 and beyond.
Moving to Slide 6 and Forged Products. Sales were down 4% to $1.1 billion, due primarily to strong double-digit declines in oil and gas and pipe sales in the quarter. Also of note was that sales were up slightly over the prior year in aerospace, which was helped by good growth in regional in business jet aircraft, while military was modestly lower driven by a difficult year-over-year comparison.
Power sales were down over 15% year-over-year, reflecting the weakness in oil and gas and pipe and markets. This resulted in lower sales volumes and unfavorable pricing in the quarter.
This rapid shift in market dynamics also created a challenge for operations as we enter each year, we are projecting certain elements, including cost, mix, inventory and volume, and we continue to measure our progress against those goals as we move through the year.  At year-end, we true up the projections to the actual results achieved. That true-up could be more significant if assumptions change materially versus at the beginning of the year.
For Forged Products, a shift in volume, mix and price centered in oil and gas and moved in a negative way for us in Q4, thus, leading to larger-than-normal year-end adjustments.  As a result, a number of the Forged Products operations retained higher-cost inventory in the year-end balances with a negative impact to their base.  We continue to deploy our operating and cost-focused initiatives, including having funded over $6 million of restructuring activities in this segment during the quarter to support profitable growth in Forged Products moving into fiscal 2016.
We also want to provide an update on our TIMET Morgantown facility. The operations suffered a very serious incident on March 27, and the TIMET team has been working diligently to bring that operation back online. facility is now back in operation, with the exception of the single electron beam furnace that suffered the explosion.  That furnace will be out of commission for an extended period of time. TIMET's network of asses is well positioned to service its critical aerospace customers, but that will -- there will be a cost associated with those alternate production routes. We will discuss the financial impact when we review our outlook for fiscal 2016.
Moving to Slide 7 in Airframe Products. Sales were up 1% to $789 million, due primarily to continued growth in large commercial aerospace, partially offset by weakness in general industrial and other in the quarter. Also of note, military sales, which represent less than 10% of the segment sales, were down low double digits. And general industrial softness, where sales were down 15%, reflect the segment sales in the construction and pulp and paper and markets, which combined represent under 5% of the segment's total sales.
Airframe Products continues to execute well, driving operational performance in the base business and continue to leverage the contributions from the ADI and Permaswage acquisition.
Operating income was up 2%, and margins expanded 20 basis points in the quarter.
Turning now to Slide 8 and the fiscal 2015 year-end balance sheet. We maintained a strong cash position with a balance of $474 million at year-end, even with the more robust deployment actions in the fourth quarter. Those actions included $170 million of capital expenditures, which is $78 million higher than last year, driven both by capacity expansions and most notably in our aerostructures operations and investments where cost improvements, primarily of TIMET and Wyman-Gordon. These internal investments have strong return profiles and remain a priority for PCC.
We also delivered on our share repurchase program during the quarter, returning $729 million of cash to shareholders and lowering our share count by nearly 4%. This brings the repurchase total to $1.6 billion or 7.2 million shares for the year.
The PCC Board of Directors today added an additional $2 billion to the company share repurchase authorization. The value in the company was $2.2 billion of availability under the program. It is our expectation that we will complete the repurchase under this new authorization over the next 12 to 18 months.
I'd also like to update you on our cash deployment in the first quarter of 2016. We have so far in the quarter spent $270 million on 2 niche businesses, which will expand our vertical integration capabilities.
As Mark will discuss in a couple minutes, we remain committed to our value-creating capital deployment strategy, focused on growing the business organically and through acquisitions and returning excess cash to shareholders be a share repurchase.
Moving now to Slide 9. I'd like to take a minute and recap the nonoperating assets rationalization and strategic actions that are reflected in our fourth quarter results. We previously provided you ranges. And now on Slide 9, you can see the actual charges associated with each of those actions. 
The largest charge relating to our joint venture, Chengde, was $174 million and due to the tax characteristics, included a small tax charge resulting in an after-tax charge of $179 million. Our decision to exit our investment hinged off of several factors. First, TIMET's pipe and markets continue to be softer than originally planned and versus our expectations. And it has proved tougher to get Chengde pipe in the targeted markets.  At the same time, our Houston facility, which have similar manufacturing capability to Chengde, has been able to expand productivity and output and therefore, has reduced the need for incremental Chengde capacity. As you are aware, Chengde has been a drag for some time on both our financial results and our managerial resources, so exiting allows for better resource and asset utilization going forward.  Therefore, we have adjusted the value of the investment to what we think is realistic in terms of achieving upon an exit in the business.  The charge and the ongoing 50% stake will be reported in equity and earnings of unconsolidated affiliates until the sale is completed.
Our inventory and other asset impairment charges totaled $127 million, primarily reflecting valuation adjustments made to inventory and other assets associated with our oil and gas markets, driven by the very rapid decline in external selling prices.  In addition, some pipes have specification deviations versus the customer's original requirements. And while we previously expected that we'll be able to find alternative customers for this product, now with a tougher demand environment, we have reevaluated those opportunities and have concluded that we need to recognize those charges in the fourth quarter.
The restructuring actions of $8 million are to better align our costs with the current landscape. These actions are primarily in Forged Products related to the oil and gas and pipe and markets and reflect headcount reductions with a very quick payback.
We view all of these actions as better positioning the company for profitable growth in fiscal 2016 and beyond. And we retained very strong capabilities in the oil and gas markets, and these actions will better position the company to serve our customer as demand stabilized.
Let's walk through our guidance summary for fiscal 2016. Moving to Slide 10, we are expecting sales in the range of $10 billion to $10.4 billion, which is flat to up 4% from fiscal 2015 both on the reported an organic basis. The euro and pound are creating an approximate $200 million sales drag on fiscal 2016 worth approximately $0.20 per share for the year. 
Segment EBIT margins are expected to be in the range of 26.6% to 27.3%, down 80 basis points to down 10 basis points on a year-over-year comparison. However, they are higher by 160 to 230 basis points from Q4 fiscal '15 levels.  I'll go into more detail in the margin dynamics as we move into the segment discussion. 
EPS is expected to be in the range of $12.50 to $13.40, representing approximately 3% growth to fiscal 2015 EPS at the midpoint of that range. This assumes a tax rate of 32.5%, and a share count of 137.9 million diluted shares. This reflects our expectation of a deployment of a portion of our new $2 billion authorized share repurchase authorization. 
We expect $70 million of net interest expense and little incremental impact from pension, reflecting strong asset returns offset by a lower discount rate for the year.
Finally, free cash flow is expected to be $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion in 2016, with capital expenditure investments of approximately $550 million for several significant capacity expansion projects as well as cost and productivity improvements throughout the organization.
In summary, we think that this represents a balanced plan, appropriately capturing the risks and opportunities of the year ahead. We have a well-positioned and diverse portfolio and a management team focused on delivering on our commitment.
On Slide 11, looking at the key end market drivers for this fiscal '16 plan, we see a mid-single-digit revenue growth in Commercial Aero, driven by higher build rates on the 787 narrow bodies and the A350 as well as growing activity on the LEAP engine and share gains in our aerostructures operations. We have also factored in an announced rate cut on the A330.
In military, we see fiscal '16 looking much like fiscal '15, with stable build rates and also stable activity in our across our spirits portfolio.
On the business and regional jets said, we're seeing continued healthy demand for mid to large cabin size, which drives continues growth. Again, we have a number of new platforms starting to ramp in this year, and that yields a high single-digit growth rate for the business in regional jet end markets.
Moving to Slide 12, let's discuss power and general industrial. In IGT, we expect continued strong growth in the high single-digit area, driven by PCC's position on the H-class platforms and upgrades program. Given the weakness in the global oil and gas demand, which is about 6% of our sales, we are anticipating volume and price pressures and see declines in excess of 30% in this market for fiscal 2016.
Within our general industrial markets, we're expecting fiscal '16 to look somewhat like fiscal '15, with risk areas around second derivative impact from oil and gas this market, but also some opportunity from global GDP.
Moving to Slide 13. I'd like to spend a minute showing you what our end market assumptions mean for our reporting segments before I hand the call back over to Mark. Starting with Investment Cast Products, we expect to leverage higher Commercial Aero and IGT volume by adding incremental capacity to meet higher demand, and at the same time, improve our overall efficiency and cost structure. Here, we expect mid-single digits sales growth with incremental margins that we expect to be above our typical 35% to 40% level.
In Forged Products, we see increased demand in aerospace and IGT, plus TIMET share gains favorably impacting sales, but also anticipate the oil and gas and foreign exchange headwinds discussed earlier.  All those inputs led to our expectation for low single-digit sales declines versus fiscal '15. 
The TIMET Morgantown incident will have a $25 million to $30 million negative impact of Forged EBIT for 2016, but the segment will also benefit from the impact of restructuring actions taken at the end of the fiscal 2015.
As of the case every year, we will be performing maintenance during Q2. And this year, we do have an extended outage plant occurring at our Wyman-Gordon U.K. facility.
Summing that all up, we see modest margin expansion at Forged Products versus the Q4 FY '15 rate and expect to segment's margins to exit fiscal 2016 in the low 20% area.
Finally, Airframe Products is expecting a strong year, with sales up mid-single digit, reflecting higher aerospace build rates, share gains and further contributions from recent acquisitions, partially offset by foreign exchange headwinds mentioned previously.
As with Investment Cast Products, we expect this segment to deliver strong leverage growth with incremental margins above the typical 35% to 40% level.
In summary, we are confident in our balanced yet achievable plan for fiscal 2016, targeting growth and margin expansion across all 3 segments off the Q4 '15 levels.
Now I'll turn it back to you, Mark."

And now I'll focus on our capital allocation framework. We have 2 primary objectives, which have been the key drivers for us for years. First, we'll continue to invest in our facilities. We will ensure that we have immediate assets to sup",987,"Thanks, Shawn. And now I'll focus on our capital allocation framework. We have 2 primary objectives, which have been the key drivers for us for years. 
First, we'll continue to invest in our facilities. We will ensure that we have immediate assets to support the growth rates and the share that we have in place as we move forward with the accelerated rates. We will relentlessly attack and drive and invest wherever we need to to extract the cost opportunities that are available to us. And we will do everything to ensure that we are providing a safe working environment and maintain our facility.
Second, we'll continue to execute our acquisition strategy that we have established and have been executing over the last 12 years. At the heart of this, we will pursue the right assets that capitalize on our core competencies. We will remain a disciplined buyer to ensure we have the proper return criteria. There are cases and times where it's not uncommon for our M&A from the time we make initial contact until we complete a transaction to be 2-plus years. Again, we're searching and extracting the right assets for us. Once we acquire, we will maintain and continue to be extremely focused on driving our integration process. And for us, that means delivering accelerated performance in the first 1 to 3 and 3 to 5 years.
We will do this while maintaining a sound balance sheet. To us, that means strong investment grade credit rating. This allows us the flexibility to capitalize as strategic opportunities arise not only in strong times, but through all phases of the business cycle. We have, however, reached the size that allows us to deliver the above expectations and return excess cash to shareholders with the intent now to clearly lower the share count.  We talked about it a couple times. The board has just authorized an additional $2 billion of stock repurchase that we expect to execute over the next 12 to 18 months. 
As I look at our performance over the last 3 years, our CapEx, our internal investments have totaled $1.1 billion. Acquisitions have totaled $6.7 billion, and our share repurchase have been $2.2 billion.  So to be clear, we have the desire and the capacity to deliver all 3, given our strong cash-generating capability and the strength of our balance sheet. 
I want to take a closer look at our M&A framework. It has been the largest component of our allocation. We've deployed $8.5 billion from fiscal year '12 through Q1 of fiscal year '16. It has been a very rigorous and focused execution over the last 12 years and will continue to focus around our core competencies. We've significantly expanded our capabilities in terms of the products, complexities, manufacturing methods and materials. We've moved in a multitude of directions. We've been able to drive and deliver accelerated performance in that first 3 to 5 years. We've been able to unlock large amount of capacity constraints that existed at the time of acquisition. We've been able to attack costs on all front. And in a lot of cases, we've been able to utilize across all PCC's assets.
That has allowed us to establish a leadership position in our core markets. I want to look at one example. I want to look at the Airframe Products segment. This is a segment we started from scratch. It covered numerous transactions, varying size and value of the transactions, wide range of complexities, started with fasteners, then moved into fastening systems and then into machining. And then we moved in an assembly utilizing our fasteners. And we're now able to vertically integrate all the way back to metal through forged products and the machining and assembly to provide a more complete value to our customers.
We've invested $5 million plus into this segment. This does account for additional capital expenditures over this time frame, both after maintaining and putting capacity in for capital and for capacity and cost take out. And we are delivering on IRR in the mid- to high teens. This does include a number of assets that are still early in the integration process with more upside, including 2 of our larger transactions, Permaswage and ADI.
M&A will continue to remain our top priority. We are actively pursuing today strategic acquisitions both large and small. We will continue to be a disciplined buyer, but we are targeting $3 billion to $5 billion over the next 2 years.
So if I look in summary, I think we have numerous opportunities for continued value creation moving forward. Our aerospace and IGT markets remain healthy. We've secured strong critical positions on the major growth platforms, the 787, the 350 and next generation narrow bodies as well as we have new share gains across numerous platforms that are under development right now.
On IGT, we have a very strong position in the growth platforms, and again the H-class being the most significant. We do clearly see challenging times in near term in the oil and gas and pipe market. We've taken aggressive actions to align our costs better to the current environment, but we have maintained and now have the key capabilities to serve the market as demand recovers.  This is a business that is firmly committed to continuing to attack, on all fronts across all our business, the opportunities to drive margin expansion.  Clearly, Shawn has already described Forged Products faces a number of challenges today, but we do see a path for sustained margin expansion from Q4 '15 levels. 
As I just reviewed, capital deployment will continue to be a key component of our strategy, with a line of sight for that $3 billion to $5 billion acquisition over the next 2 years and returning the excess cash to our shareholders through share repurchase.
So with that, we'll be happy to open up and answer any questions."

I think that in the first standpoint, I think that -- to answer your first question, there was nothing in that that front number that was out of the ordinary. I would say that we probably held on to our costs longer than we would have done when we get further clarity. And I think as you saw us move into Q4, we said, ""Enough. We're going to take a very conservative approach. We're going to make the rightsizing."" As I go back, I'm going to -- I would expect that we would kind of exit in that low-ish 20s type of number, but I would expect that we would certainly get stronger as we move through the year. What we're seeing right now is a continued kind of a holding pattern, whether it's a long-term project or its from the distribution work. Our expectation is that as we move through the back half of the year, certainly the side in the equation will start coming in. And hopefully, some of the longer-term projects would certainly have better pricing. Again, I will tell you that we've taken the proper costs steps that now get us in a better alignment. But to answer your point, kind of exit, I'd say we should come out in that mid- low-ish number, 20s is I would say."

Obviously, the 330 a moderated rate is in there, and then we've got as we sit here in '16 the 350 ramp in place. So if you fast-forward a year and 2, 350 would still be moving higher. We'll be capturing full level of higher activity on the 787 and the narrow bodies. And LEAP, LEAP is not going to be a straight line.

Portions of today's presentation contain forward-looking statements that are based on our current view of the future commercial environment and our businesses. The factors that determine those outcomes can change, and we ask that you interpret any forward-looking statements in that light. We identified the principal risks and uncertainties that affect our performance on Page 2 of today's presentation and in our Form 10-K and other SEC filings. 
In today's presentation, the company will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures is available in the appendix of the presentation slides, which have been posted to our website at www.precast.com/investors/presentations.
We will be making some enhancements to the structure of our call today. Mark will start with an overview of the fourth quarter, and then, Shawn will cover the financial results in more detail, followed by a discussion of the charges we announced on April 15 as well as our guidance for fiscal year '16. Mark will then have some closing comments, including regarding PCP's capital allocation and M&A frameworks. Mark, Shawn and I will then be available for your questions.

I'd like to provide my assessment of Q4 performance, and as Jay said, Shawn will then get into the overall and segment performance.
A look at Q4. Certainly, it was dominated by a very challenging oil and gas pipe market that's primarily centered in our Forged Products segment. We had sharp declines in volume, price and mix, all 3 in the same quarter, and this was related to our customers' very cautious buying through their uncertainties in their outlook and demand.
As you'd expect, in response to these dynamics, we addressed not only today's tough market conditions, but it cuts our future outlook. We right-sized the operations; we made quick headcount adjustments in our affected operations; we accounted for exiting underperforming investments, and this is mainly our partnership in the Chengde JV; and we adjusted inventory valuations in our exposed businesses. I think we've aligned our costs much better moving forward certainly than we have been in the last 2 or 3 quarters.
Away from oil and gas, we continue to see positive trends developing in our commercial aero with the future ramp-ups coming on the 787, both narrow bodies, and the 350 ramping up through this year and into next year that goes into higher rates of production. And we will continue to see increasing activity on the new engine programs supporting both the A320neo and the 737 MAX. IGT continues to be a strong growth driver for us. Primary driver in that is our position on the H-class turbines. These 2 end market dynamics were key components of the strong year-on-year margin expansion in Investment Cast Products and Airfame. 
In the quarter, we also were active in our cash deployment. We bought $729 million of our own stock, bringing fiscal year '15 total to $1.6 billion. You've also seen this morning that the Board of Directors has authorized an additional $2 billion of stock repurchase, which we expect to complete in the next 12 to 18 months.
From here, we are very focused on executing against our first annual guidance for fiscal year '16, which Shawn will cover shortly. We see a number of routes for sustained value creation both in fiscal year '16 and beyond.
So with that, I'll turn it over to Shawn."

I'll be discussing our consolidated fourth quarter results. Sales of just over $2.5 billion were down 1% reported and flat organically on a constant-currency basis. This reflects good growth in the aerospace and IGT power",2615,"Thanks, Mark. Moving to Slide 4. I'll be discussing our consolidated fourth quarter results. Sales of just over $2.5 billion were down 1% reported and flat organically on a constant-currency basis. This reflects good growth in the aerospace and IGT power markets, offset by strong double-digit declines in the oil and gas and pipe markets. 
Adjusted consolidated segment operating income, which excludes the restructuring and asset impairments, decreased 13% to $624 million, resulting in margin compression of 360 basis points to 24.9%.  This was primarily due to an unfavorable mix of oil and gas-related sales available to us in the quarter and the impact from the inability to move inventory due to lower oil price and distributor demand and a mix shift within the quarter to lower-end products. As you'll see on the next several slides, we did have good volume leverage in both Investment Cast and Airframe Products, reflecting strong operational and cost improvement initiatives in addition to continued acquisition integration performance from the operations we've acquired over the last several years.
Adjusted earnings per share, which excludes the asset impairment and restructuring charges in the quarter, was $2.94 per share, down 10% from last year and included the favorable impact from a lower share count.
As Mark mentioned, we returned $729 million of cash to shareholders, repurchasing nearly 3.5 million shares under our existing share authorization. This reduced our outstanding share count by nearly 3%.
Our aerospace sales were higher by 2%, but by 4% when you exclude the continued impact from the single customer de-stocking that we've discussed for the past several quarters.
In power, IGT was 2% higher but up low double digits in the Investment Cast Products, as we will discuss on the next page. Pipe and oil and gas sales were lower by close to 20% as our customers moderated their buying due to lower drilling demand.
Currency was a nearly $50 million negative year-over-year impact to sales, and this drove a $10 million negative to operating income over the same period. Total organic sales were flat year-over-year on a constant-currency basis, but this does include roughly 3% of combined negative impact from the single customer de-stocking we have discussed previously and the oil and gas decline.
Moving to Slide 5 and the -- and Investment Cast Products. We saw sales increase 1% to $648 million, driven by another quarter of strong growth in IGT volume. This was partially offset by large commercial aerospace sales and general industrial and other. 
There are several items I'd like to point out on this slide. Large OEM commercial aero activity was fairly stable, which represents about 80% of the aerospace sales in this segment, while spares sales moved lower. Regional and business jet sales continued to trend higher and military demand was once again stable. We continue to look at this as a good outcome after the sequestration-impacted declines of fiscal 2014 and much of fiscal 2015.
IGT activity continues to benefit from our success in securing positions on the latest generation of high-efficiency turbines and was higher by over 10%.
Investment Cast Products incremental margins were 40% year-over-year, driving operating income by 4%. This reflected higher IGT volumes and the continued strong performance on cost controls. From an end-market perspective, Investment Cast Products is well positioned to benefit from a strong installed base and the growth in high-efficiency IGTs. 
In aerospace, the narrow-body re-engining programs continue to progress well, and we expect to see increased levels of activity in our facilities to support the ramp of these programs in fiscal 2016 and beyond.
Moving to Slide 6 and Forged Products. Sales were down 4% to $1.1 billion, due primarily to strong double-digit declines in oil and gas and extruded pipe sales in the quarter. Also of note was that sales were up slightly over the prior year in aerospace, which was helped by good growth in regional and business jet aircraft, while military was modestly lower, driven by a difficult year-over-year comparison.
Power sales were down over 15% year-over-year, reflecting the weakness in oil and gas and pipe end markets. This resulted in lower sales volumes and unfavorable pricing in the quarter.
This rapid shift in market dynamics also created a challenge for operations. As we enter each year, we are projecting certain elements, including cost, mix, inventory and volume, and we continue to measure our progress against those goals as we move through the year.  At year-end, we true up the projections to the actual results achieved. This true-up can be more significant if assumptions change materially versus the beginning of the year.
For Forged Products, a shift in volume, mix and price centered in oil and gas and moved in a negative way for us in Q4, thus, leading to larger-than-normal year-end adjustments. As a result, a number of the Forged Products operations retained higher-cost inventory in their year-end balances with a negative impact to their EBIT. We continue to deploy our operating- and cost-focused initiatives, including having funded over $6 million of restructuring activities in this segment during the fourth quarter to support profitable growth in Forged Products moving into fiscal 2016.
We also want to provide an update on our TIMET Morgantown facility. The operations suffered a very serious incident on March 27, and the TIMET team has been working diligently to bring that operation back online. Facility is now back in operation, with the exception of the single electron beam furnace that suffered the explosion. That furnace will be out of commission for an extended period of time. TIMET's network of assets is well positioned to serve its critical aerospace customers, but that will -- there will be a cost associated with those alternate production routes. We will discuss the financial impact when we review our outlook for fiscal 2016.
Moving to Slide 7 and Airframe Products. Sales were up 1% to $789 million, due primarily to continued growth in large commercial aerospace, partially offset by weakness in general, industrial and other in the quarter. Also of note, military sales, which represent less than 10% of the segment sales, were down low double digits. And general industrial softness, where sales were down 15%, reflect the segment sales in the construction and pulp and paper end markets, which, combined, represent under 5% of the segment's total sales.
Airframe Products continues to execute well, driving operational performance in the base business, and continue to leverage the contributions from the ADI and Permaswage acquisitions.
Operating income was up 2%, and margins expanded 20 basis points in the quarter.
Turning now to Slide 8 and the fiscal 2015 year-end balance sheet. We maintained a strong cash position with a balance of $474 million at year-end, even with the more robust deployment actions in the fourth quarter. Those actions included $170 million of capital expenditures, which is $78 million higher than last year, driven both by capacity expansions and most notably in our aerostructure operations and investments for cost improvements, primarily at TIMET and Wyman-Gordon. These internal investments have strong return profiles and remain a priority for PCC.
We also delivered on our share repurchase program during the quarter, returning $729 million of cash to shareholders and lowering our share count by nearly 4%. This brings the repurchase total to $1.6 billion or 7.2 million shares for the year.
The PCC Board of Directors today added an additional $2 billion to the company's share repurchase authorization, providing the company with $2.2 billion of availability under the program. It is our expectation that we will complete the repurchase under this new authorization over the next 12 to 18 months.
I'd also like to update you on our cash deployment in the first quarter of fiscal 2016. We have so far in the quarter spent $270 million on 2 niche businesses, which will expand our vertical integration capabilities.
As Mark will discuss in a couple minutes, we remain committed to our value-creating capital deployment strategy, focused on growing the business organically and through acquisitions and returning excess cash to shareholders via share repurchase.
Moving now to Slide 9. I'd like to take a minute and recap the nonoperating asset rationalization and strategic actions that are reflected in our fourth quarter results. We've previously provided you ranges, and now, on Slide 9, you can see the actual charges associated with each of those actions. 
The largest charge relating to our joint venture, Chengde, was $174 million, and due to its tax characteristics, included a small tax charge resulting in an after-tax charge of $179 million. Our decision to exit our investment hinged off of several factors. First, Chengde's pipe end markets continue to be softer than originally planned and versus our expectations. And it has proved tougher to get China pipe in the targeted markets.  At the same time, our Houston facility, which has a similar manufacturing capability to Chengde, has been able to expand its productivity and output, and therefore, has reduced the need for incremental Chengde capacity. As you are aware, Chengde has been a drag for some time on both our financial results and our managerial resources, so exiting allows for better resource and asset utilization going forward.  Therefore, we have adjusted the value of the investment to what we think is realistic in terms of achieving upon an exit of the business.  The charge and the ongoing 50% stake will be reported in equity and earnings of unconsolidated affiliates until the sale is completed.
Our inventory and other asset impairment charges totaled $127 million, primarily reflecting valuation adjustments made to inventory and other assets associated with our oil and gas markets, driven by the very rapid decline in external selling prices.  In addition, some pipes had specification deviations versus the customer's original requirements. And while we previously had expected that we'd be able to find alternative customers for this product, now with a tougher demand environment, we have reevaluated those opportunities and have concluded that we need to recognize those charges in the fourth quarter.
The restructuring actions of $8 million are to better align our costs with the current landscape. These actions are primarily in Forged Products relating to the oil and gas and pipe end markets and reflect headcount reductions with a very quick payback.
We view all of these actions as better positioning the company for profitable growth in fiscal 2016 and beyond, and we retained very strong capabilities in the oil and gas markets, and these actions will better position the company to serve our customer as demands stabilize.
Let's walk through our guidance summary for fiscal 2016. Moving to Slide 10. We're expecting sales in the range of $10 billion to $10.4 billion, which is flat to up 4% from fiscal 2015, both on a reported and organic basis. The euro and pound are creating an approximate $200 million sales drag on fiscal 2016 worth approximately $0.20 per share for the year. 
Segment EBIT margins are expected to be in the range of 26.6% to 27.3%, down 80 basis points to down 10 basis points on a year-over-year comparison. However, they are higher by 160 to 230 basis points from Q4 fiscal '15 levels.  I'll go into more detail in the margin dynamics as we move into the segment discussion. 
EPS is expected to be in the range of $12.50 to $13.40, representing approximately 3% growth to fiscal 2015 EPS at the midpoint of that range. This assumes a tax rate of 32.5% and a share count of 137.9 million diluted shares. This reflects our expectation of a deployment of a portion of our new $2 billion share repurchase authorization. 
We expect $70 million of net interest expense and little incremental impact from pension, reflecting strong asset returns offset by a lower discount rate for the year.
Finally, free cash flow is expected to be $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion in 2016, with capital expenditure investments of approximately $550 million for several significant capacity expansion projects as well as cost and productivity improvements throughout the organization.
In summary, we think that this represents a balanced plan, appropriately capturing the risks and opportunities of the year ahead. We have a well-positioned and diverse portfolio and a management team focused on delivering on our commitment.
On Slide 11, looking at the key end market drivers for this fiscal '16 plan, we see mid-single-digit revenue growth in commercial aero, driven by higher build rates on the 787 narrow bodies and the A350 as well as growing activity on the LEAP engine and share gains in our aerostructure operations. We have also factored in announced rate cuts on the A330.
In military, we see fiscal '16 looking much like fiscal '15, with stable build rates and also stable activity across our spares portfolio.
On the business and regional jets side, we're seeing continued healthy demand for mid to large cabin size, which drives continued growth. Again, we have a number of new platforms starting to ramp in this year, and that yields a high single-digit growth rate for the business and regional jet end markets.
Moving to Slide 12, let's discuss power and general industrial. In IGT, we expect continued strong growth in the high single-digit area, driven by PCC's position on the H-class platform and upgrade programs. Given the weakness in global oil and gas demand, which accounts for about 6% of our sales, we are anticipating volume and price pressures and see declines in excess of 30% in this market for fiscal 2016.
Within our general industrial markets, we're expecting fiscal '16 to look somewhat like fiscal '15, with risk areas around second derivative impact from oil and gas-related markets, but also some opportunity from global GDP.
Moving to Slide 13. I'd like to spend a minute showing you what our end-market assumptions mean for our reporting segments before I hand the call back over to Mark. Starting with Investment Cast Products, we expect to leverage higher commercial aero and IGT volumes by adding incremental capacity to meet higher demand and, at the same time, improve our overall efficiency and cost structure. Here, we expect mid-single digits sales growth with incremental margins that we expect to be above our typical 35% to 40% levels.
In Forged Products, we see increased demand in aerospace and IGT plus TIMET share gains favorably impacting sales but also anticipate the oil and gas and foreign exchange headwinds discussed earlier. All those inputs net to our expectation for a low single-digit sales decline versus fiscal '15. 
The TIMET Morgantown incident will have a $25 million to $30 million negative impact to Forged EBIT for 2016, but the segment will also benefit from the impact of restructuring actions taken at the end of fiscal 2015.
As is the case every year, we will be performing maintenance during Q2. And this year, we do have an extended outage planned occurring at our Wyman-Gordon U.K. facility.
Summing that all up, we see modest margin expansion at Forged Products versus the Q4 FY '15 rate and expect the segment's margins to exit fiscal 2016 in the low 20% area. 
Finally, Airframe Products is expecting a strong year, with sales up mid-single digit, reflecting higher aerospace build rates, share gains and further contributions from recent acquisitions, partially offset by foreign exchange headwinds mentioned previously. As with Investment Cast Products, we expect this segment to deliver strong leverage on its growth, with incremental margins above the typical 35% to 40% level.
In summary, we are confident in our balanced yet achievable plan for fiscal 2016, targeting growth and margin expansion across all 3 segments off the Q4 '15 levels.
Now I'll turn it back over to you, Mark."

What I really want to focus on now is our capital allocation framework. We have 2 primary objectives, which have been the key drivers for us for years. First, we'll continue to invest in our facilities. We will ensure that we have the nee",992,"Thanks, Shawn. What I really want to focus on now is our capital allocation framework. We have 2 primary objectives, which have been the key drivers for us for years. 
First, we'll continue to invest in our facilities. We will ensure that we have the needed assets to support the growth rates and the share that we have in place as we move forward with the accelerated rates. We will relentlessly attack and drive and invest wherever we need to, to extract the cost opportunities that are available to us, and we will do everything to ensure that we are providing a safe working environment and maintain our facility.
Second, we will continue to execute our acquisition strategy that we have established and have been executing over the last 12 years. At the heart of this, we will pursue the right assets that capitalize on our core competencies. We will remain a disciplined buyer to ensure we have the proper return criteria. There are cases and times where it's not uncommon for our M&A, from the time we make initial contact until we complete a transaction, to be 2-plus years. Again, we're searching and extracting the right assets for us. Once we acquire, we will maintain and continue to be extremely focused on driving our integration process. And for us, that means delivering accelerated performance in the first 1 to 3 and 3 to 5 years.
We will do this while maintaining a sound balance sheet. To us, that means strong, investment-grade credit rating. This allows us the flexibility to capitalize as strategic opportunities arise not only in strong times, but through all phases of the business cycle. We have, however, reached the size that allows us to deliver the above expectations and return excess cash to shareholders with the intent now to clearly lower the share count.  We talked about it a couple times. The board has just authorized an additional $2 billion of stock repurchase that we expect to execute over the next 12 to 18 months. 
If I look at our performance over the last 3 years, our CapEx, our internal investments have totaled $1.1 billion, acquisitions have totaled $6.7 billion, and our share repurchase has been $2.2 billion. So to be clear, we have the desire and the capacity to deliver all 3, given our strong cash-generating capability and the strength of our balance sheet. 
I want to take a closer look at our M&A framework. It has been the largest component of our allocation. We've deployed $8.5 billion from fiscal year '12 through Q1 of fiscal year '16. It has been a very rigorous and focused execution over the last 12 years and will continue to focus around our core competencies. We've significantly expanded our capabilities in terms of the products, complexities, manufacturing methods and materials. We've moved in a multitude of directions. We've been able to drive and deliver accelerated performance in that first 3 to 5 years. We've been able to unlock large amounts of capacity constraints that existed at the time of acquisition. We've been able to attack costs on all fronts, and in a lot of cases, we've been able to utilize across of all PCC's assets. That has allowed us to establish a leadership position in our core markets. 
I want to look at one example. I want to look at the Airframe Products segment. This is a segment we started from scratch. It's covered numerous transactions, varying size of value of the transactions, wide range of complexities. Started with fasteners, then moved into fastening systems into machining. Then, we moved into assembly utilizing our fasteners, and we're now able to vertically integrate all the way back to metal, through Forged Products, into machining, into assembly to provide a more complete value to our customers.
We've invested $5 million-plus into this segment. This does account for the additional capital expenditures over this time frame, both after maintaining and putting capacity in for capital and for capacity and cost takeout. And we are delivering on IRR in the mid- to high teens. This does include a number of assets that are still early in the integration process with more upside, including 2 of our larger transactions, Permaswage and ADI.
M&A will continue to remain our top priority. We are actively pursuing today strategic acquisitions, both large and small. We will continue to be a disciplined buyer, but we are targeting $3 billion to $5 billion over the next 2 years.
So if I look -- in summary, I think we have numerous opportunities for -- of continued value creation moving forward. Our aerospace and IGT markets remain healthy. We've secured strong, critical positions on the major growth platforms, the 787, the 350, next-generation narrow bodies as well as we have new share gains across numerous platforms that are under development right now.
On IGT, we have a very strong position in the growth platforms, and again, the H-class being the most significant. We do clearly see challenging times in the near term in the oil and gas and the pipe markets. We've taken aggressive actions to align our costs better to the current environment, but we have maintained and now have the key capabilities to serve the market as demand recovers.  This is a business that is firmly committed to continuing to attack, on all fronts across all our business, the opportunities to drive margin expansion. 
Clearly, as Shawn has already described, Forged Products faces a number of challenges today, but we do see a path for sustained margin expansion from Q4 '15 levels. 
As I have just reviewed, capital deployment will continue to be a key component of our strategy, with a line of sight for that $3 billion to $5 billion acquisition over the next 2 years and returning the excess cash to our shareholders through share repurchase.
So with that, we'll be happy to open up and answer any questions."

On the -- there's also a major project that we're doing to move some of the back end of our -- one of our operations in Massachusetts down. We're going to do the machining closer to our end customer, so there's a large capital expenditure for that one. And then, on the Airframe one, the -- we have share that we have won already, that we are in the process of developing, so writing the programs for and getting the preliminary certifications that we have got to facilitize [ph] up for to handle the growth we have sitting in front of us.

Obviously, the 330, at a moderated rate, is in there, and then, we've got, as we sit here on '16, the 350 ramp in place. So if you fast forward a year and 2, 350 would still be moving higher. We'll be capturing full level of higher activity on the 87 (sic) and the narrow bodies. And LEAP, LEAP is not going to be a straight line. There is going to be a -- an accelerating pace of activity as we move forward in years. So I -- obviously, we need to kind of run the traps on how that all rolls out.

Portions of today's presentation contain forward-looking statements that are based on our current view of the future commercial environment and our businesses. The factors that determine those outcomes can change, and we ask that you interpret any forward-looking statements in that light. We identified the principal risks and uncertainties that affect our performance on Page 2 of today's presentation and in our Form 10-K and other SEC filings. 
In today's presentation, the company will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures is available in the appendix of the presentation slides, which have been posted to our website at www.precast.com/investors/presentations.
We will be making some enhancements to the structure of our call today. Mark will start with an overview of the fourth quarter, and then Shawn will cover the financial results in more detail, followed by a discussion of the charges we announced on April 15 as well as our guidance for fiscal year '16. Mark will then have some closing comments, including regarding PCP's capital allocation and M&A frameworks. Mark, Shawn and I will then be available for your questions.

I'd like to provide my assessment of Q4 performance, and as Jay said, Shawn will then get into the overall and segment performance.
A look at Q4. Certainly, it was dominated by a very challenging oil and gas pipe market that's primarily centered in our Forged Products segment. We had sharp declines in volume, price and mix, all 3 in the same quarter, and this was related to our customers' very cautious buying through their uncertainties in their outlook and demand.
As you'd expect, in response to these dynamics, we addressed not only today's tough market conditions, but it cuts the future outlook. We right-sized the operations; we made quick headcount adjustments in our affected operations; we accounted for exiting underperforming investments, and this is mainly our partnership in the Chengde JV; and we adjusted inventory valuations in our exposed businesses. I think we've aligned our costs much better moving forward, certainly than we have been in the last 2 or 3 quarters.
Away from oil and gas, we continue to see positive trends developing in our commercial aero with the future ramp-ups coming on the 787, both narrow bodies, and the 350 ramping up through this year and into next year that goes into higher rates of production. And we will continue to see increasing activity on the new engine programs supporting both the A320neo and the 737 MAX. IGT continues to be a strong growth driver for us. Primary driver in that is our position on the H-class turbines. These 2 end market dynamics were key components of the strong year-on-year margin expansion in Investment Cast Products and Airframe. 
In the quarter, we also were active in our cash deployment. We bought $729 million of our own stock, bringing fiscal year '15 total to $1.6 billion. You've also seen this morning that the Board of Directors has authorized an additional $2 billion of stock repurchase, which we expect to complete in the next 12 to 18 months.
From here, we are very focused on executing against our first annual guidance for fiscal year '16, which Shawn will cover shortly. We see a number of routes for sustained value creation both in fiscal year '16 and beyond.
So with that, I'll turn it over to Shawn."

I'll be discussing our consolidated fourth quarter results. Sales of just over $2.5 billion were down 1% reported and flat organically on a constant-currency basis. This reflects good growth in the aerospace and IGT power",2616,"Thanks, Mark. Moving to Slide 4. I'll be discussing our consolidated fourth quarter results. Sales of just over $2.5 billion were down 1% reported and flat organically on a constant-currency basis. This reflects good growth in the aerospace and IGT power markets, offset by strong double-digit declines in the oil and gas and pipe markets. 
Adjusted consolidated segment operating income, which excludes the restructuring and asset impairments, decreased 13% to $624 million, resulting in margin compression of 360 basis points to 24.9%. This was primarily due to an unfavorable mix of oil and gas-related sales available to us in the quarter and the impact from the inability to move inventory due to lower oil price and distributor demand and a mix shift within the quarter to lower-end products. As you'll see on the next several slides, we did have good volume leverage in both Investment Cast and Airframe Products, reflecting strong operational and cost improvement initiatives in addition to continued acquisition integration performance from the operations we've acquired over the last several years.
Adjusted earnings per share, which excludes the asset impairment and restructuring charges in the quarter, was $2.94 per share, down 10% from last year and included the favorable impact from a lower share count.
As Mark mentioned, we returned $729 million of cash to shareholders, repurchasing nearly 3.5 million shares under our existing share authorization. This reduced our outstanding share count by nearly 3%.
Our aerospace sales were higher by 2%, but by 4% when you exclude the continued impact from the single customer de-stocking that we've discussed for the past several quarters.
In power, IGT was 2% higher but up low double digits in the Investment Cast Products, as we will discuss on the next page. Pipe and oil and gas sales were lower by close to 20% as our customers moderated their buying due to lower drilling demand.
Currency was a nearly $50 million negative year-over-year impact to sales, and this drove a $10 million negative to operating income over the same period. Total organic sales were flat year-over-year on a constant-currency basis, but this does include roughly 3% of combined negative impact from the single customer de-stocking we have discussed previously and the oil and gas decline.
Moving to Slide 5 and the -- and Investment Cast Products. We saw sales increase 1% to $648 million, driven by another quarter of strong growth in IGT volume. This was partially offset by large commercial aerospace sales and general industrial and other. 
There are several items I'd like to point out on this slide. Large OEM commercial aero activity was fairly stable, which represents about 80% of the aerospace sales in this segment, while spares sales moved lower. Regional and business jet sales continued to trend higher and military demand was once again stable. We continue to look at this as a good outcome after the sequestration-impacted declines of fiscal 2014 and much of fiscal 2015.
IGT activity continues to benefit from our success in securing positions on the latest generation of high-efficiency turbines and was higher by over 10%.
Investment Cast Products incremental margins were 40% year-over-year, driving operating income by 4%. This reflected higher IGT volumes and the continued strong performance on cost controls. From an end-market perspective, Investment Cast Products is well positioned to benefit from a strong installed base and the growth in high-efficiency IGTs. 
In aerospace, the narrow-body re-engining programs continue to progress well, and we expect to see increased levels of activity in our facilities to support the ramp of these programs in fiscal 2016 and beyond.
Moving to Slide 6 and Forged Products. Sales were down 4% to $1.1 billion, due primarily to strong double-digit declines in oil and gas and extruded pipe sales in the quarter. Also of note was that sales were up slightly over the prior year in aerospace, which was helped by good growth in regional and business jet aircraft, while military was modestly lower, driven by a difficult year-over-year comparison.
Power sales were down over 15% year-over-year, reflecting the weakness in oil and gas and pipe end markets. This resulted in lower sales volumes and unfavorable pricing in the quarter.
This rapid shift in market dynamics also created a challenge for operations. As we enter each year, we are projecting certain elements, including cost, mix, inventory and volume, and we continue to measure our progress against those goals as we move through the year. At year-end, we true up the projections to the actual results achieved. This true-up can be more significant if assumptions change materially versus the beginning of the year.
For Forged Products, a shift in volume, mix and price centered in oil and gas and moved in a negative way for us in Q4, thus, leading to larger-than-normal year-end adjustments. As a result, a number of the Forged Products operations retained higher-cost inventory in their year-end balances with a negative impact to their EBIT. We continue to deploy our operating- and cost-focused initiatives, including having funded over $6 million of restructuring activities in this segment during the fourth quarter to support profitable growth in Forged Products moving into fiscal 2016.
We also want to provide an update on our TIMET Morgantown facility. The operations suffered a very serious incident on March 27, and the TIMET team has been working diligently to bring that operation back online. Facility is now back in operation, with the exception of the single electron beam furnace that suffered the explosion. That furnace will be out of commission for an extended period of time. TIMET's network of assets is well positioned to serve its critical aerospace customers, but that will -- there will be a cost associated with those alternate production routes. We will discuss the financial impact when we review our outlook for fiscal 2016.
Moving to Slide 7 and Airframe Products. Sales were up 1% to $789 million, due primarily to continued growth in large commercial aerospace, partially offset by weakness in general, industrial and other in the quarter. Also of note, military sales, which represent less than 10% of the segment sales, were down low double digits. And general industrial softness, where sales were down 15%, reflect the segment sales in the construction and pulp and paper end markets, which, combined, represent under 5% of the segment's total sales.
Airframe Products continues to execute well, driving operational performance in the base business, and continue to leverage the contributions from the ADI and Permaswage acquisitions.
Operating income was up 2%, and margins expanded 20 basis points in the quarter.
Turning now to Slide 8 and the fiscal 2015 year-end balance sheet. We maintained a strong cash position with a balance of $474 million at year-end, even with the more robust deployment actions in the fourth quarter. Those actions included $170 million of capital expenditures, which is $78 million higher than last year, driven both by capacity expansions and most notably in our aerostructure operations and investments for cost improvements, primarily at TIMET and Wyman-Gordon. These internal investments have strong return profiles and remain a priority for PCC.
We also delivered on our share repurchase program during the quarter, returning $729 million of cash to shareholders and lowering our share count by nearly 4%. This brings the repurchase total to $1.6 billion or 7.2 million shares for the year.
The PCC Board of Directors today added an additional $2 billion to the company's share repurchase authorization, providing the company with $2.2 billion of availability under the program. It is our expectation that we will complete the repurchase under this new authorization over the next 12 to 18 months.
I'd also like to update you on our cash deployment in the first quarter of fiscal 2016. We have so far in the quarter spent $270 million on 2 niche businesses, which will expand our vertical integration capabilities.
As Mark will discuss in a couple minutes, we remain committed to our value-creating capital deployment strategy, focused on growing the business organically and through acquisitions and returning excess cash to shareholders via share repurchase.
Moving now to Slide 9. I'd like to take a minute and recap the nonoperating asset rationalization and strategic actions that are reflected in our fourth quarter results. We've previously provided you ranges, and now, on Slide 9, you can see the actual charges associated with each of those actions. 
The largest charge relating to our joint venture, Chengde, was $174 million, and due to its tax characteristics, included a small tax charge resulting in an after-tax charge of $179 million. Our decision to exit our investment hinged off of several factors. First, Chengde's pipe end markets continue to be softer than originally planned and versus our expectations. And it has proved tougher to get China [ph] pipe in the targeted markets.  At the same time, our Houston facility, which has a similar manufacturing capability to Chengde, has been able to expand its productivity and output, and therefore, has reduced the need for incremental Chengde capacity. As you are aware, Chengde has been a drag for some time on both our financial results and our managerial resources, so exiting allows for better resource and asset utilization going forward. Therefore, we have adjusted the value of the investment to what we think is realistic in terms of achieving upon an exit of the business.  The charge and the ongoing 50% stake will be reported in equity and earnings of unconsolidated affiliates until the sale is completed.
Our inventory and other asset impairment charges totaled $127 million, primarily reflecting valuation adjustments made to inventory and other assets associated with our oil and gas markets, driven by the very rapid decline in external selling prices. In addition, some pipes had specification deviations versus the customer's original requirements. And while we previously had expected that we'd be able to find alternative customers for this product, now with a tougher demand environment, we have reevaluated those opportunities and have concluded that we need to recognize those charges in the fourth quarter.
The restructuring actions of $8 million are to better align our costs with the current landscape. These actions are primarily in Forged Products relating to the oil and gas and pipe end markets and reflect headcount reductions with a very quick payback.
We view all of these actions as better positioning the company for profitable growth in fiscal 2016 and beyond, and we retained very strong capabilities in the oil and gas markets, and these actions will better position the company to serve our customer as demands stabilize.
Let's walk through our guidance summary for fiscal 2016. Moving to Slide 10. We're expecting sales in the range of $10 billion to $10.4 billion, which is flat to up 4% from fiscal 2015, both on a reported and organic basis. The euro and pound are creating an approximate $200 million sales drag on fiscal 2016 worth approximately $0.20 per share for the year. 
Segment EBIT margins are expected to be in the range of 26.6% to 27.3%, down 80 basis points to down 10 basis points on a year-over-year comparison. However, they are higher by 160 to 230 basis points from Q4 fiscal '15 levels. I'll go into more detail in the margin dynamics as we move into the segment discussion. 
EPS is expected to be in the range of $12.50 to $13.40, representing approximately 3% growth to fiscal 2015 EPS at the midpoint of that range. This assumes a tax rate of 32.5% and a share count of 137.9 million diluted shares. This reflects our expectation of a deployment of a portion of our new $2 billion share repurchase authorization. 
We expect $70 million of net interest expense and little incremental impact from pension, reflecting strong asset returns offset by a lower discount rate for the year.
Finally, free cash flow is expected to be $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion in 2016, with capital expenditure investments of approximately $550 million for several significant capacity expansion projects as well as cost and productivity improvements throughout the organization.
In summary, we think that this represents a balanced plan, appropriately capturing the risks and opportunities of the year ahead. We have a well-positioned and diverse portfolio and a management team focused on delivering on our commitment.
On Slide 11, looking at the key end market drivers for this fiscal '16 plan, we see mid-single-digit revenue growth in commercial aero, driven by higher build rates on the 787 narrow bodies and the A350 as well as growing activity on the LEAP engine and share gains in our aerostructure operations. We have also factored in announced rate cuts on the A330.
In military, we see fiscal '16 looking much like fiscal '15, with stable build rates and also stable activity across our spares portfolio.
On the business and regional jets side, we're seeing continued healthy demand for mid to large cabin size, which drives continued growth. Again, we have a number of new platforms starting to ramp in this year, and that yields a high single-digit growth rate for the business and regional jet end markets.
Moving to Slide 12, let's discuss power and general industrial. In IGT, we expect continued strong growth in the high single-digit area, driven by PCC's position on the H-class platform and upgrade programs. Given the weakness in global oil and gas demand, which accounts for about 6% of our sales, we are anticipating volume and price pressures and see declines in excess of 30% in this market for fiscal 2016.
Within our general industrial markets, we're expecting fiscal '16 to look somewhat like fiscal '15, with risk areas around second derivative impact from oil and gas-related markets, but also some opportunity from global GDP.
Moving to Slide 13. I'd like to spend a minute showing you what our end-market assumptions mean for our reporting segments before I hand the call back over to Mark. Starting with Investment Cast Products, we expect to leverage higher commercial aero and IGT volumes by adding incremental capacity to meet higher demand and, at the same time, improve our overall efficiency and cost structure. Here, we expect mid-single digits sales growth with incremental margins that we expect to be above our typical 35% to 40% levels.
In Forged Products, we see increased demand in aerospace and IGT plus TIMET share gains favorably impacting sales but also anticipate the oil and gas and foreign exchange headwinds discussed earlier. All those inputs net to our expectation for a low single-digit sales decline versus fiscal '15. 
The TIMET Morgantown incident will have a $25 million to $30 million negative impact to Forged EBIT in 2016, but the segment will also benefit from the impact of restructuring actions taken at the end of fiscal 2015.
As is the case every year, we will be performing maintenance during Q2. And this year, we do have an extended outage planned occurring at our Wyman-Gordon U.K. facility.
Summing that all up, we see modest margin expansion at Forged Products versus the Q4 FY '15 rate and expect the segment's margins to exit fiscal 2016 in the low 20% area. 
Finally, Airframe Products is expecting a strong year, with sales up mid-single digit, reflecting higher aerospace build rates, share gains and further contributions from recent acquisitions, partially offset by foreign exchange headwinds mentioned previously. As with Investment Cast Products, we expect this segment to deliver strong leverage on its growth, with incremental margins above the typical 35% to 40% level.
In summary, we are confident in our balanced yet achievable plan for fiscal 2016, targeting growth and margin expansion across all 3 segments off the Q4 '15 levels.
Now I'll turn it back over to you, Mark."
297850,291416787,814232,"Precision Castparts Corp., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, May 13, 2015",2015-05-13,"Earnings Calls","Precision Castparts Corp.","Executives","Thanks, Shawn. What I really want to focus on now is our capital allocation framework. We have 2 primary objectives, which have been the key drivers for us for years. First, we will continue to invest in our facilities. We will ensure that we have the n",993,"Thanks, Shawn. What I really want to focus on now is our capital allocation framework. We have 2 primary objectives, which have been the key drivers for us for years. 
First, we will continue to invest in our facilities. We will ensure that we have the needed assets to support the growth rates and the share that we have in place as we move forward with the accelerated rates. We will relentlessly attack and drive and invest wherever we need to, to extract the cost opportunities that are available to us, and we will do everything to ensure that we are providing a safe working environment and maintain our facility.
Second, we will continue to execute our acquisition strategy that we have established and have been executing over the last 12 years. At the heart of this, we will pursue the right assets that capitalize on our core competencies. We will remain a disciplined buyer to ensure we have the proper return criteria. There are cases and times where it's not uncommon for our M&A, from the time we make initial contact until we complete a transaction, to be 2-plus years. Again, we're searching and extracting the right assets for us. Once we acquire, we will maintain and continue to be extremely focused on driving our integration process. And for us, that means delivering accelerated performance in the first 1 to 3 and 3 to 5 years.
We will do this while maintaining a sound balance sheet. To us, that means strong, investment-grade credit rating. This allows us the flexibility to capitalize as strategic opportunities arise not only in strong times, but through all phases of the business cycle. We have, however, reached the size that allows us to deliver the above expectations and return excess cash to shareholders with the intent now to clearly lower the share count. We've talked about it a couple times. The board has just authorized an additional $2 billion of stock repurchase that we expect to execute over the next 12 to 18 months. 
If I look at our performance over the last 3 years, our CapEx, our internal investments have totaled $1.1 billion, acquisitions have totaled $6.7 billion, and our share repurchase has been $2.2 billion. So to be clear, we have the desire and the capacity to deliver all 3, given our strong cash-generating capability and the strength of our balance sheet. 
I want to take a closer look at our M&A framework. It has been the largest component of our allocation. We've deployed $8.5 billion from fiscal year '12 through Q1 of fiscal year '16. It has been a very rigorous and focused execution over the last 12 years and will continue to focus around our core competencies. We've significantly expanded our capabilities in terms of the products, complexities, manufacturing methods and materials. We've moved in a multitude of directions. We've been able to drive and deliver accelerated performance in that first 3 to 5 years. We've been able to unlock large amounts of capacity constraints that existed at the time of acquisition. We've been able to attack costs on all fronts, and in a lot of cases, we've been able to utilize across of all PCC's assets. That has allowed us to establish a leadership position in our core markets. 
I want to look at one example. I want to look at Airframe Products segment. This is a segment we started from scratch. It's covered numerous transactions, brings size of value to the transactions, wide range of complexities, started with fasteners, then moved into fastening systems into machining. Then we moved into assembly utilizing our fasteners, and we're now able to vertically integrate all the way back to metal, through Forged Products, into machining, into assembly to provide a more complete value to our customers.
We've invested $5 million-plus into this segment. This does account for the additional capital expenditures over this time frame, both after maintaining and putting capacity in for capital and for capacity and cost takeout. And we are delivering an IRR in the mid- to high teens. This does include a number of assets that are still early in the integration process with more upside, including 2 of our larger transactions, Permaswage and ADI.
M&A will continue to remain our top priority. We are actively pursuing today, strategic acquisitions, both large and small. We will continue to be a disciplined buyer, but we are targeting $3 billion to $5 billion over the next 2 years.
So if I look -- in summary, I think we have numerous opportunities for -- of continued value creation moving forward. Our aerospace and IGT markets remain healthy. We've secured strong, critical positions on the major growth platforms, the 787, the 350, the next-generation narrow bodies, as well as we have new share gains across numerous platforms that are under development right now.
On IGT, we have a very strong position in the growth platforms, and again, the H-class being the most significant. We do clearly see challenging times in the near term in the oil and gas and the pipe markets. We've taken aggressive actions to align our costs better to the current environment, but we have maintained and now have the key capabilities to serve the market as demand recovers.  This is a business that is firmly committed to continuing to attack on all fronts across all our business, the opportunities to drive margin expansion. 
Clearly, as Shawn has already described, Forged Products faces a number of challenges today, but we do see a path for sustained margin expansion from Q4 '15 levels. 
As I have just reviewed, capital deployment will continue to be a key component of our strategy, with a line of sight for that $3 billion to $5 billion acquisition over the next 2 years and returning the excess cash to our shareholders through share repurchase.
So with that, we'll be happy to open up and answer any questions."

We have a couple very large key projects that are out there. We have the isothermal press, which will be needed to support the volume and the share we have won as the new engines come out. So there is a tremendous amount of volume that's sitting out there that we have to deploy to capital. On the -- there's also a major project that we're doing to move some of the back end of our -- one of our operations in Massachusetts down. We're going to do the machining closer to our end customer, so there's a large capital expenditure for that one. And then on the Airframe one, the -- we have share that we have won already, that we are in the process of developing, so writing the programs for and getting the preliminary certifications that we have got to facilitize [ph] up for to handle the growth we have sitting in front of us.

Still modest but growing level of activity in the LEAP. There is a lot more in front of us on the LEAP than its growth kind of captured in fiscal '15. Obviously, the 330, at a moderated rate, is in there, and then, we've got, as we sit here on '16, the 350 ramp in place. So as you fast forward a year and 2, 350 would still be moving higher. We'll be capturing full level of higher activity on the 87 and the narrow bodies. And LEAP, LEAP is not going to be a straight line. There is going to be a -- an accelerating pace of activity as we move forward in years. So I -- obviously, we need to kind of run the traps on how that all rolls out.

So there are, clearly, growth dynamics that start to play a little more meaningfully positive in the back half around starting to ramp some of the share gains in aerostructures. LEAP would probably play a bigger role in the back half than in the front. The cost of Morgantown is probably more impacted towards the front as we work towards the -- through the year. There are likely to be more solutions to find an efficient route to manufacture those processes. The 350 continues its build through the year.

If I look at Q1 overall, I think that Investment Cast delivered a very solid performance in the quarter. I think they're focused on the right thing in supporting the customer in their ramp-up as the customer schedules dictate. I think the actions we took in Q4 for Forged Products has established a much better footing to take on the challenging oil and gas environment. I think the team is extremely focused on attacking all opportunities they have, and that's driving cost out, capitalizing on what they can do inside their factories and certainly, positioning them to respond very well to a very competitive pressures that are out there in the marketplace today. 
Airframe Products, in my opinion, got off to a slower start, with a substantial development load as we move through the quarter, primarily driven by 2 things. We had a large number of first historicals, we have to move to the factory in getting to our customer to support the share that we have won and have to move into production at the back half of this year. And we also had a very short-cycle development program that we're required to support a key customer development schedule. Both of these really bottleneck a number of our machining assets. Shawn will go into more detail as she moves through the Airframe segment. 
If I look at our cash deployment, I think it's a very balanced approach in Q1. We repurchased roughly $232 million of stock as well as we closed in the quarter $266 million of acquisitions. You've seen that we've recently announced post-Q1 2 other acquisitions, Composites Horizons and Noranco, and I will cover these in more details on both of these as we move later through the presentation. 
So with that, I'll turn it over to Shawn."

I'll now review our consolidated first quarter results starting with Slide 4. Sales were down 4% to $2.4 billion, which reflects a sharp decline in oil and gas sales that more than offset low single-digit improvements in our large commercial aerospace demand. Consolidated segment operating income decreased 16% to $619 million, reducing operating margins by 350 basis points year-over-year to 25.7%. Earnings per share fell to $2.87 versus $3.32 in the prior year, driven primarily by end market mix and volume challenges in our Forged Products segment. Aerospace sales were down 1%, but large commercial sales were higher by 3%, reflecting our position on growth programs and stronger content wins throughout our portfolio. Power sales were down 17%, driven entirely by the 38% decline in oil and gas and other. IGT sales were higher by 3% overall, reflecting the strength of our position on the latest generation of turbines. 
Currency was a $53 million negative impact to sales, resulting in a corresponding $11 million headwind for operating income, with most of the impact saw in our Forged Products and Airframe Products segments. Total organic sales were down 2% year-over-year on a constant currency basis but were higher by 1% when you exclude the sharp decline in demand in oil and gas end markets. 
Moving to Slide 5 in Investment Cast Products. Sales were up 1% to $632 million with continued growth in aerospace, including 6% higher large commercial aerospace demand, while regional and business jet sales were stable and military demand had double-digit declines. In power, IGT sales were up 4% as the segment benefited from its strong position on the newest high-efficiency turbines. Investment Cast Products operating income was up 6% to $237 million with 170 basis points of margin expansion to 37.5%. The higher earnings quality reflects Investment Cast Products efficient leverage of volume across its assets. From an end market perspective, the segment remains well positioned to benefit from a continued rollout of high-efficiency gas turbines as well as the ramp in next-generation aerospace engines. The acquisition of Composites Horizons, which Mark will discuss in a moment, will allow us to offer a high-temperature engine solutions across a broad range of materials. 
Moving to Slide 6 in Forged Products. Sales were down 8% to $1 billion, [ph] primarily due to the continued weakness in oil and gas end markets. The stronger dollar also created a roughly 2% or $22 million drag on Forged Products revenue growth rate. In aerospace sales -- in aerospace, excuse me, sales were down 1%, with 5% growth in large commercial aerospace sales offset by moderate declines in regional and business jet sales and double-digit declines in military demand, as that end market had challenging year-over-year comparisons. In power, sales were down 33% with IGT stable and oil and gas much softer as we're not seeing any signs of improving demand trend in that market yet. Forged Products operating income was down 34% to $204 million, reflecting mainly end market mix dynamics and weaker volume in the oil and gas area. As compared to Q4 '15, the segment performed at a much improved level, demonstrating $11 million of EBIT growth on $66 million lower sales. The businesses most impacted by the oil and gas declines have used the downturn to drive efficiency into their operations, and these steps create a business better equipped to manage through the current demand challenges. We believe that we've taken the appropriate steps to rightsize the segment and do expect continued performance gains as we progress through fiscal 2016. 
Moving to Slide 7 in Airframe Products. Sales were down 3% to $779 million. The stronger dollar did create a 3% or $24 million drag on Airframe's revenue growth rate and had a $5 million negative impact on operating income. Aerospace sales were down 2%, with large commercial and regional/business jet demand stable, while military demand declined at a double-digit pace. Commercial aerospace sales experienced headwinds in Q1 from timing of fastener demand and from the impact of new product development in our Aerostructures operations. In fasteners, we saw several of our facilities impacted by demand timing associated with the expansion of our customer supply chain management initiatives. We expect this dynamic to resolve itself within the fiscal year. 
Regarding Aerostructures, we've been very successful winning new positions, but the ramp of that new work did create some disruptions in our operations and constrained activity in other areas. We expect to see improved performance as we move through fiscal 2016. 
General industrial sales, which represent only about 10% of segment's total sales, were down mid-teens due to declines in automotive and construction end markets, mainly internationally. Airframe Products operating margin income was down 10% to $218 million, impacted by the factors I just described, but we do expect operating margins to improve as we progress throughout the year. 
Airframe Products is well positioned with a line of sight to effectively leverage the expected volume growth this fiscal year. The recently announced Noranco acquisition, which Mark will cover in a minute, complements our product offering and further expands our ability to support the breadth of our customer requirements. 
Turning now to Slide 8 in our first quarter balance sheet. We increased our cash position to just over $1 billion in Q1, reflecting the net impact of our deployment actions, including the $2 billion bond issuance and our own internal cash generation. Our capital deployment actions were balanced in Q1 with capital expenditures of $94 million, which we expect to build as we progress through the year, $266 million for 2 tuck-in acquisitions and $232 million for share repurchase. We also issued $2 billion in attractively priced long-term bonds during the quarter, with a weighted average rate of 3.29%. As a result, we're updating our fiscal '16 interest expense outlook to $120 million versus the $70 million that was previously discussed. 
Moving to Slide 9 and we'll cover FY '16 guidance. Our original view on fiscal '16 is intact with the sole exception of the interest expense increase that I just discussed. Reflecting this change, we now see our fiscal '16 EPS to be in the range of $12.25 to $13.25 versus the original forecasted range of $12.50 to $13.40. We will update our views for the Composites Horizons and Noranco transactions once they're closed, which we expect in Q2 '16 and Q3, respectively. I apologize, I misread here. In the range of $3.25 to $13.15 versus our original forecast of $12.50 to $13.40. I want to make that clear. 
Moving to Slide 10. Our view for aerospace market is also intact. Commercial aerospace demand played out in Q1 as we expected, and we believe that the balance of the year can see a slightly higher growth rate versus the 3% that we achieved in Q1. With the slow start experienced in regional/business jet and military demand in the first quarter, we will be closely monitoring these markets to assess our prospect in fiscal '16. At this time, we do still see a path to achieve our indicated growth rates. 
On Slide 11, Q1's activity confirmed our fiscal '16 views for our power and general industrial markets as well as. 
Moving to Slide 12. Our view on this segment is intact. However, we do anticipate Airframe Products revenue growth more likely to land in the lower end of the indicated performance ranges with an incremental margin around 40%. This reflects the demand timing and new program development work dynamics that influence the first quarter's performance. The Airframe team remains solidly focused on delivering to our customers' demand in a cost-effective manner. Forged Products' performance in Q1 affirms our review for the year, and we expect to continue to see the segment's operating margins expand sequentially at a modest pace than the level achieved this quarter. Considering the oil and gas demand challenges faced by the segment, the first quarter's performance was a good start for fiscal '16. As a reminder, Forged Products will undergo normal seasonal maintenance in Q2. And as we indicated last quarter, we have a key asset in U.K. that will undergo extended maintenance activities. Investment Cast's strong performance in the first quarter affirms our view for FY '16 as well. 
With that, I'll turn it back to you, Mark."

We'd now like to now take a closer look at the recently announced acquisition. First, Composites Horizons. This is a technology that we have been very focused on trying to add to our portfolio really over the last couple of years. We want to make sure that as we always have that we continue to look for solutions and be able to provide for our customer as their need continues to expand. I don't care if that's been shapes or capabilities, in this case, it's moving beyond metallics. We always want to make sure we can provide the answer. 
The next-generation engines has had a growing demand for composite components as they drive for higher operating temperatures. Looking for more complex flow pass shapes, you can get a lot more configuration in a composite than you can in metallic, and they're always searching for higher strength to weight ratios. As we always have when we look at these moving different technologies, we look for assets that have a very strong technical capability, so we're building off of an extremely solid base. CHI has the expertise in both carbon and ceramic matrix components. They already have established good, solid relationships with long-term contracts with the major OEMs, and they have good content on the next-generation commercial programs. We expect to close CHI very shortly. 
Noranco continues to expand our march into Aerostructures. They, again, provide high precision machining and Airframe applications, but equally as important for us is also the ability to do complex landing gear as well as air win components so they continue to expand our capabilities. They are fully integrated supplier, going from machining through fabrication, processing, assembly and test. They also provides the opportunity to integrate some of our other operations, whether it's castings, forgings or fasteners. And as always, in this machining side of these operations, it allows us to capture another very valuable stream that can feed into our melt shops. Noranco has a very strong solid management team and I feel we'll be able to integrate rapidly our operating systems and the mentality and spread their capabilities and grow well beyond where they are today. So with that, we expect to close that in Q3 of fiscal year '16. 
So again, in summary, I think Investment Cast Products delivered solid results. I think they are focused in attacking the right elements of their business. Forged Products and the action that we have taken have certainly gave us a stable base to build out of and have allowed us to compete in a very tough market, which exists right now. Airframe Products in the quarter, we did digest a significant amount of new work. As we move through the balance of this year, I think we'll strike a much better balance between production development. And Q1 was, again, a very balanced approach in our cast deployment. And as we just said, since then, we've also announced and will add 2 additional strategic fix, CHI and Noranco. 
So with that, we'll open up to questions."

Q1 inventory build had a couple of different factors in there that impacted us. First was the build ahead for the Forged shutdowns in Q2. And the items I highlighted with regard to Airframe Products with the issue of getting the development load out and some of that fastener demand timing, that also created some increase in inventory. That was about 1/3 of the total increase for the quarter between those 2 items. If you look -- we also benefited from deflation in the quarter, especially within our Forged Products segment, and so you'll see the LIFO reserve increase there based on that performance improvement off the Q4 levels. We had some impact from currency as foreign exchange got a little stronger in some of our balance sheet internationally. And we also had the 2 tuck-in acquisitions that added inventory for the quarter. That being said, though, we still believe that there's a great deal of opportunity to drive inventory out. And we've got ourselves focused on that with a lot of internal metrics that are measuring that and driving to push inventories down."

As the engine guys over time have continued to find ways to extract basically more heat or get more performance out of the engines. There's been a certain pieces that are not necessarily structural, so they're more involved in the movement of air or direction of air. So as we thought about kind of the ceramics world and what we're looking forward is, we're not searching for something that you and I can go do in our garage. We're looking for something that has strong technical capabilities, additive to what we do. A lot of what they do is replacement for sheet metal, sheet metal fabrication, where they're able to get a component in there that's got a lot more heat capability but also gives a shape that we typically can't get out of a casting. That's why you get a lot of this replacing some sort of sheet metal and get more work into it. So right now what we're looking for is kind of being able to supply an answer to our customers that is more -- it's additive to what we're currently doing. The thing I like about CHI is it has the capability and already has the technology, and they've been at this now for well over 10 years in these complex shapes, so they've been able to get embedded in the new generation there that the capability and the contract side. And it's additive to what our current positions would be. So it's not as what though what there aren't those programs is something take away from us. It's incremental to us as we move into the next generation. Now I could also see us at some point in time moving sideways, but again, we're going to be very surgical in what it is we're going after.

I think that it's kind of a -- we don't see a lot of laughs, and the consumption is certainly staying up. There was an ability to look at the same product for 4, 5 different locations that may have been slightly overbought that enabled them to kind of consolidate that by over a short period of time. But the consumption is certainly -- it's something we have the line of sight to, and that's what we're sitting as we move through the balance of the year. It certainly comes back to more normal level. If I look at the other side of the equation, which is the development load, we had a number, if you kind of go on to the back half of this year, we have to support the contracts that we've already won. We had to get -- obviously, we have to get the development, get approved and get into our customers' hands and so we'll be very supportive the volume. And it was a in the thousands of parts numbers type of thing, so it's not a small number that we had to do. We just had to bite the bullet and get those in so we can get them behind us. And then we had a very demanding short-cycle development program that we had to take in one particular asset. We had to take almost 35% to 40% of the capability of that in terms of spend time and dedicate it to get the product through our shop into our customers so they could make the development time frame had to do. So what they really did is it kind of bottlenecked a lot of the assets from putting through already through production to make sure we were prepared. And it was a big bite to take this quarter. I think what you see as we move through the balance of the year, it comes back to much better balance in terms of how we'll digest the remaining work and then move it through along with production."

It's almost asking like with the state of The world, but let me try the best I can to kind of piece my way through that. If I look at what the -- let me just start operationally because it kind of a drumbeat of everything we do. If you look at where they are operationally, I think that again, I think we right-sized ourselves appropriately. I think we took the remaining resources we have. We have properly balance between whatever we have to make sure we're doing development, and we certainly have a very, very focused attack on cost. And I think that if you look at what we do when we see markets rollover, we really direct our resources appropriately. So if I look from a cost-takeout standpoint, I think this team has got the ability to drive up those cost in a very steady manner. So I don't think that last quarter was one-off. It was a baseline of which to move off forward. If you move into the maintenance side of the equation, Jay kind of gave you what that -- so you have the improvement that's out there from a cost standpoint, but then you have that number in. What you're looking at that makes up that number jay gave was, you're looking at probably an average. Again, we normally run that we can have after 2 weeks just overall general maintenance take a lot of shutdowns during that period of time, and then we do the extended outage in the U.K. operation that we've actually been ordered the parts from 2 years now to get in and do that. So again, I think you get the cost on one side that's improving, but you're going this headwind coming from the normal Q2 plus the major outage. I'd say that from a competitive, yes, it's very competitive. It's also -- I think we've done a good understanding now of some product lines that I think our metal assets to do very well with, and we've identified that as kind of a market to go after. And Vice President the shied away from probably some of the more, I don't want call it commodity because nothing in difficult world is commodity but something where there is more competitive pressures. So I think we're finding the right utilization of our assets and maybe staying out of some of the fray that may be going on. So yes, the pricing is competitive, but we are finding some ability now to get better -- it's not where it was, obviously. It's not going to be until the market kind of recovers and the demand, the big products start coming back in, but I think we're finding the right spot to go to compete effectively. And so I guess it's a long way of saying all in. I think we've got the cost model that's coming in. i feel good about what this team is kind of -- we took on the chin and made hard call in Q4. I think we saw stabilization but improvement coming in Q1. We're going to come into Q2 with the outages to offset that. And I think we're finding some of the right spots to go compete that, but it's going to be competitive marketplace, but I think we're positioned very well for it."

And I think that as you and others think about Airframe, you may find get that Q1 provides a different starting point that what you expect. And that is not a business that's going to perfectly snap back in the second quarter. So I think we have -- we do have a different starting point. We reflected that in our discussion with you about fiscal '16 where we said that we think they will more likely come in at the lower end of our previously discussed revenue growth and incremental margin range. So I think those are the pieces to contemplate as well as the full quarter of the interest expense where we talked -- I think in the slides, we talked about a $33 million per quarter load from that new debt issue and that's net of CP that would have been paid down obviously at a much lower rate. So I think those are the pieces that you need to put in the mix for. The second quarter and a number of those carry into the back half as well to varying degrees."

They are a long-standing business. They've been able to really get strong resistance. they're able to deliver very complex shapes. So each one has a different solution. I think as you look at -- Noranco is going to be very common. We're going to take it into kind of our world and assimilate it very rapidly on what we do. And then the CHI is kind of you're looking for that strong technical leadership that can solve solutions to a customer as you move into the future, and sort of feedback from our customers is CHI has that position. So I think that's why I say about those 2 acquisitions."

I mean, overall, again, it changes year after year after year because as we go after those cost, cost comes in, in terms of capacity, productivity gains, machine efficiency, cut times, whatever it is. But I'd say probably right now we're probably averaging overall cost company about 70%, 75%. The tight spots for us, as we look forward, we knew we have won this work in terms of the Aerostructures business. So we had already kicked off a large capital expenditure over the course of the last year in terms of additional complex machining capabilities. So those assets will be coming in, so I'd say we're probably very tight on what we consider our 5x [ph] machining. And we have the capacity coming in as we move through this year, and again, that's -- it had development behind us, and so we're ready to go and the assets come in. so we're probably well in the 85%, 90% range on that equipment. The other tight area for us has been our itemization so this powder metallurgy. We, for Forge disks, we kicked off a capital package roughly a year ago. That will be coming in starting to go and we'll get the benefit of that in I guess late calendar year '16, 17, but we are at 99% capacity in that. So that asset is running 7 days a week around the clock. We have 2 assets that exists. We have going in Kentucky, and we have another 1 in Michigan. We'll be adding to the one in Michigan, so that is probably the single tightest when we have across our castings. We will meet eventually as we move into the back half of calendar '16, we will need single crystal furnaces to support the load we have. Structural castings, I think we're in good shape, just people. And then Forged Products, except for the atomizer, I think we're in good shape from there. So those are what I would view as a key need as we move over the next 12 to 16 months."

If I look at Q1 overall, I think that investment cast delivered a very solid performance in the quarter. I think they're focused on the right thing in supporting the customer in their ramp-up as the customer schedules dictate. I think the actions we took in Q4 for Forged Products has established a much better footing to take on the challenging oil and gas environment. I think the team is extremely focused on attacking all opportunities they have. And that's driving cost out, capitalizing on what they can do inside their factories and certainly positioning them to respond very well to very competitive pressures that are out there in the marketplace today. Airframe Products, in my opinion, got off to a slower start, with a substantial development load as we move through the quarter, primarily driven by 2 things. We had a large number of first historicals we had to move through the factory in getting to our customer to support the share that we have won and have to move into production in the back half of this year. And we also had a very short-cycle development program that we were required to support a key customer development schedule. Both of these really bottlenecked a number of our machining assets. Shawn will go into more detail as she moves through the airframe segment.
If I look at our cash deployment. I think there's a very balanced approach in Q1. We repurchased roughly $232 million of stock, as well as we closed in the quarter $266 million of acquisitions. You've seen that we recently announced post-Q1 2 other acquisitions, Composites Horizons and Noranco, and I will cover these in more details, on both of these, as we move later through the presentation.
So with that, I'll turn it over to Shawn."

I'll now review our consolidated first quarter results, starting with Slide 4.
Sales were down 4% to $2.4 billion, which reflects a sharp decline in oil and gas sales that more than offset low single-digit improvements in our large commercial aerospace demand. Consolidated segment operating income decreased 16% to $619 million, reducing operating margins by 350 basis points year-over-year to 25.7%. Earnings per share fell to $2.87 versus $3.32 in the prior year, driven primarily by end-market mix and volume challenges in our Forged Products segment.
Aerospace sales were down 1%, but large commercial sales were higher by 3%, reflecting our position on growth programs and stronger content wins throughout our portfolio. Power sales were down 17%, driven entirely by the 38% decline in oil and gas and other. IGT sales were higher by 3% overall, reflecting the strength of our position on the latest generation of turbines.
Currency was a $53 million negative impact to sales, resulting in a corresponding $11 million headwind for operating income, with most of the impact felt in our Forged Products and Airframe Products segments. Total organic sales were down 2% year-over-year on a constant currency basis but were higher by 1% when you exclude the sharp decline in demand in the oil and gas end markets.
Moving to Slide 5 and Investment Cast Products. Sales were up 1% to $632 million with continued growth in aerospace, including 6% higher large commercial aerospace demand, while regional and business jet sales were stable and military demand had double-digit declines. In power, IGT sales were up 4% as the segment benefited from its strong position on the newest high-efficiency turbines.
Investment Cast Products operating income was up 6% to $237 million with 170 basis points of margin expansion to 37.5%. The higher earnings quality reflects Investment Cast Products' efficient leverage of volume across its assets. From an end-market perspective, the segment remains well positioned to benefit from a continued rollout of high-efficiency gas turbines as well as the ramp in next-generation aerospace engines. The acquisition of Composites Horizons, which Mark will discuss in a moment, will allow us to offer high-temperature engine solutions across a broad range of materials.
Moving to Slide 6 and Forged Products. Sales were down 8% to $1 billion primarily due to the continued weakness in oil and gas end markets. The stronger dollar also created a roughly 2% or $22 million drag on Forged Products revenue growth rate.
In aerospace sales -- in aerospace, excuse me, sales were down 1%, with 5% growth in large commercial aerospace sales offset by moderate declines in regional and business jet sales and double-digit declines in military demand, as that end market had challenging year-over-year comparisons. In power, sales were down 33%, with IGT stable and oil and gas much softer, as we're not seeing any signs of improving demand trend in that market yet.
Forged Products operating income was down 34% to $204 million, reflecting mainly end-market mix dynamics and weaker volume in the oil and gas area. As compared to Q4 '15, the segment performed at a much improved level, demonstrating $11 million of EBIT growth on $66 million lower sales. The businesses most impacted by the oil and gas declines have used the downturn to drive efficiency into their operations, and these steps create a business better equipped to manage through the current demand challenges. We believe that we've taken the appropriate steps to rightsize the segment and do expect continued performance gains as we progress through fiscal 2016.
Moving to Slide 7 and Airframe Products. Sales were down 3% to $779 million. The stronger dollar did create a 3% or $24 million drag on airframe's revenue growth rate and had a $5 million negative impact on operating income.
Aerospace sales were down 2%, with large commercial and regional and business jet demand stable, while military demand declined at a double-digit pace. Commercial aerospace sales experienced headwinds in Q1 from timing of fastener demand and from the impact of new product development in our aerostructures operations. In fasteners, we saw several of our facilities impacted by demand timing associated with the expansion of our customer supply chains management initiatives. We expect this dynamic to resolve itself within the fiscal year.
Regarding aerostructures, we've been very successful winning new positions, but the ramp of that new work did create some disruptions in our operations and constrained activity in other areas. We expect to see improved performance as we move through fiscal 2016. General industrial sales, which represent only about 10% of the segment's total sales, were down mid-teens due to declines in automotive and construction end markets, mainly internationally.
Airframe Products operating margin income was down 10% to $218 million, impacted by the factors I just described, but we do expect operating margins to improve as we progress throughout the year. Airframe Products is well positioned with a line of sight to effectively leverage the expected volume growth this fiscal year. The recently announced Noranco acquisition, which Mark will cover in a minute, complements our product offering and further expands our ability to support the breadth of our customer requirements.
Turning now to Slide 8 and our first quarter balance sheet.
We increased our cash position to just over $1 billion in Q1, reflecting the net impact of our deployment actions, including the $2 billion bond issuance, and our own internal cash generation. Our capital deployment actions were balanced in Q1 with capital expenditures of $94 million, which we expect to build as we progress through the year; $266 million for 2 tuck-in acquisitions; and $232 million for share repurchase. We also issued $2 billion and attractively priced long-term bonds during the quarter with a weighted average rate of 3.29%. As a result, we are updating our fiscal '16 interest expense outlook to $120 million versus the $70 million that was previously discussed.
Moving to Slide 9, and we'll cover FY '16 guidance.
Our original view on fiscal '16 is intact, with the sole exception of the interest expense increase that I just discussed. Reflecting this change, we now see our fiscal '16 EPS to be in the range of $12.25 to $13.25 versus the original forecasted range of $12.50 to $13.40. We will update our views for the Composites Horizons and Noranco transactions once they're closed, which we expect in Q2 '16 and Q3, respectively.
I apologize. Let me -- I misread here. It's in the range of $3.25 (sic) [$12.25] to $13.15 versus our original forecast of $12.50 to $13.40. I want to make that clear.
Moving to Slide 10. Our view for our aerospace markets is also intact. Commercial aerospace demand played out in Q1 as we expected, and we believe that the balance of the year can see a slightly higher growth rate versus the 3% that we achieved in Q1. With the slow starts experienced in regional and business jets and military demand in the first quarter, we will be closely monitoring these markets to assess our prospects in fiscal '16. At this time, we do still see a path to achieve our indicated growth rates.
On Slide 11. Q1's activity confirmed our fiscal '16 views for our power and general industrial markets as well.
Moving to Slide 12. Our view on the segments is intact. However, we do anticipate Airframe Products revenue growth more likely to land in the lower end of the indicated performance ranges, with an incremental margin around 40%. This reflects the demand timing and new program development work dynamics that influenced the first quarter's performance. The airframe team remains solidly focused on delivering to our customer's demand in a cost-effective manner.
Forged Products' performance in Q1 affirms our view for the year, and we expect to continue to see the segment's operating margins expand sequentially at a modest pace than the level achieved this quarter. Considering the oil- and gas-centered demand challenges faced by the segment, the first quarter's performance was a good start for fiscal '16. As a reminder, Forged Products will undergo normal seasonal maintenance in Q2. And as we indicated last quarter, we have a key asset in U.K. that will undergo extended maintenance activities.
Investment cast's strong performance in the first quarter affirms our view for FY '16 as well.
With that, I'll turn it back to you, Mark."

I don't care if that's been shapes or capabilities. In this case, it's moving beyond metallics. We always want to make sure we can provide the answer.
The next-generation engines has had a growing demand for composite components as they drive for higher operating temperatures, looking for more complex flow path shapes. You can get a lot more configuration in a composite than you can in metallic. And they're always searching for higher strength-to-weight ratios. As we always have when we look at these and moving in these different technologies, we look for assets that have a very strong technical capability, so we're building off of an extremely solid base. CHI has the expertise in both carbon and ceramic matrix components. They already have established, good, solid relationships with long-term contracts with the major OEMs, and they have good content on the next-generation commercial programs. We expect to close CHI very shortly.
Noranco continues to expand our march into aerostructures. They, again, provide high-recision machining and airframe applications, but equally as important for us is also the ability to do complex landing gear as well as aero-engine components, so they continue to expand our capabilities. They are a fully integrated supplier, going from machining through fabrication, processing, assembly and tests. They also provide us the opportunity to integrate some of our other operations, whether it's castings, forgings or fasteners. And as always, in this machining side of these operations, it allows us to capture another very valuable revert stream that we can feed into our melt shops.
Noranco has a very solid management team, and I feel we'll be able to integrate rapidly our operating systems and the mentality and spread their capability and grow well beyond where they are today. So with that, we expect to close that in Q3 of fiscal year '16.
So again, in summary, I think Investment Cast Products delivered solid results. I think they are focused in attacking the right elements of their business. Forged Products and the actions that we have taken have certainly given us a stable base to build off of and have allowed us to compete in a very tough market which exists right now. Airframe Products, in the quarter, we did digest a significant amount of new work. And as we move through the balance of this year, I think we'll strike a much better balance between production and development. And Q1 was, again, a very balanced approach in our cast deployment. And as we just said, since then, we've also announced and will add 2 additional strategic fits: CHI and Noranco.
So with that, we'll open up to questions."

Q1 inventory build had a couple of different factors in there that impacted us. First was the build ahead for the forge shutdowns in Q2. And the items I highlighted with regard to Airframe Products with the issue of getting the development load out and some of that fastener demand timing, that also created some increase in inventory. That was about 1/3 of the total increase for the quarter between those 2 items. If you look, we also benefited from deflation in the quarter, especially within our Forged Products segment. And so you'll see the LIFO reserve increase there based on that performance improvement off the Q4 levels. We had some impact from currency, as foreign exchange got a little stronger in some of our balance sheets internationally. And we also had the 2 tuck-in acquisitions that added some inventory for the quarter. That being said, though, we still believe that there's a great deal of opportunity to drive inventory out. And we've got ourselves focused on that with a lot of internal metrics that are measuring that and driving to push inventories down."

There've been certain pieces that are not necessarily structural, so they're more involved in the movement of air or direction of air. So as we thought about kind of the ceramics world and -- what we're looking forward is -- we were not searching for a -- something that you and I can go do in our garage. We were looking for something that had strong technical capabilities additive to what we do. A lot of what they do is replacement for sheet metal and sheet metal fabrication, where they're able to get a component in there that's got a lot more heat capability but also gives a shape that we typically can't get out of a casting. That's why you get a lot of this as replacing some sort of sheet metal work and get more work into it. So right now, what we're looking for is kind of being able to supply an answer to our customers that is more -- it's additive to what we're currently doing. The thing I like about CHI is that it has the capability and already has the technology in this. They've been at this now for well over 10 years, in these complex shapes, so they've been able to get embedded in the new generation. They already have that, the capability and the context on it. And it's additive to what our current positions would be, so it's not as though we're -- what their -- are in those programs is something taking away from us. It's incremental to us as we move into next generation. Now I could also see us at some point in time moving sideways, but again we're going to be very surgical in what it is we're going after.

There was an ability to look at the same part over 4 or 5 different locations that may have been slightly overbought then enabled them to kind of consolidate that buy over a short period of time. But the consumption is certainly it's something we have a line of sight to, and that's what we're seeing as we move through the balance of the year. It certainly comes back to a more normal level. If I look at the other side of the equation, which is the development load, we had a number. If you kind of go on to the back half of this year, we have to support the contracts that we've already won. We had to get -- obviously, we have to get to development, get approved and get it into our customers' hands so we'll better support the volume. And it was a ""in the thousands of part numbers"" type of thing, so it's not a small number that we had to do. We just had to bite the bullet and get those in so we can get them behind us. And then we had a very demanding short-cycle development program that we had to take in one particular asset. We had to take almost 35% to 40% of the capability of that in terms of spindle time and dedicate it to get a product through our shop, into our customers' hands so they could make the development time frame had to do. So what it really did is it kind of bottlenecked a lot of the assets from putting through already production to make sure we were prepared. And it was a big bite away [ph] to take this quarter. I think what you see, as we move through the balance of the year, it comes back into a much better balance in terms of how we'll digest the remaining work and then move it through along with production."

But let me try the best I can to kind of piece my way through that. If I look at what the operational -- let me just start it operationally because that's kind of the drumbeat of everything we do. And if you look at where they are operationally, I think that -- again, I think we rightsized ourselves appropriately. I think we took the remaining resource we have. We got them properly balanced between whatever we have to make sure we're doing development, and we certainly have a very, very focused attack on cost. And I think that, if you look at what we do when we see markets roll over, we really direct our resources appropriately. So if I look from a cost-takeout standpoint, I think this team has got the ability to drive at those costs in a very steady manner. So I don't think that last quarter was one-off. It was a baseline of which to move off forward. If you move into the maintenance side of the equation, Jay kind of gave you what that -- so you'll have the improvement that's out there from a cost standpoint, but then you'll have that number in. What you're looking at that makes up that number Jay gave was you're looking at probably an average. Again, we normally run that we can have to 2 weeks of just overall general maintenance if we take a lot of shutdowns during that period of time. And then we do of the extended outage in the U.K. operation that we've actually been ordering the parts for almost 2 years now to get in and do that. So again, I think you get the costs on one side that's improving, but you're going to have the -- this headwind coming from the normal Q2, plus the major outage. I'd say that, from a competitive, yes, it's very competitive. It's also I think we've done a -- we've got a good understanding now of some product lines that I think our metal assets do very well with, and we've identified that as kind of the market to go after. And we've probably shied away from some of the more -- I don't want to call it commodity because nothing in this nickel world is commodity but certainly where there is more competitive pressures. So I think we're finding the right utilization of our assets and maybe staying out of some of the fray that may be going on. So yes, the pricing is competitive, but we are finding some ability now to get better -- it's not where it was, obviously. It's not going to be where -- until their market kind of recovers, and the demand; when all the big projects start coming back in, but I think we're finding the right spot to go compete effectively. And so I guess it's a long way of saying all in. I think we got the cost model that's coming in. I feel good about what this team has got in. We took it on the chin. They made the hard calls in Q4. I think we saw not only stabilization but improvement coming in, in Q1. We're going to come into Q2 with the outages to offset that. And I think we're finding some of the right spots to go compete at, but it's going to be a competitive marketplace but I think we're positioned very well for it."

And we reflected that in our discussion with you about fiscal '16, where we said that we think they will more likely come in at the lower end of our previously discussed revenue growth and incremental margin range. So I think those are the pieces to contemplate, as well as the full quarter of the interest expense where we've talked. I think, in the slides, we talked about a $33 million per quarter load from that new debt issue, and that's net of CP that would have been paid down obviously at a much lower rate.

In the time we were doing due diligence, we were visiting plants. The rate at which they were able to assimilate the way we thought, the way we talked, I think that, that Noranco team is a very, very, very solid team that we can work very well. But I think the starting baseline is the same. And if I switch over to CHI: I mean the technical breadth of that group and what they've been able to do and how long they've been at it, this is not a business that's kind of new to the party. They are a longstanding business. They've been able to really get strong resistance. They're able to deliver very complex shapes. So each one has a different solution. I think, as you look at, that Noranco, it's going to feel very common, we're going to take it into a -- kind of our world. We're going to assimilate it very rapidly in what we do. And then the CHI is kind of that you're looking for that strong technical leadership that can solve solutions to a customer as you move into the future.

So those assets will be coming in. So I'd say we're probably very tight on what we consider our 5-axis machining. And we have the capacity coming in as we move through this year, and again that's what had to get development behind us so we are ready to go when the assets come in. So we're probably well into that 85%, 90% range on that equipment. The other tight area for us has been in our atomization, so this is due into our powder metallurgy up [ph]. We -- for forge discs. We kicked off a capital package roughly a year ago. That will be coming in starting to go. And we'll get the benefit of that in, I can't think what year, late calendar '16, 17, but we are at 99% capacity in that. So that asset is running 7 days a week, round the clock. We have 2 assets that exist. We have 1 in Kentucky, and we have another 1 in Michigan. We'll be adding to the one in Michigan, so that is probably the single tightest one we have. If I across our castings: We will need eventually. As we move into the back half of calendar '16, we will need more DS single crystal furnaces to support the load we have. Structural castings, I think we're in good shape. It's just people. And then Forged Products, except for the atomizer, I think we're in good shape from there.

If I look at Q1 overall, I think that investment cast delivered a very solid performance in the quarter. I think they're focused on the right thing in supporting the customer in their ramp-up as the customer schedules dictate. I think the actions we took in Q4 for Forged Products has established a much better footing to take on the challenging oil and gas environment. I think the team is extremely focused on attacking all opportunities they have. And that's driving cost out, capitalizing on what they can do inside their factories and certainly positioning them to respond very well to very competitive pressures that are out there in the marketplace today. Airframe Products, in my opinion, got off to a slower start, with a substantial development load as we moved through the quarter, primarily driven by 2 things. We had a large number of first historicals [ph] we had to move through the factory and get to our customer to support the share that we have won and have to move into production in the back half of this year. And we also had a very short-cycle development program that we required to support a key customer development schedule. Both of these really bottlenecked a number of our machining assets. Shawn will go into more detail as she moves through the airframe segment.
If I look at our cash deployment. I think there's a very balanced approach in Q1. We repurchased roughly $232 million of stock, as well as we closed, in the quarter, $266 million of acquisitions. You've seen that we recently announced post-Q1 2 other acquisitions: Composites Horizons and Noranco, and I will cover these in more details, both of these, as we move later through the presentation.
So with that, I'll turn it over to Shawn."

I'll now review our consolidated first quarter results, starting with Slide 4.
Sales were down 4% to $2.4 billion, which reflects a sharp decline in oil and gas sales that more than offset low single-digit improvements in our large commercial aerospace demand. Consolidated segment operating income decreased 16% to $619 million, reducing operating margins by 350 basis points year-over-year to 25.7%. Earnings per share fell to $2.87 versus $3.32 in the prior year, driven primarily by end-market mix and volume challenges in our Forged Products segment.
Aerospace sales were down 1%, but large commercial sales were higher by 3%, reflecting our position on growth programs and stronger content wins throughout our portfolio. Power sales were down 17%, driven entirely by the 38% decline in Oil and Gas and Other. IGT sales were higher by 3% overall, reflecting the strength of our position on the latest generation of turbines.
Currency was a $53 million negative impact to sales, resulting in a corresponding $11 million headwind for operating income, with most of the impact felt in our Forged Products and Airframe Products segments. Total organic sales were down 2% year-over-year on a constant currency basis but were higher by 1% when you exclude the sharp decline in demand in the oil and gas end markets.
Moving to Slide 5 and Investment Cast Products. Sales were up 1% to $632 million with continued growth in aerospace, including 6% higher large commercial aerospace demand, while regional and business jet sales were stable and military demand had double-digit declines. In Power, IGT sales were up 4% as the segment benefited from its strong position on the newest high-efficiency turbines.
Investment Cast Products operating income was up 6% to $237 million with 170 basis points of margin expansion to 37.5%. The higher earnings quality reflects Investment Cast Products' efficient leverage of volume across its assets. From an end-market perspective, the segment remains well positioned to benefit from a continued rollout of high-efficiency gas turbines as well as the ramp in next-generation aerospace engines. The acquisition of Composites Horizons, which Mark will discuss in a moment, will allow us to offer high-temperature engine solutions across a broad range of materials.
Moving to Slide 6 and Forged Products. Sales were down 8% to $1 billion primarily due to the continued weakness in oil and gas end markets. The stronger dollar also created a roughly 2% or $22 million drag on Forged Products' revenue growth rate.
In Aerospace sales -- in Aerospace, excuse me, sales were down 1%, with 5% growth in large commercial aerospace sales offset by moderate declines in regional and business jet sales and double-digit declines in military demand, as that end market had challenging year-over-year comparisons. In Power, sales were down 33%, with IGT stable and oil and gas much softer, as we're not seeing any signs of improving demand trend in that market yet.
Forged Products' operating income was down 34% to $204 million, reflecting mainly end-market mix dynamics and weaker volume in the oil and gas area. As compared to Q4 '15, the segment performed at a much improved level, demonstrating $11 million of EBIT growth on $66 million lower sales. The businesses most impacted by the oil and gas declines have used the downturn to drive efficiency into their operations. And these steps create a business better equipped to manage through the current demand challenges. We believe that we've taken the appropriate steps to rightsize the segment and do expect continued performance gains as we progress through fiscal 2016.
Moving to Slide 7 and Airframe Products. Sales were down 3% to $779 million. The stronger dollar did create a 3% or $24 million drag on airframe's revenue growth rates and had a $5 million negative impact on operating income.
Aerospace sales were down 2%, with large commercial and regional and business jet demand stable, while military demand declined at a double-digit pace. Commercial aerospace sales experienced headwinds in Q1 from timing of fastener demand and from the impact of new product development in our Aerostructures operations. In fasteners, we saw several of our facilities impacted by demand timing associated with the expansion of our customer supply chains management initiatives. We expect this dynamic to resolve itself within the fiscal year.
Regarding Aerostructures, we've been very successful winning new positions, but the ramp of that new work did create some disruptions in our operations and constrained activity in other areas. We expect to see improved performance as we move through fiscal 2016. General industrial sales, which represent only about 10% of the segment's total sales, were down mid-teens, due to declines in automotive and construction end markets, mainly internationally.
Airframe Products operating margin income was down 10% to $218 million, impacted by the factors I just described, but we do expect operating margins to improve as we progress throughout the year. Airframe Products is well positioned with a line of sight to effectively leverage the expected volume growth this fiscal year. The recently announced Noranco acquisition, which Mark will cover in a minute, complements our product offering and further expands our ability to support the breadth of our customer requirements.
Turning now to Slide 8 and our first quarter balance sheet.
We increased our cash position to just over $1 billion in Q1, reflecting the net impact of our deployment actions, including the $2 billion bond issuance, and our own internal cash generation. Our capital deployment actions were balanced in Q1 with capital expenditures of $94 million, which we expect to build as we progress through the year; $266 million for 2 tuck-in acquisitions; and $232 million for share repurchase. We also issued $2 billion in attractively priced long-term bonds during the quarter with a weighted average rate of 3.29%. As a result, we are updating our fiscal '16 interest expense outlook to $120 million versus the $70 million that was previously discussed.
Moving to Slide 9, I will cover FY '16 guidance.
Our original view on fiscal '16 is intact, with the sole exception of the interest expense increase that I just discussed. Reflecting this change, we now see our fiscal '16 EPS to be in the range of $12.25 to $13.25 versus the original forecasted range of $12.50 to $13.40. We will update our views for the Composites Horizons and Noranco transactions once they're closed, which we expect in Q2 '16 and Q3, respectively.
I apologize. Let me -- I misread here. It's in the range of $3.25 (sic) [$12.25] to $13.15 versus our original forecast of $12.50 to $13.40. I want to make that clear.
Moving to Slide 10. Our view for our aerospace markets is also intact. Commercial aerospace demand played out in Q1 as we expected, and we believe that the balance of the year can see a slightly higher growth rate versus the 3% that we achieved in Q1. With the slow starts experienced in regional and business jets and military demand in the first quarter, we will be closely monitoring these markets to assess our prospects in fiscal '16. At this time, we do still see a path to achieve our indicated growth rates.
On Slide 11. Q1's activity confirmed our fiscal '16 views for our power and general industrial markets as well.
Moving to Slide 12. Our view on the segments is intact. However, we do anticipate Airframe Products revenue growth more likely to land in the lower end of the indicated performance ranges, with an incremental margin around 40%. This reflects the demand timing and new program development work dynamics that influenced the first quarter's performance. The airframe team remains solidly focused on delivering to our customer's demand in a cost-effective manner.
Forged Products' performance in Q1 affirms our view for the year, and we expect to continue to see the segment's operating margins expand sequentially at a modest pace from the level achieved this quarter. Considering the oil- and gas-centered demand challenges faced by the segment, the first quarter's performance was a good start for fiscal '16. As a reminder, Forged Products will undergo normal seasonal maintenance in Q2. And as we indicated last quarter, we have a key asset in the U.K. that will undergo extended maintenance activities.
Investment cast's strong performance in the first quarter affirms our view for FY '16 as well.
With that, I'll turn it back to you, Mark."

So what I'd like to do now is take a closer look at the recently announced acquisitions.
First, Composites Horizons. This is a technology that we have been very focused on trying to add to our portfolio, really over the last couple of years. We wanted to make sure, as we always have, that we continued to look for solutions and be able to provide for our customer as their need continues to expand. I don't care if that's been shapes or capabilities. In this case, it's moving beyond metallics. We always want to make sure we can provide the answer.
The next-generation engines has had a growing demand for composite components, as they drive for higher operating temperatures, looking for more complex flow path shapes. You can get a lot more configuration in a composite than you can in metallic. And they're always searching for higher strength-to-weight ratios. As we always have when we look at these, moving in these different technologies, we look for assets that have a very strong technical capability, so we're building off of an extremely solid base. CHI has the expertise in both carbon and ceramic matrix components. They already have established, good, solid relationships with long-term contracts with the major OEMs, and they have good content on the next-generation commercial programs. We expect to close CHI very shortly.
Noranco continues to expand our march into Aerostructures. They, again, provide high-precision machining in airframe applications, but equally as important for us is also the ability to do complex landing gear as well as aero-engine components. So they continue to expand our capabilities. They are a fully integrated supplier, going from machining through fabrication, processing, assembly and tests. They also will provide us the opportunity to integrate some of our other operations, whether it's castings, forgings or fasteners. And as always, in this machining side of these operations, it allows us to capture another very valuable revert stream that we can feed into our melt shops.
Noranco has a very solid management team, that I feel we'll be able to integrate rapidly our operating systems and the mentality and spread their capability and grow well beyond where they are today. So with that, we expect to close that in Q3 of fiscal year '16.
So again, in summary, I think Investment Cast Products delivered solid results. I think they are focused in attacking the right elements of their business. Forged Products, I think the actions that we have taken have certainly given us a stable base to build off of and have allowed us to compete in a very tough market; which exists right now. Airframe Products, in the quarter, we did digest a significant amount of new work. And as we move through the balance of this year, I think we'll strike a much better balance between production and development. And Q1 was, again, a very balanced approach in our cast deployment. And as we just said, since then, we've also announced and will add 2 additional strategic fits: CHI and Noranco.
So with that, we'll open up to questions."

That was about 1/3 of the total increase for the quarter between those 2 items. If you look, we also benefited from deflation in the quarter, especially within our Forged Products segment. And so you'll see the LIFO reserve increase there, based on that performance improvement off the Q4 levels. We had some impact from currency, as foreign exchange got a little stronger on some of our balance sheets internationally. And we also had the 2 tuck-in acquisitions that added some inventory for the quarter. That being said, though, we still believe that there's a great deal of opportunity to drive inventory out.

So they're more involved in the movement of air or direction of air. So as we thought about kind of the ceramics world and -- what we're looking for is -- we were not searching for a -- something that you and I can go do in our garage. We were looking for something that had strong technical capabilities additive to what we do. A lot of what they do is replacement for sheet metal and sheet metal fabrication, where they're able to get a component in there that's got a lot more heat capability but also gives a shape that we typically can't get out of a casting. That's why you get a lot of this as replacing some sort of sheet metal -- where they can get more work into it. So right now, what we're looking for is kind of being able to supply an answer to our customers that is more -- it's additive to what we're currently doing. The thing I like about CHI is that it has the capability and already has the technology in this. They've been at this now for well over 10 years, in these complex shapes. So they've been able to get embedded in the new generation. They already have that -- the capability and the contracts on it. And it's additive to what our current positions would be. So it's not as though we're -- what there are in those programs is something taking away from us. It's incremental to us as we move into the next generation. Now I could also see us, at some point in time, moving sideways, but again we're going to be very surgical in what it is we're going after. And I think this just really fit the bill. We've had our eye on CHI for a long time."

I think that it's kind of a -- we don't see it as a long last. And the consumption is certainly staying up. There was an ability to look at the same part over 4 or 5 different locations that may have been slightly overbought that enabled them to kind of consolidate that buy over a short period of time. But the consumption is certainly -- it's something we have a line of sight to. And that's what we're seeing as we move through the balance of the year -- it certainly comes back to a more normal level. If I look at the other side of the equation, which is the development load. We had a number. If you kind of go on to the back half of this year, we have to support the contracts that we've already won. We had to get -- obviously, we have to get the development, get approved and get it into our customers' hands so we'll be prepared to support the volume. And it was a ""in the thousands of part numbers"" type of thing, so it's not a small number that we had to do. We just had to bite the bullet and get those in so we can get them behind us. And then we had a very demanding short-cycle development program that we had to take -- in one particular asset -- we had to take almost 35% to 40% of the capability of that in terms of spindle time and dedicate it to get the product through our shop, into our customers' hands so they could make the development time frame they had to do. So what it really did is it kind of bottlenecked a lot of the assets from putting through already approved production to make sure we were prepared. And it was a big bite away to take this quarter. I think what you see, as we move through the balance of the year, it comes back into a much better balance in terms of how we'll digest the remaining work and then move it through along with production."

But let me try the best I can to kind of piece my way through that. If I look at what the  -- let me just start it operationally because that's kind of the drumbeat of everything we do. And if you look at where they are operationally, I think that -- again, I think we rightsized ourselves appropriately. I think we took the remaining resources we have. We got them properly balanced between whatever we have to make sure we're doing in development, and we certainly have a very, very focused attack on cost. And I think that, if you look at what we do when we see markets roll over, we really direct our resources appropriately. So if I look from a cost-takeout standpoint, I think this team has got the ability to drive at those costs in a very steady manner. So I don't think that last quarter was one-off. It was a baseline of which to move off, forward. If you move into the maintenance side of the equation, Jay kind of gave you what that -- so you'll have the improvement that's out there from a cost standpoint, but then you'll have that number in. What you're looking at that makes up that number Jay gave was you're looking at probably an average, again, we normally run that 1.5 weeks - 2 weeks of just overall general maintenance, we take a lot of shutdowns during that period of time. And then we do have the extended outage in the U.K. operation that we've actually been ordering the parts for almost 2 years now to get in and do that. So again, I think you get the costs on one side that's improving, but you're going to have the -- this headwind coming from the normal Q2, plus the major outage. I'd say that, from a competitive -- yes, it's very competitive. It's also I think we've done a -- we've got a good understanding now of some product lines that I think our metal assets do very well with. And we've identified that as kind of the market to go after. And we've probably shied away from some of the more -- I don't want to call it commodity because nothing in this nickel world is commodity but certainly where there is more competitive pressures. So I think we're finding the right utilization of our assets and maybe staying out of some of the fray that may be going on. So yes, the pricing is competitive, but we are finding some ability now to get better -- it's not where it was, obviously. It's not going to be where -- until the market kind of recovers, and the demand -- the big projects start coming back in. But I think we're finding the right spot to go compete effectively. And so I guess it's a long way of saying all in. I think we got the cost model that's coming in. I feel good about what this team has kind of -- we took it on the chin. They made the hard calls in Q4. I think we saw not only stabilization but improvement coming in, in Q1. We're going to come into Q2 with the outages to offset that. And I think we're finding some of the right spots to go compete at, but it's going to be a competitive marketplace. But I think we're positioned very well for it."

Investment cast has a solid demand picture with which to work and they've done a good job from the cost side, and you see that in the margin performance this quarter. Airframe Products, I would say, left some opportunity on the table relative to what was in front of them. And I think that, as you and others think about Airframe, you may find that Q1 provides a different starting point than what you expect. And that is not a business that's going to perfectly snap back in the second quarter. So I think we have -- we do have a different starting point. And we reflected that in our discussion with you about fiscal '16, where we said that we think they will more likely come in at the lower end of our previously discussed revenue growth and incremental margin range. So I think those are the pieces to contemplate, as well as the full quarter of the interest expense where we've talked. I think, in the slides, we talked about a $33 million per quarter load from that new debt issue, and that's net of CP. That would have been paid down obviously at a much lower rate. So I think those are the pieces that you need to put in the mix for the second quarter, and a number of those carry into the back half as well, to varying degrees."

And quite frankly, that is the profile that we've seen across the breadth of our Aerostructures acquisition. So Noranco kind of fits right in that arena. We haven't characterized the sales. This is -- I would -- I think -- although we have said publicly in the past that we are typically transacting, I mean, historically around a 10x, 9.5x, 10x EBITDA multiple.

But we look at where that -- where can we bring the management, how do we think they can digest it. In the time we were doing due diligence, we were visiting plants. The rate at which they were able to assimilate the way we thought, the way we talked, I think that, that Noranco team is a very, very, very solid team that we can work very well. But I think the starting baseline is the same. And if I switch over to CHI -- I mean the technical breadth of that group and what they've been able to do and how long they've been at it -- this is not a business that's kind of new to the party. They are a longstanding business. They've been able to really get strong positions. They're able to deliver very complex shapes. So each one has a different solution. I think, as you look at -- that Noranco, it's going to feel very common, we're going to take it into a -- kind of our world. We're going to assimilate it very rapidly in what we do. And then the CHI is kind of that you're looking for that strong technical leadership that can solve solutions to a customer as you move into the future.

Now they do go over to some complex airframe shapes, but if you look at some of that ceramic matrix, it's falling squarely in the engine side. I would view it as an ability to continue to grow sideways. Again, typically what we do with some of these things when we find these technology step-overs, we find somebody that we think is very technologically capable. And then we look to them and say, ""Okay, where else can we grow? What else may be out there to continue to fill up the portfolio?""

The tight spots for us, as we look forward, we've -- we knew we had won this work in terms of the Aerostructures business, so we had already kicked off a large capital expenditure over the course of the last year, in terms of additional complex machining capabilities. So those assets will be coming in. So I'd say we're probably very tight on what we consider our 5-axis machining. And we have the capacity coming in as we move through this year, and again that's one of the -- had to get development behind us so we are ready to go when the assets come in. So we're probably well into the 85%, 90% range on that equipment. The other tight area for us has been in our atomization, so this -- you're into our powder metallurgy up. We -- for forged discs: We kicked off a capital package roughly a year ago. That will be coming in starting to go. And we'll get the benefit of that in, I can't think what year, late calendar '16, 17, but we are at 99% capacity in that. So that asset is running 7 days a week, round the clock. We have 2 assets that exist. We have 1 in Kentucky, and we have another 1 in Michigan. We'll be adding to the one in Michigan, so that is probably the single tightest one we have. If I across our castings: We will need eventually, as we move into the back half of calendar '16, we will need more DS single crystal furnaces to support the load we have. Structural castings, I think we're in good shape. It's just people. And then Forged Products, except for the atomizer, I think we're in good shape from there.

If I look at Q1 overall, I think that investment cast delivered a very solid performance in the quarter. I think they're focused on the right thing in supporting the customer in their ramp-up as the customer schedules dictate. I think the actions we took in Q4 for Forged Products has established a much better footing to take on the challenging oil and gas environment. I think the team is extremely focused on attacking all opportunities they have. And that's driving cost out, capitalizing on what they can do inside their factories and certainly positioning them to respond very well to very competitive pressures that are out there in the marketplace today. Airframe Products, in my opinion, got off to a slower start, with a substantial development load as we moved through the quarter, primarily driven by 2 things. We had a large number of first historicals [ph] we had to move through the factory and get to our customer to support the share that we have won and have to move into production in the back half of this year. And we also had a very short-cycle development program that we required to support a key customer development schedule. Both of these really bottlenecked a number of our machining assets. Shawn will go into more detail as she moves through the airframe segment.
If I look at our cash deployment. I think there's a very balanced approach in Q1. We repurchased roughly $232 million of stock, as well as we closed, in the quarter, $266 million of acquisitions. You've seen that we recently announced post-Q1 2 other acquisitions: Composites Horizons and Noranco, and I will cover these in more details, both of these, as we move later through the presentation.
So with that, I'll turn it over to Shawn."
297850,306773304,840886,"Precision Castparts Corp., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2015",2015-07-28,"Earnings Calls","Precision Castparts Corp.","Executives","Thanks, Mark.I'll now review our consolidated first quarter results, starting with Slide 4.Sales were down 4% to $2.4 billion, which reflects a sharp decline in oil and gas sales that more than offset low single-digit improvements in our large commerc",1393,"Thanks, Mark.
I'll now review our consolidated first quarter results, starting with Slide 4.
Sales were down 4% to $2.4 billion, which reflects a sharp decline in oil and gas sales that more than offset low single-digit improvements in our large commercial aerospace demand. Consolidated segment operating income decreased 16% to $619 million, reducing operating margins by 350 basis points year-over-year to 25.7%. Earnings per share fell to $2.87 versus $3.32 in the prior year, driven primarily by end-market mix and volume challenges in our Forged Products segment.
Aerospace sales were down 1%, but large commercial sales were higher by 3%, reflecting our position on growth programs and stronger content wins throughout our portfolio. Power sales were down 17%, driven entirely by the 38% decline in Oil and Gas and Other. IGT sales were higher by 3% overall, reflecting the strength of our position on the latest generation of turbines.
Currency was a $53 million negative impact to sales, resulting in a corresponding $11 million headwind for operating income, with most of the impact felt in our Forged Products and Airframe Products segments. Total organic sales were down 2% year-over-year on a constant currency basis but were higher by 1% when you exclude the sharp decline in demand in the oil and gas end markets.
Moving to Slide 5 and Investment Cast Products. Sales were up 1% to $632 million with continued growth in aerospace, including 6% higher large commercial aerospace demand, while regional and business jet sales were stable and military demand had double-digit declines. In Power, IGT sales were up 4% as the segment benefited from its strong position on the newest high-efficiency turbines.
Investment Cast Products operating income was up 6% to $237 million with 170 basis points of margin expansion to 37.5%. The higher earnings quality reflects Investment Cast Products' efficient leverage of volume across its assets. From an end-market perspective, the segment remains well positioned to benefit from a continued rollout of high-efficiency gas turbines as well as the ramp in next-generation aerospace engines. The acquisition of Composites Horizons, which Mark will discuss in a moment, will allow us to offer high-temperature engine solutions across a broad range of materials.
Moving to Slide 6 and Forged Products. Sales were down 8% to $1 billion primarily due to the continued weakness in oil and gas end markets. The stronger dollar also created a roughly 2% or $22 million drag on Forged Products' revenue growth rate.
In Aerospace sales -- in Aerospace, excuse me, sales were down 1%, with 5% growth in large commercial aerospace sales offset by moderate declines in regional and business jet sales and double-digit declines in military demand, as that end market had challenging year-over-year comparisons. In Power, sales were down 33%, with IGT stable and oil and gas much softer, as we're not seeing any signs of improving demand trend in that market yet.
Forged Products' operating income was down 34% to $204 million, reflecting mainly end-market mix dynamics and weaker volume in the oil and gas area. As compared to Q4 '15, the segment performed at a much improved level, demonstrating $11 million of EBIT growth on $66 million lower sales. The businesses most impacted by the oil and gas declines have used the downturn to drive efficiency into their operations. And these steps create a business better equipped to manage through the current demand challenges. We believe that we've taken the appropriate steps to rightsize the segment and do expect continued performance gains as we progress through fiscal 2016.
Moving to Slide 7 and Airframe Products. Sales were down 3% to $779 million. The stronger dollar did create a 3% or $24 million drag on airframe's revenue growth rates and had a $5 million negative impact on operating income.
Aerospace sales were down 2%, with large commercial and regional and business jet demand stable, while military demand declined at a double-digit pace. Commercial aerospace sales experienced headwinds in Q1 from timing of fastener demand and from the impact of new product development in our Aerostructures operations. In fasteners, we saw several of our facilities impacted by demand timing associated with the expansion of our customer supply chains management initiatives. We expect this dynamic to resolve itself within the fiscal year.
Regarding Aerostructures, we've been very successful winning new positions, but the ramp of that new work did create some disruptions in our operations and constrained activity in other areas. We expect to see improved performance as we move through fiscal 2016. General industrial sales, which represent only about 10% of the segment's total sales, were down mid-teens, due to declines in automotive and construction end markets, mainly internationally.
Airframe Products operating margin income was down 10% to $218 million, impacted by the factors I just described, but we do expect operating margins to improve as we progress throughout the year. Airframe Products is well positioned with a line of sight to effectively leverage the expected volume growth this fiscal year. The recently announced Noranco acquisition, which Mark will cover in a minute, complements our product offering and further expands our ability to support the breadth of our customer requirements.
Turning now to Slide 8 and our first quarter balance sheet.
We increased our cash position to just over $1 billion in Q1, reflecting the net impact of our deployment actions, including the $2 billion bond issuance, and our own internal cash generation. Our capital deployment actions were balanced in Q1 with capital expenditures of $94 million, which we expect to build as we progress through the year; $266 million for 2 tuck-in acquisitions; and $232 million for share repurchase. We also issued $2 billion in attractively priced long-term bonds during the quarter with a weighted average rate of 3.29%. As a result, we are updating our fiscal '16 interest expense outlook to $120 million versus the $70 million that was previously discussed.
Moving to Slide 9, I will cover FY '16 guidance.
Our original view on fiscal '16 is intact, with the sole exception of the interest expense increase that I just discussed. Reflecting this change, we now see our fiscal '16 EPS to be in the range of $12.25 to $13.25 versus the original forecasted range of $12.50 to $13.40. We will update our views for the Composites Horizons and Noranco transactions once they're closed, which we expect in Q2 '16 and Q3, respectively.
I apologize. Let me -- I misread here. It's in the range of $3.25 (sic) [$12.25] to $13.15 versus our original forecast of $12.50 to $13.40. I want to make that clear.
Moving to Slide 10. Our view for our aerospace markets is also intact. Commercial aerospace demand played out in Q1 as we expected, and we believe that the balance of the year can see a slightly higher growth rate versus the 3% that we achieved in Q1. With the slow starts experienced in regional and business jets and military demand in the first quarter, we will be closely monitoring these markets to assess our prospects in fiscal '16. At this time, we do still see a path to achieve our indicated growth rates.
On Slide 11. Q1's activity confirmed our fiscal '16 views for our power and general industrial markets as well.
Moving to Slide 12. Our view on the segments is intact. However, we do anticipate Airframe Products revenue growth more likely to land in the lower end of the indicated performance ranges, with an incremental margin around 40%. This reflects the demand timing and new program development work dynamics that influenced the first quarter's performance. The airframe team remains solidly focused on delivering to our customer's demand in a cost-effective manner.
Forged Products' performance in Q1 affirms our view for the year, and we expect to continue to see the segment's operating margins expand sequentially at a modest pace from the level achieved this quarter. Considering the oil- and gas-centered demand challenges faced by the segment, the first quarter's performance was a good start for fiscal '16. As a reminder, Forged Products will undergo normal seasonal maintenance in Q2. And as we indicated last quarter, we have a key asset in the U.K. that will undergo extended maintenance activities.
Investment cast's strong performance in the first quarter affirms our view for FY '16 as well.
With that, I'll turn it back to you, Mark."

This is a technology that we have been very focused on trying to add to our portfolio, really over the last couple of yea",518,"Thanks, Shawn.
So what I'd like to do now is take a closer look at the recently announced acquisitions.
First, Composites Horizons. This is a technology that we have been very focused on trying to add to our portfolio, really over the last couple of years. We wanted to make sure, as we always have, that we continued to look for solutions and be able to provide for our customer as their need continues to expand. I don't care if that's been shapes or capabilities. In this case, it's moving beyond metallics. We always want to make sure we can provide the answer.
The next-generation engines has had a growing demand for composite components, as they drive for higher operating temperatures, looking for more complex flow path shapes. You can get a lot more configuration in a composite than you can in metallic. And they're always searching for higher strength-to-weight ratios. As we always have when we look at these, moving in these different technologies, we look for assets that have a very strong technical capability, so we're building off of an extremely solid base. CHI has the expertise in both carbon and ceramic matrix components. They already have established, good, solid relationships with long-term contracts with the major OEMs, and they have good content on the next-generation commercial programs. We expect to close CHI very shortly.
Noranco continues to expand our march into Aerostructures. They, again, provide high-precision machining in airframe applications, but equally as important for us is also the ability to do complex landing gear as well as aero-engine components. So they continue to expand our capabilities. They are a fully integrated supplier, going from machining through fabrication, processing, assembly and tests. They also will provide us the opportunity to integrate some of our other operations, whether it's castings, forgings or fasteners. And as always, in this machining side of these operations, it allows us to capture another very valuable revert stream that we can feed into our melt shops.
Noranco has a very solid management team, that I feel we'll be able to integrate rapidly our operating systems and the mentality and spread their capability and grow well beyond where they are today. So with that, we expect to close that in Q3 of fiscal year '16.
So again, in summary, I think Investment Cast Products delivered solid results. I think they are focused in attacking the right elements of their business. Forged Products, I think the actions that we have taken have certainly given us a stable base to build off of and have allowed us to compete in a very tough market; which exists right now. Airframe Products, in the quarter, we did digest a significant amount of new work. And as we move through the balance of this year, I think we'll strike a much better balance between production and development. And Q1 was, again, a very balanced approach in our cast deployment. And as we just said, since then, we've also announced and will add 2 additional strategic fits: CHI and Noranco.
So with that, we'll open up to questions."

And the items I highlighted with regard to Airframe Products, with the issue of getting the development load out and some of that fastener [ph] demand timing, that also created some increase in inventory. That was about 1/3 of the total increase for the quarter between those 2 items. If you look, we also benefited from deflation in the quarter, especially within our Forged Products segment. And so you'll see the LIFO reserve increase there, based on that performance improvement off the Q4 levels. We had some impact from currency, as foreign exchange got a little stronger on some of our balance sheets internationally. And we also had the 2 tuck-in acquisitions that added some inventory for the quarter. That being said, though, we still believe that there's a great deal of opportunity to drive inventory out. And we've got ourselves focused on that with a lot of internal metrics that are measuring that and driving to push inventories down."

So they're more involved in the movement of air or direction of air. So as we thought about kind of the ceramics world and -- what we're looking for is -- we were not searching for a -- something that you and I can go do in our garage. We were looking for something that had strong technical capabilities additive to what we do. A lot of what they do is replacement for sheet metal and sheet metal fabrication, where they're able to get a component in there that's got a lot more heat capability but also gives a shape that we typically can't get out of a casting. That's why you get a lot of this as replacing some sort of sheet metal -- where they can get more work into it. So right now, what we're looking for is kind of being able to supply an answer to our customers that is more -- it's additive to what we're currently doing. The thing I like about CHI is that it has the capability and already has the technology in this. They've been at this now for well over 10 years, in these complex shapes. So they've been able to get embedded in the new generation. They already have that -- the capability and the contracts on it. And it's additive to what our current positions would be. So it's not as though we're -- what there are in those programs is something taking away from us. It's incremental to us as we move into the next generation. Now I could also see us, at some point in time, moving sideways, but again we're going to be very surgical in what it is we're going after. And I think this just really fit the bill.

But the consumption is certainly -- it's something we have a line of sight to. And that's what we're seeing as we move through the balance of the year -- it certainly comes back to a more normal level. If I look at the other side of the equation, which is the development load. We had a number. If you kind of go on to the back half of this year, we have to support the contracts that we've already won. We had to get -- obviously, we have to get the development, get approved and get it into our customers' hands so we'll be prepared to support the volume. And it was a ""in the thousands of part numbers"" type of thing, so it's not a small number that we had to do. We just had to bite the bullet and get those in so we can get them behind us. And then we had a very demanding short-cycle development program that we had to take -- in one particular asset -- we had to take almost 35% to 40% of the capability of that in terms of spindle time and dedicate it to get the product through our shop, into our customers' hands so they could make the development time frame they had to do. So what it really did is it kind of bottlenecked a lot of the assets from putting through already approved production to make sure we were prepared. And it was a big bite away to take this quarter. I think what you see, as we move through the balance of the year, it comes back into a much better balance in terms of how we'll digest the remaining work and then move it through along with production."

But let me try the best I can to kind of piece my way through that. If I look at what the  -- let me just start it operationally because that's kind of the drumbeat of everything we do. And if you look at where they are operationally, I think that -- again, I think we rightsized ourselves appropriately. I think we took the remaining resources we have. We got them properly balanced between whatever we have to make sure we're doing in development, and we certainly have a very, very focused attack on cost. And I think that, if you look at what we do when we see markets roll over, we really direct our resources appropriately. So if I look from a cost-takeout standpoint, I think this team has got the ability to drive at those costs in a very steady manner. So I don't think that last quarter was one-off. It was a baseline of which to move off, forward. If you move into the maintenance side of the equation, Jay kind of gave you what that -- so you'll have the improvement that's out there from a cost standpoint, but then you'll have that number in. What you're looking at that makes up that number Jay gave was you're looking at probably an average, again, we normally run that 1.5 weeks - 2 weeks of just overall general maintenance, we take a lot of shutdowns during that period of time. And then we do have the extended outage in the U.K. operation that we've actually been ordering the parts for almost 2 years now to get in and do that. So again, I think you get the costs on one side that's improving, but you're going to have the -- this headwind coming from the normal Q2, plus the major outage. I'd say that, from a competitive -- yes, it's very competitive. It's also I think we've done a -- we've got a good understanding now of some product lines that I think our metal assets do very well with. And we've identified that as kind of the market to go after. And we've probably shied away from some of the more -- I don't want to call it commodity because nothing in this nickel world is commodity but certainly where there is more competitive pressures. So I think we're finding the right utilization of our assets and maybe staying out of some of the fray that may be going on. So yes, the pricing is competitive, but we are finding some ability now to get better -- it's not where it was, obviously. It's not going to be where -- until the market kind of recovers, and the demand -- the big projects start coming back in. But I think we're finding the right spot to go compete effectively. And so I guess it's a long way of saying all in. I think we got the cost model that's coming in. I feel good about what this team has kind of -- we took it on the chin. They made the hard calls in Q4. I think we saw not only stabilization but improvement coming in, in Q1. We're going to come into Q2 with the outages to offset that. And I think we're finding some of the right spots to go compete at, but it's going to be a competitive marketplace. But I think we're positioned very well for it."

And I think that, as you and others think about Airframe, you may find that Q1 provides a different starting point than what you expect. And that is not a business that's going to perfectly snap back in the second quarter. So I think we have -- we do have a different starting point. And we reflected that in our discussion with you about fiscal '16, where we said that we think they will more likely come in at the lower end of our previously discussed revenue growth and incremental margin range. So I think those are the pieces to contemplate, as well as the full quarter of the interest expense where we've talked. I think, in the slides, we talked about a $33 million per quarter load from that new debt issue, and that's net of CP. That would have been paid down obviously at a much lower rate. So I think those are the pieces that you need to put in the mix for the second quarter, and a number of those carry into the back half as well, to varying degrees."

Most -- there is -- I want to make it abundantly clear, there is deflation built in that we have to overcome, as there is in every single solitary year and quarter. So kind of, as you've seen the progression, there is deflation that's built in there. We just have to have cost plans that are in place that are equal to or greater than whatever we're doing from a deflationary standpoint. So is it exact every single solitary quarter? No, there's gives and takes as we hire people to whatever it is, but I'd say, as a general rule, there's nothing there that's kind of out of the ordinary. And there's still opportunity to us that, whatever deflation, we have to get, so I'd say that they should be able to continue to progress over time."

So that is, I think, as we have -- we go through -- we've kind of gone through, I'll call it, a learning process in the fourth -- in the first quarter about what went well and what didn't, we are able to onboard subsequent work in a much more efficient fashion. And so I think, from here, it is reasonable to expect that, again, that reported margin does move higher. I think, listen, the -- we're 90 days in, Myles, on the year, and so we'll have obviously more to say as we reflect on future performance and what we see from the end markets. Forged had a good start relative to the demand dynamics that were in front of them on oil and gas and where that exited from Q4. So there are a number of moving pieces. I think, for -- we called out Airframe because it was clear that we'd -- it was kind of an exceptionally slow start. And so we'll..."

I don't want to call them onetime tasks, but there certainly were costs that we incurred in Q1 that we had to incur that may -- that were not efficiencies. So there was, to some degree, a -- I don't want to call it artificial because it was what it was, but when you move some of that through -- when you block a large number of assets that are not moving through production, you're not nearly as efficient. That -- so that goes aside. Now we still have more to do as we move into Q2, but it's not going to be at the rate at which we did in Q1. So there was a lot of headwind that we self -- we did them -- we did it. We did it at our direction. We took it. We bit the bullet, but it's not as though there -- we're looking for some magic wand to go get. We took costs squarely on the chop in Q1."
