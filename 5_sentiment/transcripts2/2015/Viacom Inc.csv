Thanks for joining us to discuss the first quarter of our 2015 fiscal year. Viacom once again, had a solid quarter.

Thanks for joining us to discuss the first quarter of our 2015 fiscal year. Viacom once again, had a solid quarter. We drove revenue growth across our business and continued to evolve and adapt to meet the opportunities of an increasingly digital and multi-platform landscape. We also maintained our strong balance sheet, while continuing to return capital to our shareholders. Let's take a quick look at our first quarter financial performance.
Revenues increased 5% to $3.34 billion due to growth across the board, all of our major drivers affiliate fees, advertising, theatrical distribution and home entertainment, so increases in the quarter. Adjusted operating income was flat for the quarter at $959 million. Adjusted net earnings were $538 million, and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased to 8% to $1.29, the highest ever for a December quarter.  These results are a reflection of our commitment to produce great multi-platform content while efficiently and effectively managing our operations. This commitment has been fundamental to our success and will drive our growth in the future.
It is no secret that there are far-reaching shifts taking place in our industry. As the industry evolves, it is more important than ever to focus on Viacom's significant strengths. Viacom has an unmatched portfolio of iconic and a powerful brands and is a leading creator of a content that drives the industry ecosystem. Viacom's current distribution partnerships are strong, with most extending well into the future and the ranks of new entrants are increasing rapidly.
Viacom's global footprint is broad and growing. Viacom is leading the rapid evolution to new measurement and monetization models that will unlock significant value for us, in particular.
We produce distinct, high-end video for screens of all sizes, content that drives greater customer engagements and is highly valued by advertisers. We invest billions in original programming year-in and year out. Included in our program for this year in the U.S. alone are well over 200 freshly produced series and events. 
Turning back to the results, worldwide Media Networks revenues increased 4%, with a 6% increase in affiliate revenues. Domestic affiliate fees rose 8%, consistent with our annualized guidance of high single to low double-digit increases going forward.
While we have recently seen a lot of posturing and positioning in affiliate negotiations across our industry, Viacom's distribution pipeline of has never been stronger. We have a long-term carriage agreements with every major distributor who is committed to a vibrant video business in most of the emerging players, including Google and Sony. 
We deliver great value to our partners, and we are committed to helping them grow. Compared to other programming groups, Viacom networks are the leader, #1 in viewers 18 to 34 and viewers 18-49 based on needs of Nostrand measurement, and we believe they account for an even greater proportion of non-Nielsen-measured digital consumption. As I've previously said, 70% of our subscriber base is covered by deals extending to 2018 and beyond, giving us a significant visibility well into the future.
As I mentioned on our last call, in the first quarter, we successfully concluded carriage agreements with Verizon and Frontier Communications and we are currently in productive discussions on other renewal deals. We are also pleased that we renewed our affiliate agreement with additional for in networks in Mexico. That deal includes the launch on --  of the Paramount channel next month, the 2.2 million subscribers bring in Paramount Channels total distribution in Latin America this early stage to 20 million subscribers.
We are also adding networks around the world, particularly in high-growth markets like India, Latin America and Africa but also in the U.K., Continental Europe and other parts of Asia. Our International business is growing rapidly and is very profitable, not some day but today. New digital entrants are providing expansion opportunities as well as sparking industry-wide innovation. 
In the first quarter, we renewed and expanded our agreement with Google. This month, FX signed a multi-year year in your renewal with Amazon, and we are looking forward to the launch of Sony's digital service in the coming months.
We are looking to tomorrow and the promise of innovation, bringing our program its audiences where they want it, including mobile. Yesterday, for example, we added 24 Viacom networks to Verizon's FiOS mobile app, which brings TV Everywhere functionality to FiOS TV. Also, in March, our Nickelodeon group will launch a new direct-to-consumer subscription service. We believe this innovative service which will have a distinct brand and will target the fast-growing mobile market will be very attractive for parents and children. Nickelodeon will provide more details and announce the brand name at its Upfront presentation next month.
Turning to advertising. Viacom's revenues grew 3% in the quarter. Domestic ad sales and at our Media Networks declined 6% compared to last year, due primarily to lower C3 ratings. This was the first full quarter results for Channel 5, which drove a 60% increase in international ad revenues.
Industry-wide declines in ratings are generating debate about ways to close the gap between currently accepted ratings and actual consumption. It is an important secular issue. Inadequate measurement, undermines innovation and disproportionately impacts of those leading programmers like us, who effectively provide the multi-platform experiences that the viewer's demand. While it is currently a reality of our business, at Viacom, we are not waiting for change.  We are working with other major parties in the advertising ecosystem, bringing together data scientists and industry experts whether at Nielsen or elsewhere, to create new measurement and monetization tools. As an example, we are in specific discussions with several media agencies to enhance our capabilities to target and plan campaigns with even more precise and comprehensive measurement. To get there, we're bringing together data on engagement and behavior from a range of sources, including set-top boxes, smart TVs and other digital devices. We're confident that these new tools will allow us to distribute video in a more strategic way, unlocking significant revenue potential.  These opportunities are not limited to the U.S. market. 
In tests in Norway, we have found that 12 to 24 ratings on MTV increase in the low teen percentages when viewing on other devices is measured. In general, we continue to develop ways to convert reach to revenue and monetize non-Nielsen measured viewership as we grow this category from 30% of total ad sales to 50% in the next 3 years.
Earlier this week, Snap Chat launched its Discover platform which include COMEDY CENTRAL and MTV international. Snap Chat has 100 million global active users, most of whom are in the demographic sweet spot for Viacom. This is another example of our non-Nielsen AutoVISION strategy, enabled by the rich native content of our brands and resonates on social platforms and drives hundreds of millions of video streams and even more engagements per month. This is a meaningful expansion of our monetization opportunities, adding Snap Chat to relationships with Twitter and Tumblr, among others.
These key attributes and initiatives, as well as the creative spirit that drives our company, are what give us great confidence as we manage through this transition. We are rapidly adopting our processes and businesses as well as human, financial and technological resources to increase focus on new high potential areas. We have teams dedicated to content creation with a focus on more and better original programming that monetizes on all screens, dedicated on expansion and innovation and emerging mobile platforms; dedicated to the rapid rollout of innovative, integrated marketing and audience data capabilities; dedicated to building a thriving television studio at Paramount; dedicated to rolling out new brands in international markets with high growth potential; and much more.  It is clear that this transition will require some organizational realignment as well as rationalization of content that no longer meets our goals. We have identified specific areas where we can work more efficiently while focusing better on the evolving needs of our customers and audiences. These changes are well underway and will result in substantial net cost savings throughout our organization while at the same time, increasing our focus and investment in areas with the highest growth potential.  We expect to have more news about these ongoing efforts in the months ahead.
In addition, we continue to supplement our organic growth with disciplined strategic expansion. Following our successful acquisition of Channel 5 in the U.K., we are looking at targeted investments that will press our advantage in key areas. We have concluded an agreement to acquire 5 regional television channels in India which we will own, along with our existing partner in India Network18, and shortly expect to receive our final regulatory approvals. We are also negotiating another acquisition that would add to our scale in an important part of our business. Together, these 2 acquisitions involve about $400 million.  Taking advantage of this compelling opportunities does not detract from our steadfast long-term commitment to returning capital to our shareholders while we grow our business. 
Through stock repurchases and dividends, Viacom returned almost $900 million to shareholders in the quarter. In addition, we continue to effectively manage our debt, successfully accessing the markets for $1 [PH] billion at very attractive rates. We are on track to buy $750 million of our stock in this quarter.  We expect to decrease the pace of our buyback for the second half of the year to stay at or below our leverage ratio target of 3.0. We will provide an update on our next earnings call.
Now let's talk briefly about our divisions. While the industry measurement issues continue to cause concern, Nickelodeon closed the calendar year as the top basic cable network with kids and total viewers. Nick is premiering more new content than ever, meeting the demands of kid audience on to say is that are craving more new episodes and fewer repeats. In the quarter, the sneak preview TV-movie of Nickelodeon's new series, 100 Things to do Before High School, racked #1 in its time period across all television and drove double-digit gains with key demos. This gives us great confidence when the series kicks off with new episodes in April. The movie also premiered in the strong greatest, starring is adopted television telecast for the week. 
Nickelodeon's tentpole shows also continued to be a force. The reimagined 2014 Nickelodeon HALO Awards captured the show's biggest audience ever with kids, tweens and total viewers, and was the #1 TV telecast for The Night with Kids. Coming up, the mega Tentpole Kids' Choice Awards will air in March, followed by the second annual Kids' Choice Sports Awards this summer.
Additionally, in early December, we launched the Nick Jr. app, which quickly topped the ranks in the U.S. iTunes App Store, and was selected as the Editor's Choice and Apple's spotlight on the best apps of 2014. Looking ahead, Nickelodeon will air more than 150 new episodes and specials in the second quarter with a focus on adapting to their viewer's changing taste. We have already found success with Bella and the Bulldogs which drew 40% more viewers than our previous live-action launches.
And of course, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles just become a dominant video, movie and consumer product brand, wrapped up a very strong Christmas season as the #1 selling in the country for calendar 2014 according to NPD group. 
Comedy Central also has more original programming in the current quarter with new seasons of returning series such as Workaholics, Broad City and Crawl Show. Of course The biggest news has been the successful launch of The Nightly Show with Larry Wilmore, which carries on COMEDY CENTRAL's tradition of innovating in Late Night and has already joined The Daily Show with Jon Stewart and is taking out a prime position in the cultural discourse.
And speaking of discourse, coming soon, we'll be shooting and airing the COMEDY CENTRAL roast of Justin Bieber. Mark your calendars, you won't want to miss it.
On SPIKE, we will be bringing fans the pop hit and viral phenomenon Lip-synch BATTLE hosted by LL Cool J, which will premiere in April. On each episode, celebrities will go head-to-head in an outrageous lip-synch contest. 
MTV also remains strong in resident with its audience, placing Awkward and Faking It among the top 15 cable series in the quarter in the 12-34 demo. Through Always On, MTV builds a real-time conversation on all of their platforms on air, online, mobile and social, in a way that no other brand can. In fact, MTV has doubled its unique digital visitors over the past year to a total of nearly 50 million in December.
In the second quarter, MTV premiered its new scripted thriller Eye Candy, and is launching broadcast game show next month and funny edgy show, with Man on the Street that are perfect for digital sharing. MTV also returns several successful series in the second quarter, including Catfish, The Challenge, Teen Mom and Ridiculousness.
We are also focusing on several high-quality big event programs across our networks, and I'd like to update you on 2 of those. Next month, BET will launch its first-ever event miniseries, the Book of, a 6-part historical drama. The television event will run over the course of 3 consecutive nights in February. SPIKE is also in production on the epic series Tad, featuring sir, Ben Kingsley about the boy king who ruled Egypt during the 18th Dynasty.
Moving to our newest brand, I'm proud to say that the integration of Channel 5 with our International Operations is going extremely well and performance is quickly improved during this transition. Channel 5 is the only major free-to-air U.K. commercial network to grow share in 2014. And this December, Channel 5 had its best Christmas week ratings in 7 years.
And 2015 has started with a bang. Celebrity Big Brother launched with an audience of 3.6 million in early January, and the reality series delivered its highest ever weekend ratings later that month. In addition, Channel 5 in MTV UK's first major Joint Commission, 10,000 BC, will begin airing on both channels in February.
Paramount's first quarter started with the previous One Left Off, building on the theatrical success of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles which pulled in more than $477 million at the global box office. We acquired the in 2009 for $60 million, and the brand has already generated more than $2.5 billion at retail, consumer products, movie tickets and home entertainment. Our miniature new release in the quarter, Interstellar, was one of the year's most talked about films and a box office success with box office to date of more than $660 million. 
Paramount Pictures started the current quarter with a wide release of another movie that we're all very proud of, nominated for best picture Oscar, Selma brings to life an important part of our history. Of course, we are all looking forward to next week's release of the SpongeBob movie, Sponge Out of Water. The first title from Paramount Animation is taking one of the world's most iconic characters to a place both literally and figuratively, he has never been before. And just announced this week, Paramount has moved up the opening of proven franchise, Mission: Impossible V, to the end of July 2015.
Nickelodeon and Paramount are also close to completing Paramount's first television production this year with School of Rock which is set to air on Nickelodeon in the fiscal fourth quarter. 
To conclude, we are pleased with our powerful position, particularly in this changing industry landscape. Viacom is dealing head-on with industry challenges, and we are positioning our operations for success. We continue to be optimistic about the growth opportunities for our brands and the video content we produce, not only here in the U.S. but particularly, in international markets where we see significant upside.
Viacom has the assets, the commitment, the people and the creative culture to succeed. We are innovating to my investing and unleashing our human and financial capital to take full advantage of these exciting opportunities, all of which puts us in an excellent position to continue to deliver outstanding content, deeper audience connections and greater returns for our shareholders.
Thank you, and now I'll turn it over to Wade."

At ou",582,"Thanks, Philippe. Before I take you to our operating results, I want to note that our earnings release and web presentation summarizing the results for our December quarter are available on our website.
Now let's take a look at our segment results. At our Media Networks segment, revenues in the quarter were up 4% compared with the prior year. Domestic revenues were up slightly, while international revenues grew 25%. Foreign currency headwinds had a 6-percentage-point negative impact on international revenues.
Channel 5 contributed to 5 percentage points of revenue growth in the quarter.  Page 10 of our web deck provides a breakdown of our Media Networks' revenue performance.
In terms of advertising, worldwide revenues were up 3% in the quarter. Domestic revenues were down 6%, and international revenues increased 60%. The growth in international advertising revenues reflects the acquisition of Channel 5, as well as continued growth in the European marketplace. Foreign exchange losses had a 7-percentage-point impact on the international advertising growth and a 1-percentage-point impact on worldwide advertising growth.
In terms of affiliate revenues, domestic revenues were up 8% year-over-year while international revenues declined 2%. Foreign exchange had a 7-percentage-point unfavorable impact on international revenue growth and a 1-percentage-point unfavorable impact on worldwide affiliate revenue growth.
Excluding the impact from the timing of product available under certain distribution agreements, domestic affiliate revenues grew high single digits in the quarter. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, the growth in international affiliate revenues was due to new channel launches, increases in subscribers, higher rates as well as the timing of products available under certain distribution agreements.
Expenses increased 9% in the quarter. Within operating expenses, programming expense grew 15% while distribution and other expenses increased 7%. SG&A expense was flat in the quarter.
Excluding the impact of Channel 5, programming expense increased 6%, while both distribution and other expenses and SG&A expense declined. The decrease in SG&A expense was driven by lower incentive-based compensation.
Media Networks' adjusted operating income was down 1%, while the adjusted operating income margin declined to 42%. Channel 5 contributed about 3 percentage points of operating income growth in the quarter. The margin decline was driven by the 9% growth in expenses, which partially offset by top line revenue growth of 4%.
Moving to Filmed Entertainment. Filmed Entertainment revenues were up 6% in the quarter, principally due to growth in Home Entertainment revenues. Page 12 of the web presentation provides a breakdown of Filmed Entertainment revenues. 
Theatrical revenues increased 6%, primarily driven by the carryover revenues from Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles which were partially offset by lower revenues from the current quarter releases.
Home Entertainment revenues grew 16% in the quarter. The increase reflects the performance of the current quarter releases of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Hercules, while there were no titles released in the December quarter of last year.
Licensed fees declined 9% in the quarter due to the mix of available titles. Filmed Entertainment generated an adjusted operating loss of $60 million in the quarter as compared to a loss of $74 million last year.
Now moving beyond the segment results. Other items reflects a loss of $18 million due to foreign exchange losses. In terms of taxes, the adjusted effective tax rate was 32.3%, reflecting a 120-basis-point improvement as compared to prior year. The reduction in the adjusted effective tax rate was principally driven by the mix of domestic and international profitability.
And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Tom."

I'm going to talk about our cash flow, our debt and our return of capital to our shareholders. I'll also cover seasonal factors impacting our 2015 fiscal year.For the quarter, we generated $57 million in free cash flow compared to $278 mil",854,"Thanks, Wade. I'm going to talk about our cash flow, our debt and our return of capital to our shareholders. I'll also cover seasonal factors impacting our 2015 fiscal year.
For the quarter, we generated $57 million in free cash flow compared to $278 million last year. Page 5 of the web deck presentation provides the components of free cash flow. The decline in free cash flow in the quarter was principally due to higher working capital utilization. Working capital was negatively impacted primarily by production spending for our upcoming film releases, including Terminator: Genesis.
Now moving to our debt. And the remains principally fixed rate, with an average cost at quarter end of 4.5%. During the quarter, we took advantage of favorable market conditions and issued $1 billion of senior notes and debentures in a combination of 5- and 20-year maturities. Part of the issuance proceeds will be used to repay the $600 million of outstanding of our 1.25% senior notes that comes due in February.  The new debt was issued at an average rate of 4%.
In terms of our short-term funding. To the extent, we have incremental borrowings, we are funding this in the Commercial segment paper market place at an annual rate of approximately 35 basis points. At quarter end, we had no variable rate borrowings.
In terms of our leverage. We ended the quarter with $13.8 billion of debt and capital leases outstanding. We had a $1.2 billion of cash and cash equivalents. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 3.2x. Taking into consideration, the February repayment of the $600 million of our senior notes, our leverage ratio is close to 3x which is within our targeted range.  At December 31, our $2.5 billion bank revolver was undrawn.
During the quarter, we continue to return capital to our shareholders. Between our buyback and dividend programs, we returned a total of $887 million of capital back to our shareholders, and we ended the quarter with 407 million shares outstanding. 
For the March quarter, we are on pace to purchase approximately $750 million of our stock, which means that for the first 6 months of the year, we will have returned a total of approximately $1.8 billion to our shareholders.
Now let's turn to some of the factors impacting the remainder of our fiscal year. In terms of affiliate revenue, we continue to see annual growth in the high single-digit to low double-digit range. 
Quarterly affiliate revenue will fluctuate given the timing of transactions and the recognition of revenue related to certain distribution agreements which are tied to product availability. For the March quarter, we anticipate that affiliate revenues will grow mid-single-digit as compared to the prior year.  For the full year, we expect that the organic growth rates for Media Networks programming expense will be in the mid-single digits. However, reported programming expense will grow in the mid-teens, factoring in the acquisition of Channel 5.  In terms of non-programming expense, we will continue to drive efficiencies throughout the organization in order to preserve our margins.
In Filmed Entertainment, we are excited about our upcoming slate, which includes SpongeBob, Terminator: Genisys and Mission: Impossible V. We continue to expect growth in profits to be weighted to the back half of the fiscal year as the studio benefits from its summer theatrical releases as well as the availability of titles in the pay-TV and home entertainment marketplaces.
For 2015, we are now forecasting a book tax rate of 32.3%. We will continue to refine this as we go through the year and get a better sense of the domestic-versus-international profitability mix.
Looking ahead at Paramount's production and development pipeline. The studio is currently in production on Paranormal Activity, The Ghost Dimension and Daddy's Home, which stars Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg. They will begin production shortly on Ben Her, which is a coproduction with MGM; The Ring 3 and a comedy, which stars Tina Fey that is being produced by Lorne Michaels. The studio is in development on a number of projects, including sequels to Star Trek, World War Z, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and G.I. Joe. 
In terms of TV production, Paramount continues to make great progress, having sold 5 more projects to bring the total number of projects sold to 11. They currently have an additional 10 projects in development.
In summary, we remain focused on growing our businesses organically and investing in our brands and franchises. While we are experiencing a challenging ratings environment, we are working with our partners to more effectively measure consumption of our content and we are developing ways to monetize viewership where measurement is currently unavailable.  We continue to generate strong growth in affiliate fees, and we'll manage our cost structure and drive greater efficiencies throughout the organization in order to preserve our core margins.  From a capital structure standpoint, we continue to take advantage of the current interest rate environment, locking in long-term financing at very attractive rates. And we'll remain focused on returning excess capital to our shareholders.

We're seeing pricing being, for us anyway, being in the teens, up from upfront pricing. Our issue based on a current Nielsen measurement in the quarter is availability of impressions for us to sell. So we currently look at domestic advertising in this quarter to be an comparable range while reported for the last quarter. And we are looking to improvement in the back half of the year in domestic ad sales performance. With 3 principal drivers: One is that we are with new programming and delivery of -- and better delivery and impressions to increase the number of impressions that we are able to sell; 2, we are looking and working hard to better monetize the impressions that are not being properly monetized; and 3, we are continuing to work very closely with the agencies and our customers the drive value through better integrated marketing efforts. We have unique capabilities in that regard. Use of reach data and engagement the data through Viacom Velocity and Viacom Echo. So as far as the movement toward better monetization of those impressions, we have a number of initiatives. I've described them in my remarks and at the prior call. And when we talk about the proportion of our ad revenues which in the last year were 30% non-Nielsen-dependent and over the next 3 years, we expect that to grow toward the 50% mark, that growth will be driven by monetizing all these impressions that you have on our dot-coms or apps, all the mobile impressions that we will continue to grow very rapidly, including through some of the new services that we will be launching with our telco partners."

Thanks for joining us to discuss the first quarter of our 2015 fiscal year. Viacom, once again, had a solid quarter. We drove revenue growth across our business and continued to evolve and adapt to meet the opportunities of an increasingly digital and multi-platform landscape. We also maintained our strong balance sheet while continuing to return capital to our shareholders. Let's take a quick look at our first quarter financial performance.
Revenues increased 5% to $3.34 billion due to growth across the board. All of our major drivers, affiliate fees, advertising, theatrical distribution and home entertainment, saw increases in the quarter. Adjusted operating income was flat for the quarter at $959 million. Adjusted net earnings were $538 million, and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 8% to $1.29, the highest ever for a December quarter. These results are a reflection of our commitment to produce great multi-platform content while efficiently and effectively managing our operations. This commitment has been fundamental to our success and will drive our growth in the future.
It is no secret that there are far-reaching shifts taking place in our industry. As the industry evolves, it is more important than ever to focus on Viacom's significant strengths. Viacom has an unmatched portfolio of iconic and powerful brands and is a leading creator of the content that drives the industry ecosystem. Viacom's current distribution partnerships are strong, with most extending well into the future, and the ranks of new entrants are increasing rapidly.
Viacom's global footprint is broad and growing. Viacom is leading the rapid evolution to new measurement and monetization models that will unlock significant value for us, in particular.
We produce distinct, high-end video for screens of all sizes, content that drives greater consumer engagements and is highly valued by advertisers. We invest billions in original programming year in and year out. Included in our programming for this year in the U.S. alone are well over 200 freshly produced series and events.
Turning back to the results. Worldwide Media Networks revenues increased 4%, with a 6% increase in affiliate revenues. Domestic affiliate fees rose 8%, consistent with our annualized guidance of high single to low double-digit increases going forward.
While we have recently seen a lot of posturing and positioning in affiliate negotiations across our industry, Viacom's distribution pipeline has never been stronger. We have long-term carriage agreements with every major distributor who is committed to a vibrant video business and most of the emerging players, including Google and Sony.
We deliver great value to our partners, and we are committed to helping them grow. Compared to other programming groups, Viacom networks are the leaders, #1 in viewers 18 to 34 and viewers 18 to 49, based on Nielsen measurement. And we believe they account for an even greater proportion of non-Nielsen-measured digital consumption. As I've previously said, 70% of our subscriber base is covered by deals extending to 2018 and beyond, giving us significant visibility well into the future.
As I mentioned on our last call, in the first quarter, we successfully concluded carriage agreements with Verizon and Frontier Communications, and we are currently in productive discussions on other renewal deals. We are also pleased that we renewed our affiliate agreement with DISH for our networks in Mexico. That deal includes the launch on DISH of the Paramount Channel next month, the 2.2 million subscribers, bringing Paramount Channel's total distribution in Latin America this early stage to 20 million subscribers.
We are also adding networks around the world, particularly in high-growth markets like India, Latin America and Africa but also in the U.K., Continental Europe and other parts of Asia. Our International business is growing rapidly and is very profitable, not someday but today. New digital entrants are providing expansion opportunities as well as sparking industry-wide innovation.
In the first quarter, we renewed and expanded our agreement with Hulu. This month, EPIX signed a multiyear renewal with Amazon, and we are looking forward to the launch of Sony's digital service in the coming months.
We are looking to tomorrow and the promise of innovation, bringing our programming to audiences where they want it, including mobile. Yesterday, for example, we added 24 Viacom networks to Verizon's FiOS mobile app, which brings TV Everywhere functionality to FiOS TV. Also, in March, our Nickelodeon group will launch a new direct-to-consumer subscription service. We believe this innovative service, which will have a distinct brand and will target the fast-growing mobile market, will be very attractive for parents and children. Nickelodeon will provide more details and announce the brand name at its Upfront presentation next month.
Turning to advertising. Viacom's revenues grew 3% in the quarter. Domestic ad sales in our Media Networks declined 6% compared to last year, due primarily to lower C3 ratings. This was the first full quarter results for Channel 5, which drove a 60% increase in international ad revenues.
Industry-wide declines in ratings are generating debate about ways to close the gap between currently accepted ratings and actual consumption. It is an important secular issue. Inadequate measurement undermines innovation and disproportionately impacts those leading programmers like us, who effectively provide the multi-platform experiences that viewers demand. While it is currently a reality of our business, at Viacom, we are not waiting for change.  We are working with other major parties in the advertising ecosystem, bringing together data scientists and industry experts, whether at Nielsen or elsewhere, to create new measurement and monetization tools. As an example, we are in specific discussions with several media agencies to enhance our capabilities to target and plan campaigns with even more precise and comprehensive measurement. To get there, we're bringing together data on engagement and behavior from a range of sources, including set-top boxes, smart TVs and other digital devices. We're confident that these new tools will allow us to distribute video in a more strategic way, unlocking significant revenue potential. These opportunities are not limited to the U.S. market. In tests in Norway, we have found that 12 to 24 ratings on MTV increase in the low-teen percentages when viewing on other devices is measured. In general, we continue to develop ways to convert reach to revenue and monetize non-Nielsen-measured viewership as we grow this category from 30% of total ad sales to 50% in the next 3 years.
Earlier this week, Snapchat launched its Discovery platform, which include Comedy Central and MTV International. Snapchat has 100 million global active users, most of whom are in the demographic sweet spot for Viacom. This is another example of our non-Nielsen-monetization strategy, enabled by the rich, native content of our brands that resonates on social platforms and drives hundreds of millions of video streams and even more engagements per month. This is a meaningful expansion of our monetization opportunities, adding Snapchat to relationships with Twitter and Tumblr, among others.
These key attributes and initiatives as well as the creative spirit that drives our company are what give us great confidence as we manage through this transition. We are rapidly adopting our processes and businesses as well as human, financial and technological resources to increase focus on new high-potential areas. We have teams dedicated to content creation, with a focus on more and better original programming that monetizes on all screens; dedicated to expansion and innovation on emerging mobile platforms; dedicated to the rapid rollout of innovative, integrated marketing and audience data capabilities; dedicated to building a thriving television studio at Paramount; dedicated to rolling out new brands in international markets with high growth potential; and much more.
It is clear that this transition will require some organizational realignment as well as rationalization of content that no longer meets our goals. We have identified specific areas where we can work more efficiently while focusing better on the evolving needs of our customers and audiences. These changes are well underway and will result in substantial net cost savings throughout our organization while at the same time, increasing our focus and investment in areas with the highest growth potential. We expect to have more news about these ongoing efforts in the months ahead.
In addition, we continue to supplement our organic growth with disciplined strategic expansion. Following our successful acquisition of Channel 5 in the U.K., we are looking at targeted investments that will press our advantage in key areas. We have concluded an agreement to acquire 5 regional television channels in India which we will own, along with our existing partner in India, Network18, and shortly expect to receive our final regulatory approvals. We are also negotiating another acquisition that would add to our scale in an important part of our business. Together, these 2 acquisitions involve about $400 million. Taking advantage of this compelling opportunities does not detract from our steadfast, long-term commitment to returning capital to our shareholders while we grow our business.
Through stock repurchases and dividends, Viacom returned almost $900 million to shareholders in the quarter. In addition, we continue to effectively manage our debt, successfully accessing the markets for $1 billion at very attractive rates. We are on track to buy $750 million of our stock in this quarter. We expect to decrease the pace of our buyback for the second half of the year to stay at or below our leverage ratio target of 3.0. We will provide an update on our next earnings call.
Now let's talk briefly about our divisions. While the industry measurement issues continue to cause concern, Nickelodeon closed the calendar year as the top basic cable network with kids and total viewers. Nick is premiering more new content than ever, meeting the demands of kid audiences that are craving more new episodes and fewer repeats. In the quarter, the sneak preview TV-movie of Nickelodeon's new series, 100 Things To Do Before High School, ranked #1 in its time period across all television and drove double-digit gains with key demos. This gives us great confidence when the series kicks off with new episodes in April. The movie, Santa Hunters, also premiered to strong rating, scoring as the top kids television telecast for the week.
Nickelodeon's tentpole shows also continued to be a force. The reimagined 2014 Nickelodeon HALO Awards captured the show's biggest audience ever with kids, tweens and total viewers, and was the #1 TV telecast for the night with kids. Coming up, the mega tentpole Kids' Choice Awards will air in March, followed by the second annual Kids' Choice Sports Awards this summer.
Additionally, in early December, we launched the Nick Jr. app, which quickly topped the ranks in the U.S. iTunes App Store and was selected as the Editor's Choice and Apple's spotlight on the best apps of 2014.
Looking ahead, Nickelodeon will air more than 150 new episodes and specials in the second quarter, with a focus on adapting to their viewers' changing taste. We have already found success with Bella and the Bulldogs, which drew 40% more viewers than our previous live-action launches.
And of course, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, just become a dominant video, movie and consumer product brand, wrapped up a very strong Christmas season as the #1 selling toy in the country for calendar 2014 according to NPD Group.
Comedy Central also has more original programming in the current quarter, with new seasons of returning series such as Workaholics, Broad City and Kroll Show. Of course, the biggest news has been the successful launch of The Nightly Show with Larry Wilmore, which carries on Comedy Central's tradition of innovating in late night and has already joined The Daily Show with Jon Stewart and is taking out a prime position in the cultural discourse.
And speaking of discourse, coming soon, we'll be shooting and airing the Comedy Central roast of Justin Bieber. Mark your calendars, you won't want to miss it.
On SPIKE, we will be bringing fans the pop hit and viral phenomenon, Lip Sync Battle, hosted by LL Cool J, which will premiere in April. On each episode, celebrities will go head-to-head in an outrageous lip sync contest. 
MTV also remains strong and resonant with its audience, placing Awkward and Faking It among the top 15 cable series in the quarter in the 12 to 34 demo. Through Always On, MTV builds a real-time conversation on all of their platforms, on air, online, mobile and social, in a way that no other brand can. In fact, MTV has doubled its unique digital visitors over the past year to a total of nearly 50 million in December.
In the second quarter, MTV premiered its new scripted thriller, Eye Candy, and is launching Broke Ass Game Show next month, a funny, edgy show, with man on the street dares that are perfect for digital sharing. MTV also returns several successful series in the second quarter, including Catfish, The Challenge, Teen Mom and Ridiculousness.
We are also focusing on several high-quality, big-event programs across our networks, and I'd like to update you on 2 of those. Next month, BET will launch its first-ever event miniseries, The Book of Negroes, a 6-part historical drama. The television event will run over the course of 3 consecutive nights in February. SPIKE is also in production on the epic series, Tut, featuring Sir Ben Kingsley, about the boy king who ruled Egypt during the 18th Dynasty.
Moving to our newest brand. I'm proud to say that the integration of Channel 5 with our international operations is going extremely well, and performance has quickly improved during this transition. Channel 5 is the only major free-to-air U.K. commercial network to grow share in 2014. And this December, Channel 5 had its best Christmas week ratings in 7 years.
And 2015 has started with a bang. Celebrity Big Brother launched with an audience of 3.6 million in early January, and the reality series delivered its highest-ever weekend ratings later that month. In addition, Channel 5 and MTV UK's first major joint commission, 10,000 BC, will begin airing on both channels in February.
Paramount's first quarter started with the previous one left off, building on the theatrical success of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, which pulled in more than $477 million at the global box office. We acquired the Turtles in 2009 for $60 million, and the brand has already generated more than $2.5 billion at retail and consumer products, movie tickets and home entertainment. Our miniature new release in the quarter, Interstellar, was one of the year's most talked about films and a box office success with box office to date of more than $660 million.
Paramount Pictures started the current quarter with a wide release of another movie that we're all very proud of. Nominated for Best Picture Oscar, Selma brings to life an important part of our history. Of course, we are all looking forward to next week's release of the SpongeBob movie, Sponge Out of Water. The first title from Paramount Animation is taking one of the world's most iconic characters to a place, both literally and figuratively, he has never been before. And just announced this week, Paramount has moved up the opening of proven franchise, Mission: Impossible V, to the end of July 2015.
Nickelodeon and Paramount are also close to completing Paramount's first television production this year with School of Rock, which is set to air on Nickelodeon in the fiscal fourth quarter.
To conclude, we are pleased with our powerful position, particularly in this changing industry landscape. Viacom is dealing head-on with industry challenges, and we are positioning our operations for success. We continue to be optimistic about the growth opportunities for our brands and the video content we produce, not only here in the U.S., but particularly in international markets where we see significant upside.
Viacom has the assets, the commitment, the people and the creative culture to succeed. We are innovating, investing and unleashing our human and financial capital to take full advantage of these exciting opportunities, all of which puts us in an excellent position to continue to deliver outstanding content, deeper audience connections and greater returns for our shareholders.
Thank you. And now I'll turn it over to Wade."

Before I take you through our operating results, I want to note that our earnings release and web presentation summarizing the results for our December quarter are available on our website.
Now let's take a look at our segment results. At our Media Networks segment, revenues in the quarter were up 4% compared with the prior year. Domestic revenues were up slightly, while international revenues grew 25%. Foreign currency headwinds had a 6-percentage-point negative impact on international revenues.
Channel 5 contributed 5 percentage points of revenue growth in the quarter. Page 10 of our web deck provides a breakdown of our Media Networks' revenue performance.
In terms of advertising, worldwide revenues were up 3% in the quarter. Domestic revenues were down 6%, and international revenues increased 60%. The growth in international advertising revenues reflects the acquisition of Channel 5 as well as continued growth in the European marketplace. Foreign exchange losses had a 7-percentage-point impact on the international advertising growth and a 1-percentage-point impact on worldwide advertising growth.
In terms of affiliate revenues, domestic revenues were up 8% year-over-year, while international revenues declined 2%. Foreign exchange had a 7-percentage-point unfavorable impact on international revenue growth and a 1-percentage-point unfavorable impact on worldwide affiliate revenue growth.
Excluding the impact from the timing of product available under certain distribution agreements, domestic affiliate revenues grew high single digits in the quarter. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, the growth in international affiliate revenues was due to new channel launches, increases in subscribers, higher rates as well as the timing of products available under certain distribution agreements.
Expenses increased 9% in the quarter. Within operating expenses, programming expense grew 15%, while distribution and other expenses increased 7%. SG&A expense was flat in the quarter.
Excluding the impact of Channel 5, programming expense increased 6%, while both distribution and other expenses and SG&A expense declined. The decrease in SG&A expense was driven by lower incentive-based compensation.
Media Networks' adjusted operating income was down 1%, while the adjusted operating income margin declined to 42%. Channel 5 contributed about 3 percentage points of operating income growth in the quarter. The margin decline was driven by the 9% growth in expenses, which was partially offset by top line revenue growth of 4%.
Moving to Filmed Entertainment. Filmed Entertainment revenues were up 6% in the quarter, principally due to growth in home entertainment revenues. Page 12 of the web presentation provides a breakdown of Filmed Entertainment revenues.
Theatrical revenues increased 6%, primarily driven by carryover revenues from Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, which were partially offset by lower revenues from the current quarter releases.
Home entertainment revenues grew 16% in the quarter. The increase reflects the performance of the current quarter releases of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Hercules, while there were no titles released in the December quarter of last year.
License fees declined 9% in the quarter due to the mix of available titles.
Filmed Entertainment generated an adjusted operating loss of $60 million in the quarter as compared to a loss of $74 million last year.
Now moving beyond the segment results. Other items reflects a loss of $18 million due to foreign exchange losses. In terms of taxes, the adjusted effective tax rate was 32.3%, reflecting a 120 basis point improvement as compared to prior year. The reduction in the adjusted effective tax rate was principally driven by the mix of domestic and international profitability.
And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Tom."

I'm going to talk about our cash flow, our debt and the return of capital to our shareholders. I'll also cover seasonal factors impacting our 2015 fiscal year.For the quarter, we generated $57 million in free cash flow compared to $278 mil",850,"Thanks, Wade. I'm going to talk about our cash flow, our debt and the return of capital to our shareholders. I'll also cover seasonal factors impacting our 2015 fiscal year.
For the quarter, we generated $57 million in free cash flow compared to $278 million last year. Page 5 of the web deck presentation provides the components of free cash flow. The decline in free cash flow in the quarter was principally due to the higher working capital utilization. Working capital was negatively impacted primarily by production spending for our upcoming film releases, including Terminator: Genisys.
Now moving to our debt. It remains principally fixed rate, with an average cost at quarter end of 4.5%. During the quarter, we took advantage of favorable market conditions and issued $1 billion of senior notes and debentures in a combination of 5- and 20-year maturities. Part of the issuance proceeds will be used to repay the $600 million outstanding of our 1.25% senior notes that come due in February. The new debt was issued at an average rate of 4%.
In terms of our short-term funding. To the extent we have incremental borrowings, we are funding this in a commercial paper marketplace at an annual rate of approximately 35 basis points. At quarter end, we had no variable rate borrowings.
In terms of our leverage. We ended the quarter with $13.8 billion of debt and capital leases outstanding. We had $1.2 billion of cash and cash equivalents. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 3.2x. Taking into consideration the February repayment of the $600 million of our senior notes, our leverage ratio is close to 3x, which is within our targeted range. At December 31, our $2.5 billion bank revolver was undrawn.
During the quarter, we continued to return capital to our shareholders. Between our buyback and dividend programs, we returned a total of $887 million of capital back to our shareholders, and we ended the quarter with 407 million shares outstanding.
For the March quarter, we are on pace to purchase approximately $750 million of our stock, which means that for the first 6 months of the year, we will have returned a total of approximately $1.8 billion to our shareholders.
Now let's turn to some of the factors impacting the remainder of our fiscal year. In terms of affiliate revenue, we continue to see annual growth in the high single-digit to low double-digit range.
Quarterly affiliate revenue will fluctuate, given the timing of transactions and the recognition of revenue related to certain distribution agreements which are tied to product availability. For the March quarter, we anticipate that affiliate revenues will grow mid-single digits as compared to the prior year. For the full year, we expect that the organic growth rates for Media Networks' programming expense will be in the mid-single digits. However, reported programming expense will grow in the mid-teens, factoring in the acquisition of Channel 5. In terms of non-programming expense, we will continue to drive efficiencies throughout the organization in order to preserve our margins.
At Filmed Entertainment, we are excited about our upcoming slate, which includes SpongeBob, Terminator: Genisys and Mission: Impossible V. We continue to expect growth in profits to be weighted to the back half of the fiscal year as the studio benefits from its summer theatrical releases as well as the availability of titles in the pay-TV and home entertainment marketplaces.
For 2015, we are now forecasting a book tax rate of 32.3%. We will continue to refine this as we go through the year and get a better sense of domestic-versus-international profitability mix.
Looking ahead at Paramount's production and development pipeline. The studio is currently in production on Paranormal Activity: The Ghost Dimension; and Daddy's Home, which stars Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg. They will begin production shortly on Ben-Hur, which is a coproduction with MGM; The Ring 3; and a comedy which stars Tina Fey that is being produced by Lorne Michaels. The studio is in development on a number of projects, including sequels to Star Trek, World War Z, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and G.I. Joe.
In terms of TV production, Paramount continues to make great progress, having sold 5 more projects to bring the total number of projects sold to 11. They currently have an additional 10 projects in development.
In summary, we remain focused on growing our businesses organically and investing in our brands and franchises. While we are experiencing a challenging ratings environment, we are working with our partners to more effectively measure consumption of our content, and we are developing ways to monetize viewership where measurement is currently unavailable. We continue to generate strong growth in affiliate fees, and we will manage our cost structure and drive greater efficiencies throughout the organization in order to preserve our core margins. From a capital structure standpoint, we continue to take advantage of the current interest rate environment, locking in long-term financing at very attractive rates. And we remain focused on returning excess capital to our shareholders.

So we have the biggest scale, biggest reach in the demos that are particularly important when our distribution partners are trying to sell a variety of services to those same demos. We are working closely with our affiliates to provide more value, even in the absence of affiliate renewals, as witnessed the announcement yesterday by Verizon FiOS for TV Everywhere capability. And we provide great value for all the reach that we provide. Pound for pound, we -- our programming fees are lower than many of the other programming families with much lower reach than we have. So we continue to be very confident. We have successfully renewed on attractive terms for ourselves and for our partners all of our major affiliate agreements and, certainly, with all of those who are committed to the video business. So we continue to remain confident, and we feel we have the ability to manage our affiliate revenue stream as we now stand successfully as we go into the future, and we have demonstrated that."

We're seeing pricing being -- for us anyway, being in the teens, up from upfront pricing. Our issue, based on a current Nielsen measurement in the quarter, is availability of impressions for us to sell. So we currently look at domestic advertising in this quarter to be in a comparable range to what we reported for the last quarter. And we are looking to improvement in the back half of the year in domestic ad sales performance, with 3 principal drivers. One is that we are with new programming and delivery of -- and better delivery of impressions to increase the number of impressions that we are able to sell. Two, we are looking and working hard to better monetize the impressions that are not being properly monetized. And three, we are continuing to work very closely with the agencies and our customers to drive value through better integrated marketing efforts. We have unique capabilities in that regard. Use of reach data and engagement data through Viacom Velocity and Viacom Echo. So as far as the movement toward better monetization of those impressions, we have a number of initiatives. I've described them in my remarks at the prior call. And when we talk about the proportion of our ad revenues, which in the last year were 30% non-Nielsen-dependent and over the next 3 years, we expect that to grow toward the 50% marks, that growth will be driven by monetizing all these impressions that you have on our dot-coms or apps, all the mobile impressions that we will continue to grow very rapidly, including through some of the new services that we will be launching with our telco partners."

And different advertisers are moving down the digital road at different speed and the kind of the nature of their product to find the opportunity. A car manufacturer who knows that an individual lease is coming up for renewal in 3 to 6 months. Using that data, combined with knowing what IP address that data -- that person is connected to, would allow you to target ads as that person consumes content from Viacom or our competitors. It's a very, very powerful tool in terms of targeting because that often is informed, not only by the timing of that person's need or demand, but also it's informed by the kind of the car they have and whether it's a luxury vehicle or a midsized or a compact. And people are just beginning to understand that and working with their advertising agencies and their partners like Viacom to better take advantage of that information and integrate that into a more informed by, a much more targeted by, a much more valuable by the advertiser. That's all taking place. That's what dynamic ad insertion is all about. And there's just a plethora of data out there that adds to the value equation. Some advertisers, like the ones I just mentioned, are very sophisticated and beginning to use it. Others are beginning to figure out ways on how it might apply to their product. But we're in -- as we've said earlier, we're in conversations across the industry with multiple agencies, dealing with multiple measurement metrics that reflect more appropriately that advertiser's targeting -- defined targeted customer. And how -- and this is just the beginning of this whole evolution and whole understanding as to the metrics that are now available in the marketplace and how they will begin to change this.

And what he found from his checks was that, based on the data that only went to sometime toward the end of 2014, it's not even current, that expanded basic video customers had declined 18% since our networks were dropped. So you have there an example of a company that is very rural, that is facing on the video side very stiff competition from DISH and DIRECTV, and seems to be focusing most in the broadband business where it's not facing that kind of competition. So it's an unusual situation, and we certainly -- we've had great success in renewing our deals with others who obviously have a strong commitment to all aspects of their business, including video. We provide great value for them to keep their customers and to grow and attract new customers, and relationship with us is critically important."

Thanks for joining us to discuss the first quarter of our 2015 fiscal year. Viacom, once again, had a solid quarter. We drove revenue growth across our business and continued to evolve and adapt to meet the opportunities of an increasingly digital and multi-platform landscape. We also maintained our strong balance sheet while continuing to return capital to our shareholders. Let's take a quick look at our first quarter financial performance.
Revenues increased 5% to $3.34 billion due to growth across the board. All of our major drivers, affiliate fees, advertising, theatrical distribution and home entertainment, saw increases in the quarter. Adjusted operating income was flat for the quarter at $959 million. Adjusted net earnings were $538 million, and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 8% to $1.29, the highest ever for a December quarter. These results are a reflection of our commitment to produce great multi-platform content while efficiently and effectively managing our operations. This commitment has been fundamental to our success and will drive our growth in the future.
It is no secret that there are far-reaching shifts taking place in our industry. As the industry evolves, it is more important than ever to focus on Viacom's significant strengths. Viacom has an unmatched portfolio of iconic and powerful brands and is a leading creator of the content that drives the industry ecosystem. Viacom's current distribution partnerships are strong, with most extending well into the future, and the ranks of new entrants are increasing rapidly.
Viacom's global footprint is broad and growing. Viacom is leading the rapid evolution to new measurement and monetization models that will unlock significant value for us, in particular.
We produce distinct, high-end video for screens of all sizes, content that drives greater consumer engagement and is highly valued by advertisers. We invest billions in original programming year in and year out. Included in our programming for this year in the U.S. alone are well over 200 freshly produced series and events.
Turning back to the results. Worldwide Media Networks revenues increased 4%, with a 6% increase in affiliate revenues. Domestic affiliate fees rose 8%, consistent with our annualized guidance of high single- to low double-digit increases going forward.
While we have recently seen a lot of posturing and positioning in affiliate negotiations across our industry, Viacom's distribution pipeline has never been stronger. We have long-term carriage agreements with every major distributor who is committed to a vibrant video business and most of the emerging players, including Google and Sony.
We deliver great value to our partners, and we are committed to helping them grow. Compared to other programming groups, Viacom networks are the leaders: #1 in viewers 18 to 34 and viewers 18 to 49, based on Nielsen measurement. And we believe they account for an even greater proportion of non-Nielsen-measured digital consumption. As I've previously said, 70% of our subscriber base is covered by deals extending to 2018 and beyond, giving us significant visibility well into the future.
As I mentioned on our last call, in the first quarter, we successfully concluded carriage agreements with Verizon and Frontier Communications, and we are currently in productive discussions on other renewal deals. We are also pleased that we renewed our affiliate agreement with DISH for our networks in Mexico. That deal includes the launch on DISH of the Paramount Channel next month to 2.2 million subscribers, bringing Paramount Channel's total distribution in Latin America at this early stage to 20 million subscribers.
We are also adding networks around the world, particularly in high-growth markets like India, Latin America and Africa but also in the U.K., Continental Europe and other parts of Asia. Our International business is growing rapidly and is very profitable, not someday but today. New digital entrants are providing expansion opportunities as well as sparking industry-wide innovation.
In the first quarter, we renewed and expanded our agreement with Hulu. This month, EPIX signed a multiyear renewal with Amazon, and we are looking forward to the launch of Sony's digital service in the coming months.
We are looking to tomorrow and the promise of innovation, bringing our programming to audiences where they want it, including mobile. Yesterday, for example, we added 24 Viacom networks to Verizon's FiOS mobile app, which brings TV Everywhere functionality to FiOS TV. Also, in March, our Nickelodeon group will launch a new direct-to-consumer subscription service. We believe this innovative service, which will have a distinct brand and will target the fast-growing mobile market, will be very attractive for parents and children. Nickelodeon will provide more details and announce the brand name at its Upfront presentation next month.
Turning to advertising. Viacom's revenues grew 3% in the quarter. Domestic ad sales in our Media Networks declined 6% compared to last year, due primarily to lower C3 ratings. This was the first full quarter of results for Channel 5, which drove a 60% increase in international ad revenues.
Industry-wide declines in ratings are generating debate about ways to close the gap between currently accepted ratings and actual consumption. It is an important secular issue. Inadequate measurement undermines innovation and disproportionately impacts those leading programmers, like us, who effectively provide the multi-platform experiences that viewers demand. While it is currently a reality of our business, at Viacom, we are not waiting for change.  We are working with other major parties in the advertising ecosystem, bringing together data scientists and industry experts, whether at Nielsen or elsewhere, to create new measurement and monetization tools. As an example, we are in specific discussions with several media agencies to enhance our capabilities to target and plan campaigns with even more precise and comprehensive measurement. To get there, we're bringing together data on engagement and behavior from a range of sources, including set-top boxes, smart TVs and other digital devices. We're confident that these new tools will allow us to distribute video in a more strategic way, unlocking significant revenue potential. These opportunities are not limited to the U.S. market. In tests in Norway, we have found that 12-to-24 ratings on MTV increase in the low-teen percentages when viewing on other devices is measured. In general, we continue to develop ways to convert reach to revenue and monetize non-Nielsen-measured viewership as we grow this category from 30% of total ad sales to 50% in the next 3 years.
Earlier this week, Snapchat launched its Discover platform, which include Comedy Central and MTV International. Snapchat has 100 million global active users, most of whom are in the demographic sweet spot for Viacom. This is another example of our non-Nielsen-monetization strategy, enabled by the rich, native content of our brands that resonates on social platforms and drives hundreds of millions of video streams and even more engagements per month. This is a meaningful expansion of our monetization opportunities, adding Snapchat to relationships with Twitter and Tumblr, among others.
These key attributes and initiatives as well as the creative spirit that drives our company are what give us great confidence as we manage through this transition. We are rapidly adapting our processes and businesses as well as human, financial and technological resources to increase focus on new high-potential areas. We have teams dedicated to content creation, with a focus on more and better original programming that monetizes on all screens; dedicated to expansion and innovation on emerging mobile platforms; dedicated to the rapid rollout of innovative, integrated marketing and audience data capabilities; dedicated to building a thriving television studio at Paramount; dedicated to rolling out new brands in international markets with high growth potential; and much more.
It is clear that this transition will require some organizational realignment as well as rationalization of content that no longer meets our goals. We have identified specific areas where we can work more efficiently while focusing better on the evolving needs of our customers and audiences. These changes are well underway and will result in substantial net cost savings throughout our organization while, at the same time, increasing our focus and investment in areas with the highest growth potential. We expect to have more news about these ongoing efforts in the months ahead.
In addition, we continue to supplement our organic growth with disciplined strategic expansion. Following our successful acquisition of Channel 5 in the U.K., we are looking at targeted investments that will press our advantage in key areas. We have concluded an agreement to acquire 5 regional television channels in India, which we will own along with our existing partner in India, Network18, and shortly expect to receive our final regulatory approvals. We are also negotiating another acquisition that would add to our scale in an important part of our business. Together, these 2 acquisitions involve about $400 million. Taking advantage of these compelling opportunities does not detract from our steadfast, long-term commitment to returning capital to our shareholders while we grow our business.
Through stock repurchases and dividends, Viacom returned almost $900 million to shareholders in the quarter. In addition, we continue to effectively manage our debt, successfully accessing the markets for $1 billion at very attractive rates. We are on track to buy $750 million of our stock in this quarter. We expect to decrease the pace of our buyback for the second half of the year to stay at or below our leverage ratio target of 3.0. We will provide an update on our next earnings call.
Now let's talk briefly about our divisions. While the industry measurement issues continue to cause concern, Nickelodeon closed the calendar year as the top basic cable network with kids and total viewers. Nick is premiering more new content than ever, meeting the demands of kid audiences that are craving more new episodes and fewer repeats. In the quarter, the sneak preview TV-movie of Nickelodeon's new series, 100 Things To Do Before High School, ranked #1 in its time period across all television and drove double-digit gains with key demos. This gives us great confidence when the series kicks off with new episodes in April. The movie, Santa Hunters, also premiered to strong ratings, scoring as the top kids' television telecast for the week.
Nickelodeon's tentpole shows also continued to be a force. The reimagined 2014 Nickelodeon HALO Awards captured the show's biggest audience ever with kids, tweens and total viewers, and was the #1 TV telecast for the night with kids. Coming up, the mega tentpole Kids' Choice Awards will air in March, followed by the second annual Kids' Choice Sports Awards this summer.
Additionally, in early December, we launched the Nick Jr. app, which quickly topped the ranks in the U.S. iTunes App Store and was selected as the Editor's Choice in Apple's spotlight on the best apps of 2014.
Looking ahead, Nickelodeon will air more than 150 new episodes and specials in the second quarter, with a focus on adapting to their viewers' changing tastes. We have already found success with Bella and The Bulldogs, which drew 40% more viewers than our previous live-action launches.
And of course, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, which has become a dominant video, movie and consumer product brand, wrapped up a very strong Christmas season as the #1 selling toy in the country for calendar 2014 according to NPD Group.
Comedy Central also has more original programming in the current quarter, with new seasons of returning series such as Workaholics, Broad City and Kroll Show. Of course, the biggest news has been the successful launch of The Nightly Show with Larry Wilmore, which carries on Comedy Central's tradition of innovating in late night and has already joined The Daily Show with Jon Stewart in staking out a prime position in the cultural discourse.
And speaking of discourse, coming soon, we'll be shooting and airing the Comedy Central roast of Justin Bieber. Mark your calendars, you won't want to miss it.
On SPIKE, we will be bringing fans the pop hit and viral phenomenon, Lip Sync Battle, hosted by LL Cool J, which will premiere in April. On each episode, celebrities will go head-to-head in an outrageous lip sync contest. 
MTV also remains strong and resonant with its audience, placing Awkward and Faking It among the top 15 cable series in the quarter in the 12-to-34 demo. Through Always On, MTV builds a real-time conversation on all of their platforms, on air, online, mobile and social, in a way that no other brand can. In fact, MTV has doubled its unique digital visitors over the past year to a total of nearly 50 million in December.
In the second quarter, MTV premiered its new scripted thriller, Eye Candy, and is launching Broke Ass Game Show next month, a funny, edgy show, with man on the street dares that are perfect for digital sharing. MTV also returns several successful series in the second quarter, including Catfish, The Challenge, Teen Mom and Ridiculousness.
We are also focusing on several high-quality, big-event programs across our networks, and I'd like to update you on 2 of those. Next month, BET will launch its first-ever event miniseries, The Book of Negroes, a 6-part historical drama. The television event will run over the course of 3 consecutive nights in February. SPIKE is also in production on the epic series Tut, featuring Sir Ben Kingsley, about the boy king who ruled Egypt during the 18th Dynasty.
Moving to our newest brand. I'm proud to say that the integration of Channel 5 with our international operations is going extremely well, and performance has quickly improved during this transition. Channel 5 is the only major free-to-air U.K. commercial network to grow share in 2014. And this December, Channel 5 had its best Christmas week ratings in 7 years.
And 2015 has started with a bang. Celebrity Big Brother launched with an audience of 3.6 million in early January, and the reality series delivered its highest-ever weekend ratings later that month. In addition, Channel 5 and MTV UK's first major joint commission, 10,000 BC, will begin airing on both channels in February.
Paramount's first quarter started where the previous one left off, building on the theatrical success of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, which pulled in more than $477 million at the global box office. We acquired the Turtles in 2009 for $60 million, and the brand has already generated more than $2.5 billion at retail and consumer products, movie tickets and home entertainment. Our miniature new release in the quarter, Interstellar, was one of the year's most talked about films and a box office success with box office to date of more than $660 million.
Paramount Pictures started the current quarter with the wide release of another movie that we're all very proud of. Nominated for Best Picture Oscar, Selma brings to life an important part of our history. Of course, we are all looking forward to next week's release of the SpongeBob movie, Sponge Out of Water. The first title from Paramount Animation is taking one of the world's most iconic characters to a place, both literally and figuratively, he has never been before. And just announced this week, Paramount has moved up the opening of proven franchise, Mission: Impossible V, to the end of July 2015.
Nickelodeon and Paramount are also close to completing Paramount's first television production this year with School of Rock, which is set to air on Nickelodeon in the fiscal fourth quarter.
To conclude, we are pleased with our powerful position, particularly in this changing industry landscape. Viacom is dealing head-on with industry challenges, and we are positioning our operations for success. We continue to be optimistic about the growth opportunities for our brands and the video content we produce, not only here in the U.S., but particularly in international markets where we see significant upside.
Viacom has the assets, the commitment, the people and the creative culture to succeed. We are innovating, investing and unleashing our human and financial capital to take full advantage of these exciting opportunities, all of which puts us in an excellent position to continue to deliver outstanding content, deeper audience connections and greater returns for our shareholders.
Thank you. And now I'll turn it over to Wade."

Before I take you through our operating results, I want to note that our earnings release and web presentation summarizing the results for our December quarter are available on our website.
Now let's take a look at our segment results. At our Media Networks segment, revenues in the quarter were up 4% compared with the prior year. Domestic revenues were up slightly, while international revenues grew 25%. Foreign currency headwinds had a 6-percentage-point negative impact on international revenues.
Channel 5 contributed 5 percentage points of revenue growth in the quarter. Page 10 of our web deck provides a breakdown of our Media Networks' revenue performance.
In terms of advertising, worldwide revenues were up 3% in the quarter. Domestic revenues were down 6%, and international revenues increased 60%. The growth in international advertising revenues reflects the acquisition of Channel 5 as well as continued growth in the European marketplace. Foreign exchange losses had a 7-percentage-point impact on international advertising growth and a 1-percentage-point impact on worldwide advertising growth.
In terms of affiliate revenues, domestic revenues were up 8% year-over-year, while international revenues declined 2%. Foreign exchange had a 7-percentage-point unfavorable impact on international revenue growth and a 1-percentage-point unfavorable impact on worldwide affiliate revenue growth.
Excluding the impact from the timing of product available under certain distribution agreements, domestic affiliate revenues grew high single digits in the quarter. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, the growth in international affiliate revenues was due to new channel launches, increases in subscribers, higher rates as well as the timing of product available under certain distribution agreements.
Expenses increased 9% in the quarter. Within operating expenses, programming expense grew 15%, while distribution and other expenses increased 7%. SG&A expense was flat in the quarter.
Excluding the impact of Channel 5, programming expense increased 6%, while both distribution and other expenses and SG&A expense declined. The decrease in SG&A expense was driven by lower incentive-based compensation.
Media Networks' adjusted operating income was down 1%, while the adjusted operating income margin declined to 42%. Channel 5 contributed about 3 percentage points of operating income growth in the quarter. The margin decline was driven by the 9% growth in expenses, which was partially offset by top line revenue growth of 4%.
Moving to Filmed Entertainment. Filmed Entertainment revenues were up 6% in the quarter, principally due to growth in home entertainment revenues. Page 12 of the web presentation provides a breakdown of Filmed Entertainment revenues.
Theatrical revenues increased 6%, primarily driven by carryover revenues from Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, which were partially offset by lower revenues from the current quarter releases.
Home entertainment revenues grew 16% in the quarter. The increase reflects the performance of the current quarter releases of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Hercules, while there were no titles released in the December quarter of last year.
License fees declined 9% in the quarter due to the mix of available titles.
Filmed Entertainment generated an adjusted operating loss of $60 million in the quarter as compared to a loss of $74 million last year.
Now moving beyond the segment results. Other items reflects a loss of $18 million due to foreign exchange losses. In terms of taxes, the adjusted effective tax rate was 32.3%, reflecting a 120 basis point improvement as compared to prior year. The reduction in the adjusted effective tax rate was principally driven by the mix of domestic and international profitability.
And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Tom."

I'm going to talk about our cash flow, our debt and the return of capital to our shareholders. I'll also cover seasonal factors impacting our 2015 fiscal year.For the quarter, we generated $57 million in free cash flow compared to $278 mil",850,"Thanks, Wade. I'm going to talk about our cash flow, our debt and the return of capital to our shareholders. I'll also cover seasonal factors impacting our 2015 fiscal year.
For the quarter, we generated $57 million in free cash flow compared to $278 million last year. Page 5 of the web deck presentation provides the components of free cash flow. The decline in free cash flow in the quarter was principally due to the higher working capital utilization. Working capital was negatively impacted primarily by production spending for our upcoming film releases, including Terminator: Genisys.
Now moving to our debt. It remains principally fixed rate, with an average cost at quarter end of 4.5%. During the quarter, we took advantage of favorable market conditions and issued $1 billion of senior notes and debentures in a combination of 5- and 20-year maturities. Part of the issuance proceeds will be used to repay the $600 million outstanding of our 1.25% senior notes that come due in February. The new debt was issued at an average rate of 4%.
In terms of our short-term funding. To the extent we have incremental borrowings, we are funding this in the commercial paper marketplace at an annual rate of approximately 35 basis points. At quarter end, we had no variable rate borrowings.
In terms of our leverage. We ended the quarter with $13.8 billion of debt and capital leases outstanding. We had $1.2 billion of cash and cash equivalents. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 3.2x. Taking into consideration the February repayment of the $600 million of our senior notes, our leverage ratio is close to 3x, which is within our targeted range. At December 31, our $2.5 billion bank revolver was undrawn.
During the quarter, we continued to return capital to our shareholders. Between our buyback and dividend programs, we returned a total of $887 million of capital back to our shareholders, and we ended the quarter with 407 million shares outstanding.
For the March quarter, we are on pace to purchase approximately $750 million of our stock, which means that for the first 6 months of the year, we will have returned a total of approximately $1.8 billion to our shareholders.
Now let's turn to some of the factors impacting the remainder of our fiscal year. In terms of affiliate revenue, we continue to see annual growth in the high single-digit to low double-digit range.
Quarterly affiliate revenue will fluctuate, given the timing of transactions and the recognition of revenue related to certain distribution agreements which are tied to product availability. For the March quarter, we anticipate that affiliate revenues will grow mid-single digits as compared to the prior year. For the full year, we expect that the organic growth rate for Media Networks' programming expense will be in the mid-single digits. However, reported programming expense will grow in the mid-teens, factoring in the acquisition of Channel 5. In terms of non-programming expense, we will continue to drive efficiencies throughout the organization in order to preserve our margins.
At Filmed Entertainment, we are excited about our upcoming slate, which includes SpongeBob, Terminator: Genisys and Mission: Impossible V. We continue to expect growth in profits to be weighted to the back half of the fiscal year as the studio benefits from its summer theatrical releases as well as the availability of titles in the pay-TV and home entertainment marketplaces.
For 2015, we are now forecasting a book tax rate of 32.3%. We will continue to refine this as we go through the year and get a better sense of domestic-versus-international profitability mix.
Looking ahead at Paramount's production and development pipeline. The studio is currently in production on Paranormal Activity: The Ghost Dimension; and Daddy's Home, which stars Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg. They will begin production shortly on Ben-Hur, which is a coproduction with MGM; The Ring 3; and a comedy which stars Tina Fey that is being produced by Lorne Michaels. The studio is in development on a number of projects, including sequels to Star Trek, World War Z, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and G.I. Joe.
In terms of TV production, Paramount continues to make great progress, having sold 5 more projects to bring the total number of projects sold to 11. They currently have an additional 10 projects in development.
In summary, we remain focused on growing our businesses organically and investing in our brands and franchises. While we are experiencing a challenging ratings environment, we are working with our partners to more effectively measure consumption of our content, and we are developing ways to monetize viewership where measurement is currently unavailable. We continue to generate strong growth in affiliate fees, and we will manage our cost structure and drive greater efficiencies throughout the organization in order to preserve our core margins. From a capital structure standpoint, we continue to take advantage of the current interest rate environment, locking in long-term financing at very attractive rates. And we remain focused on returning excess capital to our shareholders.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to your questions."

We're seeing pricing being -- for us anyway, being in the teens, up from upfront pricing. Our issue, based on a current Nielsen measurement in the quarter, is availability of impressions for us to sell. So we currently look at domestic advertising in this quarter to be in a comparable range to what we reported for the last quarter. And we are looking to improvement in the back half of the year in domestic ad sales performance, with 3 principal drivers. One is that we are, with new programming and delivery of -- and better delivery of impressions, to increase the number of impressions that we are able to sell. Two, we are looking and working hard to better monetize the impressions that are not being properly monetized. And three, we are continuing to work very closely with the agencies and our customers to drive value through better integrated marketing efforts. We have unique capabilities in that regard. Use of reach data and engagement data through Viacom Velocity and Viacom Echo. So as far as the movement toward better monetization of those impressions, we have a number of initiatives. I've described them in my remarks and in the prior call. And when we talk about the proportion of our ad revenues, which in the last year were 30% non-Nielsen-dependent and, over the next 3 years, we expect that to grow toward the 50% marks, that growth will be driven by monetizing all these impressions that you have on our dot-coms or apps, all the mobile impressions that we will continue to grow very rapidly, including through some of the new services that we will be launching with our telco partners."

So some of these shows are seeing as much as a 50% lift from the live viewing into C3. And then you have a large proportion of viewing that's not being measured within that C3 window and then -- and viewing outside of the C3 window. So this -- there's obviously been some talk over time about adding to the 3 number, but we're working very closely with the agencies and advertisers alike on more comprehensive measurement tools and working with them to take advantage of the reach we provide, not just on the shows themselves but in social media added on to our viewing, with special integrated marketing executions, sharing our data, sharing our research with them.

Using that data, combined with knowing what IP address that data -- that person is connected to, would allow you to target ads as that person consumes content from Viacom or our competitors.

And people are just beginning to understand that and working with their advertising agencies and their partners like Viacom to better take advantage of that information and integrate that into a more informed buy, a much more targeted buy, a much more valuable buy to the advertiser. That's all taking place. That's what dynamic ad insertion is all about. And there's just a plethora of data out there that adds to the value equation. Some advertisers, like the ones I just mentioned, are very sophisticated and beginning to use it. Others are beginning to figure out ways on how it might apply to their product. But we're in -- as Philippe said earlier, we're in conversations across the industry with multiple agencies, dealing with multiple measurement metrics that reflect more appropriately that advertiser's targeting -- defined targeted customer. And how -- and this is just the beginning of this whole evolution and whole understanding as to the metrics that are now available in the marketplace and how they'll begin to change this. But the key thing is to get there, work with those advertisers, understand their products and understand how we can bring, connect them to consumers interested in consuming their products."

And what he found from his checks was that, based on the data that only went to sometime toward the end of 2014, it's not even current, that expanded basic video customers had declined 18% since our networks were dropped. So you have there an example of a company that is very rural, that is facing on the video side very stiff competition from DISH and DIRECTV, and seems to be focusing most in the broadband business where it's not facing that kind of competition. So it's an unusual situation, and we certainly -- we've had great success in renewing our deals with others who obviously have a strong commitment to all aspects of their business, including video.

Thanks for joining us to discuss the first quarter of our 2015 fiscal year. Viacom, once again, had a solid quarter. We drove revenue growth across our business and continued to evolve and adapt to meet the opportunities of an increasingly digital and multi-platform landscape. We also maintained our strong balance sheet while continuing to return capital to our shareholders. Let's take a quick look at our first quarter financial performance.
Revenues increased 5% to $3.34 billion due to growth across the board. All of our major drivers, affiliate fees, advertising, theatrical distribution and home entertainment, saw increases in the quarter. Adjusted operating income was flat for the quarter at $959 million. Adjusted net earnings were $538 million, and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 8% to $1.29, the highest ever for a December quarter. These results are a reflection of our commitment to produce great multi-platform content while efficiently and effectively managing our operations. This commitment has been fundamental to our success and will drive our growth in the future.
It is no secret that there are far-reaching shifts taking place in our industry. As the industry evolves, it is more important than ever to focus on Viacom's significant strengths. Viacom has an unmatched portfolio of iconic and powerful brands and is a leading creator of the content that drives the industry ecosystem. Viacom's current distribution partnerships are strong, with most extending well into the future, and the ranks of new entrants are increasing rapidly.
Viacom's global footprint is broad and growing. Viacom is leading the rapid evolution to new measurement and monetization models that will unlock significant value for us, in particular.
We produce distinct, high-end video for screens of all sizes, content that drives greater consumer engagement and is highly valued by advertisers. We invest billions in original programming year in and year out. Included in our programming for this year in the U.S. alone are well over 200 freshly produced series and events.
Turning back to the results. Worldwide Media Networks revenues increased 4%, with a 6% increase in affiliate revenues. Domestic affiliate fees rose 8%, consistent with our annualized guidance of high single- to low double-digit increases going forward.
While we have recently seen a lot of posturing and positioning in affiliate negotiations across our industry, Viacom's distribution pipeline has never been stronger. We have long-term carriage agreements with every major distributor who is committed to a vibrant video business and most of the emerging players, including Google and Sony.
We deliver great value to our partners, and we are committed to helping them grow. Compared to other programming groups, Viacom networks are the leaders: #1 in viewers 18 to 34 and viewers 18 to 49, based on Nielsen measurement. And we believe they account for an even greater proportion of non-Nielsen-measured digital consumption. As I've previously said, 70% of our subscriber base is covered by deals extending to 2018 and beyond, giving us significant visibility well into the future.
As I mentioned on our last call, in the first quarter, we successfully concluded carriage agreements with Verizon and Frontier Communications, and we are currently in productive discussions on other renewal deals. We are also pleased that we renewed our affiliate agreement with DISH for our networks in Mexico. That deal includes the launch on DISH of the Paramount Channel next month to 2.2 million subscribers, bringing Paramount Channel's total distribution in Latin America at this early stage to 20 million subscribers.
We are also adding networks around the world, particularly in high-growth markets like India, Latin America and Africa but also in the U.K., Continental Europe and other parts of Asia. Our International business is growing rapidly and is very profitable, not someday but today. New digital entrants are providing expansion opportunities as well as sparking industry-wide innovation.
In the first quarter, we renewed and expanded our agreement with Hulu. This month, EPIX signed a multiyear renewal with Amazon, and we are looking forward to the launch of Sony's digital service in the coming months.
We are looking to tomorrow and the promise of innovation, bringing our programming to audiences where they want it, including mobile. Yesterday, for example, we added 24 Viacom networks to Verizon's FiOS mobile app, which brings TV Everywhere functionality to FiOS TV. Also, in March, our Nickelodeon group will launch a new direct-to-consumer subscription service. We believe this innovative service, which will have a distinct brand and will target the fast-growing mobile market, will be very attractive for parents and children. Nickelodeon will provide more details and announce the brand name at its Upfront presentation next month.
Turning to advertising. Viacom's revenues grew 3% in the quarter. Domestic ad sales in our Media Networks declined 6% compared to last year, due primarily to lower C3 ratings. This was the first full quarter of results for Channel 5, which drove a 60% increase in international ad revenues.
Industry-wide declines in ratings are generating debate about ways to close the gap between currently accepted ratings and actual consumption. It is an important secular issue. Inadequate measurement undermines innovation and disproportionately impacts those leading programmers, like us, who effectively provide the multi-platform experiences that viewers demand. While it is currently a reality of our business, at Viacom, we are not waiting for change. We are working with other major parties in the advertising ecosystem, bringing together data scientists and industry experts, whether at Nielsen or elsewhere, to create new measurement and monetization tools. As an example, we are in specific discussions with several media agencies to enhance our capabilities to target and plan campaigns with even more precise and comprehensive measurement. To get there, we're bringing together data on engagement and behavior from a range of sources, including set-top boxes, smart TVs and other digital devices. We're confident that these new tools will allow us to distribute video in a more strategic way, unlocking significant revenue potential. These opportunities are not limited to the U.S. market. In tests in Norway, we have found that 12-to-24 ratings on MTV increase in the low-teen percentages when viewing on other devices is measured. In general, we continue to develop ways to convert reach to revenue and monetize non-Nielsen-measured viewership as we grow this category from 30% of total ad sales to 50% in the next 3 years.
Earlier this week, Snapchat launched its Discover platform, which include Comedy Central and MTV International. Snapchat has 100 million global active users, most of whom are in the demographic sweet spot for Viacom. This is another example of our non-Nielsen-monetization strategy, enabled by the rich, native content of our brands that resonates on social platforms and drives hundreds of millions of video streams and even more engagements per month. This is a meaningful expansion of our monetization opportunities, adding Snapchat to relationships with Twitter and Tumblr, among others.
These key attributes and initiatives as well as the creative spirit that drives our company are what give us great confidence as we manage through this transition. We are rapidly adapting our processes and businesses as well as human, financial and technological resources to increase focus on new high-potential areas. We have teams dedicated to content creation, with a focus on more and better original programming that monetizes on all screens; dedicated to expansion and innovation on emerging mobile platforms; dedicated to the rapid rollout of innovative, integrated marketing and audience data capabilities; dedicated to building a thriving television studio at Paramount; dedicated to rolling out new brands in international markets with high growth potential; and much more.
It is clear that this transition will require some organizational realignment as well as rationalization of content that no longer meets our goals. We have identified specific areas where we can work more efficiently while focusing better on the evolving needs of our customers and audiences. These changes are well underway and will result in substantial net cost savings throughout our organization while, at the same time, increasing our focus and investment in areas with the highest growth potential. We expect to have more news about these ongoing efforts in the months ahead.
In addition, we continue to supplement our organic growth with disciplined strategic expansion. Following our successful acquisition of Channel 5 in the U.K., we are looking at targeted investments that will press our advantage in key areas. We have concluded an agreement to acquire 5 regional television channels in India, which we will own along with our existing partner in India, Network18, and shortly expect to receive our final regulatory approvals. We are also negotiating another acquisition that would add to our scale in an important part of our business. Together, these 2 acquisitions involve about $400 million. Taking advantage of these compelling opportunities does not detract from our steadfast, long-term commitment to returning capital to our shareholders while we grow our business.
Through stock repurchases and dividends, Viacom returned almost $900 million to shareholders in the quarter. In addition, we continue to effectively manage our debt, successfully accessing the markets for $1 billion at very attractive rates. We are on track to buy $750 million of our stock in this quarter. We expect to decrease the pace of our buyback for the second half of the year to stay at or below our leverage ratio target of 3.0. We will provide an update on our next earnings call.
Now let's talk briefly about our divisions. While the industry measurement issues continue to cause concern, Nickelodeon closed the calendar year as the top basic cable network with kids and total viewers. Nick is premiering more new content than ever, meeting the demands of kid audiences that are craving more new episodes and fewer repeats. In the quarter, the sneak preview TV-movie of Nickelodeon's new series, 100 Things To Do Before High School, ranked #1 in its time period across all television and drove double-digit gains with key demos. This gives us great confidence when the series kicks off with new episodes in April. The movie, Santa Hunters, also premiered to strong ratings, scoring as the top kids' television telecast for the week.
Nickelodeon's tentpole shows also continued to be a force. The reimagined 2014 Nickelodeon HALO Awards captured the show's biggest audience ever with kids, tweens and total viewers, and was the #1 TV telecast for the night with kids. Coming up, the mega tentpole Kids' Choice Awards will air in March, followed by the second annual Kids' Choice Sports Awards this summer.
Additionally, in early December, we launched the Nick Jr. app, which quickly topped the ranks in the U.S. iTunes App Store and was selected as the Editor's Choice in Apple's spotlight on the best apps of 2014.
Looking ahead, Nickelodeon will air more than 150 new episodes and specials in the second quarter, with a focus on adapting to their viewers' changing tastes. We have already found success with Bella and The Bulldogs, which drew 40% more viewers than our previous live-action launches.
And of course, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, which has become a dominant video, movie and consumer product brand, wrapped up a very strong Christmas season as the #1 selling toy in the country for calendar 2014 according to NPD Group.
Comedy Central also has more original programming in the current quarter, with new seasons of returning series such as Workaholics, Broad City and Kroll Show. Of course, the biggest news has been the successful launch of The Nightly Show with Larry Wilmore, which carries on Comedy Central's tradition of innovating in late night and has already joined The Daily Show with Jon Stewart in staking out a prime position in the cultural discourse.
And speaking of discourse, coming soon, we'll be shooting and airing the Comedy Central roast of Justin Bieber. Mark your calendars, you won't want to miss it.
On SPIKE, we will be bringing fans the pop hit and viral phenomenon, Lip Sync Battle, hosted by LL Cool J, which will premiere in April. On each episode, celebrities will go head-to-head in an outrageous lip sync contest. 
MTV also remains strong and resonant with its audience, placing Awkward and Faking It among the top 15 cable series in the quarter in the 12-to-34 demo. Through Always On, MTV builds a real-time conversation on all of their platforms, on air, online, mobile and social, in a way that no other brand can. In fact, MTV has doubled its unique digital visitors over the past year to a total of nearly 50 million in December.
In the second quarter, MTV premiered its new scripted thriller, Eye Candy, and is launching Broke Ass Game Show next month, a funny, edgy show, with man on the street dares that are perfect for digital sharing. MTV also returns several successful series in the second quarter, including Catfish, The Challenge, Teen Mom and Ridiculousness.
We are also focusing on several high-quality, big-event programs across our networks, and I'd like to update you on 2 of those. Next month, BET will launch its first-ever event miniseries, The Book of Negroes, a 6-part historical drama. The television event will run over the course of 3 consecutive nights in February. SPIKE is also in production on the epic series Tut, featuring Sir Ben Kingsley, about the boy king who ruled Egypt during the 18th Dynasty.
Moving to our newest brand. I'm proud to say that the integration of Channel 5 with our international operations is going extremely well, and performance has quickly improved during this transition. Channel 5 is the only major free-to-air U.K. commercial network to grow share in 2014. And this December, Channel 5 had its best Christmas week ratings in 7 years.
And 2015 has started with a bang. Celebrity Big Brother launched with an audience of 3.6 million in early January, and the reality series delivered its highest-ever weekend ratings later that month. In addition, Channel 5 and MTV UK's first major joint commission, 10,000 BC, will begin airing on both channels in February.
Paramount's first quarter started where the previous one left off, building on the theatrical success of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, which pulled in more than $477 million at the global box office. We acquired the Turtles in 2009 for $60 million, and the brand has already generated more than $2.5 billion at retail and consumer products, movie tickets and home entertainment. Our miniature new release in the quarter, Interstellar, was one of the year's most talked about films and a box office success with box office to date of more than $660 million.
Paramount Pictures started the current quarter with the wide release of another movie that we're all very proud of. Nominated for Best Picture Oscar, Selma brings to life an important part of our history. Of course, we are all looking forward to next week's release of the SpongeBob movie, Sponge Out of Water. The first title from Paramount Animation is taking one of the world's most iconic characters to a place, both literally and figuratively, he has never been before. And just announced this week, Paramount has moved up the opening of proven franchise, Mission: Impossible V, to the end of July 2015.
Nickelodeon and Paramount are also close to completing Paramount's first television production this year with School of Rock, which is set to air on Nickelodeon in the fiscal fourth quarter.
To conclude, we are pleased with our powerful position, particularly in this changing industry landscape. Viacom is dealing head-on with industry challenges, and we are positioning our operations for success. We continue to be optimistic about the growth opportunities for our brands and the video content we produce, not only here in the U.S., but particularly in international markets where we see significant upside.
Viacom has the assets, the commitment, the people and the creative culture to succeed. We are innovating, investing and unleashing our human and financial capital to take full advantage of these exciting opportunities, all of which puts us in an excellent position to continue to deliver outstanding content, deeper audience connections and greater returns for our shareholders.
Thank you. And now I'll turn it over to Wade."

Before I take you through our operating results, I want to note that our earnings release and web presentation summarizing the results for our December quarter are available on our website.
Now let's take a look at our segment results. At our Media Networks segment, revenues in the quarter were up 4% compared with the prior year. Domestic revenues were up slightly, while international revenues grew 25%. Foreign currency headwinds had a 6 percentage point negative impact on international revenues.
Channel 5 contributed 5 percentage points of revenue growth in the quarter. Page 10 of our web deck provides a breakdown of our Media Networks' revenue performance.
In terms of advertising, worldwide revenues were up 3% in the quarter. Domestic revenues were down 6%, and international revenues increased 60%. The growth in international advertising revenues reflects the acquisition of Channel 5 as well as continued growth in the European marketplace. Foreign exchange losses had a 7 percentage point impact on international advertising growth and a 1 percentage point impact on worldwide advertising growth.
In terms of affiliate revenues, domestic revenues were up 8% year-over-year, while international revenues declined 2%. Foreign exchange had a 7 percentage point unfavorable impact on international revenue growth and a 1 percentage point unfavorable impact on worldwide affiliate revenue growth.
Excluding the impact from the timing of product available under certain distribution agreements, domestic affiliate revenues grew high single digits in the quarter. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, the growth in international affiliate revenues was due to new channel launches, increases in subscribers, higher rates as well as the timing of product available under certain distribution agreements.
Expenses increased 9% in the quarter. Within operating expenses, programming expense grew 15%, while distribution and other expenses increased 7%. SG&A expense was flat in the quarter.
Excluding the impact of Channel 5, programming expense increased 6%, while both distribution and other expenses and SG&A expense declined. The decrease in SG&A expense was driven by lower incentive-based compensation.
Media Networks' adjusted operating income was down 1%, while the adjusted operating income margin declined to 42%. Channel 5 contributed about 3 percentage points of operating income growth in the quarter. The margin decline was driven by the 9% growth in expenses, which was partially offset by top line revenue growth of 4%.
Moving to Filmed Entertainment. Filmed Entertainment revenues were up 6% in the quarter, principally due to growth in home entertainment revenues. Page 12 of the web presentation provides a breakdown of Filmed Entertainment revenues.
Theatrical revenues increased 6%, primarily driven by carryover revenues from Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, which were partially offset by lower revenues from the current quarter releases.
Home entertainment revenues grew 16% in the quarter. The increase reflects the performance of the current quarter releases of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Hercules, while there were no titles released in the December quarter of last year.
License fees declined 9% in the quarter due to the mix of available titles.
Filmed Entertainment generated an adjusted operating loss of $60 million in the quarter as compared to a loss of $74 million last year.
Now moving beyond the segment results. Other items reflects a loss of $18 million due to foreign exchange losses. In terms of taxes, the adjusted effective tax rate was 32.3%, reflecting a 120 basis point improvement as compared to prior year. The reduction in the adjusted effective tax rate was principally driven by the mix of domestic and international profitability.
And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Tom."

I'll also cover seasonal factors impacting our 2015 fiscal year.For the quarter, we generated $57 million in free cash flow compared to $278 mil",850,"Thanks, Wade. I'm going to talk about our cash flow, our debt and the return of capital to our shareholders. I'll also cover seasonal factors impacting our 2015 fiscal year.
For the quarter, we generated $57 million in free cash flow compared to $278 million last year. Page 5 of the web deck presentation provides the components of free cash flow. The decline in free cash flow in the quarter was principally due to the higher working capital utilization. Working capital was negatively impacted primarily by production spending for our upcoming film releases, including Terminator: Genisys.
Now moving to our debt. It remains principally fixed rate, with an average cost at quarter end of 4.5%. During the quarter, we took advantage of favorable market conditions and issued $1 billion of senior notes and debentures in a combination of 5- and 20-year maturities. Part of the issuance proceeds will be used to repay the $600 million outstanding of our 1.25% senior notes that come due in February. The new debt was issued at an average rate of 4%.
In terms of our short-term funding. To the extent we have incremental borrowings, we are funding this in the commercial paper marketplace at an annual rate of approximately 35 basis points. At quarter end, we had no variable rate borrowings.
In terms of our leverage. We ended the quarter with $13.8 billion of debt and capital leases outstanding. We had $1.2 billion of cash and cash equivalents. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 3.2x. Taking into consideration the February repayment of the $600 million of our senior notes, our leverage ratio is close to 3x, which is within our targeted range. At December 31, our $2.5 billion bank revolver was undrawn.
During the quarter, we continued to return capital to our shareholders. Between our buyback and dividend programs, we returned a total of $887 million of capital back to our shareholders, and we ended the quarter with 407 million shares outstanding.
For the March quarter, we are on pace to purchase approximately $750 million of our stock, which means that for the first 6 months of the year, we will have returned a total of approximately $1.8 billion to our shareholders.
Now let's turn to some of the factors impacting the remainder of our fiscal year. In terms of affiliate revenue, we continue to see annual growth in the high single-digit to low double-digit range.
Quarterly affiliate revenue will fluctuate, given the timing of transactions and the recognition of revenue related to certain distribution agreements which are tied to product availability. For the March quarter, we anticipate that affiliate revenues will grow mid-single digits as compared to the prior year. For the full year, we expect that the organic growth rate for Media Networks' programming expense will be in the mid-single digits. However, reported programming expense will grow in the mid-teens, factoring in the acquisition of Channel 5. In terms of non-programming expense, we will continue to drive efficiencies throughout the organization in order to preserve our margins.
At Filmed Entertainment, we are excited about our upcoming slate, which includes SpongeBob, Terminator: Genisys and Mission: Impossible V. We continue to expect growth in profits to be weighted to the back half of the fiscal year as the studio benefits from its summer theatrical releases as well as the availability of titles in the pay-TV and home entertainment marketplaces.
For 2015, we are now forecasting a book tax rate of 32.3%. We will continue to refine this as we go through the year and get a better sense of domestic-versus-international profitability mix.
Looking ahead at Paramount's production and development pipeline. The studio is currently in production on Paranormal Activity: The Ghost Dimension; and Daddy's Home, which stars Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg. They will begin production shortly on Ben-Hur, which is a coproduction with MGM; The Ring 3; and a comedy which stars Tina Fey that is being produced by Lorne Michaels. The studio is in development on a number of projects, including sequels to Star Trek, World War Z, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and G.I. Joe.
In terms of TV production, Paramount continues to make great progress, having sold 5 more projects to bring the total number of projects sold to 11. They currently have an additional 10 projects in development.
In summary, we remain focused on growing our businesses organically and investing in our brands and franchises. While we are experiencing a challenging ratings environment, we are working with our partners to more effectively measure consumption of our content, and we are developing ways to monetize viewership where measurement is currently unavailable. We continue to generate strong growth in affiliate fees, and we will manage our cost structure and drive greater efficiencies throughout the organization in order to preserve our core margins. From a capital structure standpoint, we continue to take advantage of the current interest rate environment, locking in long-term financing at very attractive rates. And we remain focused on returning excess capital to our shareholders.

We're seeing pricing being -- for us anyway, being in the teens, up from upfront pricing. Our issue, based on a current Nielsen measurement in the quarter, is availability of impressions for us to sell. So we currently look at domestic advertising in this quarter to be in a comparable range to what we reported for the last quarter. And we are looking to improvement in the back half of the year in domestic ad sales performance, with 3 principal drivers. One is that we are, with new programming and delivery of -- and better delivery of impressions, to increase the number of impressions that we are able to sell. Two, we are looking and working hard to better monetize the impressions that are not being properly monetized. And three, we are continuing to work very closely with the agencies and our customers to drive value through better integrated marketing efforts. We have unique capabilities in that regard. Use of reach data and engagement data through Viacom Velocity and Viacom Echo. So as far as the movement toward better monetization of those impressions, we have a number of initiatives. I've described them in my remarks and in the prior call. And when we talk about the proportion of our ad revenues, which in the last year were 30% non-Nielsen-dependent and, over the next 3 years, we expect that to grow toward the 50% marks, that growth will be driven by monetizing all these impressions that you have on our dot-coms or apps, all the mobile impressions that we will continue to grow very rapidly, including through some of the new services that we will be launching with our telco partners."

As the trajectory of consumer behavior changes, it's only likely going to accelerate with respect to cross-platform viewership and time shifting. So I think the issue that we wonder about is, it seems the advertisers have really defined the C3 parameter for measurement, and the advertisers have limited cross-platform measurement, that kind of identical spot load, which really hurts the headline rating numbers even if online impressions may be healthy. So how much of this is about -- in changing the ratings metric, in changing the ratings, how much of it is about a dialogue with advertisers versus sort of the -- versus the measurement companies?"

We need to improve even in C3. We need to improve just the C3 current measurement. If you look at some of our shows across our networks, whether it's an Awkward or Faking It on MTV, or Drunk History on Comedy Central and many of our other shows, there's a move just within the C3 universe from live viewing to viewing later on. So some of these shows are seeing as much as a 50% lift from the live viewing into C3. And then you have a large proportion of viewing that's not being measured within that C3 window and then -- and viewing outside of the C3 window. So this -- there's obviously been some talk over time about adding to the 3 number, but we're working very closely with the agencies and advertisers alike on more comprehensive measurement tools and working with them to take advantage of the reach we provide, not just on the shows themselves but in social media added on to our viewing, with special integrated marketing executions, sharing our data, sharing our research with them. And so then we're getting a very receptive audience, and we're starting to see some movement there, which, again, will be a factor in improving our monetization going forward."

And different advertisers are moving down the digital road at different speed and the kind of the nature of their product defines the opportunity. A car manufacturer who knows that an individual lease is coming up for renewal in 3 to 6 months. Using that data, combined with knowing what IP address that data -- that person is connected to, would allow you to target ads as that person consumes content from Viacom or our competitors. It's a very, very powerful tool in terms of targeting because that often is informed, not only by the timing of that person's need or demand, but also is informed by the kind of the car they have and whether it's a luxury vehicle or a midsized or a compact. And people are just beginning to understand that and working with their advertising agencies and their partners like Viacom to better take advantage of that information and integrate that into a more informed buy, a much more targeted buy, a much more valuable buy to the advertiser. That's all taking place. That's what dynamic ad insertion is all about. And there's just a plethora of data out there that adds to the value equation. Some advertisers, like the ones I just mentioned, are very sophisticated and beginning to use it. Others are beginning to figure out ways on how it might apply to their product. But we're in -- as Philippe said earlier, we're in conversations across the industry with multiple agencies, dealing with multiple measurement metrics that reflect more appropriately that advertiser's targeting -- defined targeted customer. And how -- and this is just the beginning of this whole evolution and whole understanding as to the metrics that are now available in the marketplace and how they'll begin to change this. But the key thing is to get there, work with those advertisers, understand their products and understand how we can bring, connect them to consumers interested in consuming their products."

Thanks for joining us to discuss the second quarter of our 2015 fiscal year. Viacom continued to successfully execute on our strategy this quarter and made significant changes to better align Viacom's operations",2973,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us to discuss the second quarter of our 2015 fiscal year. Viacom continued to successfully execute on our strategy this quarter and made significant changes to better align Viacom's operations with new opportunities in our industry around the world.
First, let's take a look at our financial performance in the quarter. Revenues declined 3% to $3.08 billion as increases in Media Networks' revenues were more than offset by declines in Filmed Entertainment and the impact of foreign exchange. Absent an unfavorable 2% impact of foreign exchange, overall revenues declined 1%. Quarterly adjusted operating income declined 6%, and adjusted net earnings were $467 million. Adjusted earnings per share increased by 7% to $1.16, the highest ever for our March quarter. Advertising revenues increased 4% in the quarter. Domestic ad sales at our Media Networks declined 5% compared to last year, due primarily to lower ratings. International ad sales grew 80% due largely to the contributions of Channel 5 in the U.K. Affiliate revenues rose 3%. Domestic affiliate revenues rose 5%, more than offsetting a decline in international affiliate revenues that was driven by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange. Results in the quarter included a $784 million charge related to our previously announced strategic realignment designed to better capture the opportunities in a changing market and achieve significant strategic and operational improvements.
Earlier this month, we also announced a temporary pause in the buyback to ensure that we continue to operate within our leverage target. We remain strongly committed to returning value to shareholders. And as we also announced earlier, expect that we will resume the buyback no later than the start of our next fiscal year.
As has been our practice the last several years, we also intend to recommend an increase in our dividend when our board convenes at the end of next month.
Turning back to the realignment. Among the changes we made was the reorganization of 4 domestic Media Networks' divisions into 3 groups, with outstanding leadership and a simplified structure that realigns sales, marketing, creative and support functions, increases efficiencies in program and product development, enhances opportunities to share expertise and promotes greater cross-channel marketing and programming activity.
At Paramount, we reduced overhead and infrastructure related to international home entertainment by entering into a partnership to distribute our DVD and Blu-ray product overseas. In addition, we reallocated resources throughout the company to expand our capabilities in data analysis, technology development and research, which are the key to success in our rapidly changing marketplace. Our strategic realignment will generate substantial cost savings. We expect to realize $175 million in net savings through the end of fiscal 2015 and achieve an annual run rate of $350 million in net savings starting in the next fiscal year.
As you know, many of Viacom's brands are most popular among younger, digital-native demos, and we has stepped up to the challenge that these early adopters present. We are moving rapidly to fully align ourselves and our partners with the consumption preferences and entertainment experiences that our audiences demand. Make no mistake. These changes are part of a far-reaching strategy to transform Viacom into a creatively centered, fully multiplatform content company. We were among the first in our industry to call out the transformational shifts that we saw on the horizon. We were among the first to join with existing and new distribution partners to explore innovative and new platforms. We were among the first to transform our program in ways that recognize and embrace the new pathways to discovery and fandom that define the behavior of our young audiences. We were among the first to deeply embed data insights into our core operations and use those insights to accelerate the transformation of our advertising as measured and monetized. In many of these important areas, we are well ahead of the industry. In fact, our advanced and proprietary data insights are already producing innovative deals with major advertisers, with many more in the pipeline. As we have discussed previously, we are moving away as rapidly as possible from traditional methods of measurement and towards a more meaningful and powerful dynamic intelligence platform that enables our marketing partners to tap into the unique cultural connections our content has with the consumers they want to reach. Our velocity and echo ad initiatives, as well as the recently launched Viacom Vantage, are leading the way and redefining how advertisers connect with our audiences and more fundamentally how ratings success will be defined in the coming television landscape. I'll talk about the transformational promise of Viacom Vantage in a moment.
But first, I'd like to take a moment to talk more specifically about the shifts we see in the programming marketplace and how Viacom is prepared to capitalize on these opportunities. Our distribution relationships remain broad and strong. We have long-term agreements with most of our major distributors. We look forward to successfully concluding negotiations with those partners whose agreements are up sooner. As I mentioned earlier, advances in technology provide even more options for television subscribers. And although the path can be complicated, we are finding a great deal of common ground with MVPDs and working with them on flexible digital delivery.
Consumption is changing a variety of ways and levels we haven't seen before. Audiences are looking for new, high-quality content and have an expectation to watch and interact with it on their schedule and on the device of their choosing. In addition, as mentioned earlier, marketers are becoming increasingly interested in the opportunities that data provides to reach their consumers in more focused and more effective ways. As you know, we have been filling our Media Networks pipeline with unique, high-quality programming and positioned for success in this environment. Massive culture-defining event tentpoles like the VMA, the BET Experience and Nickelodeon's Kids' Choice awards, Cinematic Series such as MTV's Teen Wolf and the highly anticipated Tut and Scream and programming like Broad City and Lip Sync Battle with monetize-able digital footprints exponentially larger than their substantial television viewership. And while we are thriving on new platforms, our channels continue to show strength in the traditional linear television world. On a Nielsen basis this past quarter, we are the #1 cable network family among viewers 2 to 49, 18 to 49 and 2 plus, among other demos. And Viacom leads with 8 of the top 30 cable networks with viewers 18 to 49. And as I noted in previous calls, we have also set a goal to grow our non-Nielsen-dependent ad revenues from 30% today to 50% in 3 years. We continue to make progress on that path with industry-leading marketing and data capabilities that build on our deep knowledge of audiences and consumer behavior and a goal of exceptional value for marketers.
Viacom Vantage, for example, delivers unmatched audience intelligence for television advertisers, providing insights and targeting that go far beyond the traditional age and gender benchmarks of legacy rating systems. This unique approach integrates our own robust portfolio of first-party data with data from multiple third-party sources, creating targeting programs that give advertisers the precision to customize the audience they want to reach and clear guidance to pinpoint what shows best deliver the highest concentration of that target audiences. While others are beginning their data journey, Viacom Vantage has already successfully piloted with several major advertisers. And that list is growing as we engage in upfront discussions. And this is just the first step. As the distribution technology improves and large-scale dynamic ad insertion becomes a commercial reality, targeting will become more sophisticated, leading to individually targeted advertising across every platform where Viacom content appears. We are happy that the industry is following our lead. Our programming thrives on digital and VOD platforms. For example, our programming accounts for 26% of all on-demand viewing on MVPD platforms. And several of our programs, most recently Key and Peele, have each generated more than 1 billion lifetime digital streams. This means we have tremendous revenue upside and are poised to lead the charge into this exciting new era of data-driven, results-based advertising. I'll give you an example. Comedy Central's Broad City is one of the network's new success stories. In the quarter, the series maintained its strong Nielsen ratings from its debut season 1 year ago. Season 2 was #1 in its timeslot across all television for men 18 to 34 and up 21% with women 18 to 34. As important, its digital growth was explosive. Total digital video streams across all platforms were up by a multiple of 10, with 7 million streams originating on Viacom-owned platforms alone. Its viewing on cable VOD was up 55% over last year. We're thrilled with the response and the opportunity for data-driven marketing, and the monetization that follows is growing. The Comedy Central Roast of Justin Bieber was another strong linear performance supplemented by record-setting digital success. The Roast was #1 in critical demos, adults 18 to 24 and 18 to 34. And it represented the best day in a decade for Comedy Central among women 18 to 34. On digital, the Bieber Roast generated 26 million streams on Viacom sites and apps, with more than 400,000 live streams. And it drove the highest single day of downloads for the Comedy Central app. On social platforms, this one program generated approximately 7 billion impressions. Overall, Comedy Central continues to hit its stride with strong talent, aggressive distribution and a commitment to let programming find its rhythm and succeed. The network currently has the 3 highest-rated, late-night talk shows among men 18 to 34 in all of television, including broadcast. The Nightly Show and @midnight are already proven successes, and we are looking forward to the final 3 months of John Stewart on The Daily Show and for Trevor Noah, bringing his distinct take to a new generation of Daily Show viewers.
SPIKE is also on a hot streak, with a monster hit Lip Sync Battle, which premiered at the beginning of the current quarter and has already been renewed with fantastic talent fighting to participate in future episodes. Including DVR playback, the series averages 3.2 million viewers per episode and has driven millions of streams across our owned and operated digital properties and over 120 million digital clip views on all platforms. The series premiere was #1 in its timeslot with adults 18 to 49 and the second most-watched telecast for SPIKE ever. We've also been successful syndicating the series on other Viacom networks. Aggregating viewership on SPIKE, MTV and BET, Lip Sync Battle captured approximately 40 million Nielsen viewers for the first 5 episodes. Lip Sync Battle also is delivering on SPIKE's new broader audience strategy that looks beyond the brand's core male demographic. The show brought 1.5 million women to the network, a large number of whom did not previously watch SPIKE. And certain episodes delivered a predominantly female audience. Our investment in SPIKE's new positioning will become even more evident in the months ahead. We're developing high-quality programming with big stars and great production values. The network's highly anticipated epic miniseries, Tut, premiers in July, and advertising has already completely sold out. And the pipeline is full. Among the series and miniseries currently in development, we have Pierce Brosnan's crusaders, War at the Shore, Red Mars, and the recently announced Harvest, executive produced by Jerry Bruckheimer. Of course, we're continuing to build on the network's reality successes. Ink Master, Catch A Contractor and Bar Rescue have all been strong performers for the network. And they're all coming back soon. Nickelodeon was once again #1 in Kids 2 to 11, driving success with longtime hits and innovative new programming. Bella and The Bulldogs joined Saturday Night's very strong lineup and was the top show for kids 6 to 11. In preschool, Monster Machines and PAW Patrol are driving ratings success, with consumer products not far behind. Nickelodeon launched Harvey Bewkes and Make It Pop to strong starts and wrapped up the quarter with another outstanding Kids' Choice Awards that maintained the tentpole strong ratings track record. And the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles continue to thrive with the #1 boys' consumer products property and a new movie already in production that will take the franchise to a whole new level.
Kids love watching our programming on TV. In fact, Nickelodeon brands reached more kids 2 to 11 every Saturday morning than YouTube does in a month. And there's a lot on deck as we move forward into this quarter and beyond. Nickelodeon will launch a new live-action series, 100 Things To Do Before High School. A movie special for this new property aired to great response in the fall, and we're very optimistic about its series run. This summer, we're premiering 20 brand-new SpongeBob episodes and the second Annual Kids' Choice Sports Awards, hosted by Seahawks quarterback, Russell Wilson. As I mentioned on the last call, Nickelodeon recently launched its Noggin Over the Top app, an innovative new way to connect with our audience. It has been very well received by consumers. In the March quarter, MTV saw the successful returns of its hit scripted drama, Finding Carter, and the newest installment of the Teen Mom franchise. At its Upfront presentation last week in New York, the network unveiled a new programming slate of 10 new and 9 returning series and previewed some of its more than 100 projects currently in development. Among the highlights are MTV's television series reinvention of the horror film franchise, Scream, premiering June 30, and its ambitious sci-fi fantasy series, the Shannara Chronicles, which is currently in production in New Zealand under executive producer, Jon Favreau. At the other end of the development spectrum, MTV is increasing its output of format-driven comedy series like the recently renewed Broke Ass Game Show and a forthcoming animation showcase, Greatest Party Story Ever. Series like this are topical and highly clip-able, enabling them to migrate well into the mobile and social spaces. This migration and all of MTV's multiscreen programming are powered by the engine of its growing, Always On initiative. Through Always On, MTV continues to harness the power of its more than 220 million social media fans. And all the data we collect from those connections to create content across platforms in real-time bring greater urgency and topicality to the brand and offering new, innovative advertiser opportunities.
Perhaps the most exciting sustained growth opportunity for Viacom is our rapidly expanding international Media Networks business. We are dramatically expanding our footprint and building major businesses across every continent. Our newest brand, the UK's Channel 5, continues to outperform other commercial free-to-air U.K. networks in the second fiscal quarter of 2015, with share of viewers 16 to 34 increasing 7% over the previous year. In fact, Channel 5 was also the only major commercial network in the U.K. to grow share in the quarter, building a strong competitive performance in 2014. SPIKE, our next global television brand, successfully launched in the U.K. this month. SPIKE U.K.'s first night average was 9x higher than the last comparable channel launch on free-to-air TV, Turners True TV. Since the launch, a total of 7 million viewers have tuned in to watch SPIKE U.K. The U.K. is an important market for Viacom with significant opportunities for growth. It has also become an important content factory for us, second only to the U.S., to fuel our growth around the world. Our international group also launched the Paramount Channel in Poland in the quarter, bringing Paramount Channel to a total of 63 countries around the world. In just 3 years, we've grown this brand to almost 70 million homes, 10 languages, across 20 time zones. Paramount Channel is now the most-watched, ad-supported international multichannel. And we're just beginning.
Moving onto movie studio. Paramount Pictures delivered a strong debut for its animation division. The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water was an international box office success and a demonstration of the powerful combination of Paramount Animation's capabilities and our unmatched marketing expertise. And we're looking ahead to a summer of proven franchises and massive star power. Arnold Schwarzenegger is back as the Terminator in the wildly anticipated Terminator: Genisys set to open on July 1. This fresh take, also starring Emilia Clarke of Game of Thrones fame, brings a new twist to a legendary franchise. Later in July, Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation hits the screen, starring Tom Cruise and Jeremy Renner and directed by Chris Macquarie. Tom Cruise remains at the top of his game, and this film is certain to be a blockbuster.
Paramount Television is steadily building a TV studio committed to developing and selling great content with some of the most distinguished creative talent in the business today. Networks and online distributing partners include Fox, HBO, EPIX, Amazon, U.S.A., Hulu as well as Comedy Central, MTV and Nickelodeon.
In conclusion, I have a great deal of confidence in the future of Viacom. We are transforming the company to fully capture the many opportunities created by the changing media landscape and to fuel growth initiatives with big potential. We are unleashing the value of our television brands to invest in more original content, creative marketing initiatives, better measurement and data-driven monetization, mobile initiatives, significant international expansion. At Paramount, with a richer development program, great film franchises and the further building of our animation and television production initiatives, we can look forward to renewed growth in the years ahead. By leading the charge, we are extremely well positioned to be among the first to benefit as the industry transition takes hold. And as it does, we look forward to delivering superior returns to our shareholders for many years to come.
And now I'd like to turn the call over to Wade."

Before I take you through our operating results, I want to note that our earnings release and web presentation summarizing the results for our March quarter are available on our website. The results that I will discuss have been adjusted",605,"Thanks, Philippe. Before I take you through our operating results, I want to note that our earnings release and web presentation summarizing the results for our March quarter are available on our website. The results that I will discuss have been adjusted to exclude the restructuring and programming charges of $784 million that were incurred in the March quarter.
Now let's take a look at our segment results. At our Media Networks segment, revenues in the quarter were up 3% compared with the prior year. Domestic revenues were flat, while international revenues grew 23%. Excluding a 13% unpaid rule impact from foreign currency, international revenues were up 36%. Channel 5 contributed 31 percentage points to international revenue growth in the quarter. Page 11 of our web deck provides a breakdown of our Media Networks' revenue performance.
In terms of advertising, worldwide revenues were up 4% in the quarter. Domestic revenues were down 5% and international revenues increased 80%. The increase in international advertising was driven by growth in Europe, principally from Channel 5. Foreign exchange losses had a 17 percentage point impact on international advertising growth and a 2 percentage point impact on worldwide advertising growth.
In terms of affiliate revenues, worldwide revenues were up 3%. Domestic revenues were up 5% in the quarter, while international revenues declined 8%. Foreign exchange had a 13 percentage point unfavorable impact on international revenue growth and a 2 percentage point unfavorable impact on worldwide affiliate revenue growth. Excluding the impact from the timing of product available under certain distribution agreements, domestic affiliate revenues grew mid to high single digits in the quarter. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, international affiliate revenues grew as a result of new channel launches, increases in subscribers, as well as the timing of product available under certain distribution agreements.
Expenses increased 9% in the quarter. Within operating expenses, programming expense grew 10% while distribution and other expenses increased 23%. SG&A expense was up 4% in the quarter. Increases in expenses were principally driven by the acquisition of Channel 5. Excluding the impact of Channel 5, total expenses were flat in the quarter, with growth in SG&A expense driven by higher advertising and promotion expense, principally related to the marketing of new original series and specials.
Media Networks' adjusted operating income was down 5%, while the adjusted operating income margin declined to 36.8%. The margin decline was driven by the 9% growth in expenses, partially offset by top line revenue growth of 3%.
Moving to Filmed Entertainment. Revenues were down 21% in the quarter, principally due to decreases in home entertainment and licensed revenues. Page 13 of the web presentation provides a breakdown of Filmed Entertainment revenues. Theatrical revenues decreased 10% as lower carryover revenues from prior period releases were partially offset by our current quarter releases, including The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water. Home entertainment revenues declined 25%, principally due to the lower revenues from the current quarter and prior period releases. License fees declined 32% in the quarter due to the number and mix of available titles. Filmed Entertainment generated adjusted operating income of $1 million in the quarter as compared to $11 million last year.
Now moving beyond the segment results. Other items principally reflect a loss of $10 million due to foreign exchange losses. In terms of taxes, the year-to-date adjusted effective tax rate was 31.8%, reflecting a 120 basis point improvement as compared to the prior year. The reduction in the adjusted effective tax rate was principally driven by the mix of domestic and international profitability.
And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Tom."

I'm going to talk about our cash flow, our debt and return of capital to our shareholders. I'll also cover seasonal factors impacting the remainder of our 2015 fiscal year. For the quarter, we generated $598 million in free cash flow compare",781,"Thanks, Wade. I'm going to talk about our cash flow, our debt and return of capital to our shareholders. I'll also cover seasonal factors impacting the remainder of our 2015 fiscal year. For the quarter, we generated $598 million in free cash flow compared to $524 million free cash flow last year. Page 6 of the web deck presentation provides the components of free cash flow. The increase in free cash flow in the quarter was principally due to lower cash taxes, partially offset by higher working capital utilization. Cash taxes benefited from provisions allowing for accelerated deductions related to domestic film and TV production expense. Working capital was principally impacted by higher programming spend at Media Networks.
Now moving to our debt. It remained principally fixed rate with an average cost at quarter end of 4.7%. We used part of the proceeds from the $1 billion of fixed-rate debt we issued back in December to repay a $600 million outstanding of our 1.25% senior notes that came due in February. As for our variable-rate borrowings, at quarter end, we had $75 million of commercial paper outstanding.
In terms of our leverage, we ended the quarter with $13.2 billion of total debt and $306 million of cash and cash equivalents. The decrease in cash from the December quarter reflects the repayment of the senior notes that matured in February. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 3.1x. At March 31, our $2.5 million -- $2.5 billion bank revolver was undrawn. During the quarter, between our buyback and our dividend programs, we returned a total of $885 million of capital back to our shareholders, and we ended the quarter with 397 million shares outstanding. If you include our April dividend payment, we have returned a total of $1.9 billion to shareholders in the fiscal year, which is a return on market cap of approximately 7%.
Now let's turn to some of the factors impacting the remainder of our fiscal year. In terms of our affiliate revenue, quarterly revenue will fluctuate, given the timing of transaction and the recognition of revenue related to certain distribution agreements which are tied to product availability. Accordingly, for the June quarter, we anticipate that affiliate revenues will be relatively flat as compared to the prior year. However, we expect affiliate revenue will grow double digit in the September quarter. For the full year, we expect that our -- the organic growth rate for Media Networks' programming expense will be in the mid-single digits. However, factoring in the acquisition of Channel 5, reported programming expense will grow in the mid-teen. For 2015, we are now forecasting a book tax rate of 31.8%.
At Filmed Entertainment, we're excited about our summer slate, which includes Terminator: Genisys and Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation. For the June quarter, given that these films will be released later in the quarter with significant worldwide P&A expense, we anticipate difficult bottom line comparisons to the prior year. In the September quarter, we expect the studio will generate significant profits as they benefit from the carryover performance of these summer tentpoles as well as the availability of titles in the pay TV and syndication marketplaces.
Looking ahead at Paramount's production and development pipeline. The studio is currently in production on a number of projects including Zoolander 2, which stars Ben Stiller, Owen Wilson and Will Ferrell. Ben-Hur, which is a coproduction with MGM; and The Big Short, an adaptation of Michael Lewis's book, starring Brad Pitt, Steve Carrell, Christian Bale and Ryan Gosling. The second installment of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles recently went into production. And this summer, the studio starts production on Star Trek 3. Paramount is in development on a number of sequels to existing franchises including World War Z, Jack Reacher and the recently announced sequel to the SpongeBob movie.
In summary, the industry is evolving, and we have taken significant steps to realign our business to position the company to meet the challenges that lay ahead. By rethinking how we operate, we have reduced our cost structure, enabling us to invest in our brands and technology, while preserving our core margins. We are investing to enhance our capabilities to monetize our content outside of traditional measurements. We continue to develop specialized ad sales products, which enable us to monetize our consumers in innovative ways and provide our advertisers with new targeting capabilities to drive efficiency in their marketing campaigns. We remain committed to returning excess capital to our shareholders through our dividend and buyback programs, while at the same time, maintaining our investment-grade status.
With that, I would like to turn the call over to your questions. Operator?"

They've always been available, by the way, the -- what people are calling skinny bundles, used to be called family tiers. And there's always a place for bringing consumers into the television ecosystem. In many cases, young people getting into it, and over time, upgrading to larger packages. There's no greater value in existence today as has been demonstrated in a number of studies of how the pricing works and what you get for the money. There's no greater value than the firehose of programming that you get by getting a broad bundle, which can be marketing -- marketed in a way that with promotional value to give consumers good value. Today, consumers get more original programming on television than they've ever gotten before. There are hundreds of shows across television including our own that get much more viewership than many of the shows that are touted out there on pure online delivery. And the functionality keeps getting better. We believe that functionality, the ability to view linear television, on-demand television on different devices and different places is revolutionary for consumers. And we're working very closely with our partners to build that value. At the same time, we're willing, as we always have been, to engage with our distributor partners in smaller bundles, again to bring people into the ecosystem. A lot has been talked about in this arena. A lot of hype about it. I don't think that's going to be a very significant change in the overall value proposition that exists in television today. We have, as I mentioned in my remarks, the #1 family of cable networks across just about every demo, except when you get to the really older demos. And as we continue to invest in original programming, all of our networks will keep getting better and better. And we'll work with our distributors and look at innovative ways to engage consumers."

So I'll just give you the example in the kids and family group. By putting together with Nick at Nite, TV Land and CMT, we now have a broad portfolio of more family-oriented networks where we can cross-fertilize program development and even the acquisitions can play across several networks. And the cross-promotion opportunities are obvious, in that case. I see, for example, CMT being able to tap a more -- a much more logical group of shows that are developed for Nick at Nite, TV Land to appeal to that heartland audience, which is a growth opportunity for us, and to orient the development of CMT toward a more wholesome feel rather than have some of the programming which was more connected to MTV and really didn't take CMT to a broader direction. I think it's a great potential to grow. And we have a show like Younger. Younger, which has only had 4 episodes airing. We've aired it on -- it was created for TV Land. We've aired it on Nick at Nite. We put it in other venues. It's a great show. It's building fandom. We've had 24 million views across our platforms of Younger episodes. And that show, that's a greater performance of any of the big hits that somebody asked about SVOD earlier. The biggest hits on SVOD do not have that kind of performance [indiscernible] 4 shows in. So being able to expose Younger across these different platforms will help the show grow justify investment in more and more original programming. And we can also be more judicious in how we acquire the third-party programming for those networks and get more value for that. So it's a big evolution going forward. This is not just about saving cost, although we are saving cost. It's about growing revenue. And I think we will see the results of that in fairly short order."

One, delayed viewing, particularly if it's fairly near term, time shift is viewing, still is very valuable to advertisers. And in fact, connection -- we want programming that creates engagement that -- and that creates that urgency, that connection, and then having the advertiser be part of that connection with the audience something they're passionate about, reaching a fan of Teen Wolf or Tyler Posey in Teen Wolf. That's a very valuable connection that we often, not just on our VMA kind of events. But in moving to original programming, in moving to scripted, those are events. Those are people -- people are engaging with the characters on the shows and that you see the same across television. So this big shift that we're making toward increasing the level of production of original programming, making it more relevant across all of our networks, adding to our creative talent, adding to the Always On capability at MTV, having our content live on mobile as well as the big screen at home, capturing our fans on mobile where they live, being able to monetize that connection. That's the -- that's where the TV marketplace is going to. And as I said in my remarks, we are leading the charge. We are orienting our entire organization to doing that. When we did the realignment, yes, we saved money by looking at how we are organized, but we are also investing in our people. We're bringing in new people. We're really building up our human resources to drive Viacom Vantage, these other initiatives. We're building up our programming resources. We're building up our capabilities at mobile. So we're reorienting our organization, our programming and our human resources to really be a major beneficiary of the transformation and how people are enjoying content. And the good news is they are enjoying more and more of it. So we are becoming less reliant on those part of our programming write-downs, less reliant on that old, not-so-relevant programming that we had acquired years ago. We said goodbye to that, and we're saying hello to a lot of new, more engaging, more live in terms of participation kind of television content for our new audiences."

Some people like studios don't need the advertising after 3 or 4 days. It's not as relevant or not as valuable to them. But other advertisers, with the adding data to the conversation with them, are very, very interested in reaching the right consumer around the right content. And the right content is being constantly redefined as data allows us to demonstrate who might be a heavy consumer of fast-food product. Obviously, much more relevant to people who sell fast food. And we're now able to connect the dots and provide very hard data around which audiences are much more able to deliver heavy consumers of fast-food product or who might be people -- we can actually target for people concentrations of audiences that are not subscribers to their current product. In other words, they don't want to reach people who currently subscribe or advertise their current product. They'd like to be -- get people that don't subscribe to them. And through data, we are beginning to be able to more precisely target audiences that are not current customers to give them the opportunity to get in front of more potential new customers. So that is really what our conversations are taking up most of the time in our conversations with advertisers. To supplement, Philippe commented on on how that conversation is evolving very quickly. And it doesn't seem to be at all focused on whether the show is a live show or are the recently of the airing of the show. It's much more to the quality of the audiences you're putting in front of them."

Thanks for joining us to discuss the second quarter of our 2015 fiscal year. Viacom continued to successfully execute on our strategy this quarter and made significant changes to better align Viacom's operations",2990,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us to discuss the second quarter of our 2015 fiscal year. Viacom continued to successfully execute on our strategy this quarter and made significant changes to better align Viacom's operations with new opportunities in our industry around the world.
First, let's take a look at our financial performance in the quarter. Revenues declined 3% to $3.08 billion, as increases in Media Networks' revenues were more than offset by declines in Filmed Entertainment and the impact of foreign exchange. Absent an unfavorable 2% impact of foreign exchange, overall revenues declined 1%. Quarterly adjusted operating income declined 6%, and adjusted net earnings were $467 million. Adjusted earnings per share increased by 7% to $1.16, the highest ever for our March quarter.
Advertising revenues increased 4% in the quarter. Domestic ad sales at our Media Networks declined 5% compared to last year, due primarily to lower ratings. International ad sales grew 80%, due largely to the contributions of Channel 5 in the U.K. Affiliate revenues rose 3%. Domestic affiliate revenues rose 5%, more than offsetting a decline in international affiliate revenues that was driven by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange.
Results in the quarter included a $784 million charge related to our previously announced strategic realignment designed to better capture the opportunities in a changing market and achieve significant strategic and operational improvements.
Earlier this month, we also announced a temporary pause in the buyback to ensure that we continue to operate within our leverage target. We remain strongly committed to returning value to shareholders, and as we also announced earlier, expect that we will resume the buyback no later than the start of our next fiscal year.
As has been our practice the last several years, we also intend to recommend an increase in our dividend when our board convenes at the end of next month.
Turning back to the realignment. Among the changes we made was the reorganization of 4 domestic Media Networks' divisions into 3 groups, with outstanding leadership and a simplified structure that realigns sales, marketing, creative and support functions; increases efficiencies in program and product development; enhances opportunities to share expertise and promotes greater cross-channel marketing and programming activity.
At Paramount, we reduced overhead and infrastructure related to international home entertainment by entering into a partnership to distribute our DVD and Blu-ray product overseas. In addition, we reallocated resources throughout the company to expand our capabilities in data analysis, technology development and research, which are the key to success in our rapidly changing marketplace.
Our strategic realignment will generate substantial cost savings. We expect to realize $175 million in net savings through the end of fiscal 2015 and achieve an annual run rate of $350 million in net savings starting in the next fiscal year.
As you know, many of Viacom's brands are most popular among younger, digital-native demos, and we has stepped up to the challenge that these early adopters present. We are moving rapidly to fully align ourselves and our partners with the consumption preferences and entertainment experiences that our audiences demand.
Make no mistake. These changes are part of a far-reaching strategy to transform Viacom into a creatively centered, fully multiplatform content company. We were among the first in our industry to call out the transformational shifts that we saw on the horizon. We were among the first to join with existing and new distribution partners to explore innovative and new platforms. We were among the first to transform our program in ways that recognized and embraced the new pathways to discovery and fandom that defined the behavior of our young audiences.
We were among the first to deeply embed data insights into our core operations and use those insights to accelerate the transformation of our advertising as measured and monetized. In many of these important areas, we are well ahead of the industry. In fact, our advanced and proprietary data insights are already producing innovative deals with major advertisers with many more in the pipeline.
As we have discussed previously, we are moving away as rapidly as possible from traditional methods of measurement and towards a more meaningful and powerful dynamic intelligence platform that enables our marketing partners to tap into the unique cultural connections our content has with the consumers they want to reach. Our Velocity and Echo ad initiatives as well as the recently launched Viacom Vantage are leading the way and redefining how advertisers connect with our audiences, and more fundamentally, how rating success will be defined in the coming television landscape. I'll talk about the transformational promise of Viacom Vantage in a moment.
But first, I'd like to take a moment to talk more specifically about the shifts we see in the programming marketplace and how Viacom is prepared to capitalize on these opportunities. Our distribution relationships remain broad and strong. We have long-term agreements with most of our major distributors. We look forward to successfully concluding negotiations with those partners whose agreements are up sooner. As I mentioned earlier, advances in technology provide even more options for television subscribers, and although the path can be complicated, we are finding a great deal of common ground with MVPDs in working with them on flexible digital delivery.
Consumption is changing in a variety of ways and at levels we haven't seen before. Audiences are looking for new, high-quality content and have an expectation to watch and interact with it on their schedule and on the device of their choosing. In addition, as mentioned earlier, marketers are becoming increasingly interested in the opportunities that data provides to reach their consumers in more focused and more effective ways.
As you know, we had been filling our Media Networks pipeline with unique, high-quality programming that is positioned for success in this environment. Massive culture-defining event tentpoles like the VMA, the BET Experience and Nickelodeon's Kids' Choice Awards, cinematic series such as MTV's Teen Wolf and the highly anticipated Tut and Scream and programming like Broad City and Lip Sync Battle with monetizable digital footprints exponentially larger than their substantial television viewership.
And while we are thriving on new platforms, our channels continue to show strength in the traditional linear television world. On a Nielsen basis this past quarter, we are the #1 cable network family among viewers 2 to 49, 18 to 49 and 2 plus, among other demos. And Viacom leads with 8 of the top 30 cable networks with viewers 18 to 49. And as I noted in previous calls, we have also set a goal to grow our non-Nielsen-dependent ad revenues from 30% today to 50% in 3 years. We continue to make progress on that path with industry-leading marketing and data capabilities that build on our deep knowledge of audiences and consumer behavior and a goal of exceptional value for marketers.
Viacom Vantage, for example, delivers unmatched audience intelligence for television advertisers, providing insights and targeting that go far beyond the traditional age and gender benchmarks of legacy rating systems. This unique approach integrates our own robust portfolio of first-party data with data from multiple third-party sources, creating targeting programs that give advertisers the precision to customize the audience they want to reach and clear guidance to pin point what shows best deliver the highest concentration of that target audiences. While others are beginning their data journey, Viacom Vantage has already successfully piloted with several major advertisers, and that list is growing as we engage in upfront discussions. And this is just the first step.
As the distribution technology improves and large-scale dynamic ad insertion becomes a commercial reality, targeting will become more sophisticated, leading to individually targeted advertising across every platform where Viacom content appears. We are happy that the industry is following our lead. Our programming thrives on digital and VOD platforms.
For example, our programming accounts for 26% of all on-demand viewing on MVPD platforms. And several of our programs, most recently Key & Peele, have each generated more than 1 billion lifetime digital streams. This means we have tremendous revenue upside and are poised to lead the charge into this exciting new era of data-driven, results-based advertising.
I'll give you an example. Comedy Central's Broad City is one of the network's new success stories. In the quarter, the series maintained its strong Nielsen ratings from its debut season 1 year ago. Season 2 was #1 in its time slot across all television for men 18 to 34 and up 21% with women 18 to 34. As important, its digital growth was explosive. Total digital video streams across all platforms were up by a multiple of 10, with 7 million streams originating on Viacom-owned platforms alone. Its viewing on cable VOD was up 55% over last year.
We're thrilled with the response and the opportunity for data-driven marketing, and the monetization that follows is growing. The Comedy Central Roast of Justin Bieber was another strong linear performance supplemented by record-setting digital success. The Roast was #1 in critical demos, adults 18 to 24 and 18 to 34. And it represented the best day in a decade for Comedy Central among women 18 to 34. On digital, the Bieber Roast generated 26 million streams on Viacom sites and apps, with more than 400,000 live streams, and it drove the highest single day of downloads for the Comedy Central app. On social platforms, this one program generated approximately 7 billion impressions.
Overall, Comedy Central continues to hit its stride with the strong talent, aggressive distribution and a commitment to let programming find its rhythm and succeed. The network currently has the 3 highest-rated, late-night talk shows among men 18 to 34 in all of television, including broadcast. The Nightly Show and @midnight are already proven successes, and we are looking forward to the final 3 months of Jon Stewart on The Daily Show and the Trevor Noah, bringing his distinct take to a new generation of Daily Show viewers.
SPIKE is also on a hot streak with the monster hit Lip Sync Battle, which premiered at the beginning of the current quarter and has already been renewed with fantastic talent fighting to participate in future episodes. Including DVR playback, the series averages 3.2 million viewers per episode and has driven millions of streams across our owned and operated digital properties and over 120 million digital clip views on all platforms. The series premiere was #1 in its time slot with adults 18 to 49 and the second most-watched telecast for SPIKE ever. We've also been successful syndicating the series on other Viacom networks.
Aggregating viewership on SPIKE, MTV and BET, Lip Sync Battle captured approximately 40 million Nielsen viewers for the first 5 episodes. Lip Sync Battle also is delivering on SPIKE's new broader audience strategy that looks beyond the brand's core male demographic. The show brought 1.5 million women to the network, a large number of whom did not previously watch SPIKE, and certain episodes delivered a predominantly female audience. Our investment in SPIKE's new positioning will become even more evident in the months ahead.
We're developing high-quality programming with big stars and great production values. The network's highly anticipated epic miniseries, Tut, premiers in July and advertising has already completely sold out. And the pipeline is full. Among the series and miniseries currently in development, we have Pierce Brosnan's Crusaders, War at the Shore, Red Mars, and the recently announced Harvest, executive produced by Jerry Bruckheimer.
Of course, we're continuing to build on the network's reality successes. Ink Master, Catch A Contractor and Bar Rescue have all been strong performers for the network, and they're all coming back soon. Nickelodeon was once again #1 in kids 2 to 11, driving success with long-time hits and innovative new programming. Bella and The Bulldogs joined Saturday Night's very strong lineup and was the top show for kids 6 to 11. In preschool, Blaze and the Monster Machines and PAW Patrol are driving rating success, with consumer products not far behind.
Nickelodeon launched Harvey Beaks and Make It Pop to strong starts and wrapped up the quarter with another outstanding Kids' Choice Awards that maintained the tentpole strong ratings track record. And the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles continued to thrive with the #1 boys' consumer products property and a new movie already in production that will take the franchise to a whole new level.
Kids love watching our programming on TV. In fact, Nickelodeon brands reached more kids 2 to 11 every Saturday morning than YouTube does in a month. And there's a lot on deck as we move forward into this new quarter and beyond. Nickelodeon will launch a new live action series, 100 Things to Do Before High School. A movie special for this new property aired to great response in the fall, and we're very optimistic about its series run. This summer, we're premiering 20 brand new SpongeBob episodes and the second annual Kids' Choice Sports Awards hosted by Seahawks quarterback, Russell Wilson.
As I mentioned on the last call, Nickelodeon recently launched its Noggin over-the-top app, an innovative new way to connect with our audience. It has been very well received by consumers.
In the March quarter, MTV saw the successful returns of its hit scripted drama, Finding Carter, and the newest installment of the Teen Mom franchise. At its Upfront presentation last week in New York, the network unveiled a new programming slate of 10 new and 9 returning series and previewed some of its more than 100 projects currently in development. Among the highlights are MTV's television series reinvention of the horror film franchise, Scream, premiering June 30; and its ambitious sci-fi fantasy series, The Shannara Chronicles, which is currently in production in New Zealand under executive producer, Jon Favreau.
At the other end of the development spectrum, MTV is increasing its output of format-driven comedy series like the recently renewed Broke A$$ Game Show and the forthcoming animation showcase, Greatest Party Story Ever. Series like these are topical and highly clippable, enabling them to migrate well into the mobile and social spaces. This migration and all of MTV's multiscreen programming are powered by the engine of its growing Always On initiative. Through Always On, MTV continues to harness the power of its more than 220 million social media fans. And all the data we collect from those connections to create content across platforms in real time bring greater urgency and topicality to the brand and offering new, innovative advertiser opportunities.
Perhaps the most exciting sustained growth opportunity for Viacom is our rapidly expanding international Media Networks business. We are dramatically expanding our footprint and building major businesses across every continent. Our newest brand, the UK's Channel 5, continued to outperform other commercial free-to-air U.K. networks in the second fiscal quarter of 2015, with its share of viewers 16 to 34 increasing 7% over the previous year. In fact, Channel 5 was also the only major commercial network in the U.K. to grow share in the quarter, building on its strong competitive performance in 2014.
SPIKE, our next global television brand, successfully launched into the U.K. this month. SPIKE U.K.'s first night average was 9x higher than the last comparable channel launch on free-to-air TV, Turner's truTV. Since the launch, a total of 7 million viewers have tuned in to watch SPIKE U.K.
The U.K. is an important market for Viacom with significant opportunities for growth. It has also become an important content factory for us, second only to the U.S., to fuel our growth around the world.
Our international group also launched the Paramount Channel in Poland in the quarter, bringing Paramount Channel to a total of 63 countries around the world. In just 3 years, we've grown this brand to almost 70 million homes, 10 languages, across 20 time zones. Paramount Channel is now the most watched ad-supported international movie channel, and we're just beginning.
Moving on to the movie studio. Paramount Pictures delivered a strong debut for its animation division. The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water was an international box office success and a demonstration of the powerful combination of Paramount Animation's capabilities and our unmatched marketing expertise. And we're looking ahead to a summer of proven franchises and massive star power. Arnold Schwarzenegger is back as the Terminator in the widely anticipated Terminator Genisys set to open on July 1. This fresh take, also starring Emilia Clarke of Game of Thrones fame, brings a new twist to a legendary franchise.
Later in July, Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation hits the screen, starring Tom Cruise and Jeremy Renner and directed by Chris McQuarrie. Tom Cruise remains at the top of his game, and this film is certain to be a blockbuster.
Paramount Television is steadily building a TV studio committed to developing and selling great content with some of the most distinguished creative talent in the business today. Networks and online distributing partners include Fox, HBO, EPIX, Amazon, USA, Hulu as well as Comedy Central, MTV and Nickelodeon.
In conclusion, I have a great deal of confidence in the future of Viacom. We are transforming the company to fully capture the many opportunities created by the changing media landscape and to fuel growth initiatives with big potential. We are unleashing the value of our television brands to invest in more original content, creative marketing initiatives, better measurement and data-driven monetization, mobile initiatives, significant international expansion. At Paramount, with a richer development program, great film franchises and the further building of our animation and television production initiatives, we can look forward to renewed growth in the years ahead. By leading the charge, we are extremely well positioned to be among the first to benefit as the industry transition takes hold. And as it does, we look forward to delivering superior returns to our shareholders for many years to come.
And now I'd like to turn the call over to Wade."

Before I take you through our operating results, I want to note that our earnings release and web presentation summarizing the results for our March quarter are available on our website. The results that I will discuss have been adjusted to exclude the restructuring and programming charges of $784 million that were incurred in the March quarter.
Now let's take a look at our segment results. At our Media Networks segment, revenues in the quarter were up 3% compared with the prior year. Domestic revenues were flat, while international revenues grew 23%. Excluding a 13% unpaid rule [ph] impact from foreign currency, international revenues were up 36%. Channel 5 contributed 31 percentage points to international revenue growth in the quarter.
Page 11 of our web deck provides a breakdown of our Media Networks' revenue performance.
In terms of advertising, worldwide revenues were up 4% in the quarter. Domestic revenues were down 5% and international revenues increased 80%. The increase in international advertising was driven by growth in Europe, principally from Channel 5. Foreign exchange losses had a 17 percentage point impact on international advertising growth and a 2 percentage point impact on worldwide advertising growth.
In terms of affiliate revenues, worldwide revenues were up 3%. Domestic revenues were up 5% in the quarter, while international revenues declined 8%. Foreign exchange had a 13 percentage point unfavorable impact on the international revenue growth and a 2 percentage point unfavorable impact on worldwide affiliate revenue growth.
Excluding the impact from the timing of product available under certain distribution agreements, domestic affiliate revenues grew mid- to high-single digits in the quarter. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, international affiliate revenues grew as a result of new channel launches, increases in subscribers as well as the timing of product available under certain distribution agreements.
Expenses increased 9% in the quarter. Within operating expenses, programming expense grew 10%, while distribution and other expenses increased 23%. SG&A expense was up 4% in the quarter. Increases in expenses were principally driven by the acquisition of Channel 5. Excluding the impact of Channel 5, total expenses were flat in the quarter, with growth in SG&A expense driven by higher advertising and promotion expense principally related to the marketing of new original series and specials.
Media Networks' adjusted operating income was down 5%, while the adjusted operating income margin declined to 36.8%. The margin decline was driven by the 9% growth in expenses, partially offset by top line revenue growth of 3%.
Moving to Filmed Entertainment. Revenues were down 21% in the quarter, principally due to decreases in home entertainment and licensed revenues. Page 13 of the web presentation provides a breakdown of Filmed Entertainment revenues. Theatrical revenues decreased 10%, as lower carryover revenues from prior period releases were partially offset by our current quarter releases, including The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water. Home entertainment revenues declined 25%, principally due to the lower revenues from the current quarter and prior period releases. License fees declined 32% in the quarter due to the number and mix of available titles. Filmed Entertainment generated adjusted operating income of $1 million in the quarter as compared to $11 million last year.
Now moving beyond the segment results. Other items principally reflect a loss of $10 million due to foreign exchange losses. In terms of taxes, the year-to-date adjusted effective tax rate was 31.8%, reflecting a 120 basis point improvement as compared to the prior year. The reduction in the adjusted effective tax rate was principally driven by the mix of domestic and international profitability.
And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Tom."
25403751,286527010,798905,"Viacom, Inc., Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2015",2015-04-30,"Earnings Calls","Viacom Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Wade. I'm going to talk about our cash flow, our debt and the return of capital to our shareholders. I'll also cover seasonal factors impacting the remainder of our 2015 fiscal year. For the quarter, we generated $598 million in free cash flow com",782,"Thanks, Wade. I'm going to talk about our cash flow, our debt and the return of capital to our shareholders. I'll also cover seasonal factors impacting the remainder of our 2015 fiscal year. For the quarter, we generated $598 million in free cash flow compared to $524 million free cash flow last year. Page 6 of the web deck presentation provides the components of free cash flow. The increase in free cash flow in the quarter was principally due to lower cash taxes, partially offset by higher working capital utilization.
Cash taxes benefited from provisions allowing for accelerated deductions related to domestic film and TV production expense. Working capital was principally impacted by a higher programming spend at Media Networks.
Now moving to our debt. It remained principally fixed rate with an average cost at quarter end of 4.7%. We used part of the proceeds from the $1 billion of fixed rate debt we issued back in December to repay a $600 million outstanding of our 1.25% senior notes that came due in February. As for our variable rate borrowings, at quarter end, we had $75 million of commercial paper outstanding.
In terms of our leverage, we ended the quarter with $13.2 billion of total debt and $306 million of cash and cash equivalents. The decrease in cash from the December quarter reflects the repayment of the senior notes that matured in February. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 3.1x. At March 31, our $2.5 million bank revolver was undrawn. During the quarter, between our buyback and our dividend programs, we returned a total of $885 million of capital back to our shareholders, and we ended the quarter with 397 million shares outstanding. If you include our April dividend payment, we have returned a total of $1.9 billion to shareholders in the fiscal year, which is a return on market cap of approximately 7%.
Now let's turn to some of the factors impacting the remainder of our fiscal year. In terms of our affiliate revenue, quarterly revenue will fluctuate, given the timing of transactions and the recognition of revenue related to certain distribution agreements which are tied to product availability. Accordingly, for the June quarter, we anticipate that affiliate revenues will be relatively flat as compared to the prior year. However, we expect affiliate revenue will grow double digit in the September quarter.
For the full year, we expect that our -- the organic growth rate for Media Networks' programming expense will be in the mid-single digits. However, factoring in the acquisition of Channel 5, reported programming expense will grow in the mid-teen. For 2015, we are now forecasting a book tax rate of 31.8%.
At Filmed Entertainment, we're excited about our summer slate, which includes Terminator Genisys and Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation. For the June quarter, given that these films will be released later in the quarter with significant worldwide P&A expense, we anticipate difficult bottom line comparisons to the prior year. In the September quarter, we expect the studio will generate significant profits as they benefit from the carryover performance of these summer tentpoles as well as the availability of titles in the pay TV and syndication marketplaces.
Looking ahead at Paramount's production and development pipeline. The studio is currently in production on a number of projects, including Zoolander 2, which stars Ben Stiller, Owen Wilson and Will Ferrell; Ben-Hur, which is a coproduction with MGM; and The Big Short, an adaptation of Michael Lewis's book, starring Brad Pitt, Steve Carell, Christian Bale and Ryan Gosling. The second installment of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles recently went into production. And this summer, the studio starts production on Star Trek 3. Paramount is in development on a number of sequels to existing franchises, including World War Z, Jack Reacher and the recently announced sequel to The SpongeBob Movie.
In summary, the industry is evolving, and we have taken significant steps to realign our business to position the company to meet the challenges that lay ahead. By rethinking how we operate, we have reduced our cost structure, enabling us to invest in our brands and technology, while preserving our core margins. We are investing to enhance our capabilities to monetize our content outside of traditional measurements. We continue to develop specialized ad sales products, which enable us to monetize our consumers in innovative ways and provide our advertisers with new targeting capabilities to drive efficiency in their marketing campaigns. We remain committed to returning excess capital to our shareholders through our dividend and buyback programs, while at the same time, maintaining our investment-grade status.

In many cases, young people getting into it, and over time, upgrading to larger packages. There is no greater value in existence today as has been demonstrated in a number of studies of how the pricing works and what you get for the money. There's no greater value than the firehose of programming that you get by getting a broad bundle which can be marketing -- marketed in a way that with promotional value to give consumers good value. Today, consumers get more original programming on television than they've ever gotten before. There are hundreds of shows across television including our own that get much more viewership than many of the shows that are touted out there on pure online delivery. And the functionality keeps getting better. We believe that functionality, the ability to view linear television, on-demand television on different devices and different places is revolutionary for consumers, and we're working very closely with our partners to build that value. At the same time, we're willing, as we always have been, to engage with our distributor partners in smaller bundles, again to bring people into the ecosystem. A lot has been talked about in this arena. A lot of hype about it. I don't think that's going to be a very significant change in the overall value proposition that exists in television today. We have, as I mentioned in my remarks, the #1 family of cable networks across just about every demo, except when you get to the really older demos. And as we continue to invest in original programming, all of our networks will keep getting better and better. And we'll work with our distributors and look at innovative ways to engage consumers."

You have to be in Comedy Central and so forth. So we also have a very large penetration of video-on-demand. We also lead in new forms of distribution. So we are engaged with every existing distributor and new ones. So you can rest assured that whether it's an Apple or Sony or anyone else that we would be talking to all of them. And when -- and we enter into deals when we think that the time and format is right. And we bring value, and we expect value in return. And we believe we will continue to perform well in our affiliate revenues for the years to come."

The amount of time a product spends in one window or one distribution platform and how it might evolve to a second distribution platform will change and will -- as Philippe mentioned, we'll take the value and we'll try to get the value that most maximizes the revenue potential of the content we have. We have library stuff that is doing extraordinarily well in advertising campaigns when we attach attitudinal and behavioral data to that with -- that we get from syndicated research platforms and work with advertisers and agencies to make that much more available than otherwise normally would be. I think we're just at the very beginning of the opportunity around data to inform advertisers how to more accurately and efficiently target consumers. And each one of these conversations is specific to the product that the advertiser is selling. So I think there's -- at the very early stages of this thing. It's very, very promising. It's very bespoke in terms of each advertiser's product has unique attributes that they determined relevant to their target -- best targeted consumer. And we're working with them to evolve those and match them up with our content in our channels.

So I'll just give you the example in the kids and family group. By putting together with Nick at Nite, TV Land and CMT, we now have a broad portfolio of more family-oriented networks where we can cross-fertilize program development and even the acquisitions can play across several networks. And the cross-promotion opportunities are obvious in that case. I see, for example, CMT being able to tap a more -- a much more logical group of shows that are developed for Nick at Nite, TV Land to appeal to that heartland audience, which is a growth opportunity for us, and to orient the development of CMT toward a more wholesome feel rather than have some of the programming which was more connected to MTV and really didn't take CMT to -- in a broader direction. I think it's a great potential to grow. And we have a show like Younger. Younger, which has only had 4 episodes airing, we've aired it on -- it was created for TV Land. We've aired it on Nick at Nite. We put it on other venues. It's a great show. It's building fandom. We've had 24 million views across our platforms of Younger episodes. And that show, that's a greater performance that any of the big hits that are -- somebody asked about SVOD earlier. The biggest hits on SVOD do not have that kind of performance, as we're 4 shows in. So being able to expose Younger across these different platforms will help the show grow, justify investment in more and more original programming. And we can also be more judicious in how we acquire the third-party programming for those networks and get more value for that. So it's a big evolution going forward. This is not just about saving cost, although we are saving cost. It's about growing revenue. And I think we will see the results of that in fairly short order."

One, delayed viewing, particularly if it's fairly near-term time-shift viewing, still is very valuable to advertisers. And in fact, connection -- we want programming that creates engagement that -- and that creates that urgency, that connection, and then having the advertiser be part of that connection with the audience something they're passionate about. Reaching a fan of Teen Wolf or Tyler Posey in Teen Wolf, that's a very valuable connection that we offer, not just on our VMA kind of events. But in moving to original programming, in moving to scripted, those are events, those are people -- people are engaging with the characters on the shows, and that you see the same across television. So this big shift that we're making toward increasing the level of production of original programming, making it more relevant across all of our networks, adding to our creative talent, adding to the Always On capability at MTV, having our content live on mobile as well as the big screen at home, capturing our fans on mobile where they live, being able to monetize that connection, that's the -- that's where the TV marketplace is going to. And as I said in my remarks, we are leading the charge. We are orienting our entire organization to doing that. When we did the realignment, yes, we saved money by looking at how we are organized, but we are also investing in our people. We're bringing new people. We're really building up our human resources to drive Viacom Vantage, these other initiatives. We're building up our programming resources. We're building up our capabilities in mobile. So we're reorienting our organization, our programming and our human resources to really be a major beneficiary of the transformation and how people are enjoying content. And the good news is they are enjoying more and more of it. So we are becoming less reliant on those part of our programming write-down, less reliant on that old, not-so-relevant programming that we had acquired years ago. We said goodbye to that, and we're saying hello to a lot of new, more engaging, more live in terms of participation kind of television content for our new audiences."

But other advertisers, we'd be adding data to the conversation with them, are very, very interested in reaching the right consumer around the right content. And the right content is being constantly redefined as data allows us to demonstrate who might be a heavy consumer of fast-food product. Obviously, much more relevant to people who sell fast food. And we're now able to connect the dots and provide very hard data around which audiences are much more able to deliver heavy consumers of fast-food product or who might be people -- we can actually target for people concentrations of audiences that are not subscribers to their current product. In other words, they don't want to reach people who currently subscribe or advertise their current product. They'd like to get the people that don't subscribe to them. And through data, we are beginning to be able to more precisely target audiences that are not their current customers to give them the opportunity to get in front of more potential new customers.

Thanks for joining us to discuss the second quarter of our 2015 fiscal year. Viacom continued to successfully execute on our strategy this quarter and made significant changes to better align Viacom's operations",2983,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us to discuss the second quarter of our 2015 fiscal year. Viacom continued to successfully execute on our strategy this quarter and made significant changes to better align Viacom's operations with new opportunities in our industry around the world.
First, let's take a look at our financial performance in the quarter. Revenues declined 3% to $3.08 billion, as increases in Media Networks' revenues were more than offset by declines in Filmed Entertainment and the impact of foreign exchange. Absent an unfavorable 2% impact of foreign exchange, overall revenues declined 1%. Quarterly adjusted operating income declined 6%, and adjusted net earnings were $467 million. Adjusted earnings per share increased by 7% to $1.16, the highest ever for our March quarter.
Advertising revenues increased 4% in the quarter. Domestic ad sales at our Media Networks declined 5% compared to last year, due primarily to lower ratings. International ad sales grew 80%, due largely to the contributions of Channel 5 in the U.K. Affiliate revenues rose 3%. Domestic affiliate revenues rose 5%, more than offsetting a decline in international affiliate revenues that was driven by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange.
Results in the quarter included a $784 million charge related to our previously announced strategic realignment designed to better capture the opportunities in a changing market and achieve significant strategic and operational improvements.
Earlier this month, we also announced a temporary pause in the buyback to ensure that we continue to operate within our leverage target. We remain strongly committed to returning value to shareholders, and as we also announced earlier, expect that we will resume the buyback no later than the start of our next fiscal year.
As has been our practice the last several years, we also intend to recommend an increase in our dividend when our board convenes at the end of next month.
Turning back to the realignment. Among the changes we made was the reorganization of 4 domestic Media Networks' divisions into 3 groups, with outstanding leadership and a simplified structure that realigns sales, marketing, creative and support functions; increases efficiencies in program and product development; enhances opportunities to share expertise and promotes greater cross-channel marketing and programming activity.
At Paramount, we reduced overhead and infrastructure related to international home entertainment by entering into a partnership to distribute our DVD and Blu-ray product overseas. In addition, we reallocated resources throughout the company to expand our capabilities in data analysis, technology development and research, which are the key to success in our rapidly changing marketplace.
Our strategic realignment will generate substantial cost savings. We expect to realize $175 million in net savings through the end of fiscal 2015 and achieve an annual run rate of $350 million in net savings starting in the next fiscal year.
As you know, many of Viacom's brands are most popular among younger, digital-native demos, and we has stepped up to the challenge that these early adopters present. We are moving rapidly to fully align ourselves and our partners with the consumption preferences and the entertainment experiences that our audiences demand.
Make no mistake, these changes are part of a far-reaching strategy to transform Viacom into a creatively centered, fully multiplatform content company. We were among the first in our industry to call out the transformational shifts that we saw on the horizon. We were among the first to join with existing and new distribution partners to explore innovative and new platforms. We were among the first to transform our programming in ways that recognize and embrace the new pathways to discovery and fandom that define the behavior of our young audiences.
We were among the first to deeply embed data insights into our core operations and use those insights to accelerate the transformation of how advertising is measured and monetized. In many of these important areas, we are well ahead of the industry. In fact, our advanced and proprietary data insights are already producing innovative deals with major advertisers, with many more in the pipeline.
As we have discussed previously, we are moving away as rapidly as possible from traditional methods of measurement and towards a more meaningful and powerful dynamic intelligence platform that enables our marketing partners to tap into the unique cultural connections our content has with the consumers they want to reach. Our Velocity and Echo ad initiatives as well as the recently launched Viacom Vantage are leading the way and redefining how advertisers connect with our audiences and, more fundamentally, how rating success will be defined in the coming television landscape. I'll talk about the transformational promise of Viacom Vantage in a moment.
But first, I'd like to take a moment to talk more specifically about the shifts we see in the programming marketplace and how Viacom is prepared to capitalize on these opportunities. Our distribution relationships remain broad and strong. We have long-term agreements with most of our major distributors. We look forward to successfully concluding negotiations with those partners whose agreements are up sooner. As I mentioned earlier, advances in technology provide even more options for television subscribers, and although the path can be complicated, we are finding a great deal of common ground with MVPDs in working with them on flexible digital delivery.
Consumption is changing in a variety of ways and at levels we haven't seen before. Audiences are looking for new high-quality content and have an expectation to watch and interact with it on their schedule and on the device of their choosing. In addition, as mentioned earlier, marketers are becoming increasingly interested in the opportunities that data provides to reach their consumers in more focused and more effective ways.
As you know, we had been filling our Media Networks pipeline with unique, high-quality programming that is positioned for success in this environment. Massive culture-defining event tentpoles like the VMAs, the BET Experience and Nickelodeon's Kids' Choice Awards; cinematic series such as MTV's Teen Wolf and the highly anticipated Tut and Scream; and programming like Broad City and Lip Sync Battle with monetizable digital footprints exponentially larger than their substantial television viewership.
And while we are thriving on new platforms, our channels continue to show strength in the traditional linear television world. On a Nielsen basis this past quarter, we are the #1 cable network family among viewers 2 to 49, 18 to 49 and 2-plus, among other demos. And Viacom leads with 8 of the top 30 cable networks with viewers 18 to 49. And as I noted in previous calls, we have also set a goal to grow our non-Nielsen-dependent ad revenues from 30% today to 50% in 3 years. We continue to make progress on that path with industry-leading marketing and data capabilities that build on our deep knowledge of audiences and consumer behavior and a goal of exceptional value for marketers.
Viacom Vantage, for example, delivers unmatched audience intelligence for television advertisers, providing insights and targeting that go far beyond the traditional age and gender benchmarks of legacy ratings systems. This unique approach integrates our own robust portfolio of first-party data with data from multiple third-party sources, creating targeting programs that give advertisers the precision to customize the audience they want to reach and clear guidance to pinpoint what shows best deliver the highest concentration of that target audiences. While others are beginning their data journey, Viacom Vantage has already successfully piloted with several major advertisers, and that list is growing as we engage in upfront discussions. And this is just the first step.
As the distribution technology improves and large-scale dynamic ad insertion becomes a commercial reality, targeting will become more sophisticated, leading to individually targeted advertising across every platform where Viacom content appears. We are happy that the industry is following our lead. Our programming thrives on digital and VOD platforms.
For example, our programming accounts for 26% of all on-demand viewing on MVPD platforms. And several of our programs, most recently Key & Peele, have each generated more than 1 billion lifetime digital streams. This means we have tremendous revenue upside and are poised to lead the charge into this exciting new era of data-driven, results-based advertising.
I'll give you an example. Comedy Central's Broad City is one of the network's new success stories. In the quarter, the series maintained its strong Nielsen ratings from its debut season 1 year ago. Season 2 was #1 in its time slot across all television for men 18 to 34 and up 21% with women 18 to 34. As important, its digital growth was explosive. Total digital video streams across all platforms were up by a multiple of 10, with 7 million streams originating on Viacom-owned platforms alone. Its viewing on cable VOD was up 55% over last year.
We're thrilled with the response and the opportunity for data-driven marketing, and the monetization that follows is growing. The Comedy Central Roast of Justin Bieber was another strong linear performance supplemented by record-setting digital success. The Roast was #1 in critical demos, adults 18 to 24 and 18 to 34. And it represented the best day in a decade for Comedy Central among women 18 to 34. On digital, the Bieber Roast generated 26 million streams on Viacom sites and apps, with more than 400,000 live streams, and it drove the highest single day of downloads for the Comedy Central app. On social platforms, this one program generated approximately 7 billion impressions.
Overall, Comedy Central continues to hit its stride with strong talent, aggressive distribution and a commitment to let programming find its rhythm and succeed. The network currently has the 3 highest-rated late-night talk shows among men 18 to 34 in all of television, including broadcast. The Nightly Show and @midnight are already proven successes, and we are looking forward to the final 3 months of Jon Stewart on The Daily Show and the Trevor Noah, bringing his distinct take to a new generation of Daily Show viewers.
SPIKE is also on a hot streak with the monster hit Lip Sync Battle, which premiered at the beginning of the current quarter and has already been renewed, with fantastic talent fighting to participate in future episodes. Including DVR playback, the series averages 3.2 million viewers per episode and has driven millions of streams across our owned and operated digital properties and over 120 million digital clip views on all platforms. The series premiere was #1 in its time slot with adults 18 to 49 and the second-most-watched telecast for SPIKE ever. We've also been successful syndicating the series on other Viacom networks.
Aggregating viewership on SPIKE, MTV and BET, Lip Sync Battle captured approximately 40 million Nielsen viewers for the first 5 episodes. Lip Sync Battle also is delivering on SPIKE's new broader-audience strategy that looks beyond the brand's core male demographic. The show brought 1.5 million women to the network, a large number of whom did not previously watch SPIKE, and certain episodes delivered a predominantly female audience. Our investment in SPIKE's new positioning will become even more evident in the months ahead.
We're developing high-quality programming with big stars and great production values. The network's highly anticipated epic miniseries, Tut, premiers in July and advertising has already completely sold out. And the pipeline is full. Among the series and miniseries currently in development, we have Pierce Brosnan's Crusaders, War at the Shore, Red Mars, and the recently announced Harvest, executive produced by Jerry Bruckheimer.
Of course, we're continuing to build on the network's reality successes. Ink Master, Catch a Contractor and Bar Rescue have all been strong performers for the network, and they're all coming back soon. Nickelodeon was once again #1 in kids 2 to 11, driving success with long-time hits and innovative new programming. Bella and The Bulldogs joined Saturday Night's very strong lineup and was the top show for kids 6 to 11. In preschool, Blaze and the Monster Machines and PAW Patrol are driving rating success, with consumer products not far behind.
Nickelodeon launched Harvey Beaks and Make It Pop to strong starts and wrapped up the quarter with another outstanding Kids' Choice Awards that maintained the tentpole strong ratings track record. And the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles continue to thrive, with a #1 boys' consumer products property and a new movie already in production that will take the franchise to a whole new level.
Kids love watching our programming on TV. In fact, Nickelodeon brands reached more kids 2 to 11 every Saturday morning than YouTube does in a month. And there's a lot on deck as we move forward into this new quarter and beyond. Nickelodeon will launch a new live-action series, 100 Things to Do Before High School. A movie special for this new property aired to great response in the fall, and we're very optimistic about its series run. This summer, we are premiering 20 brand-new SpongeBob episodes and the second annual Kids' Choice Sports Awards hosted by Seahawks quarterback, Russell Wilson.
As I mentioned on the last call, Nickelodeon recently launched its Noggin over-the-top app, an innovative new way to connect with our audience. It has been very well-received by consumers.
In the March quarter, MTV saw the successful returns of its hit scripted drama, Finding Carter, and the newest installment of the Teen Mom franchise. At its Upfront presentation last week in New York, the network unveiled a new programming slate of 10 new and 9 returning series and previewed some of its more than 100 projects currently in development. Among the highlights are MTV's television series reinvention of the horror film franchise Scream, premiering June 30; and its ambitious sci-fi fantasy series The Shannara Chronicles, which is currently in production in New Zealand under executive producer Jon Favreau.
At the other end of the development spectrum, MTV is increasing its output of format-driven comedy series like the recently renewed Broke A$$ Game Show and the forthcoming animation showcase Greatest Party Story Ever. Series like these are topical and highly clippable, enabling them to migrate well into the mobile and social spaces. This migration and all of MTV's multiscreen programming are powered by the engine of its growing Always On initiative. Through Always On, MTV continues to harness the power of its more than 220 million social media fans. And all the data we collect from those connections to create content across platforms in real time bring greater urgency and topicality to the brand and offering new, innovative advertiser opportunities.
Perhaps the most exciting sustained growth opportunity for Viacom is our rapidly expanding international Media Networks business. We are dramatically expanding our footprint and building major businesses across every continent. Our newest brand, the UK's Channel 5, continued to outperform other commercial free-to-air U.K. networks in the second fiscal quarter of 2015, with its share of viewers 16 to 34 increasing 7% over the previous year. In fact, Channel 5 was also the only major commercial network in the U.K. to grow share in the quarter, building on its strong competitive performance in 2014.
SPIKE, our next global television brand, successfully launched into the U.K. this month. SPIKE U.K.'s first night average was 9x higher than the last comparable channel launch on free-to-air TV, Turner's truTV. Since the launch, a total of 7 million viewers have tuned in to watch SPIKE U.K.
The U.K. is an important market for Viacom with significant opportunities for growth. It has also become an important content factory for us, second only to the U.S., to fuel our growth around the world.
Our international group also launched the Paramount Channel in Poland in the quarter, bringing Paramount Channel to a total of 63 countries around the world. In just 3 years, we've grown this brand to almost 70 million homes, 10 languages, across 20 time zones. Paramount Channel is now the most-watched ad-supported international movie channel, and we're just beginning.
Moving on to the movie studio. Paramount Pictures delivered a strong debut for its animation division. The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water was an international box office success and a demonstration of the powerful combination of Paramount Animation's capabilities and our unmatched marketing expertise. And we're looking ahead to a summer of proven franchises and massive star power. Arnold Schwarzenegger is back as the Terminator in the widely anticipated Terminator Genisys set to open on July 1. This fresh take, also starring Emilia Clarke of Game of Thrones fame, brings a new twist to a legendary franchise.
Later in July, Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation hits the screen, starring Tom Cruise and Jeremy Renner and directed by Chris McQuarrie. Tom Cruise remains at the top of his game, and this film is certain to be a blockbuster.
Paramount Television is steadily building a TV studio committed to developing and selling great content with some of the most distinguished creative talent in the business today. Networks and online distributing partners include Fox, HBO, EPIX, Amazon, USA, Hulu as well as Comedy Central, MTV and Nickelodeon.
In conclusion, I have a great deal of confidence in the future of Viacom. We are transforming the company to fully capture the many opportunities created by the changing media landscape and to fuel growth initiatives with big potential. We are unleashing the value of our television brands to invest in more original content, creative marketing initiatives, better measurement in data-driven monetization, mobile initiatives, significant international expansion. At Paramount, with a richer development program, great film franchises and the further building of our animation and television production initiatives, we can look forward to renewed growth in the years ahead. By leading the charge, we are extremely well positioned to be among the first to benefit as the industry transition takes hold. And as it does, we look forward to delivering superior returns to our shareholders for many years to come.
And now I'd like to turn the call over to Wade."

The results that I will discuss have been adjusted to exclude the restructuring and programming charges of $784 million that were incurred in the March quarter.
Now let's take a look at our segment results. At our Media Networks segment, revenues in the quarter were up 3% compared with the prior year. Domestic revenues were flat, while international revenues grew 23%. Excluding a 13% unpaid rule [ph] impact from foreign currency, international revenues were up 36%. Channel 5 contributed 31 percentage points to international revenue growth in the quarter.
Page 11 of our web deck provides a breakdown of our Media Networks' revenue performance.
In terms of advertising, worldwide revenues were up 4% in the quarter. Domestic revenues were down 5% and international revenues increased 80%. The increase in international advertising was driven by growth in Europe, principally from Channel 5. Foreign exchange losses had a 17 percentage point impact on international advertising growth and a 2 percentage point impact on worldwide advertising growth.
In terms of affiliate revenues, worldwide revenues were up 3%. Domestic revenues were up 5% in the quarter, while international revenues declined 8%. Foreign exchange had a 13 percentage point unfavorable impact on international revenue growth and a 2 percentage point unfavorable impact on worldwide affiliate revenue growth.
Excluding the impact from the timing of product available under certain distribution agreements, domestic affiliate revenues grew mid- to high-single digits in the quarter. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, international affiliate revenues grew as a result of new channel launches, increases in subscribers as well as the timing of product available under certain distribution agreements.
Expenses increased 9% in the quarter. Within operating expenses, programming expense grew 10%, while distribution and other expenses increased 23%. SG&A expense was up 4% in the quarter. Increases in expenses were principally driven by the acquisition of Channel 5. Excluding the impact of Channel 5, total expenses were flat in the quarter, with growth in SG&A expense driven by higher advertising and promotion expense principally related to the marketing of new original series and specials.
Media Networks' adjusted operating income was down 5%, while the adjusted operating income margin declined to 36.8%. The margin decline was driven by the 9% growth in expenses, partially offset by top line revenue growth of 3%.
Moving to Filmed Entertainment. Revenues were down 21% in the quarter, principally due to decreases in home entertainment and licensed revenues. Page 13 of the web presentation provides a breakdown of Filmed Entertainment revenues. Theatrical revenues decreased 10%, as lower carryover revenues from prior period releases were partially offset by our current quarter releases, including The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water. Home entertainment revenues declined 25%, principally due to the lower revenues from the current quarter and prior period releases. License fees declined 32% in the quarter due to the number and mix of available titles. Filmed Entertainment generated adjusted operating income of $1 million in the quarter as compared to $11 million last year.
Now moving beyond the segment results. Other items principally reflect a loss of $10 million due to foreign exchange losses. In terms of taxes, the year-to-date adjusted effective tax rate was 31.8%, reflecting a 120 basis point improvement as compared to the prior year. The reduction in the adjusted effective tax rate was principally driven by the mix of domestic and international profitability.
And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Tom."
25403751,286527010,799071,"Viacom, Inc., Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2015",2015-04-30,"Earnings Calls","Viacom Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Wade. I'm going to talk about our cash flow, our debt and the return of capital to our shareholders. I'll also cover seasonal factors impacting the remainder of our 2015 fiscal year. For the quarter, we generated $598 million in free cash flow com",786,"Thanks, Wade. I'm going to talk about our cash flow, our debt and the return of capital to our shareholders. I'll also cover seasonal factors impacting the remainder of our 2015 fiscal year. For the quarter, we generated $598 million in free cash flow compared to $524 million free cash flow last year. Page 6 of the web deck presentation provides the components of free cash flow. The increase in free cash flow in the quarter was principally due to lower cash taxes, partially offset by higher working capital utilization.
Cash taxes benefited from provisions allowing for accelerated deductions related to domestic film and TV production expense. Working capital was principally impacted by a higher programming spend at Media Networks.
Now moving to our debt. It remains principally fixed rate, with an average cost at quarter end of 4.7%. We used part of the proceeds from the $1 billion of fixed rate debt we issued back in December to repay a $600 million outstanding of our 1.25% senior notes that came due in February. As for our variable rate borrowings, at quarter end we had $75 million of commercial paper outstanding.
In terms of our leverage, we ended the quarter with $13.2 billion of total debt and $306 million of cash and cash equivalents. The decrease in cash from the December quarter reflects the repayment of the senior notes that matured in February. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 3.1x. At March 31, our $2.5 million -- $2.5 billion bank revolver was undrawn. During the quarter, between our buyback and our dividend programs, we returned a total of $885 million of capital back to our shareholders, and we ended the quarter with 397 million shares outstanding. If you include our April dividend payment, we have returned a total of $1.9 billion to shareholders in the fiscal year, which is a return on market cap of approximately 7%.
Now let's turn to some of the factors impacting the remainder of our fiscal year. In terms of our affiliate revenue, quarterly revenue will fluctuate, given the timing of transactions and the recognition of revenue related to certain distribution agreements which are tied to product availability. Accordingly, for the June quarter, we anticipate that affiliate revenues will be relatively flat as compared to the prior year. However, we expect affiliate revenue will grow double digit in the September quarter.
For the full year, we expect that our -- the organic growth rate for Media Networks' programming expense will be in the mid-single digits. However, factoring in the acquisition of Channel 5, reported programming expense will grow in the mid-teens. For 2015, we are now forecasting a book tax rate of 31.8%.
At Filmed Entertainment, we are excited about our summer slate, which includes Terminator Genisys and Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation. For the June quarter, given that these films will be released later in the quarter with significant worldwide P&A expense, we anticipate difficult bottom line comparisons to the prior year. In the September quarter, we expect the studio will generate significant profits as they benefit from the carryover performance of these summer tentpoles as well as the availability of titles in the pay TV and syndication marketplaces.
Looking ahead at Paramount's production and development pipeline. The studio is currently in production on a number of projects, including Zoolander 2, which stars Ben Stiller, Owen Wilson and Will Ferrell; Ben-Hur, which is a coproduction with MGM; and The Big Short, an adaptation of Michael Lewis's book, starring Brad Pitt, Steve Carell, Christian Bale and Ryan Gosling. The second installment of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles recently went into production. And this summer, the studio starts production on Star Trek 3. Paramount is in development on a number of sequels to existing franchises, including World War Z, Jack Reacher and the recently announced sequel to The SpongeBob Movie.
In summary, the industry is evolving, and we have taken significant steps to realign our business to position the company to meet the challenges that lay ahead. By rethinking how we operate, we have reduced our cost structure, enabling us to invest in our brands and technology, while preserving our core margins. We are investing to enhance our capabilities to monetize our content outside of traditional measurements. We continue to develop specialized ad sales products, which enable us to monetize our consumers in innovative ways and provide our advertisers with new targeting capabilities to drive efficiency in their marketing campaigns. We remain committed to returning excess capital to our shareholders through our dividend and buyback programs, while at the same time, maintaining our investment-grade status.
With that, I would like to turn the call over to your questions. Operator?"

Look, I think the -- there are a number of offerings out there. They've always been available, by the way, the -- what people are calling skinny bundles used to be called family tiers, and there's always a place for bringing consumers into the television ecosystem. In many cases, young people getting into it, and over time, upgrading to larger packages. There is no greater value in existence today, as has been demonstrated in a number of studies of how the pricing works and what you get for the money, there's no greater value than the firehose of programming that you get by getting a broad bundle which can be marketing -- marketed in a way that with promotional value to give consumers good value. Today, consumers get more original programming on television than they've ever gotten before. There are hundreds of shows across television, including our own, that get much more viewership than many of the shows that are touted out there on pure online delivery. And the functionality keeps getting better. We believe that functionality, the ability to view linear television, on-demand television on different devices and different places is revolutionary for consumers, and we're working very closely with our partners to build that value. At the same time, we're willing, as we always have been, to engage with our distributor partners in smaller bundles, again to bring people into the ecosystem. A lot has been talked about in this arena. A lot of hype about it. I don't think that's going to be a very significant change in the overall value proposition that exists in television today. We have, as I mentioned in my remarks, the #1 family of cable networks across just about every demo, except when you get to the really older demos. And as we continue to invest in original programming, all of our networks will keep getting better and better. And we'll work with our distributors and look at innovative ways to engage consumers."

We have library stuff that is doing extraordinarily well in advertising campaigns when we attach attitudinal and behavioral data to that with -- that we get from syndicated research platforms and work with advertisers and agencies to make that much more valuable than it otherwise normally would be. I think we're just at the very beginning of the opportunity around data to inform advertisers how to more accurately and efficiently target consumers. And each one of these conversations is specific to the product that the advertiser is selling. So I think there's -- at the very early stages of this thing, it's very, very promising. It's very bespoke in terms of each advertiser's product has unique attributes that they determined relevant to their target -- best targeted consumer.

So I'll just give you the example in the kids and family group. By putting together with Nick at Nite, TV Land and CMT, we now have a broad portfolio of more family-oriented networks where we can cross-fertilize program development and even the acquisitions can play across several networks. And the cross-promotion opportunities are obvious in that case. I see, for example, CMT being able to tap a more -- a much more logical group of shows that are developed for Nick at Nite, TV Land to appeal to that heartland audience, which is a growth opportunity for us, and to orient the development of CMT toward a more wholesome feel rather than have some of the programming which was more connected to MTV and really didn't take CMT to -- in a broader direction, I think, gives it great potential to grow. And we have a show like Younger. Younger, which has only had 4 episodes airing, we've aired it on -- it was created for TV Land. We've aired it on Nick at Nite. We put it on other venues. It's a great show. It's building fandom. We've had 24 million views across our platforms of Younger episodes. And that show, that's a greater performance that any of the big hits that are -- somebody asked about SVOD earlier. The biggest hits on SVOD do not have that kind of performance, as we're 4 shows in. So being able to expose Younger across these different platforms will help the show grow, justify investment in more and more original programming. And we can also be more judicious in how we acquire the third-party programming for those networks and get more value for that. So it's a big evolution going forward. This is not just about saving cost, although we are saving cost. It's about growing revenue. And I think we will see the results of that in fairly short order."

And it's that connection -- we want programming that creates engagement that -- and that creates that urgency, that connection, and then having the advertiser be part of that connection with the audience something they're passionate about. Reaching a fan of Teen Wolf or Tyler Posey in Teen Wolf, that's a very valuable connection that we offer, not just on our VMA kind of event. But in moving to original programming, in moving to scripted, those are events, those are people -- people are engaging with the characters on the shows, and that you see the same across television. So this big shift that we're making toward increasing the level of production of original programming, making it more relevant across all of our networks, adding to our creative talent, adding to the Always On capability at MTV, having our content live on mobile as well as the big screen at home, capturing our fans on mobile where they live, being able to monetize that connection, that's the -- that's where the TV marketplace is going to. And as I said in my remarks, we are leading the charge. We are orienting our entire organization to doing that. When we did the realignment, yes, we saved money by looking at how we are organized, but we are also investing in our people. We're bringing new people. We're really building up our human resources to drive Viacom Vantage, these other initiatives. We're building up our programming resources. We're building up our capabilities in mobile. So we're reorienting our organization, our programming and our human resources to really be a major beneficiary of the transformation and how people are enjoying content. And the good news is they are enjoying more and more of it. So we are becoming less reliant -- it was part of our programming write-down, less reliant on that old, not-so-relevant programming that we had acquired years ago. We said goodbye to that, and we're saying hello to a lot of new, more engaging, more live in terms of participation kind of television content for our new audiences."

Some people like studios don't need the advertising after 3 or 4 days. It's not as relevant or not as valuable to them. But other advertisers, with the adding data to the conversation with them, are very, very interested in reaching the right consumer around the right content. And the right content is being constantly redefined as data allows us to demonstrate who might be a heavy consumer of fast-food product. It's, obviously, much more relevant to people who sell fast food. And we're now able to connect the dots and provide very hard data around which audiences are much more able to deliver heavy consumers of fast-food product or who might be people -- we can actually target for people concentrations of audiences that are not subscribers to their current product. In other words, they don't want to reach people who currently subscribe or advertise to their current product. They'd like to get the people that don't subscribe to them. And through data, we are beginning to be able to more precisely target audiences that are not their current customers to give them the opportunity to get in front of more potential new customers. So that is really what our conversations are taking up most of the time in our conversations with advertisers. To supplement what Philippe just commented on, on how that conversation is evolving very quickly, and it doesn't seem to be at all focused on the -- whether the show is a live show or the recency of the airing of the show. It's much more to the quality of the audience that you're putting in front of them."

Thanks for joining us to discuss the second quarter of our 2015 fiscal year. Viacom continued to successfully execute on our strategy this quarter and made significant changes to better align Viacom's operations",2983,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us to discuss the second quarter of our 2015 fiscal year. Viacom continued to successfully execute on our strategy this quarter and made significant changes to better align Viacom's operations with new opportunities in our industry around the world.
First, let's take a look at our financial performance in the quarter. Revenues declined 3% to $3.08 billion, as increases in Media Networks' revenues were more than offset by declines in Filmed Entertainment and the impact of foreign exchange. Absent an unfavorable 2% impact of foreign exchange, overall revenues declined 1%. Quarterly adjusted operating income declined 6%, and adjusted net earnings were $467 million. Adjusted earnings per share increased by 7% to $1.16, the highest ever for our March quarter.
Advertising revenues increased 4% in the quarter. Domestic ad sales at our Media Networks declined 5% compared to last year, due primarily to lower ratings. International ad sales grew 80%, due largely to the contributions of Channel 5 in the U.K. Affiliate revenues rose 3%. Domestic affiliate revenues rose 5%, more than offsetting a decline in international affiliate revenues that was driven by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange.
Results in the quarter included a $784 million charge related to our previously announced strategic realignment designed to better capture the opportunities in a changing market and achieve significant strategic and operational improvements.
Earlier this month, we also announced a temporary pause in the buyback to ensure that we continue to operate within our leverage target. We remain strongly committed to returning value to shareholders, and as we also announced earlier, expect that we will resume the buyback no later than the start of our next fiscal year.
As has been our practice the last several years, we also intend to recommend an increase in our dividend when our board convenes at the end of next month.
Turning back to the realignment. Among the changes we made was the reorganization of 4 domestic Media Networks' divisions into 3 groups, with outstanding leadership and a simplified structure that realigns sales, marketing, creative and support functions; increases efficiencies in program and product development; enhances opportunities to share expertise and promotes greater cross-channel marketing and programming activity.
At Paramount, we reduced overhead and infrastructure related to international home entertainment by entering into a partnership to distribute our DVD and Blu-ray product overseas. In addition, we reallocated resources throughout the company to expand our capabilities in data analysis, technology development and research, which are the key to success in our rapidly changing marketplace.
Our strategic realignment will generate substantial cost savings. We expect to realize $175 million in net savings through the end of fiscal 2015 and achieve an annual run rate of $350 million in net savings starting in the next fiscal year.
As you know, many of Viacom's brands are most popular among younger, digital-native demos, and we has stepped up to the challenge that these early adopters present. We are moving rapidly to fully align ourselves and our partners with the consumption preferences and the entertainment experiences that our audiences demand.
Make no mistake, these changes are part of a far-reaching strategy to transform Viacom into a creatively centered, fully multiplatform content company. We were among the first in our industry to call out the transformational shifts that we saw on the horizon. We were among the first to join with existing and new distribution partners to explore innovative and new platforms. We were among the first to transform our programming in ways that recognize and embrace the new pathways to discovery and fandom that define the behavior of our young audiences.
We were among the first to deeply embed data insights into our core operations and use those insights to accelerate the transformation of how advertising is measured and monetized. In many of these important areas, we are well ahead of the industry. In fact, our advanced and proprietary data insights are already producing innovative deals with major advertisers, with many more in the pipeline.
As we have discussed previously, we are moving away as rapidly as possible from traditional methods of measurement and towards a more meaningful and powerful dynamic intelligence platform that enables our marketing partners to tap into the unique cultural connections our content has with the consumers they want to reach. Our Velocity and Echo ad initiatives as well as the recently launched Viacom Vantage are leading the way and redefining how advertisers connect with our audiences and, more fundamentally, how rating success will be defined in the coming television landscape. I'll talk about the transformational promise of Viacom Vantage in a moment.
But first, I'd like to take a moment to talk more specifically about the shifts we see in the programming marketplace and how Viacom is prepared to capitalize on these opportunities. Our distribution relationships remain broad and strong. We have long-term agreements with most of our major distributors. We look forward to successfully concluding negotiations with those partners whose agreements are up sooner. As I mentioned earlier, advances in technology provide even more options for television subscribers, and although the path can be complicated, we are finding a great deal of common ground with MVPDs in working with them on flexible digital delivery.
Consumption is changing in a variety of ways and at levels we haven't seen before. Audiences are looking for new high-quality content and have an expectation to watch and interact with it on their schedule and on the device of their choosing. In addition, as mentioned earlier, marketers are becoming increasingly interested in the opportunities that data provides to reach their consumers in more focused and more effective ways.
As you know, we had been filling our Media Networks pipeline with unique, high-quality programming that is positioned for success in this environment. Massive culture-defining event tentpoles like the VMAs, the BET Experience and Nickelodeon's Kids' Choice Awards; cinematic series such as MTV's Teen Wolf and the highly anticipated Tut and Scream; and programming like Broad City and Lip Sync Battle with monetizable digital footprints exponentially larger than their substantial television viewership.
And while we are thriving on new platforms, our channels continue to show strength in the traditional linear television world. On a Nielsen basis this past quarter, we are the #1 cable network family among viewers 2 to 49, 18 to 49 and 2-plus, among other demos. And Viacom leads with 8 of the top 30 cable networks with viewers 18 to 49. And as I noted in previous calls, we have also set a goal to grow our non-Nielsen-dependent ad revenues from 30% today to 50% in 3 years. We continue to make progress on that path with industry-leading marketing and data capabilities that build on our deep knowledge of audiences and consumer behavior and a goal of exceptional value for marketers.
Viacom Vantage, for example, delivers unmatched audience intelligence for television advertisers, providing insights and targeting that go far beyond the traditional age and gender benchmarks of legacy ratings systems. This unique approach integrates our own robust portfolio of first-party data with data from multiple third-party sources, creating targeting programs that give advertisers the precision to customize the audience they want to reach and clear guidance to pinpoint what shows best deliver the highest concentration of that target audiences. While others are beginning their data journey, Viacom Vantage has already successfully piloted with several major advertisers, and that list is growing as we engage in upfront discussions. And this is just the first step.
As the distribution technology improves and large-scale dynamic ad insertion becomes a commercial reality, targeting will become more sophisticated, leading to individually targeted advertising across every platform where Viacom content appears. We are happy that the industry is following our lead. Our programming thrives on digital and VOD platforms.
For example, our programming accounts for 26% of all on-demand viewing on MVPD platforms. And several of our programs, most recently Key & Peele, have each generated more than 1 billion lifetime digital streams. This means we have tremendous revenue upside and are poised to lead the charge into this exciting new era of data-driven, results-based advertising.
I'll give you an example. Comedy Central's Broad City is one of the network's new success stories. In the quarter, the series maintained its strong Nielsen ratings from its debut season 1 year ago. Season 2 was #1 in its time slot across all television for men 18 to 34 and up 21% with women 18 to 34. As important, its digital growth was explosive. Total digital video streams across all platforms were up by a multiple of 10, with 7 million streams originating on Viacom-owned platforms alone. Its viewing on cable VOD was up 55% over last year.
We're thrilled with the response and the opportunity for data-driven marketing, and the monetization that follows is growing. The Comedy Central Roast of Justin Bieber was another strong linear performance supplemented by record-setting digital success. The Roast was #1 in critical demos, adults 18 to 24 and 18 to 34. And it represented the best day in a decade for Comedy Central among women 18 to 34. On digital, the Bieber Roast generated 26 million streams on Viacom sites and apps, with more than 400,000 live streams, and it drove the highest single day of downloads for the Comedy Central app. On social platforms, this one program generated approximately 7 billion impressions.
Overall, Comedy Central continues to hit its stride with strong talent, aggressive distribution and a commitment to let programming find its rhythm and succeed. The network currently has the 3 highest-rated late-night talk shows among men 18 to 34 in all of television, including broadcast. The Nightly Show and @midnight are already proven successes, and we are looking forward to the final 3 months of Jon Stewart on The Daily Show and the Trevor Noah, bringing his distinct take to a new generation of Daily Show viewers.
SPIKE is also on a hot streak with the monster hit Lip Sync Battle, which premiered at the beginning of the current quarter and has already been renewed, with fantastic talent fighting to participate in future episodes. Including DVR playback, the series averages 3.2 million viewers per episode and has driven millions of streams across our owned and operated digital properties and over 120 million digital clip views on all platforms. The series premiere was #1 in its time slot with adults 18 to 49 and the second-most-watched telecast for SPIKE ever. We've also been successful syndicating the series on other Viacom networks.
Aggregating viewership on SPIKE, MTV and BET, Lip Sync Battle captured approximately 40 million Nielsen viewers for the first 5 episodes. Lip Sync Battle also is delivering on SPIKE's new broader-audience strategy that looks beyond the brand's core male demographic. The show brought 1.5 million women to the network, a large number of whom did not previously watch SPIKE, and certain episodes delivered a predominantly female audience. Our investment in SPIKE's new positioning will become even more evident in the months ahead.
We're developing high-quality programming with big stars and great production values. The network's highly anticipated epic miniseries, Tut, premiers in July and advertising has already completely sold out. And the pipeline is full. Among the series and miniseries currently in development, we have Pierce Brosnan's Crusaders, War at the Shore, Red Mars, and the recently announced Harvest, executive produced by Jerry Bruckheimer.
Of course, we're continuing to build on the network's reality successes. Ink Master, Catch a Contractor and Bar Rescue have all been strong performers for the network, and they're all coming back soon. Nickelodeon was once again #1 in kids 2 to 11, driving success with long-time hits and innovative new programming. Bella and The Bulldogs joined Saturday Night's very strong lineup and was the top show for kids 6 to 11. In preschool, Blaze and the Monster Machines and PAW Patrol are driving rating success, with consumer products not far behind.
Nickelodeon launched Harvey Beaks and Make It Pop to strong starts and wrapped up the quarter with another outstanding Kids' Choice Awards that maintained the tentpole strong ratings track record. And the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles continue to thrive, with a #1 boys' consumer products property and a new movie already in production that will take the franchise to a whole new level.
Kids love watching our programming on TV. In fact, Nickelodeon brands reached more kids 2 to 11 every Saturday morning than YouTube does in a month. And there's a lot on deck as we move forward into this new quarter and beyond. Nickelodeon will launch a new live-action series, 100 Things to Do Before High School. A movie special for this new property aired to great response in the fall, and we're very optimistic about its series run. This summer, we are premiering 20 brand-new SpongeBob episodes and the second annual Kids' Choice Sports Awards hosted by Seahawks quarterback, Russell Wilson.
As I mentioned on the last call, Nickelodeon recently launched its Noggin over-the-top app, an innovative new way to connect with our audience. It has been very well-received by consumers.
In the March quarter, MTV saw the successful returns of its hit scripted drama, Finding Carter, and the newest installment of the Teen Mom franchise. At its Upfront presentation last week in New York, the network unveiled a new programming slate of 10 new and 9 returning series and previewed some of its more than 100 projects currently in development. Among the highlights are MTV's television series reinvention of the horror film franchise Scream, premiering June 30; and its ambitious sci-fi fantasy series The Shannara Chronicles, which is currently in production in New Zealand under executive producer Jon Favreau.
At the other end of the development spectrum, MTV is increasing its output of format-driven comedy series like the recently renewed Broke A$$ Game Show and the forthcoming animation showcase Greatest Party Story Ever. Series like these are topical and highly clippable, enabling them to migrate well into the mobile and social spaces. This migration and all of MTV's multiscreen programming are powered by the engine of its growing Always On initiative. Through Always On, MTV continues to harness the power of its more than 220 million social media fans. And all the data we collect from those connections to create content across platforms in real time bring greater urgency and topicality to the brand and offering new, innovative advertiser opportunities.
Perhaps the most exciting sustained growth opportunity for Viacom is our rapidly expanding international Media Networks business. We are dramatically expanding our footprint and building major businesses across every continent. Our newest brand, the UK's Channel 5, continued to outperform other commercial free-to-air U.K. networks in the second fiscal quarter of 2015, with its share of viewers 16 to 34 increasing 7% over the previous year. In fact, Channel 5 was also the only major commercial network in the U.K. to grow share in the quarter, building on its strong competitive performance in 2014.
SPIKE, our next global television brand, successfully launched into the U.K. this month. SPIKE U.K.'s first night average was 9x higher than the last comparable channel launch on free-to-air TV, Turner's truTV. Since the launch, a total of 7 million viewers have tuned in to watch SPIKE U.K.
The U.K. is an important market for Viacom with significant opportunities for growth. It has also become an important content factory for us, second only to the U.S., to fuel our growth around the world.
Our international group also launched the Paramount Channel in Poland in the quarter, bringing Paramount Channel to a total of 63 countries around the world. In just 3 years, we've grown this brand to almost 70 million homes, 10 languages, across 20 time zones. Paramount Channel is now the most-watched ad-supported international movie channel, and we're just beginning.
Moving on to the movie studio. Paramount Pictures delivered a strong debut for its animation division. The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water was an international box office success and a demonstration of the powerful combination of Paramount Animation's capabilities and our unmatched marketing expertise. And we're looking ahead to a summer of proven franchises and massive star power. Arnold Schwarzenegger is back as the Terminator in the widely anticipated Terminator Genisys set to open on July 1. This fresh take, also starring Emilia Clarke of Game of Thrones fame, brings a new twist to a legendary franchise.
Later in July, Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation hits the screen, starring Tom Cruise and Jeremy Renner and directed by Chris McQuarrie. Tom Cruise remains at the top of his game, and this film is certain to be a blockbuster.
Paramount Television is steadily building a TV studio committed to developing and selling great content with some of the most distinguished creative talent in the business today. Networks and online distributing partners include Fox, HBO, EPIX, Amazon, USA, Hulu as well as Comedy Central, MTV and Nickelodeon.
In conclusion, I have a great deal of confidence in the future of Viacom. We are transforming the company to fully capture the many opportunities created by the changing media landscape and to fuel growth initiatives with big potential. We are unleashing the value of our television brands to invest in more original content, creative marketing initiatives, better measurement in data-driven monetization, mobile initiatives, significant international expansion. At Paramount, with a richer development program, great film franchises and the further building of our animation and television production initiatives, we can look forward to renewed growth in the years ahead. By leading the charge, we are extremely well positioned to be among the first to benefit as the industry transition takes hold. And as it does, we look forward to delivering superior returns to our shareholders for many years to come.
And now I'd like to turn the call over to Wade."

Before I take you through our operating results, I want to note that our earnings release and web presentation summarizing the results for our March quarter are available on our website. The results that I will discuss have been adjusted to exclude the restructuring and programming charges of $784 million that were incurred in the March quarter.
Now let's take a look at our segment results. At our Media Networks segment, revenues in the quarter were up 3% compared with the prior year. Domestic revenues were flat, while international revenues grew 23%. Excluding a 13% unpaid rule [ph] impact from foreign currency, international revenues were up 36%. Channel 5 contributed 31 percentage points to international revenue growth in the quarter.
Page 11 of our web deck provides a breakdown of our Media Networks' revenue performance.
In terms of advertising, worldwide revenues were up 4% in the quarter. Domestic revenues were down 5% and international revenues increased 80%. The increase in international advertising was driven by growth in Europe, principally from Channel 5. Foreign exchange losses had a 17 percentage point impact on international advertising growth and a 2 percentage point impact on worldwide advertising growth.
In terms of affiliate revenues, worldwide revenues were up 3%. Domestic revenues were up 5% in the quarter, while international revenues declined 8%. Foreign exchange had a 13 percentage point unfavorable impact on international revenue growth and a 2 percentage point unfavorable impact on worldwide affiliate revenue growth.
Excluding the impact from the timing of product available under certain distribution agreements, domestic affiliate revenues grew mid- to high-single digits in the quarter. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, international affiliate revenues grew as a result of new channel launches, increases in subscribers as well as the timing of product available under certain distribution agreements.
Expenses increased 9% in the quarter. Within operating expenses, programming expense grew 10%, while distribution and other expenses increased 23%. SG&A expense was up 4% in the quarter. Increases in expenses were principally driven by the acquisition of Channel 5. Excluding the impact of Channel 5, total expenses were flat in the quarter, with growth in SG&A expense driven by higher advertising and promotion expense principally related to the marketing of new original series and specials.
Media Networks' adjusted operating income was down 5%, while the adjusted operating income margin declined to 36.8%. The margin decline was driven by the 9% growth in expenses, partially offset by top line revenue growth of 3%.
Moving to Filmed Entertainment. Revenues were down 21% in the quarter, principally due to decreases in home entertainment and licensed revenues. Page 13 of the web presentation provides a breakdown of Filmed Entertainment revenues. Theatrical revenues decreased 10%, as lower carryover revenues from prior period releases were partially offset by our current quarter releases, including The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water. Home entertainment revenues declined 25%, principally due to the lower revenues from the current quarter and prior period releases. License fees declined 32% in the quarter due to the number and mix of available titles. Filmed Entertainment generated adjusted operating income of $1 million in the quarter as compared to $11 million last year.
Now moving beyond the segment results. Other items principally reflect a loss of $10 million due to foreign exchange losses. In terms of taxes, the year-to-date adjusted effective tax rate was 31.8%, reflecting a 120 basis point improvement as compared to the prior year. The reduction in the adjusted effective tax rate was principally driven by the mix of domestic and international profitability.
And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Tom."
25403751,286527010,799937,"Viacom, Inc., Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2015",2015-04-30,"Earnings Calls","Viacom Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Wade. I'm going to talk about our cash flow, our debt and the return of capital to our shareholders. I'll also cover seasonal factors impacting the remainder of our 2015 fiscal year. For the quarter, we generated $598 million in free cash flow com",786,"Thanks, Wade. I'm going to talk about our cash flow, our debt and the return of capital to our shareholders. I'll also cover seasonal factors impacting the remainder of our 2015 fiscal year. For the quarter, we generated $598 million in free cash flow compared to $524 million free cash flow last year. Page 6 of the web deck presentation provides the components of free cash flow. The increase in free cash flow in the quarter was principally due to lower cash taxes, partially offset by higher working capital utilization.
Cash taxes benefited from provisions allowing for accelerated deductions related to domestic film and TV production expense. Working capital was principally impacted by a higher programming spend at Media Networks.
Now moving to our debt. It remains principally fixed rate, with an average cost at quarter end of 4.7%. We used part of the proceeds from the $1 billion of fixed rate debt we issued back in December to repay a $600 million outstanding of our 1.25% senior notes that came due in February. As for our variable rate borrowings, at quarter end we had $75 million of commercial paper outstanding.
In terms of our leverage, we ended the quarter with $13.2 billion of total debt and $306 million of cash and cash equivalents. The decrease in cash from the December quarter reflects the repayment of the senior notes that matured in February. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 3.1x. At March 31, our $2.5 million -- $2.5 billion bank revolver was undrawn. During the quarter, between our buyback and our dividend programs, we returned a total of $885 million of capital back to our shareholders, and we ended the quarter with 397 million shares outstanding. If you include our April dividend payment, we have returned a total of $1.9 billion to shareholders in the fiscal year, which is a return on market cap of approximately 7%.
Now let's turn to some of the factors impacting the remainder of our fiscal year. In terms of our affiliate revenue, quarterly revenue will fluctuate, given the timing of transactions and the recognition of revenue related to certain distribution agreements which are tied to product availability. Accordingly, for the June quarter, we anticipate that affiliate revenues will be relatively flat as compared to the prior year. However, we expect affiliate revenue will grow double digit in the September quarter.
For the full year, we expect that our -- the organic growth rate for Media Networks' programming expense will be in the mid-single digits. However, factoring in the acquisition of Channel 5, reported programming expense will grow in the mid-teens. For 2015, we are now forecasting a book tax rate of 31.8%.
At Filmed Entertainment, we are excited about our summer slate, which includes Terminator Genisys and Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation. For the June quarter, given that these films will be released later in the quarter with significant worldwide P&A expense, we anticipate difficult bottom line comparisons to the prior year. In the September quarter, we expect the studio will generate significant profits as they benefit from the carryover performance of these summer tentpoles as well as the availability of titles in the pay TV and syndication marketplaces.
Looking ahead at Paramount's production and development pipeline. The studio is currently in production on a number of projects, including Zoolander 2, which stars Ben Stiller, Owen Wilson and Will Ferrell; Ben-Hur, which is a coproduction with MGM; and The Big Short, an adaptation of Michael Lewis's book, starring Brad Pitt, Steve Carell, Christian Bale and Ryan Gosling. The second installment of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles recently went into production. And this summer, the studio starts production on Star Trek 3. Paramount is in development on a number of sequels to existing franchises, including World War Z, Jack Reacher and the recently announced sequel to The SpongeBob Movie.
In summary, the industry is evolving, and we have taken significant steps to realign our business to position the company to meet the challenges that lay ahead. By rethinking how we operate, we have reduced our cost structure, enabling us to invest in our brands and technology, while preserving our core margins. We are investing to enhance our capabilities to monetize our content outside of traditional measurements. We continue to develop specialized ad sales products, which enable us to monetize our consumers in innovative ways and provide our advertisers with new targeting capabilities to drive efficiency in their marketing campaigns. We remain committed to returning excess capital to our shareholders through our dividend and buyback programs, while at the same time, maintaining our investment-grade status.
With that, I would like to turn the call over to your questions. Operator?"

Look, I think the -- there are a number of offerings out there. They've always been available, by the way, the -- what people are calling skinny bundles used to be called family tiers, and there's always a place for bringing consumers into the television ecosystem. In many cases, young people getting into it, and over time, upgrading to larger packages. There is no greater value in existence today, as has been demonstrated in a number of studies of how the pricing works and what you get for the money, there's no greater value than the fire hose of programming that you get by getting a broad bundle which can be marketing -- marketed in a way that with promotional value to give consumers good value. Today, consumers get more original programming on television than they've ever gotten before. There are hundreds of shows across television, including our own, that get much more viewership than many of the shows that are touted out there on pure online delivery. And the functionality keeps getting better. We believe that functionality, the ability to view linear television, on-demand television on different devices and different places is revolutionary for consumers, and we're working very closely with our partners to build that value. At the same time, we're willing, as we always have been, to engage with our distributor partners in smaller bundles, again to bring people into the ecosystem. A lot has been talked about in this arena. A lot of hype about it. I don't think that's going to be a very significant change in the overall value proposition that exists in television today. We have, as I mentioned in my remarks, the #1 family of cable networks across just about every demo, except when you get to the really older demos. And as we continue to invest in original programming, all of our networks will keep getting better and better. And we'll work with our distributors and look at innovative ways to engage consumers."

So I'll just give you the example in the kids and family group. By putting together with Nick at Nite, TV Land and CMT, we now have a broad portfolio of more family-oriented networks where we can cross-fertilize program development and even the acquisitions can play across several networks. And the cross-promotion opportunities are obvious in that case. I see, for example, CMT being able to tap a more -- a much more logical group of shows that are developed for Nick at Nite, TV Land to appeal to that heartland audience, which is a growth opportunity for us, and to orient the development of CMT toward a more wholesome feel rather than have some of the programming which was more connected to MTV and really didn't take CMT to -- in a broader direction, I think, gives it great potential to grow. And we have a show like Younger. Younger, which has only had 4 episodes airing, we've aired it on -- it was created for TV Land. We've aired it on Nick at Nite. We put it on other venues. It's a great show. It's building fandom. We've had 24 million views across our platforms of Younger episodes. And that show, that's a greater performance that any of the big hits that are -- somebody asked about SVOD earlier. The biggest hits on SVOD do not have that kind of performance, as we're 4 shows in. So being able to expose Younger across these different platforms will help the show grow, justify investment in more and more original programming. And we can also be more judicious in how we acquire the third-party programming for those networks and get more value for that. So it's a big evolution going forward. This is not just about saving cost, although we are saving cost. It's about growing revenue. And I think we will see the results of that in fairly short order."

I'm trying get a sense of how long it will take before you really see sort of a transformative change in approach, where it goes from picking out kind of under-monetized advertising, which currently is the case, to really being much more additive and having a much more -- a very impactful impact on your advertising revenues."

One, delayed viewing, particularly if it's fairly near-term time-shifted viewing, still is very valuable to advertisers. And it's that connection -- we want programming that creates engagement that -- and that creates that urgency, that connection, and then having the advertiser be part of that connection with the audience something they're passionate about. Reaching a fan of Teen Wolf or Tyler Posey in Teen Wolf, that's a very valuable connection that we offer, not just on our VMA kind of event. But in moving to original programming, in moving to scripted, those are events, those are people -- people are engaging with the characters on the shows, and that you see the same across television. So this big shift that we're making toward increasing the level of production of original programming, making it more relevant across all of our networks, adding to our creative talent, adding to the Always On capability at MTV, having our content live on mobile as well as the big screen at home, capturing our fans on mobile where they live, being able to monetize that connection, that's the -- that's where the TV marketplace is going to. And as I said in my remarks, we are leading the charge. We are orienting our entire organization to doing that. When we did the realignment, yes, we saved money by looking at how we are organized, but we are also investing in our people. We're bringing new people. We're really building up our human resources to drive Viacom Vantage, these other initiatives. We're building up our programming resources. We're building up our capabilities in mobile. So we're reorienting our organization, our programming and our human resources to really be a major beneficiary of the transformation and how people are enjoying content. And the good news is they are enjoying more and more of it. So we are becoming less reliant -- it was part of our programming write-down, less reliant on that old, not-so-relevant programming that we had acquired years ago. We said goodbye to that, and we're saying hello to a lot of new, more engaging, more live in terms of participation kind of television content for our new audiences."

Some people like studios don't need the advertising after 3 or 4 days. It's not as relevant or not as valuable to them. But other advertisers, with the adding data to the conversation with them, are very, very interested in reaching the right consumer around the right content. And the right content is being constantly redefined as data allows us to demonstrate who might be a heavy consumer of fast-food product. It's, obviously, much more relevant to people who sell fast food. And we're now able to connect the dots and provide very hard data around which audiences are much more able to deliver heavy consumers of fast-food product or who might be people -- we can actually target for people concentrations of audiences that are not subscribers to their current product. In other words, they don't want to reach people who currently subscribe or advertise to their current product. They'd like to get the people that don't subscribe to them. And through data, we are beginning to be able to more precisely target audiences that are not their current customers to give them the opportunity to get in front of more potential new customers. So that is really what our conversations are taking up most of the time in our conversations with advertisers.

Thanks for joining us to discuss the third quarter of our 2015 fiscal year. Viacom continued to execute on our strategic plan, increasing our investment in outstanding creative content, building our international scale and capabilities and applying technology-driven innovations to both expand distribution and develop first-of-their-kind advertising platforms. There's no question that our industry is in the midst of significant change. Change can create uncertainty and concern, but with change also comes opportunity. And Viacom is seizing every opportunity. Many of our brands speak to the younger audiences that are the leading edge of the evolution of media. This has always proven to be an advantage over the years, and it will again as we accelerate our investment in initiatives, platforms and content. We continue to do the hard work to confidently move forward and lead our industry through the latest pivot. We have made necessary organizational changes at every level. As a result of our strategic realignment, the new larger music and entertainment and kids and family groups have made tremendous progress integrating their portfolios and accelerating investment in content. Across the company, we have never spent more money on original programming as we do today. Touch, Scream and Lip Sync Battle are all new success stories for Viacom and the result of our deep commitment to invest in our programming and our future. In fact, we are doubling down on quality original programming across our brands as acquired and syndicated shows our underperforming in today's environment. Our ownership and control of the vast majority of our content allow us to monetize across platforms and geographies. As a result of the continuing strength of our business and our financial discipline, we can continue to invest in all these important areas and deliver returns to shareholders. As previously announced, we will resume share repurchases in October.
Urgency and acceleration are front and center. Our senior executives understand both the challenges and the opportunities we have ahead, and they and their teams are fully engaged. We're nearing the end of our budget process for the coming year, and I can tell you that our teams and leaders, Bob the CEO of Viacom International Media Networks; Brad Grey, the CEO of Paramount; Doug Herzog, the CEO of our Music Entertainment Group; Debra Lee, the CEO of BET Networks; and the CEO of our Kids and Family group are fully committed to our success. They have company's financial, strategic and administrative support to define the future of their businesses and brands and the authority to execute that vision.
Let's take a quick look at our financial performance in the quarter. Media Networks revenues increased slightly driven by affiliate fees. Absent the impact of foreign exchange, Media Networks revenue grew 2%. Filmed Entertainment revenues were significantly impacted by the timing of the summer slate. As you know, we scheduled wide theatrical releases of our tentpole films for the fiscal fourth quarter. This resulted in an expected decline in Filmed Entertainment revenues, which were $479 million. As a result, our overall revenues declined 11% to $3.06 billion.
Quarterly adjusted operating income was steady at $1.08 billion, and adjusted net earnings were $591 million. Adjusted earnings per share increased by 4% to $1.47, a record for the June quarter. While domestic advertising revenues in the quarter were down 9%, and we expect comparable results in the current quarter, this significantly outpaces traditional ratings due to our substantial and growing next-generation advertising capabilities. These provide marketers with some of the most sophisticated and efficient products on the market. This initiative has momentum, and we're continuing to scale as our client base quickly expands.
Take Viacom Vantage. Vantage goes far beyond traditional demographics, integrating proprietary and third-party data that give advertisers the precision to customize the audience they want to reach and clear guidance to pinpoint the programming that best delivers on that target. 3 months ago, I told you that we had piloted this platform and that we were committed to move aggressively. I'm pleased to tell you today that Vantage is working with 10 of the largest and most sophisticated advertisers in the world, representing leading brands in a variety of sectors, including automotive, retail, telecom, financial services, consumer products and many others. In fact, Vantage already is generating significant incremental advertising revenue. And that's just a start. We have been investing in data and planning for this pivot for some time and are committed to accelerating the rollout from here.
On our Media Networks distribution side. We concluded 2 successful carriage agreements in the quarter with Charter and Mediacom. Both of these deals expand our relationships, providing more programming and more ways to consumers and delivering enhanced value for our brands. In addition, we continue to work productively with digital and over-the-top distributors to create innovative new experiences on a variety of platforms. We are working with MVPDs to accelerate improvements in the consumer experience by increasing the availability and flexibility of on-demand viewing, focusing on multidevice access, co-investing in content and experiences and extending partnerships relating to data and monetization.
We are also excited by the growth opportunity provided by mobile video, and we look forward to the prominent role our content will play in Verizon's new mobile video offerings.
Before I get to the performance of some of our individual brands, I'd like to provide an update on our international operations with preview as one of Viacom's most important and underappreciated assets. When I became CEO, one of the first opportunity areas I identified was our markets outside the U.S. Over the last several years, we have transformed Viacom International Media Networks from a collection of disparate channels into a strategically integrated portfolio leveraging content, technology and expertise across brands and regions. And we are just at the beginning.
Viacom already has enviable positions of scale in the world's key markets. In the U.K, the fastest-growing developed economy outside the U.S., Viacom is the second-largest privately held media network group. On the other end of the spectrum, we are 1 of the 4 largest media network groups in India, the fastest-growing economy in the developing world. Our operations in Europe are successful and expanding with new networks such as Channel 5, SPIKE U.K. as well as the Paramount Channel, which continues its rapid growth and has strong margins. Channel 5 has given us an additional original content engine, which has only begun to power our expansion in Europe.
We have also undergone major expansion in Latin America, Asia and Africa, building our brands in countries with enormous headroom for growth in their own media markets. Since 2012, Viacom has increased the number of channels per country in international markets by 22% and expanded our paid TV distribution by 50%. And even in the complicated Chinese market, we are establishing a position that is already profitable, albeit modestly so thus far.
I'm also pleased to tell you that since the end of the third quarter, we closed 2 key transactions overseas. In India, Viacom acquired a 50% interest in PRISM TV, which owns and operates popular regional entertainment channels. The Network18 Group, our partner in the Viacom 18 joint venture, holds the remaining 50%. Viacom 18 is the fastest-growing entertainment network in India, operating 10 channels including MTV, Nickelodeon, Comedy Central and Colors, a leading Hindi general entertainment brand. This deal gives Viacom a significant presence in the fast-growing regional TV sector in India, where almost 60% of the population speak regional languages.
In addition, we expanded our presence in Italy through the announcement of 2 new networks on Sky Italy, TeenNick and MTV Next, a new highly interactive MTV-branded channel. Year-to-date, we have launched 16 new networks in our international markets, and there are more to come.
Now let's talk in more detail about our Media Networks. MTV Scream, our newest scripted program for the network, has proven to be a bona fide hit, with more than 21 million viewers in its debut season. It was the #1 scripted series launch of the summer across all ad-supported cable and MTV's highest-rated series launch in a year among the core 12 to 34 demo. Scream continues to build. This series has consistently enjoyed viewership gains of more than 60% during the live 7 period over a live plus same day and double-digit increases every week in viewing across digital platforms. We have renewed Scream for a second season.
Of course, MTV's tentpole events still supply many of the most anticipated cultural moments on television, and the VMAs coming up later this month will be no exception. Miley Cyrus is returning, this time to host, for the first time since her breakthrough 2013 performance. Not surprisingly, the advertising response has been unprecedented. We are already sold out and expect to drive a second consecutive year of record revenue from the show.
Immediately after the VMAs, MTV will launch a new Monday 2-hour programming block, including fan favorites Awkward and Faking It, followed by the all-new Todd Rick and Girl Code Live. We will also launch our new MTV series, The Shannara Chronicles, in January.
Part of our commitment to accelerate delivery of original programming, Teen Wolf will return in January twice as fast as last year. We are also increasing the number of 2-hour blocks across MTV schedule and plan to air 23% more original prime time programming hours in fiscal 2016. Original programming is paying dividends at SPIKE as well. Lip Sync Battle has been a ratings champion since its launch in the third quarter, delivering record viewership. Over its 9-week initial run, Lip Sync Battle ranked #1 in its time slot in all of cable with adults 18 to 49, averaging 2.9 million viewers, and delivered nearly 200 million cross-platform digital streams. SPIKE's 3-night epic series Tut delivered an average of 2.2 million viewers, the largest average viewership for SPIKE in the time slot in 8 years. And a great majority of that audience was new to the network. A total of 27 million viewers consumed Tut content across digital platforms and VOD. Building on that success, SPIKE is moving quickly and greenlighting its first scripted dramatic series in almost a decade, with an announcement very shortly.
Nickelodeon also continues to create more great characters and original programming that kids love and drive engagement through television, digital, mobile and consumer products. In fact, Nickelodeon is rolling out almost 200 premiere episodes of original content in the next quarter, which will have an even greater impact as it reaches audiences on all of our growing platforms. Among 2- to 5-year-olds, Nick's preschool programming dominated in the quarter, and we plan to continue that by offering almost 100 new premiere episodes on the Nick Jr. block and channel next quarter. Nickelodeon was the highest-rated network in the preschool demo last quarter, owning all of the top 5 programs, including PAW Patrol, Monster Machines, Bubble Guppies, and Team Izumi. The portfolio of preschool hits has translated into nearly 40 million full episode views on the Nick Jr. app in the quarter. Delays in particular has been a breakout success across platforms as kids that watched episodes of the show millions of times over the quarter on the app, and we delivered even more viewership of the show on TV VOD.
Blaze consumer products are now coming to the marketplace, reinforced by the continued outstanding performance of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Among kids 6 to 11, the daily series Make It Pop is Nick's #1 show, like every which way and the kitchen, is another validation of the network's success with different formats and daily scripted series. Make It Pop will debut on Nickelodeon's international channels beginning this summer.
Comedy Central continues to be the #1 full-day entertainment network among young men 18 to 34 with 6 of the top 20 cable series in that demo. And it's even more successful beyond traditional measurement with total consumption across platforms beyond live plus 3, up 52%. Comedy Central is hands-down the premier destination for comedic talent offering a supportive platform with outstanding resources, deep audience connections, and's a creative-first philosophy. It has successfully partnered with comedians like Amy Schumer, Keegan Michael Key and Jordan Peel and Abby Jacobsen and Alana Glaser from Broad City to create programming that creates broad cultural impact and attracts loyal and engaged fans who propel them into the zeitgeist. The creative excellence of the Comedy Central brand is exemplified but it's recent haul of 26 Emmy nominations. Comedy Central's commitment to creativity creates unique opportunities. Perhaps, this is best exemplified by South Park and our latest announcement with Trey Parker and Matt Stone, extending our enduring relationship with Stan, Karl, Eric, Kenny and Sometimes Butters through 2019. South Park helped define Comedy Central's boundary-breaking mission and continues to be the #1 comedy series among young men nearly 2 decades later. We are thrilled to be working with them as Trey and Matt take South Park past its 300th episode.
The South Park team also has partnered with Comedy Central on cross-platform digital initiatives. In fact, South Park has extended its relationship on Hulu, providing broad distribution, deeper engagement with fans and outstanding value for Viacom.
We've been so proud of our work with Jon Stewart throughout his 16-year daily show run, which, as you know, ends tonight. Beyond his enormous contributions to advancing Comedy Central and Viacom, John has been an important voice in the national conversation. His legacy will live on within the well-oiled machine of The Daily Show, which will be welcoming Trevor Noah as a new host in September. We cannot be more pleased about the next chapter for the show. There's a tremendous opportunity to build on that franchise with late-night television's first millennial host, and we intend to make the most of it.
Comedy Central has an extremely robust pipeline and an unparalleled ability to program its content across multiple platforms. The network is launching 7 new series in 2016, including 3 animated series, which have strong appeal and a longer life across linear consumer products and digital extensions.
Moving to Paramount Pictures. We are pleased with the performance of Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation, which earned $120 million at the global box office in its first weekend. Terminator: Genisys, also released this quarter, had a strong showing with more than $315 million at the worldwide box office today. We're looking forward to adding to that total. Both of these films open in China the next few weeks. The first foreign titles to play in that market since mid-June.
With the success of our first Paramount Animation feature, our unparalleled marketing capability and increased production across genres, the studio is stepping up its output and will be back up to its annual target of 15 films in 2016. We're excited about the new films in the pipeline, including projects for Mark Wahlberg and Will Ferrell, who are starring in Daddy's Home, this Christmas. Michael Bay's 13 hours is coming early next year, followed by the epic retelling of Ben-Hur, and Ben Stiller's Zoolander 2 in February. Our newly launched Paramount Television operation has already built a formidable slate of shows, with the first completed coproduction Minority Report premiering on Fox in September.
To date, Paramount Television has 9 shows ordered to production and an additional 12 projects set up at networks and major digital outlets. Paramount Television's revenue is all incremental to our historical theatrical pipeline, and the television sales cycles has the benefit of smoothing out the variability of our Filmed Entertainment segment.
After a tough year, we believe Paramount is positioned to grow strongly next year and in the years to come, fueled both by a reinvigorated film business and our new high-growth TV production business. We continue to innovate in other areas. We recently announced a breakthrough partnership with AMC and Cineplex to close the gap between the theatrical and home entertainment windows for films that typically have shorter theatrical runs. It's a forward-looking solution that works for us, the theater owners, and for the consumer. We're optimistic about the strategy, and we'll see the benefit of this approach in future quarters.
EPIX, our successful joint venture with Lions Gate and MGM, continues to develop its own slate of original programming. The network is beginning production this fall on 2 new series, Berlin Station, a spy drama from Paramount Television; and Graves, a single-camera comedy starring Nick Nolte and Susan Sarandon, from Lions Gate.
I will conclude where I began. We are at the cutting edge of navigating the transition of our industry into the future, and we have positioned ourselves very well to do so. Our quality video content continues to perform well with young, highly coveted audiences. In the last quarter, Viacom was the #1 family of cable networks, as measured by Nielsen, in the key 2-to-49, 12-to-34, 18-to-34 and 18-to-49 demos. And industry-wide consumption on nonlinear platforms continues to expand, particularly with young viewers, growing nearly 30% since 2011. This gives Viacom's uniquely multiplatform brands and top-tier original content an even greater long-term advantage. That is why we continue to build our leadership position in multiplatform video consumption and aggressively pursue better monetization of consumers' deep engagement with our content through direct action and working with our affiliate advertising and digital partners.
Our organization is streamlined and improved. We have invested in more and more original content as well as cutting-edge data, marketing and measurement capabilities. We are successfully building an exceptional and high-growth international media platform, and we are investing in other growth initiatives, ranging from television production to film animation, to mobile, to consumer products.
As we begin to look forward to next fiscal year, we expect to deliver continued strong growth in affiliate revenues, a return to growth in our advertising revenues, a stronger slate and financial performance at Paramount and the resumption of our buyback program to complement our strong dividend yield.
And now I'd like to turn the call over to Wade."

At o",543,"Thanks, Philippe. Before I take you through our operating results, I want to note that our earnings release and web presentation summarizing the results for our June quarter are available on our website.
Now let's take a look at our segment results. At our Media Networks segment, revenues in the quarter were up slightly compared with the prior year. Domestic revenues were down 3% while international revenues grew 22%. Excluding a 10% unfavorable impact from foreign currency, international revenues were up 32%. Channel 5 contributed 33 percentage points to international revenue growth in the quarter. Page 10 of our web deck provides a breakdown of our Media Networks revenue performance.
In terms of advertising, worldwide revenues were down 2% in the quarter, domestic revenues were down 9%, and international revenues increased to 58%. The increase in international advertising revenues was driven principally by Channel 5. Foreign exchange losses had an 11 percentage point impact on international advertising growth.
In terms of affiliate revenues, worldwide revenues were up 2%. Domestic revenues were up 2% in the quarter while international revenues declined 3%. Excluding the impacts from the timing of product available under certain distribution agreements, domestic affiliate revenues grew mid-single digits in the quarter. Foreign exchange had an 11 percentage point unfavorable impact on international affiliate revenue growth. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, international affiliate revenues grew as a result of new channel launches, new distribution agreements as well as the timing of product available under certain distribution agreements.
Expenses increased 1% in the quarter. Within operating expenses, programming expense grew 3% while distribution and other expenses increased 10%. SG&A expense was down 6% in the quarter. Increases in expenses were principally driven by the acquisition of Channel 5. Excluding the impact of Channel 5, total expenses were down 7% in the quarter, principally due to the savings from our recent strategic realignment.
While Media Networks' adjusted operating income was down 1%, the adjusted operating income margin declined 40 basis points to 42.9%. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, adjusted operating income was flat.
Moving to Filmed Entertainment. Revenues were down 44% in the quarter principally due to decreases in theatrical and home entertainment revenues. Page 13 of the web presentation provides a breakdown of Filmed Entertainment revenues.
Theatrical revenues decreased 92% due to the timing of our summer tentpoles. Transformers: Age of Extinction was released in the June quarter of last year while Terminator: Genisys and Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation were widely released in the September quarter of this year.
Home Entertainment revenues declined 30%, principally due to lower revenues from third-party distribution and catalog titles. Ancillary revenues declined by 43% due primarily to a comparison in the prior year related to the sale of certain distribution rights.
Filmed Entertainment generated adjusted operating income of $48 million in the quarter as compared to $55 million last year.
Moving to taxes. The year-to-date effective tax rate was 31.8%, reflecting a 30 basis point improvement as compared to the prior year.
In terms of noncontrolling interest, the increase of $11 million in the quarter principally represents the minority interest share of income associated with the renewal of the content distribution agreement.
And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Tom."
25403751,303758918,850593,"Viacom, Inc., Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Aug 06, 2015",2015-08-06,"Earnings Calls","Viacom Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Wade. I'm going to talk about our cash flow, our debt and return of capital to our shareholders. I'll also cover seasonal factors impacting the fourth quarter of our 2015 fiscal year. For the quarter, we generated $380 million in operating free ca",711,"Thanks, Wade. I'm going to talk about our cash flow, our debt and return of capital to our shareholders. I'll also cover seasonal factors impacting the fourth quarter of our 2015 fiscal year. For the quarter, we generated $380 million in operating free cash flow compared to $571 million last year. Page 5 of the web deck presentation provides the components of free cash flow. The decline in operating free cash flow in the quarter was principally due to higher working capital utilization and higher cash interest. Working capital was impacted by increased TV program expense as well as production spend for the films including Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2.
Now moving on to our debt. It remains principally fixed rate with an average cost at quarter-end of 4.7%. At quarter-end, we had no variable-rate borrowings outstanding. In terms of our leverage, we ended the quarter with $13.1 billion of total debt and $421 million of cash and cash equivalent. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 3.1x. At June 30, our $2.5 billion bank revolver was undrawn.
In terms of capital return to shareholders, we increased our quarterly dividend by 21% to $0.40 for our July payment. If you include this dividend payment, we have returned a total of $2.1 billion [ph] to shareholders in the fiscal year, which is a return on market capitalization of approximately 10%.
Now let's turn to some of the factors impacting our fourth quarter and full year. In terms of our affiliate revenue, quarterly revenue will fluctuate given the timing of transactions and the recognition of revenue related to certain distribution agreements that are tied to product availability. Accordingly, for the September quarter, we anticipate that worldwide affiliate revenues will grow low double digits. For the full year, we expect that the organic growth rate for Media Networks' programming expense will be in the low to mid-single digits. However, factoring in the acquisition of Channel 5, reported programming expense will grow in the low to mid-teens. For 2015, we are forecasting a book tax rate of 31.8%.
Moving on to Filmed Entertainment. Given this year's mix of theatrical releases as compared to last year, on a full year basis, the studio will face difficult bottom line comparison. As we look into fiscal 2016, in October, the studio will release the final installment of our Paranormal franchise. Other December quarter releases include Ring, the third installment of the Ring franchise, as well as Daddy's Home.
Looking ahead at the studio's production and development pipeline, Paramount has wrapped production on Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2; Zoolander 2, which stars Ben Stiller, Owen Wilson and Will Ferrell; and The Big Short, which is based on the best-selling book by Michael Lewis and stars Brad Pitt, Steve Carrell, Christian Bale and Ryan Gosling as well as the CGI-animated Monster Trucks, which is directed by Chris Wedge. And they are currently in production on Star Trek 3 as well as Story of Your Life, which stars Amy Adams and Jeremy Renner. Paramount is in development on a number of sequels to existing franchises, including World War Z, Jack Reacher, Transformers, The SpongeBob Movie, and as announced this week, the sixth installment of Mission: Impossible.
In summary, while the industry continues to evolve, we are taking significant steps to realign our businesses to address these challenges. We have rethought our organization structure, reducing costs in certain areas while investing in our brands, technology and new capabilities. These investments have enabled us to monetize our content outside of traditional measurements through the development of specialized ad sales products. These offerings provide incremental value to our advertising partners by using targeting to drive efficiency in their marketing campaign. We have also invested in our international media networks over the past several years. We continue to launch new channels and brands, building scale in key markets. And we have entered into long-term distribution and ad sales agreement with key partners, positioning our international networks for growth. We remain committed to returning excess capital to our shareholders through our dividend and buyback programs while at the same time maintaining our investment-grade status.

Well, as I mentioned in my remarks, we successfully concluded the 2 agreements that were up in the last quarter, Mediacom and Charter. We look forward to renewing other affiliation agreements going forward. As I mentioned also, our networks are the -- constitute the leading family of cable networks out there and particularly in the key demos that are driving adoption of new services, whether it's broadband, utilization of other devices and so forth. We are working very closely with our partners even before renewals on how they can better engage those consumers so as to drive success of the ecosystem. We think there's a lot of work to be done. It is happening. I'm happy to see better consumer interfaces and better availability of video product for consumers, and that will help both the distributors and the programmers. So I have a lot of confidence in continuing to execute on that. And as far as our affiliate revenue growth, we will continue to deliver in this year and the years to come the high single-digit affiliate revenue growth. We have many long-term agreements in place. The organic rate increases under these long-term agreements average out in the high mid-single-digit rates. When you add to that the 2, 3 points, depending on the year of growth in new distribution opportunities, whether it's SVOD, new over-the-top services, new players, opportunities presented by renewals, you get to that high single [indiscernible] and we've managed our portfolio of renewal such that we have a pretty long view of most of our agreements, with a few coming up. So I have a lot of confidence in the continued growth of our affiliate revenue. On -- and that's domestically speaking. On the international front, as we roll out new networks, as we execute deals with -- such as the recent one that we did with Sky Italia, the expansion of our Sky U.K., launching new networks, as you look in the long run, I also see affiliate revenue growth to be a steady driver for many years to come and our international marketplace. And again, new technologies there in the international marketplace are a real upside opportunity for us. I've touched on China. Part of the reason we're modestly profitable already in China, whereas as you know it's hard to launch actual television networks, is there is a growing number of indigenous SVOD players in that marketplace. So we're able to introduce our content there. We're working on other revenue opportunities, consumer products, other areas that are open to us in that marketplace. Obviously, the film market is really growing well for us in China. We look forward to growing that. But that's just one example of a number of opportunities available to us in growing these new forms of revenue. And mobile, I touched on mobile. It's a very exciting opportunity. Mobile video distribution, affiliate and as well as advertising will begin to be a significant and rapidly growing opportunity in -- as we head into the next fiscal year. So we are extremely well positioned, owning our content, having the content that appeals to young audiences and having content that we can roll out around the world."

We also view the television operation as strategic for our media networks. Where -- there's a lot of interaction between the Paramount television group and our cable network groups. And as we go more and more into scripted series across virtually all of our networks, the Paramount Television Group is an in-house source of a high-level creative talent, and that is something that you will see unfold as we go forward with already several series picked up by our network.

We've outlined in our presentation today all the initiatives that we're taking, the growth that we have ahead, the balance in our revenue streams going forward, the inherent value of our international portfolio, the fact that we are the leading edge of taking advantage through our direct action and working with our partners who are also improving the consumer experience, which will drive monetization value, having -- being able to do better monetization of advertising opportunities through addressable advertising, whether it's on video on demand or otherwise, will stabilize and allow us to get back to growth on ad revenues. The asset value at this price level is -- the asset value of the underlying assets far outpaces what's reflected in the marketplace. Even before you get to operating businesses, if you just look at what's below the line, Michael, if you take the value of our joint venture interest in EPIX and our very successful Viacom 18 joint venture in India, even the hidden asset, we own spectrum from low-power stations that were once used -- casually one of our networks that are not used, when you add all that up -- just that, and I haven't even touched on operating basis, you have several dollars per share of value, all right? You take the value of our international operations, and you look at how international operations are valued around the world and the high growth for many, many years ahead, I leave it to you analysts to figure out the value of that. And you take Paramount -- and you take -- and then you get to our Media Networks business, which has multiple opportunities ahead, the mobile video opportunity is in fairly short order, a potential hundreds of millions of dollars a year opportunity. And it will -- it is -- given the direction in which the major mobile companies are going, this is a particularly significant opportunity for us. So we have in the past gone through this market dislocations. And we, obviously, as you know, we believe in our stock. We are resuming our buyback program in October. As Tom said, we are going to conduct it in a responsible way over time and keeping in mind that we want to maintain our investment-grade rating. But the stock, once we reached -- once we pass certain milestones, will reflect our performance. It is certainly not reflecting it today."

Yes, as far as -- look, we obviously are still only in the early part of the second month of the quarter, but we -- and so we are not assuming immediate ratings improvement and getting to offer prognostications. We're giving you our best guess and trying to be realistic about the quarter. The reason that we have a view that we're going to resume growth in advertising revenue in the fall fiscal year next year is that obviously we had a tough year this year. We have begun to expand the scale of our targeted advertising initiatives, the Viacom's Vantage, Viacom Velocity. We've added a lot of human resources to those efforts. It was an important part of our upfront discussions with major advertisers. And by the way, given the overall difficult nature of the upfront marketplace, which the overall television market was down in volume, we did well and came very, very close to the level of volume that we had last year, notwithstanding what took place in the ratings. We have a larger volume of signature original shows. We have more events that we are -- shows that we're building. We have more scripted series. These are higher value, and we are increasing accordingly our ad revenues from significant advertisers who want to engage with those kinds of programs on our networks. And again, our distributor partners are enhancing their own products. And yes, we're beginning to see some ramp-up and things like dynamic ad insertion in video on demand. I mentioned new products in the mobile arena also offer advertising opportunities. So we feel that we are going to be able to climb back up as we add all those different factors in."

Live -- there's more and more delayed viewing of programming. So obviously, the live same-day kind of ratings become less and less meaningful as we go forward. So I think in terms of the -- what is the currency today, the C3, there's a lot more viewing taking place in that 2 and 3 part. Then there's also more viewing taking place beyond that, and there's also viewing taking place on other platforms. This is where our Viacom Vantage product, which we have now introduced in a major way with 10 of our largest advertisers in different sectors, and we're going to add to that number, allow us different measurement metrics to complement the traditional ratings and therefore improve the monetization. What we found across our schedule is that we have better ratings on the -- our prime dayparts. Where there is significant weakness is in other dayparts where you have a lot of repeats, off-network syndication. This is true across television. And so -- and in part because there's a lot of choice on the part of viewers. This is where strategically we are increasing the amount of original program. And a lot of it, as I mentioned, whether it's animation, whether it's serialized low-cost programming that we run across dayparts, for example, on Nickelodeon. We are working to improve the performance of those dayparts. The original shows that we are launching, particularly when you add the other viewings taking place, measure fully up to what we were achieving with shows that aired over the last several years. So a show like Bella and The Bulldogs is performing at the same kind of level when you add the -- there's delayed viewing on all the rest, as I Carly did when it launched. So this is a process that's not overnight, day by day, but it's a continual adjustment which we're doing. The personnel realignment and improvements that we're making are bearing fruit already. There's a -- we are accelerating. Accelerating is a word we use a lot here at Viacom. So we are accelerating our efforts to speed up next seasons of shows that worked, like the Teen Wolf example I gave you. We're accelerating the development and production of the kind of programming that works, whether it's scripted series, animation, events. We very recently had the second annual Kids' Choice Sports Awards, which is a new event, and it is a very successful and popular show with advertisers. The BET Experience also recently launched and continues to grow year after year. So we'll continue to look to add the kind of programming that works particularly well with the young audiences and millennial audiences, and that includes on-air talent. I am personally very excited about the potential of Trevor Noah on The Daily Show in reaching and bringing to that great show a younger average audience, which is a hard audience to reach. We are -- if you want to get reach on young audiences, if you want to get kids, if you're a toy company, Nickelodeon's the place to be. So we are being extremely proactive in taking all measures that are necessary to address the changing media landscape, and it is a changing media landscape. I think we'll come out on the other side in a much stronger place."

As those initiatives come to fruition, the value for the consumer will expand. The churn rate should improve. So there is a very positive impact on having on the distribution side forward-looking operators who will build the ecosystem, which benefits both sides, because the value of what they're offering consumers depends on the content. And we and many of our competitors are continually increasing the value of the content. We are producing more original programming. We are less reliant on old shows, 20-, 30-, 40-year-old shows. We are providing fresh content that's going to be usable in more ways. And so we view all distributors as our partners. And as we do renewals, we discuss all these new services.

Thanks for joining us to discuss the third quarter of our 2015 fiscal year. Viacom continued to execute on our strategic plan, increasing our investment in outstanding creative content, building our international scale and capabilities and applying technology-driven innovations to both expand distribution and develop first-of-their-kind advertising platforms. 
There's no question that our industry is in the midst of significant change. Change can create uncertainty and concern. But with change also comes opportunity. And Viacom is seizing every opportunity. Many of our brands speak to the younger audiences that are the leading edge of the evolution of media. This has always proven to be an advantage over the years, and it will, again, as we accelerate our investment in initiatives, platforms and content.  We continue to do the hard work to confidently move forward and lead our industry through the latest pivot. 
We have made necessary organizational changes at every level. As a result of our strategic realignment, the new larger music and entertainment and kids and family groups have made tremendous progress integrating their portfolios and accelerating investment in content. Across the company, we have never spent more money on original programming as we do today. Tut, Scream and Lip Sync Battle are all new success stories for Viacom and the result of our deep commitment to invest in our programming and our future. 
In fact, we are doubling down on quality original programming across our brands as acquired and syndicated shows our underperforming in today's environment. Our ownership and control of the vast majority of our content allow us to monetize across platforms and geographies. As a result of the continuing strength of our business and our financial discipline, we can continue to invest in all these important areas and deliver returns to shareholders. As previously announced, we will resume share repurchases in October.
Urgency and acceleration are front and center. Our senior executives understand both the challenges and the opportunities we have ahead, and they and their teams are fully engaged. We're nearing the end of our budget process for the coming year, and I can tell you that our teams and leaders, Bob Bakish, the CEO of Viacom International Media Networks; Brad Grey, the CEO of Paramount; Doug Herzog, the CEO of our Music and Entertainment Group; Debra Lee, the CEO of BET Networks; and Cyma Zarghami, the CEO of our Kids & Family group are fully committed to our success. They have the company's financial, strategic and administrative support to define the future of their businesses and brands and the authority to execute that vision.
Let's take a quick look at our financial performance in the quarter. Media Networks revenues increased slightly driven by affiliate fees. Absent the impact of foreign exchange, Media Networks revenue grew 2%. Filmed Entertainment revenues were significantly impacted by the timing of the summer slate. As you know, we scheduled the wide theatrical releases of our tentpole films for the fiscal fourth quarter. This resulted in an expected decline in Filmed Entertainment revenues, which were $479 million. As a result, our overall revenues declined 11% to $3.06 billion.
Quarterly adjusted operating income was steady at $1.08 billion, and adjusted net earnings were $591 million. Adjusted earnings per share increased by 4% to $1.47, a record for the June quarter. While domestic advertising revenues in the quarter were down 9%, and we expect comparable results in the current quarter, this significantly outpaces traditional ratings due to our substantial and growing next-generation advertising capabilities. These provide marketers with some of the most sophisticated and efficient products on the market. This initiative has momentum, and we're continuing to scale as our client base quickly expands.
Take Viacom Vantage. Vantage goes far beyond traditional demographics, integrating proprietary and third-party data to give advertisers the precision to customize the audience they want to reach and clear guidance to pinpoint the programming that best delivers on that target. 3 months ago, I told you that we had piloted this platform and that we were committed to move aggressively. I'm pleased to tell you today that Vantage is working with 10 of the largest and most sophisticated advertisers in the world, representing leading brands in a variety of sectors, including automotive, retail, telecom, financial services, consumer products and many others. In fact, Vantage already is generating significant incremental advertising revenue. And that's just a start. We have been investing in data and planning for this pivot for some time and are committed to accelerating the rollout from here.
On our Media Networks distribution side. We concluded 2 successful carriage agreements in the quarter with Charter and Mediacom. Both of these deals expand our relationships, providing more programming and more ways to consumers and delivering enhanced value for our brands. In addition, we continue to work productively with digital and over-the-top distributors to create innovative new experiences on a variety of platforms. We are working with MVPDs to accelerate improvements in the consumer experience by increasing the availability and flexibility of on-demand viewing, focusing on multi-device access, co-investing in content and experiences and extending partnerships relating to data and monetization.
We are also excited by the growth opportunity provided by mobile video, and we look forward to the prominent role our content will play in Verizon's new mobile video offering.  
Before I get to the performance of some of our individual brands, I'd like to provide an update on our international operations which we view as one of Viacom's most important and underappreciated assets. 
When I became CEO, one of the first opportunity areas I identified was our markets outside the U.S. Over the last several years, we have transformed Viacom International Media Networks from a collection of disparate channels into a strategically integrated portfolio leveraging content, technology and expertise across brands and regions. And we are just at the beginning.
Viacom already has enviable positions of scale in the world's key markets. In the U.K, the fastest-growing developed economy outside the U.S., Viacom is the second-largest privately held media network group. On the other end of the spectrum, we are 1 of the 4 largest media network groups in India, the fastest-growing economy in the developing world. 
Our operations in Europe are successful and expanding, with new networks such as Channel 5, SPIKE U.K. as well as the Paramount Channel, which continues its rapid growth and has strong margins. Channel 5 has given us an additional original content engine, which has only begun to power our expansion in Europe.  We have also undergone major expansion in Latin America, Asia and Africa, building our brands in countries with enormous headroom for growth in their own media markets. Since 2012, Viacom has increased the number of channels per country in international markets by 22% and expanded our paid TV distribution by 50%. And even in the complicated Chinese market, we are establishing a position that is already profitable, albeit modestly so, thus far.
I'm also pleased to tell you that since the end of the third quarter, we closed 2 key transactions overseas. In India, Viacom acquired a 50% interest in Prism TV, which owns and operates popular regional entertainment channels. The Network18 Group, our partner in the Viacom 18 joint venture, holds the remaining 50%. Viacom 18 is the fastest-growing entertainment network in India, operating 10 channels including MTV, Nickelodeon, Comedy Central and COLORS, a leading Hindi general entertainment brand. This deal gives Viacom a significant presence in the fast-growing regional TV sector in India, where almost 60% of the population speak regional languages.
In addition, we expanded our presence in Italy through the announcement of 2 new networks on Sky Italy, TeenNick and MTV Next, a new highly interactive MTV-branded channel. Year-to-date, we have launched 16 new networks in our international markets, and there are more to come.
Now let's talk in more detail about our Media Networks. MTV's Scream, our newest scripted program for the network, has proven to be a bona fide hit, with more than 21 million viewers in its debut season. It was the #1 scripted series launch of the summer across all ad-supported cable and MTV's highest-rated series launch in a year among the core 12 to 34 demo. Scream continues to build. The series has consistently enjoyed viewership gains of more than 60% during the live 7 period over a live plus same day, and double-digit increases every week in viewing across digital platforms. We have renewed Scream for a second season.  Of course, MTV's tentpole events still supply many of the most anticipated cultural moments on television, and the VMAs coming up later this month will be no exception. Miley Cyrus is returning, this time to host, for the first time since her breakthrough 2013 performance. Not surprisingly, the advertising response has been unprecedented. We are already sold out and expect to drive a second consecutive year of record revenue from the show.
Immediately after the VMAs, MTV will launch a new Monday 2-hour programming block, including fan favorites Awkward and Faking It, followed by the all-new Todrick  and Girl Code Live. We will also launch our new MTV series, The Shannara Chronicles, in January.
Part of our commitment to accelerate delivery of original programming, Teen Wolf will return in January twice as fast as last year. We are also increasing the number of 2-hour blocks across MTV schedule and plan to air 23% more original prime time programming hours in fiscal 2016. 
Original programming is paying dividends at SPIKE as well. Lip Sync Battle has been a ratings champion since its launch in the third quarter, delivering record viewership. Over its 9-week initial run, Lip Sync Battle ranked #1 in its time slot in all of cable with adults 18 to 49, averaging 2.9 million viewers, and delivered nearly 200 million cross-platform digital streams. SPIKE's 3-night epic series Tut delivered an average of 2.2 million viewers, the largest average viewership for SPIKE in the time slot in 8 years. And a great majority of that audience was new to the network. A total of 27 million viewers consume Tut content across digital platforms and VOD. 
Building on that success, SPIKE is moving quickly and greenlighting its first scripted dramatic series in almost a decade, with an announcement very shortly.
Nickelodeon also continues to create more great characters and original programming that kids love and drive that engagement through television, digital, mobile and consumer products. In fact, Nickelodeon is rolling out almost 200 premiere episodes of original content in the next quarter, which will have an even greater impact as it reaches audiences on all of our growing platforms. Among 2- to 5-year-olds, Nick's preschool programming dominated in the quarter, and we plan to continue that by offering almost 100 new premiere episodes on the Nick Jr. block and channel next quarter. Nickelodeon was the highest-rated network in the preschool demo last quarter, owning all of the top 5 programs, including PAW Patrol, Blaze and the Monster Machines, Bubble Guppies, Wallykazam! and Team Umizoomi. The portfolio of preschool hits has translated into nearly 40 million full episode views on the Nick Jr. app in the quarter. Blaze in particular has been a breakout success across platforms as kids that watched episodes of the show millions of times over the quarter on the app, and we delivered even more viewership of the show on TV VOD.
Blaze consumer products are now coming to the marketplace, reinforced by the continued outstanding performance of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Among kids 6 to 11, the daily series Make It Pop is Nick's #1 show, like Every Witch Way and Talia in the Kitchen, it is another validation of the network's success with different formats and daily scripted series. Make It Pop will debut on Nickelodeon's international channels beginning this summer.
Comedy Central continues to be the #1 full-day entertainment network among young men 18 to 34 with 6 of the top 20 cable series in that demo. And it's even more successful beyond traditional measurement, with total consumption across platforms beyond live plus 3 [ph], up 52%. Comedy Central is, hands down, the premier destination for comedic talent offering a supportive platform with outstanding resources, deep audience connections and a creative-first philosophy. It has successfully partnered with comedians like Amy Schumer, Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peele and Abbi Jacobson and  Ilana Glazer from Broad City to create programming that creates broad cultural impact and attracts loyal, engaged fans who propel them into the zeitgeist. The creative excellence of the Comedy Central brand is exemplified by it's recent haul of 26 Emmy nominations. Comedy Central's commitment to creativity creates unique opportunities. Perhaps, this is best exemplified by South Park in our latest announcement with Trey Parker and Matt Stone, extending our enduring relationship with Stan, Kyle, Eric, Kenny, and sometimes, Butters through 2019. South Park helped define Comedy Central's boundary-breaking mission and continues to be the #1 comedy series among young men nearly 2 decades later. We are thrilled to be working with them as Trey and Matt take South Park past its 300th episode.
The South Park team also has partnered with Comedy Central on cross-platform digital initiatives. In fact, South Park has extended its relationship on Hulu, providing broad distribution, deeper engagement with fans and outstanding value for Viacom.
We've been so proud of our work with Jon Stewart throughout his 16-year daily show run, which, as you know, ends tonight. Beyond his enormous contributions to advancing Comedy Central and Viacom, John has been an important voice in the national conversation. His legacy will live on within the well-oiled machine of The Daily Show, which will be welcoming Trevor Noah as the new host in September. We cannot be more pleased about the next chapter for the show. There is a tremendous opportunity to build on that franchise with late-night television's first millennial host, and we intend to make the most of it.
Comedy Central has an extremely robust pipeline and an unparalleled ability to program its content across multiple platforms. The network is launching 7 new series in 2016, including 3 animated series, which have strong appeal and a longer life across linear consumer products and digital extensions.
Moving to Paramount Pictures. We are pleased with the performance of Mission: Impossible Rogue Nation, which earned $120 million at the global box office in its first weekend. Terminator Genisys, also released this quarter, had a strong showing of more than $315 million at the worldwide box office to date. We are looking forward to adding to that total. Both of these films open in China the next few weeks, the first foreign titles to play in that market since mid-June.
With the success of our first Paramount Animation feature, our unparalleled marketing capability and increased production across genres, the studio is stepping up its output and will be back up to its annual target of 15 films in 2016. We're excited about the new films in the pipeline, including projects for Mark Wahlberg and Will Ferrell, who are starring in Daddy's Home, this Christmas; Michael Bay's 13 hours coming early next year; followed by the epic retelling of Ben-Hur, and Ben Stiller's Zoolander 2 in February. Our newly launched Paramount Television operation has already built a formidable slate of shows, with the first completed coproduction Minority Report premiering on FOX in September.
To date, Paramount Television has 9 shows ordered to production and an additional 12 projects set up at networks and major digital outlets. Paramount Television's revenue is all incremental to our historical theatrical pipeline, and the television sales cycle has the benefit of smoothing out the variability of our Filmed Entertainment segment.
After a tough year, we believe Paramount is positioned to grow strongly next year and in the years to come, fueled both by a reinvigorated film business and our new high-growth TV production business. We continue to innovate in other areas. We recently announced a breakthrough partnership with AMC and Cineplex to close the gap between the theatrical and home entertainment windows for films that typically have shorter theatrical runs. It's a forward-looking solution that works for us, the theater owners, and for the consumer. We're optimistic about the strategy, and we'll see the benefit of this approach in future quarters.
EPIX, our successful joint venture with Lionsgate and MGM, continues to develop its own slate of original programming. The network is beginning production this fall on 2 new series, Berlin Station, a spy drama from Paramount Television; and Graves, a single-camera comedy starring Nick Nolte and Susan Sarandon, from Lionsgate.
I will conclude where I began. We are at the cutting edge of navigating the transition of our industry into the future, and we have positioned ourselves very well to do so. Our quality video content continues to perform well with young, highly coveted audiences. In the last quarter, Viacom was the #1 family of cable networks, as measured by Nielsen, in the key 2-to-49, 12-to-34, 18-to-34 and 18-to-49 demos. And industry-wide consumption on nonlinear platforms continues to expand, particularly with young viewers, growing nearly 30% since 2011. This gives Viacom's uniquely multi-platform brands and top-tier original content an even greater long-term advantage. That is why we continue to build our leadership position in multiplatform video consumption and aggressively pursue better monetization of consumers' deep engagement with our content through direct action and working with our affiliate advertising and digital partners.
Our organization is streamlined and improved. We have invested in more and more original content as well as cutting-edge data, marketing and measurement capabilities. We are successfully building an exceptional and high-growth international media platform, and we are investing in other growth initiatives, ranging from television production to film animation, to mobile, to consumer products.
As we begin to look forward to next fiscal year, we expect to deliver continued strong growth in affiliate revenues, a return to growth in our advertising revenues, a stronger slate and financial performance at Paramount and the resumption of our buyback program to complement our strong dividend yield.
And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Wade."

Before I take you through our operating results, I want to note that our earnings release and web presentations summarizing the results for our June quarter are available on our website.Now let's take a look at our segment results. At",542,"Thanks, Philippe. Before I take you through our operating results, I want to note that our earnings release and web presentations summarizing the results for our June quarter are available on our website.
Now let's take a look at our segment results. At our Media Networks segment, revenues in the quarter were up slightly compared with the prior year. Domestic revenues were down 3% while international revenues grew 22%. Excluding a 10% unfavorable impact from foreign currency, international revenues were up 32%. Channel 5 contributed 33 percentage points to international revenue growth in the quarter. Page 10 of our web deck provides a breakdown of our Media Networks revenue performance.
In terms of advertising, worldwide revenues were down 2% in the quarter, domestic revenues were down 9%, and international revenues increased to 58%. The increase in international advertising revenues was driven principally by Channel 5. Foreign exchange losses had an 11 percentage point impact on international advertising growth.
In terms of affiliate revenues, worldwide revenues were up 2%. Domestic revenues were up 2% in the quarter, while international revenues declined 3%. Excluding the impacts from the timing of product available under certain distribution agreements, domestic affiliate revenues grew mid-single digits in the quarter. Foreign exchange had an 11 percentage point unfavorable impact on international affiliate revenue growth. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, international affiliate revenues grew as a result of new channel launches, new distribution agreements as well as the timing of product available under certain distribution agreements.
Expenses increased 1% in the quarter. Within operating expenses, programming expense grew 3%, while distribution and other expenses increased 10%. SG&A expense was down 6% in the quarter. Increases in expenses were principally driven by the acquisition of Channel 5. Excluding the impact of Channel 5, total expenses were down 7% in the quarter, principally due to the savings from our recent strategic realignment.
While Media Networks' adjusted operating income was down 1%, the adjusted operating income margin declined 40 basis points to 42.9%. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, adjusted operating income was flat.
Moving to Filmed Entertainment. Revenues were down 44% in the quarter, principally due to decreases in theatrical and home entertainment revenues. Page 13 of the web presentation provides a breakdown of Filmed Entertainment revenues.
Theatrical revenues decreased 92% due to the timing of our summer tentpoles. Transformers: Age of Extinction was released in the June quarter of last year, while Terminator Genisys and Mission: Impossible Rogue Nation were widely released in the September quarter of this year.
Home Entertainment revenues declined 30%, principally due to lower revenues from third-party distribution and catalog titles. Ancillary revenues declined by 43%, due primarily to a comparison in the prior year related to the sale of certain distribution rights.
Filmed Entertainment generated adjusted operating income of $48 million in the quarter as compared to $55 million last year.
Moving to taxes. The year-to-date effective tax rate was 31.8%, reflecting a 30 basis point improvement as compared to the prior year.
In terms of noncontrolling interest, the increase of $11 million in the quarter principally represents the minority interest share of income associated with the renewal of the content distribution agreement.
And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Tom."
25403751,303758918,851107,"Viacom, Inc., Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Aug 06, 2015",2015-08-06,"Earnings Calls","Viacom Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Wade. I'm going to talk about our cash flow, our debt and return of capital to our shareholders. I'll also cover seasonal factors impacting the fourth quarter of our 2015 fiscal year. For the quarter, we generated $380 million in operating free",709,"Thanks, Wade. I'm going to talk about our cash flow, our debt and return of capital to our shareholders. I'll also cover seasonal factors impacting the fourth quarter of our 2015 fiscal year. 
For the quarter, we generated $380 million in operating free cash flow compared to $571 million last year. Page 5 of the web deck presentation provides the components of free cash flow. The decline in operating free cash flow in the quarter was principally due to higher working capital utilization and higher cash interest. Working capital was impacted by increased TV programming spend, as well as production spend for the films including Mission: Impossible Rogue Nation and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2.
Now moving on to our debt. It remains principally fixed rate with an average cost at quarter-end of 4.7%. At quarter-end, we had no variable rate borrowings outstanding. In terms of our leverage, we ended the quarter with $13.1 billion of total debt and $421 million of cash and cash equivalent. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 3.1x. At June 30, our $2.5 billion bank revolver was undrawn.
In terms of capital return to shareholders, we increased our quarterly dividend by 21% to $0.40 for our July payment. If you include this dividend payment, we have returned a total of $2.1 billion  to shareholders in the fiscal year, which is a return on market capitalization of approximately 10%.
Now let's turn to some of the factors impacting our fourth quarter and full year. In terms of our affiliate revenue, quarterly revenue will fluctuate given the timing of transactions and the recognition of revenue related to certain distribution agreements that are tied to product availability. Accordingly, for the September quarter, we anticipate that worldwide affiliate revenues will grow low-double digits. For the full year, we expect that the organic growth rate for Media Networks' programming expense will be in the low- to mid-single digits. However, factoring in the acquisition of Channel 5, reported programming expense will grow in the low- to mid-teens. For 2015, we are forecasting a book tax rate of 31.8%.
Moving on to Filmed Entertainment. Given this year's mix of theatrical releases as compared to last year, on a full year basis, the studio will face difficult bottom line comparison. As we look into fiscal 2016, in October, the studio will release the final installment of our Paranormal franchise. Other December quarter releases include Ring, the third installment of the Ring franchise, as well as Daddy's Home.
Looking ahead at the studio's production and development pipeline, Paramount has wrapped production on Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2; Zoolander 2, which stars Ben Stiller, Owen Wilson and Will Ferrell; and The Big Short, which is based on the best-selling book by Michael Lewis and stars Brad Pitt, Steve Carrell, Christian Bale and Ryan Gosling as well as the CGI-animated Monster Trucks, which is directed by Chris Wedge. And they are currently in production on Star Trek 3 as well as Story of Your Life, which stars Amy Adams and Jeremy Renner. Paramount is in development on a number of sequels to existing franchises, including World War Z, Jack Reacher, Transformers, The SpongeBob Movie, and as announced this week, the sixth installment of Mission: Impossible.
In summary, while the industry continues to evolve, we are taking significant steps to realign our businesses to address these challenges. We have rethought our organization structure, reducing costs in certain areas while investing in our brands, technology and new capabilities. These investments have enabled us to monetize our content outside of traditional measurements through the development of specialized ad sales products. These offerings provide incremental value to our advertising partners by using targeting to drive efficiency in their marketing campaign. We have also invested in our international media networks over the past several years. We continue to launch new channels and brands, building scale in key markets. And we have entered into long-term distribution and ad sales agreement with key partners, positioning our international networks for growth. We remain committed to returning excess capital to our shareholders through our dividend and buyback programs while at the same time, maintaining our investment-grade status.

Well, as I mentioned in my remarks, we successfully concluded the 2 agreements that were up in the last quarter, Mediacom and Charter. We look forward to renewing other affiliation agreements going forward. As I mentioned also, our networks are the -- constitute the leading family of cable networks out there and particularly in the key demos that are driving adoption of new services, whether it's broadband, utilization of other devices and so forth. We are working very closely with our partners, even before renewals, on how they can better engage those consumers so as to drive success of the ecosystem. We think there's a lot of work to be done. It is happening. I'm happy to see better consumer interfaces and better availability of video product for consumers, and that will help both the distributors and the programmers. So I have a lot of confidence in continuing to execute on that. And as far as our affiliate revenue growth, we will continue to deliver, in this year and the years to come, the high single-digit affiliate revenue growth. We have many long-term agreements in place. The organic rate increases under these long-term agreements average out in the high mid-single-digit rates. When you add to that the 2, 3 points, depending on the year of growth in new distribution opportunities, whether it's SVOD, new over-the-top services, new players, opportunities presented by renewals, you get to that high single [indiscernible] and we've managed our portfolio of renewal such that we have a pretty long view of most of our agreements, with a few coming up. So I have a lot of confidence in the continued growth of our affiliate revenue. On -- and that's domestically speaking. On the international front, as we roll out new networks, as we execute deals with -- such as the recent one that we did with Sky Italia, the expansion of our Sky U.K., launching new networks, as you look in the long run, I also see affiliate revenue growth to be a steady driver for many years to come and our international marketplace. And again, new technologies there in the international marketplace are a real upside opportunity for us. I've touched on China. Part of the reason we're modestly profitable already in China, where as you know, it's hard to launch actual television networks, is there is a growing number of indigenous SVOD players in that marketplace. So we're able to introduce our content there. We're working on other revenue opportunities, consumer products, other areas that are open to us in that marketplace. Obviously, the film market is really growing well for us in China. We look forward to growing that. But that's just one example of a number of opportunities available to us in growing these new forms of revenue. And mobile, I touched on mobile. It's a very exciting opportunity. Mobile video distribution, affiliate and as well as advertising will begin to be a significant and rapidly growing opportunity in -- as we head into the next fiscal year. So we are extremely well-positioned, owning our content, having the content that appeals to young audiences and having content that we can roll out around the world."

The good news is we're able to run this business on a very low structural overhead, and we're also able to essentially largely cover cost of production based on the deals that are available in today's marketplace, particularly when you fold in international distribution opportunities with respect to that content. We also view the television operation as strategic for our media networks. There is a lot of interaction between the Paramount television group and our cable network groups. And as we go more and more into scripted series across virtually all of our networks, the Paramount Television Group is an in-house source of high-level creative talent, and that is something that you will see unfold as we go forward with already several series picked up by our networks. And EPIX, our pay service joint venture, is going to have a high-quality television series for the first time next fall, which will continue to drive value for EPIX in the future."

And it will -- it is -- given the direction in which the major mobile companies are going, this is a particularly significant opportunity for us. So we have in the past gone through these market dislocations. And we, obviously, as you know, we believe in our stock. We are resuming our buyback program in October. As Tom said, we are going to conduct it in a responsible way over time, keeping in mind that we want to maintain our investment-grade rating.

Yes, as far as -- look, we obviously are still only in the early part of the second month of the quarter, but we -- and so we are not assuming immediate ratings improvement and giving our prognostications. We're giving you our best guess and trying to be realistic about the quarter. The reason that we have a view that we are going to resume growth in advertising revenue in the fall fiscal year next year is that obviously we had a tough year this year. We have begun to expand the scale of our targeted advertising initiatives, the Viacom Vantage, Viacom Velocity. We've added a lot of human resources to those efforts. It was an important part of our upfront discussions with major advertisers. And by the way, given the overall difficult nature of the upfront marketplace, which the overall television market was down in volume, we did well and came very, very close to the level of volume that we had last year, notwithstanding what took place in the ratings. We have a larger volume of signature original shows. We have more events that we are -- event shows we're building. We have more scripted series. These are higher value. And we are increasing accordingly our ad revenues from significant advertisers who want to engage with those kinds of programs on our networks. And again, our distributor partners are enhancing their own products. And yes, we're beginning to see some ramp-up in things like dynamic ad insertion in video on demand. I mentioned new products in the mobile arena also offer advertising opportunities. So we feel that we are going to be able to climb back up as we add all those different factors in."

Live -- there's more and more delayed viewing of programming. So obviously, the live same-day kind of ratings become less and less meaningful as we go forward. And so I think in terms of the what is the currency today, the C3, there's a lot more viewing taking place in that 2 and 3 part. Then there's also more viewing taking place beyond that, and there's also viewing taking place on other platforms. This is where our Viacom Vantage product, which we have now introduced in a major way with 10 of our largest advertisers in different sectors, and we're going to add to that number, allow us different measurement metrics to complement the traditional ratings, and therefore, improve monetization. What we found across our schedule is that we have better ratings on the -- our prime dayparts. Where there is significant weakness is in other dayparts where you have a lot of repeats, off-network syndication. This is true across television. So -- and that's, in part, because there's a lot of choice on the part of viewers. This is why, strategically, we are increasing the amount of original program. And a lot of it, as I mentioned, whether it's animation, whether it's serialized low-cost programming that we run across dayparts, for example, on Nickelodeon, we are working to improve the performance of those dayparts. The original shows that we are launching, particularly when you add the other viewings taking place, measure fully up to what we were achieving on shows that aired over the last several years. So a show like Bella and The Bulldogs is performing at the same kind of level when you add the -- there's delayed viewing in all the rest, as iCarly did when it launched. So this is a process that's not overnight, day by day, but it's a continual adjustment which we're doing. The personnel realignment and improvements that we're making are bearing fruit already. There's a -- we are accelerating. Accelerating is a word we use a lot here at Viacom. So we are accelerating our efforts to speed up next seasons of shows that work, like the Teen Wolf example I gave you. We're accelerating the development and production of the kind of programming that works, whether it's scripted series, animation, events. We very recently had the second annual Kids' Choice Sports Awards, which is a new event, and it is a very successful and popular show with advertisers. The BET Experience also recently launched and continues to grow year after year. So we'll continue to look to add the kind of programming that works particularly well with the young audiences and the millennial audiences, that includes on-air talent. I am personally very excited about the potential of Trevor Noah on The Daily Show in reaching and bringing to that great show a younger average audience, which is a hard audience to reach. We are -- if you want to get reach on young audiences, if you want to get kids, if you're a toy company, Nickelodeon's the place to be. So we are being extremely proactive in taking all measures that are necessary to address the changing media landscape, and it is a changing media landscape. I think we'll come out on the other side in a much stronger place."

As those initiatives come to fruition, the value for the consumer will expand. The churn rate should improve. So there is a very positive impact on having on the distribution side forward-looking operators who will build the ecosystem, which benefits both sides, because the value of what they're offering consumers depends on the content. And we, and many of our competitors, are continually increasing the value of the content. We are producing more original programming. We are less reliant on old shows, 20-, 30-, 40-year-old shows.

Thanks for joining us to discuss the third quarter of our 2015 fiscal year. Viacom continued to execute on our strategic plan, increasing our investment in outstanding creative content, building our international scale and capabilities and applying technology-driven innovations to both expand distribution and develop first-of-their-kind advertising platforms. 
There's no question that our industry is in the midst of significant change. Change can create uncertainty and concern. But with change also comes opportunity. And Viacom is seizing every opportunity. Many of our brands speak to the younger audiences that are the leading edge of the evolution of media. This has always proven to be an advantage over the years, and it will, again, as we accelerate our investment in initiatives, platforms and content.  We continue to do the hard work to confidently move forward and lead our industry through the latest pivot. 
We have made necessary organizational changes at every level. As a result of our strategic realignment, the new larger music and entertainment and kids and family groups have made tremendous progress integrating their portfolios and accelerating investment in content. Across the company, we have never spent more money on original programming as we do today. Tut, Scream and Lip Sync Battle are all new success stories for Viacom and the result of our deep commitment to invest in our programming and our future. 
In fact, we are doubling down on quality original programming across our brands as acquired and syndicated shows are underperforming in today's environment. Our ownership and control of the vast majority of our content allow us to monetize across platforms and geographies. As a result of the continuing strength of our business and our financial discipline, we can continue to invest in all these important areas and deliver returns to shareholders. As previously announced, we will resume share repurchases in October.
Urgency and acceleration are front and center. Our senior executives understand both the challenges and the opportunities we have ahead, and they and their teams are fully engaged. We're nearing the end of our budget process for the coming year, and I can tell you that our teams and leaders, Bob Bakish, the CEO of Viacom International Media Networks; Brad Grey, the CEO of Paramount; Doug Herzog, the CEO of our Music and Entertainment Group; Debra Lee, the CEO of BET Networks; and Cyma Zarghami, the CEO of our Kids & Family group are fully committed to our success. They have the company's financial, strategic and administrative support to define the future of their businesses and brands and the authority to execute that vision.
Let's take a quick look at our financial performance in the quarter. Media Networks revenues increased slightly driven by affiliate fees. Absent the impact of foreign exchange, Media Networks revenue grew 2%. Filmed Entertainment revenues were significantly impacted by the timing of the summer slate. As you know, we schedule the wide theatrical releases of our tentpole films for the fiscal fourth quarter. This resulted in an expected decline in Filmed Entertainment revenues, which were $479 million. As a result, our overall revenues declined 11% to $3.06 billion.
Quarterly adjusted operating income was steady at $1.08 billion, and adjusted net earnings were $591 million. Adjusted earnings per share increased by 4% to $1.47, a record for the June quarter. While domestic advertising revenues in the quarter were down 9%, and we expect comparable results in the current quarter, this significantly outpaces traditional ratings due to our substantial and growing next-generation advertising capabilities. These provide marketers with some of the most sophisticated and efficient products on the market. This initiative has momentum, and we are continuing to scale as our client base quickly expands.
Take Viacom Vantage. Vantage goes far beyond traditional demographics, integrating proprietary and third-party data to give advertisers the precision to customize the audience they want to reach and clear guidance to pinpoint the programming that best delivers on that target. 3 months ago, I told you that we had piloted this platform and that we were committed to move aggressively. I'm pleased to tell you today that Vantage is working with 10 of the largest and most sophisticated advertisers in the world, representing leading brands in a variety of sectors, including automotive, retail, telecom, financial services, consumer products and many others. In fact, Vantage already is generating significant incremental advertising revenue. And that's just a start. We have been investing in data and planning for this pivot for some time and are committed to accelerating the rollout from here.
On our Media Networks distribution side. We concluded 2 successful carriage agreements in the quarter with Charter and Mediacom. Both of these deals expand our relationships, providing more programming and more ways to consumers and delivering enhanced value for our brands. In addition, we continue to work productively with digital and over-the-top distributors to create innovative new experiences on a variety of platforms. We are working with MVPDs to accelerate improvements in the consumer experience by increasing the availability and flexibility of on-demand viewing, focusing on multi-device access, co-investing in content and experiences and extending partnerships relating to data and monetization.
We are also excited by the growth opportunity provided by mobile video, and we look forward to the prominent role our content will play in Verizon's new mobile video offering.  
Before I get to the performance of some of our individual brands, I'd like to provide an update on our international operations which we view as one of Viacom's most important and underappreciated assets. 
When I became CEO, one of the first opportunity areas I identified was our markets outside the U.S. Over the last several years, we have transformed Viacom International Media Networks from a collection of disparate channels into a strategically integrated portfolio leveraging content, technology and expertise across brands and regions. And we are just at the beginning.
Viacom already has enviable positions of scale in the world's key markets. In the U.K., the fastest-growing developed economy outside the U.S., Viacom is the second-largest privately held media network group. On the other end of the spectrum, we are 1 of the 4 largest media network groups in India, the fastest-growing economy in the developing world. 
Our operations in Europe are successful and expanding, with new networks such as Channel 5, SPIKE U.K. as well as the Paramount Channel, which continues its rapid growth and has strong margins. Channel 5 has given us an additional original content engine, which has only begun to power our expansion in Europe.  We have also undergone major expansion in Latin America, Asia and Africa, building our brands in countries with enormous headroom for growth in their own media markets. Since 2012, Viacom has increased the number of channels per country in international markets by 22% and expanded our pay TV distribution by 50%. And even in the complicated Chinese market, we are establishing a position that is already profitable, albeit modestly so, thus far.
I'm also pleased to tell you that since the end of the third quarter, we closed 2 key transactions overseas. In India, Viacom acquired a 50% interest in Prism TV, which owns and operates popular regional entertainment channels. The Network18 Group, our partner in the Viacom 18 joint venture, holds the remaining 50%. Viacom 18 is the fastest-growing entertainment network in India, operating 10 channels including MTV, Nickelodeon, Comedy Central and COLORS, a leading Hindi general entertainment brand. This deal gives Viacom a significant presence in the fast-growing regional TV sector in India, where almost 60% of the population speak regional languages.
In addition, we expanded our presence in Italy through the announcement of 2 new networks on Sky Italy, TeenNick and MTV Next, a new highly interactive MTV-branded channel. Year-to-date, we have launched 16 new networks in our international markets, and there are more to come.
Now let's talk in more detail about our Media Networks. MTV's Scream, our newest scripted program for the network, has proven to be a bona fide hit, with more than 21 million viewers in its debut season. It was the #1 scripted series launch of the summer across all ad-supported cable and MTV's highest-rated series launch in a year among the core 12-34 demo. Scream continues to build. The series has consistently enjoyed viewership gains of more than 60% during the LIVE+7 period over a LIVE plus same day, and double-digit increases every week in viewing across digital platforms. We have renewed Scream for a second season.  Of course, MTV's tentpole events still supply many of the most anticipated cultural moments on television, and the VMAs coming up later this month will be no exception. Miley Cyrus is returning, this time to host, for the first time since her breakthrough 2013 performance. Not surprisingly, the advertising response has been unprecedented. We are already sold out and expect to drive a second consecutive year of record revenue from the show.
Immediately after the VMAs, MTV will launch a new Monday 2-hour programming block, including fan favorites Awkward and Faking It, followed by the all-new Todrick  and Girl Code Live. We will also launch our new MTV series, The Shannara Chronicles, in January.
Part of our commitment to accelerate delivery of original programming, Teen Wolf will return in January twice as fast as last year. We are also increasing the number of 2-hour blocks across MTV schedule and plan to air 23% more original prime time programming hours in fiscal 2016. 
Original programming is paying dividends at SPIKE as well. Lip Sync Battle has been a ratings champion since its launch in the third quarter, delivering record viewership. Over its 9-week initial run, Lip Sync Battle ranked #1 in its time slot in all of cable with adults 18-49, averaging 2.9 million viewers, and delivered nearly 200 million cross-platform digital streams. SPIKE's 3-night epic series Tut delivered an average of 2.2 million viewers, the largest average viewership for SPIKE in the time slot in 8 years. And a great majority of that audience was new to the network. A total of 27 million viewers consume Tut content across digital platforms and VOD. 
Building on that success, SPIKE is moving quickly and greenlighting its first scripted dramatic series in almost a decade, with an announcement very shortly.
Nickelodeon also continues to create more great characters and original programming that kids love and drive that engagement through television, digital, mobile and consumer products. In fact, Nickelodeon is rolling out almost 200 premiere episodes of original content in the next quarter, which will have an even greater impact as it reaches audiences on all of our growing platforms. Among 2- to 5-year-olds, Nick's preschool programming dominated in the quarter, and we plan to continue that by offering almost 100 new premiere episodes on the Nick Jr. block and channel next quarter. Nickelodeon was the highest-rated network in the preschool demo last quarter, owning all of the top 5 programs, including PAW Patrol, Blaze and the Monster Machines, Bubble Guppies, Wallykazam! and Team Umizoomi. The portfolio of preschool hits has translated into nearly 40 million full episode views on the Nick Jr. app in the quarter. Blaze in particular has been a breakout success across platforms as kids that watched episodes of the show millions of times over the quarter on the app, and we delivered even more viewership of the show on TV VOD.
Blaze consumer products are now coming to the marketplace, reinforced by the continued outstanding performance of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Among kids 6 to 11, the daily series Make It Pop is Nick's #1 show, like Every Witch Way and Talia in the Kitchen, it is another validation of the network's success with different formats and daily scripted series. Make It Pop will debut on Nickelodeon's international channels beginning this summer.
Comedy Central continues to be the #1 full-day entertainment network among young men 18-34 with 6 of the top 20 cable series in that demo. And it's even more successful beyond traditional measurement, with total consumption across platforms beyond LIVE+3 up 52%. Comedy Central is, hands down, the premier destination for comedic talent offering a supportive platform with outstanding resources, deep audience connections and a creative-first philosophy. It has successfully partnered with comedians like Amy Schumer, Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peele and Abbi Jacobson and Ilana Glazer from Broad City to create programming that creates broad cultural impact and attracts loyal, engaged fans who propel them into the zeitgeist. The creative excellence of the Comedy Central brand is exemplified by its recent haul of 26 Emmy nominations. Comedy Central's commitment to creativity creates unique opportunities. Perhaps, this is best exemplified by South Park in our latest announcement with Trey Parker and Matt Stone, extending our enduring relationship with Stan, Kyle, Eric, Kenny, and sometimes, Butters through 2019. South Park helped define Comedy Central's boundary-breaking mission and continues to be the #1 comedy series among young men nearly 2 decades later. We are thrilled to be working with them as Trey and Matt take South Park past its 300th episode.
The South Park team also has partnered with Comedy Central on cross-platform digital initiatives. In fact, South Park has extended its relationship on Hulu, providing broad distribution, deeper engagement with fans and outstanding value for Viacom.
We've been so proud of our work with Jon Stewart throughout his 16-year Daily Show run, which, as you know, ends tonight. Beyond his enormous contributions to advancing Comedy Central and Viacom, John has been an important voice in the national conversation. His legacy will live on within the well-oiled machine of The Daily Show, which will be welcoming Trevor Noah as the new host in September. We cannot be more pleased about the next chapter for the show. There is a tremendous opportunity to build on that franchise with late-night television's first millennial host, and we intend to make the most of it.
Comedy Central has an extremely robust pipeline and an unparalleled ability to program its content across multiple platforms. The network is launching 7 new series in 2016, including 3 animated series, which have strong appeal and a longer life across linear consumer products and digital extensions.
Moving to Paramount Pictures. We are pleased with the performance of Mission: Impossible Rogue Nation, which earned $120 million at the global box office in its first weekend. Terminator Genisys, also released this quarter, had a strong showing of more than $315 million at the worldwide box office to date. We are looking forward to adding to that total. Both of these films open in China the next few weeks, the first foreign titles to play in that market since mid-June.
With the success of our first Paramount Animation feature, our unparalleled marketing capability and increased production across genres, the studio is stepping up its output and will be back up to its annual target of 15 films in 2016. We're excited about the new films in the pipeline, including projects from Mark Wahlberg and Will Ferrell, who are starring in Daddy's Home, this Christmas; Michael Bay's 13 Hours coming early next year; followed by the epic retelling of Ben-Hur, and Ben Stiller's Zoolander 2 in February. Our newly launched Paramount Television operation has already built a formidable slate of shows, with the first completed coproduction Minority Report premiering on FOX in September.
To date, Paramount Television has 9 shows ordered to production and an additional 12 projects set up at networks and major digital outlets. Paramount Television's revenue is all incremental to our historical theatrical pipeline, and the television sales cycle has the benefit of smoothing out the variability of our Filmed Entertainment segment.
After a tough year, we believe Paramount is positioned to grow strongly next year and in the years to come, fueled both by a reinvigorated film business and our new high-growth TV production business. We continue to innovate in other areas. We recently announced a breakthrough partnership with AMC and Cineplex to close the gap between the theatrical and home entertainment windows for films that typically have shorter theatrical runs. It's a forward-looking solution that works for us, the theater owners, and for the consumer. We're optimistic about the strategy, and we'll see the benefit of this approach in future quarters.
EPIX, our successful joint venture with Lionsgate and MGM, continues to develop its own slate of original programming. The network is beginning production this fall on 2 new series, Berlin Station, a spy drama from Paramount Television; and Graves, a single-camera comedy starring Nick Nolte and Susan Sarandon, from Lionsgate.
I will conclude where I began. We are at the cutting edge of navigating the transition of our industry into the future, and we have positioned ourselves very well to do so. Our quality video content continues to perform well with young, highly coveted audiences. In the last quarter, Viacom was the #1 family of cable networks, as measured by Nielsen, in the key 2-49, 12-34, 18-34 and 18-49 demos. And industry-wide consumption on nonlinear platforms continues to expand, particularly with young viewers, growing nearly 30% since 2011. This gives Viacom's uniquely multi-platform brands and top-tier original content an even greater long-term advantage. That is why we continue to build our leadership position in multiplatform video consumption and aggressively pursue better monetization of consumers' deep engagement with our content through direct action and working with our affiliate advertising and digital partners.
Our organization is streamlined and improved. We have invested in more and more original content as well as cutting-edge data, marketing and measurement capabilities. We are successfully building an exceptional and high-growth international media platform, and we are investing in other growth initiatives, ranging from television production to film animation, to mobile, to consumer products.
As we begin to look forward to next fiscal year, we expect to deliver continued strong growth in affiliate revenues, a return to growth in our advertising revenues, a stronger slate and financial performance at Paramount and the resumption of our buyback program to complement our strong dividend yield.
And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Wade."

Before I take you through our operating results, I want to note that our earnings release and web presentations summarizing the results for our June quarter are available on our website.Now let's take a look at our segment results. At",541,"Thanks, Philippe. Before I take you through our operating results, I want to note that our earnings release and web presentations summarizing the results for our June quarter are available on our website.
Now let's take a look at our segment results. At our Media Networks segment, revenues in the quarter were up slightly compared with the prior year. Domestic revenues were down 3% while international revenues grew 22%. Excluding a 10% unfavorable impact from foreign currency, international revenues were up 32%. Channel 5 contributed 33 percentage points to international revenue growth in the quarter. Page 10 of our web deck provides a breakdown of our Media Networks revenue performance.
In terms of advertising, worldwide revenues were down 2% in the quarter, domestic revenues were down 9%, and international revenues increased 58%. The increase in international advertising revenues was driven principally by Channel 5. Foreign exchange losses had an 11 percentage point impact on international advertising growth.
In terms of affiliate revenues, worldwide revenues were up 2%. Domestic revenues were up 2% in the quarter, while international revenues declined 3%. Excluding the impacts from the timing of product available under certain distribution agreements, domestic affiliate revenues grew mid-single digits in the quarter. Foreign exchange had an 11 percentage point unfavorable impact on international affiliate revenue growth. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, international affiliate revenues grew as a result of new channel launches, new distribution agreements as well as the timing of product available under certain distribution agreements.
Expenses increased 1% in the quarter. Within operating expenses, programming expense grew 3%, while distribution and other expenses increased 10%. SG&A expense was down 6% in the quarter. Increases in expenses were principally driven by the acquisition of Channel 5. Excluding the impact of Channel 5, total expenses were down 7% in the quarter, principally due to the savings from our recent strategic realignment.
While Media Networks' adjusted operating income was down 1%, the adjusted operating income margin declined 40 basis points to 42.9%. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, adjusted operating income was flat.
Moving to Filmed Entertainment. Revenues were down 44% in the quarter, principally due to decreases in theatrical and home entertainment revenues. Page 13 of the web presentation provides a breakdown of Filmed Entertainment revenues.
Theatrical revenues decreased 92% due to the timing of our summer tentpoles. Transformers: Age of Extinction was released in the June quarter of last year, while Terminator Genisys and Mission: Impossible Rogue Nation were widely released in the September quarter of this year.
Home Entertainment revenues declined 30%, principally due to lower revenues from third-party distribution and catalog titles. Ancillary revenues declined by 43%, due primarily to a comparison in the prior year related to the sale of certain distribution rights.
Filmed Entertainment generated adjusted operating income of $48 million in the quarter as compared to $55 million last year.
Moving to taxes. The year-to-date effective tax rate was 31.8%, reflecting a 30 basis point improvement as compared to the prior year.
In terms of noncontrolling interest, the increase of $11 million in the quarter principally represents the minority interest share of income associated with the renewal of the content distribution agreement.
And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Tom."
25403751,303758918,851331,"Viacom, Inc., Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Aug 06, 2015",2015-08-06,"Earnings Calls","Viacom Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Wade. I'm going to talk about our cash flow, our debt and return of capital to our shareholders. I'll also cover seasonal factors impacting the fourth quarter of our 2015 fiscal year. For the quarter, we generated $380 million in operating free",709,"Thanks, Wade. I'm going to talk about our cash flow, our debt and return of capital to our shareholders. I'll also cover seasonal factors impacting the fourth quarter of our 2015 fiscal year. 
For the quarter, we generated $380 million in operating free cash flow compared to $571 million last year. Page 5 of the web deck presentation provides the components of free cash flow. The decline in operating free cash flow in the quarter was principally due to higher working capital utilization and higher cash interest. Working capital was impacted by increased TV programming spend, as well as production spend for the films including Mission: Impossible Rogue Nation and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2.
Now moving on to our debt. It remains principally fixed rate with an average cost at quarter-end of 4.7%. At quarter-end, we had no variable rate borrowings outstanding. In terms of our leverage, we ended the quarter with $13.1 billion of total debt and $421 million of cash and cash equivalents. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 3.1x. At June 30, our $2.5 billion bank revolver was undrawn.
In terms of capital return to shareholders, we increased our quarterly dividend by 21% to $0.40 for our July payment. If you include this dividend payment, we have returned a total of $2.1 billion  to shareholders in the fiscal year, which is a return on market capitalization of approximately 10%.
Now let's turn to some of the factors impacting our fourth quarter and full year. In terms of our affiliate revenue, quarterly revenue will fluctuate given the timing of transactions and the recognition of revenue related to certain distribution agreements that are tied to product availability. Accordingly, for the September quarter, we anticipate that worldwide affiliate revenues will grow low-double digits. For the full year, we expect that the organic growth rate for Media Networks' programming expense will be in the low- to mid-single digits. However, factoring in the acquisition of Channel 5, reported programming expense will grow in the low- to mid-teens. For 2015, we are forecasting a book tax rate of 31.8%.
Moving on to Filmed Entertainment. Given this year's mix of theatrical releases as compared to last year, on a full year basis, the studio will face difficult bottom line comparison. As we look into fiscal 2016, in October, the studio will release the final installment of our Paranormal franchise. Other December quarter releases include Ring, the third installment of the Ring franchise, as well as Daddy's Home.
Looking ahead at the studio's production and development pipeline, Paramount has wrapped production on Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2; Zoolander 2, which stars Ben Stiller, Owen Wilson and Will Ferrell; and The Big Short, which is based on the best-selling book by Michael Lewis and stars Brad Pitt, Steve Carrell, Christian Bale and Ryan Gosling as well as the CGI-animated Monster Trucks, which is directed by Chris Wedge. And they are currently in production on Star Trek 3 as well as Story of Your Life, which stars Amy Adams and Jeremy Renner. Paramount is in development on a number of sequels to existing franchises, including World War Z, Jack Reacher, Transformers, The SpongeBob Movie, and as announced this week, the sixth installment of Mission: Impossible.
In summary, while the industry continues to evolve, we are taking significant steps to realign our businesses to address these challenges. We have rethought our organization structure, reducing costs in certain areas while investing in our brands, technology and new capabilities. These investments have enabled us to monetize our content outside of traditional measurements through the development of specialized ad sales products. These offerings provide incremental value to our advertising partners by using targeting to drive efficiency in their marketing campaign. We have also invested in our international media networks over the past several years. We continue to launch new channels and brands, building scale in key markets. And we have entered into long-term distribution and ad sales agreement with key partners, positioning our international networks for growth. We remain committed to returning excess capital to our shareholders through our dividend and buyback programs while at the same time, maintaining our investment-grade status.

Well, as I mentioned in my remarks, we successfully concluded the 2 agreements that were up in the last quarter, Mediacom and Charter. We look forward to renewing other affiliation agreements going forward. As I mentioned also, our networks are the -- constitute the leading family of cable networks out there and particularly in the key demos that are driving adoption of new services, whether it's broadband, utilization of other devices and so forth. We are working very closely with our partners, even before renewals, on how they can better engage those consumers so as to drive success of the ecosystem. We think there's a lot of work to be done. It is happening. I'm happy to see better consumer interfaces and better availability of video product for consumers, and that will help both the distributors and the programmers. So I have a lot of confidence in continuing to execute on that. And as far as our affiliate revenue growth, we will continue to deliver, in this year and the years to come, the high single-digit affiliate revenue growth. We have many long-term agreements in place. The organic rate increases under these long-term agreements average out in the high mid-single-digit rates. When you add to that the 2, 3 points, depending on the year of growth in new distribution opportunities, whether it's SVOD, new over-the-top services, new players, opportunities presented by renewals, you get to that high-single-digit and we've managed our portfolio of renewal such that we have a pretty long view of most of our agreements, with a few coming up. So I have a lot of confidence in the continued growth of our affiliate revenue. On -- and that's domestically speaking. 
On the international front, as we roll out new networks, as we execute deals with -- such as the recent one that we did with Sky Italia, the extension of our Sky U.K., launching new networks, as you look in the long run, I also see affiliate revenue growth to be a steady driver for many years to come and our international marketplace. And again, new technologies there in the international marketplace are a real upside opportunity for us. I've touched on China. Part of the reason we're modestly profitable already in China where, as you know, it's hard to launch actual television networks, is there is a growing number of indigenous SVOD players in that marketplace. So we're able to introduce our content there. We're working on other revenue opportunities, consumer products, other areas that are open to us in that marketplace. Obviously, the film market is really growing well for us in China. We look forward to growing that. But that's just one example of a number of opportunities available to us in growing these new forms of revenue. 
And mobile, I touched on mobile. It's a very exciting opportunity. Mobile video distribution, affiliate and as well as advertising will begin to be a significant and rapidly growing opportunity in -- as we head into the next fiscal year. So we are extremely well-positioned, owning our content, having the content that appeals to young audiences and having content that we can roll out around the world."

The good news is we're able to run this business on a very low structural overhead, and we're also able to essentially largely cover cost of production based on the deals that are available in today's marketplace, particularly when you fold in international distribution opportunities with respect to that content. We also view the television operation as strategic for our media networks. There is a lot of interaction between the Paramount television group and our cable network groups. And as we go more and more into scripted series across virtually all of our networks, the Paramount Television Group is an in-house source of high-level creative talent, and that is something that you will see unfold as we go forward with already several series picked up by our networks. And EPIX, our pay service joint venture, is going to have a high-quality television series for the first time next fall, which will continue to drive value for EPIX in the future."

The asset value at this price level is -- the asset value of the underlying assets far outpaces what's reflected in the marketplace. Even before you get to our operating businesses, if you just look at what's below the line, Michael. If you take the value of our joint venture interest in EPIX, in our very successful Viacom 18 joint venture in India, even the hidden asset, we own spectrum from low-power stations that were once used and connect with one of our networks that are not used, when you add all that up -- just that, and I haven't even touched on our operating businesses, you have several dollars per share of value.

And it will -- it is -- given the direction in which the major mobile companies are going, this is a particularly significant opportunity for us. So we have in the past gone through these market dislocations. And we, obviously, as you know, we believe in our stock. We are resuming our buyback program in October. As Tom said, we are going to conduct it in a responsible way over time, keeping in mind that we want to maintain our investment-grade rating.

And then can you just walk us through to the path to get from what is down high-single digits to returning to ad growth? What happens -- what needs to happen with ratings or measurements? How much is the contribution from the digital and targeting efforts that you're undertaking?"

Yes, as far as -- look, we obviously are still only in the early part of the second month of the quarter, but we -- and so we are not assuming immediate ratings improvement and giving our prognostications. We're giving you our best guess",290,"Thank you, Doug. Yes, as far as -- look, we obviously are still only in the early part of the second month of the quarter, but we -- and so we are not assuming immediate ratings improvement and giving our prognostications. We're giving you our best guess and trying to be realistic about the quarter. The reason that we have a view that we are going to resume growth in advertising revenue in the full fiscal year next year is that obviously we had a tough year this year. We have begun to expand the scale of our targeted advertising initiatives, the Viacom Vantage, Viacom Velocity. We've added a lot of human resources to those efforts. It was an important part of our upfront discussions with major advertisers. And by the way, given the overall difficult nature of the upfront marketplace, which the overall television market was down in volume, we did well and came very, very close to the level of volume that we had last year, notwithstanding what took place in the ratings. We have a larger volume of signature original shows. We have more events that we are -- event shows we're building. We have more scripted series. These are higher value. And we are increasing accordingly our ad revenues from significant advertisers who want to engage with those kinds of programs on our networks. And again, our distributor partners are enhancing their own products. And yes, we're beginning to see some ramp-up in things like dynamic ad insertion in video on demand. I mentioned new products in the mobile arena also offer advertising opportunities. So we feel that we are going to be able to climb back up as we add all those different factors in."

Live -- there's more and more delayed viewing of programming. So obviously, the live same-day kind of ratings become less and less meaningful as we go forward. And so I think in terms of the what is the currency today, the C3, there's a lot more viewing taking place in that 2 and 3 part. Then there's also more viewing taking place beyond that, and there's also viewing taking place on other platforms. This is where our Viacom Vantage product, which we have now introduced in a major way with 10 of our largest advertisers in different sectors, and we're going to add to that number, allow us different measurement metrics to complement the traditional ratings, and therefore, improve monetization. What we found across our schedule is that we have better ratings on the -- our prime dayparts. Where there is significant weakness is in other dayparts where you have a lot of repeats, off-network syndication. This is true across television. So -- and that's, in part, because there's a lot of choice on the part of viewers. This is why, strategically, we are increasing the amount of original program. And a lot of it, as I mentioned, whether it's animation, whether it's serialized low-cost programming that we run across dayparts, for example, on Nickelodeon, we are working to improve the performance of those dayparts. The original shows that we are launching, particularly when you add the other viewings taking place, measure fully up to what we were achieving on shows that aired over the last several years. So a show like Bella and The Bulldogs is performing at the same kind of level when you add the -- there's delayed viewing and all the rest, as iCarly did when it launched. So this is a process that's not overnight, day by day, but it's a continual adjustment which we're doing. The personnel realignment and improvements that we're making are bearing fruit already. There's a -- we are accelerating. Accelerating is a word we use a lot here at Viacom. So we are accelerating our efforts to speed up next seasons of shows that work, like the Teen Wolf example I gave you. We're accelerating the development and production of the kind of programming that works, whether it's scripted series, animation, events. We very recently had the second annual Kids' Choice Sports Awards, which is a new event, and it is a very successful and popular show with advertisers. The BET Experience also recently launched and continues to grow year after year. So we'll continue to look to add the kind of programming that works particularly well with the young audiences and the millennial audiences, that includes on-air talent. I am personally very excited about the potential of Trevor Noah on The Daily Show in reaching and bringing to that great show a younger average audience, which is a hard audience to reach. We are -- if you want to get reach on young audiences, if you want to get kids, if you're a toy company, Nickelodeon's the place to be. So we are being extremely proactive in taking all measures that are necessary to address the changing media landscape, and it is a changing media landscape. I think we'll come out on the other side in a much stronger place."

So yes, we had a lot of scarcity in it. So we -- some of these players came back in into the upfront marketplace. So we believe we have made adjustments. That's an answer to an earlier question. That's why we have optimism that the situation on ad revenues will improve as we get into next year, in part, is the fruit of our labors in addressing the issues that we saw."

Yes, Charter is an example of a company that is being proactive in providing more video on demand, more availability of networks on multiple devices inside the home, outside the home. As those initiatives come to fruition, the value for the consumer will expand. The churn rate should improve. So there is a very positive impact on having on the distribution side forward-looking operators who will build the ecosystem, which benefits both sides, because the value of what they are offering consumers depends on the content. And we, and many of our competitors, are continually increasing the value of the content. We are producing more original programming. We are less reliant on old shows, 20-, 30-, 40-year-old shows. We are providing fresh content that's going to be usable in more ways. And so we view all distributors as our partners. And as we do renewals, we discuss all these new services.

Thank you for joining us to discuss Viacom's results for 2015 fourth quarter and full fiscal year. We are seeing real progress as the ecosystem adapts and coalesces around innovative new models both in distribution and advertising in the U.S. and around the world. We believe these changes will usher in a new period of prosperity and growth but also know that success will require a focus on the long-term health and vitality of our business. More than ever, this is a great time to be in the content business. And those with a more long-term view that is currently in vogue will be richly rewarded. Viacom continues to take a leadership role in capturing the opportunities that are rapidly taking shape. We are effectively adapting to a digital, on-demand, socially-driven global marketplace, even as we demonstrate quantifiable success in achieving our strategic goals. Importantly, we are also accelerating the critical initiatives that are driving improvement throughout the company.
First, I'll recap our financial performance in the quarter and the year and share some operational and strategic highlights. Tom and Wade will go into greater detail on the results in a minute.
In the fourth quarter, revenues declined 5% to $3.79 billion. Adjusted operating income was $1.06 billion, and adjusted net earnings from continuing operations was $614 million. Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations declined 10% to $1.54 per diluted share. For the year, revenues were $13.27 billion, a decline of 4%. Adjusted operating income totaled $3.92 billion, and adjusted net earnings from continuing operations were $2.21 billion. Full year adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 1% to $5.44, which was an all-time record for the company. Viacom continued to generate substantial free cash and returned $2.1 billion to shareholders in fiscal 2015 through share repurchases and dividends. As planned, we resumed share repurchases last month at a relatively modest pace thus far as we focus on growth initiatives while maintaining a strong financial position.
Looking back at the quarter and the full year, Viacom continue to execute on our top strategic priorities: investing in content, especially original content for all technologies; building international scale, capabilities and profitability; and expanding the use of data and technology in advertising, distribution and the viewer experience to derive additional value from our brands.
As I said earlier, our industry has been moving to a period that has challenged established patterns of media consumption and measurement of that consumption. Because of our young audiences and highly focused brands, Viacom experienced the changes early in the cycle and across more of our properties than other media companies. That transition has now taken hold across the industry, creating disruption, but also spurring action and real momentum towards solutions. As the early birds, we see that as platforms expand and opportunities increase, fully measured consumption becomes even stronger. In fact, recent research revealed that young people are spending more time consuming media each day than they do sleeping. So apparently, media executives aren't the only ones losing sleep in this modern world. I'm pleased to say that at Viacom we are starting to turn the corner. Once again, in the quarter, the Viacom family of networks was #1 according to Nielsen for people 2-plus, people 18 to 34, people 18 to 49 and people 2 to 49. That's a lot of people. Ratings are improving at key networks like Nickelodeon, Nick at Nite, TV Land, BET, CMT and VH1, with additional improvement expected at our other networks as new programming kicks in. Our investment in data is producing meaningful incremental revenue, and the benefits of digital distribution continue to develop and grow. As other companies now begin their pivot through the transition, many of our Media Networks brands are already beginning to emerge, well positioned to grow and succeed.
Turning to the Media Networks results. Revenues increased 5% to $2.79 billion in the quarter. Affiliate revenues remain strong, up 15% domestically and 10% worldwide in the quarter. For the year, domestic affiliate revenues increased 8% and worldwide revenues were up 5%. We expect continued high single-digit growth in domestic affiliate revenue in fiscal 2016. With the renewal of our AT&T agreement at the end of the quarter, we concluded a year in which we successfully renewed affiliate deals covering close to 20% of our distribution. In addition, we closed an unprecedented Hulu deal in September that provides outstanding value for our programming while supporting the vitality of the overall distribution ecosystem.
On the advertising sales front, we delivered sequential improvement in quarterly domestic advertising revenue growth with a decline of 7% improved from a 9% decline in Q3. While it is still early in the quarter, we expect continuing improvement in domestic ad sales this quarter, which we expect to accelerate further as our fiscal year progresses. Worldwide, the decline in the fourth quarter was 1%. For the year, worldwide advertising revenues increased 1%. Once again, advertising revenue substantially outpaced traditional ratings as we continue to provide significant value-added offerings to marketing partners. And we continue to deepen our value proposition to partners, offering deep social connections to our Viacom Echo platform. A key component of Viacom's next-generation advertising portfolio is Vantage, our bet on sophisticated data that leverages our leadership in analytics and data aggregation for the benefit of marketing partners. It is a proven success and a platform that is in great demand among the largest and most sophisticated advertisers. Currently, we have 11 advertisers using Vantage, leading national advertisers across sectors that include automotive, beverages, consumer goods, financial services and quick-service restaurants. We are in discussions with dozens of additional Fortune 500 partners. Demand is strong and building. We anticipate that we will triple the total number of Vantage deals by next year's upfront, represent a significant portion of our advertising revenue base. Many of our peers are beginning their own data programs. The market is moving rapidly in this direction, led by sophisticated national advertisers. This is good for the ecosystem and will create more demand. We are confident that Viacom will remain in the forefront as we continue to evolve and improve our proprietary product.
Our brands remain powerful. Our creative and technical talent is unmatched and our exclusive relationships cannot be replicated, like the TiVo partnership we announced just last week. In addition, we have the last few weeks taken a significant ownership stake in digitour, the leading live events provider for social media talent, with many partnership opportunities across our brands. We are deeply committed to keeping our leadership in this area and firmly believe that as others catch up, we will already be executing on the next generation of these high-margin, highly sophisticated programs for our marketing partners.
Of course, all of this continued improvement depends on great content. And our Media Networks are delivering more new original programming than ever before for every platform. Nickelodeon is a prime example of the success of this commitment. The network delivered a strong fourth quarter by launching innovative new shows and increasing the volume of high-quality premieres. Throughout the quarter, Nickelodeon had more than 100 new episodes of preschool and kids content with positive results. PAW Patrol and Blaze and the Monster Machines are preschool hits, with live plus 3 [ph] ratings for premieres exceeding a 10. Saturday nights now host 2 new hits, Henry Danger, which was the #1 live action show for kids 2 to 11 in the fourth quarter; and Game Shakers, which has become the #1 live action show in recent weeks. Game Shakers also plays cross-platform, with its Sky Whale game already generating 3 million downloads since it September launch. August marks Nick's highest rated month of the year with kids 2 to 11 and 6 to 11. By September, Nick had taken a strong lead over its nearest competitors and has continued that trend into the current quarter, where Nickelodeon will premiere 140 new episodes and event programs in the Heart 8. In digital, the Nick app, Nick Jr. app and Noggin are all expanding their reach. The Nick app has surpassed $20 million installs across iOS, Android, Xbox and Roku, and the Nick Jr. app has surpassed 2 million installs, with kids spending over 100 minutes per week within the app. Noggin continues to perform well and will be available on Android and internationally for the first time beginning next week.
VH1 is another success story. With new leadership in place, the network increased totaled A rating 6% over the fourth quarter of 2014, driven by strong Monday lineup. For the quarter, VH1 was the #1 cable network on Monday nights among women 18 to 49 and #3 among all adults 18 to 49, fueled by the Love & Hip Hop franchise. The season 4 finale day of VH1's Love & Hip Hop: Atlanta was the #1 telecast in all television for the day among women 18 to 49 and women 18 to 34. The episode was also the #1 cable telecast among adults 18 to 49, delivering a 2.3 rating in that demo and over 3.3 million total viewers. When combined with the evening's 2 encore airings, more than 5.3 million total viewers tuned in for the season 4 finale. In the current quarter, VH1 is continuing to roll with October prime time ratings up 33%. VH1 owns Monday nights as the #1 non-sports cable network for women 18 to 49. BET delivered sequential improvement in ratings growth in the fourth quarter with a top 2 sitcoms in all basic cable for the key 18 to 49 demo, the Game and Real Husbands of Hollywood. And the network delivered on their all-new reboot of the classic MTV series PUNK'D, making it the third-highest-rated BET series in the quarter. In the first quarter of fiscal 2016, BET is driving even more ratings growth, quickly bringing more quality and more volume to the schedule. The Being Mary Jane season 3 premiere was Tuesday night's top scripted program on cable this season among adults 18 to 49, and the WestbrooWest Brooks is already becoming a new reality hit. We are also looking forward to CENTRIC Soul Train Awards at the end of this month, which is a proven viewership tentpole. And much like the wildly successful BET experience, the soul train awards continues to build a scale of its weekend-long live event, reinforcing connection with fans and creating unprecedented marketing opportunities for our advertising partners.
At MTV, we've also installed new leadership. Sean Atkins joined us in October. He's an accomplished, versatile media executive who brings excellent management skills and creative experience across developing -- across development, production and digital products. He has hit the ground running, and we expect to see significant improvement at MTV in fiscal 2016. Despite traditional ratings challenges, the MTV brand maintains its prowess and vitality, engaging its young audience in more and deeper ways than ever. The recent Video Music Awards is a great example. The show attracted 10 million viewers on-air and more than 76 million video views across platforms in the first 3 days, including 12 million views on Snapchat. This show generated over 0.5 billion social impressions and also set a new record for tweets during the entertainment program. To kick off our second fiscal quarter, MTV is returning some of its biggest hits and bringing hotly anticipated new series to air, including new seasons of Teen Mom OG and Teen Wolf as well as the epic fantasy drama, The Shannara Chronicles. Comedy Central also had a quarter success that illustrates its continued vibrancy as the home of fresh comedic talent and ever more engaging programming. The network had its most successful Emmy season ever with 26 nominations and 8 wins, the third most wins of any network. We couldn't be prouder of their achievements and the validation of the network's position as the center of the comedy zeitgeist. Comedy Central remains the destination for the most intriguing comic minds and is consistently pushing the envelope to create programming that drives culture and explodes on digital platforms among its dedicated fans. While traditional rating softened in the quarter, the rate network's homegrown hits like Inside Amy Schumer, Broad City, South Park, Drunk History and Tosh.0 continue to drive substantial gains on well-monetized digital platforms like Hulu and the Comedy Central app. Comedy will see improvement in traditional ratings with upcoming new programs and schedule changes and will be a big beneficiary as more complete and accurate measurement takes hold.
The network also successfully relaunched The Daily Show in September with new host Trevor Noah. Trevor has exceeded our expectations and has already built an audience that is younger, more digital and more diverse. Over the first 4 weeks, Trevor grew linear viewing among adults 18 to 24 by 20% and men 18 to 24 by 32%. And the program remains the #1 late-night show in all television with those audiences. In addition, The Daily Show is now averaging 750,000 digital full-episode views per show over and above the traditional measurement totals. Looking to the second fiscal quarter, the Comedy Central pipeline is full with 10 original series on the schedule, including Idiot Sitter, a scripted series starting Charlotte Newhouse and Julian Bell, a fan favorite from Workaholics, as well as a new multiplatform series, Not Safe with Nikki Glaser. We are seeing additional improvement across our portfolio. The recently completed SPIKE series, Ink Master, posted the highest C3 ratings in its history, up 14% from the prior season. And I Love Kellie Pickler got off to a terrific start on CMT last week, posting triple-digit ratings gains for the channel in its time slot.
As we have discussed in the past, we are hyper-focused on building upon our industry-leading footprint outside of the U.S. No other media company can match the breadth of Viacom's international network brands or our broad geographic reach. We intend to push our advantage. In that regard, fiscal 2015 was a landmark year, with the full integration of Channel 5 into our operations and the launch of 21 channels around the world, including 7 in the fourth quarter. Also in the quarter, Viacom International Media Networks launched Viacom Play Plex, a global sweep of branded mobile apps designed to complement our linear TV channels and allow our distribution partners to deepen and improve the entertainment experience they offer their subscribers, consistent with the TV Everywhere products we offer in the U.S. These apps will be available in all 180 markets we operate in. We believe no other international entertainment company is offering this type of innovation at this scale, serving every niche or demographic in every major TV market. And last month, Viacom International Media Networks held the EMAs, our largest international music tentpole of the year. TV viewership remained strong for the show around the globe, and digital video views exploded by 340% over the last year. We also had an impressive 300 million social mentions and #MTVEMA was the #1 worldwide trending Twitter topic on the night of the show.
At the studio, Paramount delivered one of the top 5 movies of the summer in Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation. Once again, Tom Cruise performed at a superstar level at the box office in the U.S., and particularly overseas, where we drew more than 70% of the sales revenue. Paramount's ability to produce and market films is stronger than ever, but we simply did not have enough films in the pipeline this year to take full advantage of our capabilities. In fiscal 2016, we have committed to returning Paramount to a full 15-film slate. In addition, Paramount Animation has a number of exciting projects on tap, including The Little Prince, which the studio will release next March. Paramount Animation team is also currently in production with Monster Trucks, Sherlock Gnomes, SpongeBob SquarePants 3 and Amusement Park. With 3 new shows set for early next, including School of Rock in Nickelodeon, GREASE LIVE on Fox and Vinyl on HBO, Paramount Television continues to expand and demonstrate its creative approach to developing and producing television entertainment. The division is also growing its original programming slate and a distinguished roster of creative partners, most recently announcing a straight-to-series order with Netflix for 13 Reasons Why, the executive produced by Selena Gomez, and an overall television deal with Emmy Award-winning director, Carrie Fukunaga. To date, Paramount Television has 10 shows ordered to production and an additional 12 projects set up at networks and major digital outlets.
In closing, we are optimistic about the state of our industry and the significant opportunities Viacom has to benefit from changes in technology, consumption and the growing international marketplace. As we move through 2016, we are committed to tripling our roster of Vantage clients leading into the 2016 upfront, rolling out more original programming across the company at an unprecedented level in our history, improving the scale and profitability in our international Media Networks Group, driving Paramount to significantly improve financial performance in the years ahead by returning the theatrical slate to 15 films per year, together with the continuing buildup of our television production and animation activities. 2016 will be a significant year as measurement and monetization come into realignment around sophisticated, data-enhanced programs that we are pioneering. The application of data insights will lead to more and more differentiation in technology-driven advertising. Consumption will continue to expand across all platforms, and international markets will present new and exciting opportunities. Of course, the turn is not fully complete. We are all learning more and more every day, but we are confident that the pace of change we have set gives us an important long-term advantage over our competition.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Wade."

Before I take you through our operating results, I want to note that our earnings release and web presentation summarizing the results for our September quarter are available on our website.Now let's take a look at our segment results.",542,"Thanks, Philippe. Before I take you through our operating results, I want to note that our earnings release and web presentation summarizing the results for our September quarter are available on our website.
Now let's take a look at our segment results. At our Media Networks segment, revenues in the quarter were up 5% compared with the prior year. Domestic revenues were up 3% while international revenues increased 11%. Excluding a 10% unfavorable impact from foreign currency, international revenues were up 21%, primarily due to the acquisition of Channel 5.  Page 10 of our web deck provides a breakdown of our Media Networks revenue performance.
In terms of advertising, worldwide advertising revenues declined 1% in the quarter. Domestic revenues were down 7%, and the international revenues grew 45%. The increase in international advertising revenues was driven by growth in Europe, principally from Channel 5. Foreign exchange losses had a 9 percentage point negative impact on international advertising growth.
In terms of affiliate revenues, worldwide revenues were up 10%. Domestic revenues were up 15% in the quarter while international revenues declined 14%. The growth in domestic affiliate revenues was due to the timing of product available under certain distribution agreement as well as rate increases. Foreign exchange had a 12 percentage point unfavorable impact on international affiliate revenue growth. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, international affiliate revenue declined as revenue growth from new channel launches and increases in subscribers were more than offset by the timing of product available under certain distribution agreements.
Turning to expenses. Overall expenses increased 12% in the quarter. Within operating expenses, programming expense grew 19% while distribution and other expenses increased 11%. SG&A expense increased 3% in the quarter. Expense growth was driven by the acquisition of Channel 5 as well as higher programming, advertising and promotion expense primarily related to new original series and specials. Media Networks adjusted operating income was down 6% for the quarter, and the adjusted operating income margin was 37%. 
Moving to Filmed Entertainment. Revenues were down 24% in the quarter, principally due to decreases in home entertainment and theatrical revenues. Foreign exchange had a 5 percentage point unfavorable impact on Filmed Entertainment revenue growth. Page 13 of the web presentation provides a breakdown of Filmed Entertainment revenues.
Theatrical revenues declined 20%. Foreign currency had a 9 percentage point unfavorable impact on theatrical revenues. Lower carryover revenues from prior period releases were partially offset by revenues from our current-quarter releases, including Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation and Terminator: Genisys. Home entertainment revenues declined 54%, principally due to the absence of releases in the September quarter of this year. Whereas last year, we released Transformers and Noah. Ancillary revenues declined by 38%, due primarily to lower consumer product licensing revenues, with last year's September quarter benefiting from the release of Transformers. Filmed Entertainment generated adjusted operating income of $122 million in the quarter as compared to $213 million last year. The September quarter of last year benefited from both the theatrical and home entertainment performance of Transformers.
Moving to taxes. The full year adjusted effective tax rate was 31.2%, reflecting a 20 basis point improvement as compared to the prior year.
With that, I would like to turn the call over to Tom."

Let me cover our full year results as well as take -- talk about our cash flow and our debt. I'll also cover seasonal factors impacting the 2016 [ph] fiscal year that haven't already been discussed. For the full year, Viacom generated $13",828,"Thank you, Wade. Let me cover our full year results as well as take -- talk about our cash flow and our debt. I'll also cover seasonal factors impacting the 2016 [ph] fiscal year that haven't already been discussed. For the full year, Viacom generated $13.3 billion of revenue, $3.9 billion of adjusted operating income, $2.2 billion of operating free cash flow and $5.44 of adjusted earnings per share. That breaks down as follows: Media Networks generated revenue of $10.5 billion, which is an increase of 3% over the prior year. Adjusted operating income of $4.1 billion declined 3% as compared to 2014. Affiliate revenue grew 5% for the year while advertising revenue increased 1%. And the Media Networks adjusted operating income margin was 39.5%. Filmed Entertainment generated revenue of $2.9 billion and adjusted operating income margin of $111 million -- I'm sorry. Adjusted operating income of $111 million and an operating income margin of 4%. For the total company, foreign currency had an unfavorable impact of 2% on revenue growth, 1% on operating income growth and $0.14 on full year EPS. As I mentioned, we generated $2.2 billion in operating cash flow for the year or $5.50 per share, which is a free cash flow yield of approximately 11%.
In terms of capital return to shareholders. For the full year, we repurchased 21 million Viacom B shares for an aggregate purchase price of $1.5 billion. In July, we also increased our dividend per share by 21% to $0.40 a share. Between our buyback and our dividend programs, we returned a total of $2.1 billion to shareholders in the fiscal year, which is a return on market capital innovation of approximately 10%. We ended the year with 50 million Viacom A shares and 348 million Viacom B shares outstanding.
Now moving on to our debt. It remains principally fixed-rate with an average cost at quarter-end of 4.6%. In September, we repaid the $250 million of outstanding of our 4.25% senior notes which came due. We also redeemed $550 million of our 6.25% senior notes, which are due in April 2016, leaving $368 million remaining outstanding. We ended the quarter with $12.3 billion of total debt and $506 million of cash and cash equivalents. This is an $800 million decrease in gross debt from our June quarter. As previously mentioned, we redeemed $550 million of senior notes to ensure that we stayed within our leverage ratio target. At the end of the quarter, our leverage ratio was 3x.
Now let's turn to some of the factors impacting fiscal 2016. Philippe discussed ad sales and affiliate revenues. For the full year, we expect that Media Networks programming expense growth rate will be in the mid- to high single digits. In terms of taxes, for 2016, we are forecasting a book tax rate of approximately 32%. We will refine this as we go through the year and get a better sense of the domestic versus international profitability mix.
At Paramount, we're excited about our upcoming slate, which includes Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2 and Star Trek 3. For fiscal 2016, we expect profits to be weighted to the back half of the year as the studio benefits from their summer releases. For the December quarter, given the softer performance of certain of our theatrical releases, we anticipate difficult bottom line comparisons to the prior year. Looking ahead at the studio's production and development pipeline, Paramount has just wrapped production on Star Trek 3, and they are currently in production on the next Jack Reacher film. Current films in preproduction include Brad Pitt starring in a romantic thriller set in World War II by Director Robert Zemeckis and a film by award-winning filmmaker Alexander Payne titled Downsizing. In addition, the studio is in active development on Transformers 5 as well as future installment of the franchise. And the studio extended their first production deal with Martin Scorsese.
In summary, we are investing in our brand, and we are building new capabilities to take advantage of the opportunities and meet the challenges as our industry continues to evolve. At Media Networks, we are growing the level of original programming. 6 of our top 10 networks are seeing year-over-year ratings growth, and we continue to secure long-term affiliate deals with both traditional and digital distribution partners. At Paramount, we are developing our franchise pipeline on films, and we have made great progress in TV production in a short period of time. On the advertising front, we are at the dawn of a new age of the data-enhanced marketing. We have invested in technology and in our capabilities, which have enabled us to establish a leading position providing advanced ad sales products and solutions for our marketing partners. It is important to remember, television remains the most compelling vehicle for reaching and influencing consumers, and data-enhanced marketing will only make that more true.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to your questions."

Philippe, there's been a lot of discussion this quarter on these calls regarding SVOD strategy, and I was just hoping for some of a more detailed update from your end, especially as you're getting bigger into sort of more traditional Hollywood and dramas and comedies, but also a strategy around your core channel. Is this inning of the data that you're seeing that suggest the strategy needs to be revised or changed? And any thoughts on sort of the idea of holding back multiple seasons from current shows to burst through TV Everywhere versus selling to SVOD? And then for Tom, I just -- I was hoping for some thoughts on free cash flow generation as you look at fiscal '16. When I look at the last 4 to 5 years, the conversion ratio has really bounced around a lot. I think there was some discussion on this call about ramping the film slate a little bit, which can you use some capital.

Yes, we have always been at the forefront of thinking through how we handle distribution of our content. Remember, we have a vast library of owned content. For many, many years, most of our networks have created original programming, while we have stepped up the level of original programming. This is nothing new for us. So we have successfully, over the last several years, generated a large amount of revenue from the new revenue stream, and we have strategically developed and chosen windows for different types of programming down to specific shows and moved around distribution of some of these shows around the existing major SVOD players in the U.S. And for example, we've seen growth in our presence in Hulu and a diminishment of our presence on Netflix. And that goes both for our networks here at Viacom and EPIX. So we think that's true. We look at the -- not just the monetary value but the promotional value of having shows at different points in the cycle on SVOD. And it is often useful to have prior seasons as we launch new seasons, as an example. Internationally, SVOD is a driver of growth. When you look at a country like China, which is somewhat limited in the traditional distribution of television product, you're seeing a large number, a larger number than in the U.S., of significant SVOD players. So for the first time, we see China as a potentially significant growth market, not just in the film business for Hollywood, but also for us in the television business. And we are seeing rapid expansion of distribution opportunities there and elsewhere as well as increases in pricing as those services grow. So we view, in this arena, as in everywhere else, that technology is our friend, and it is good to be on the content side of the business and we maintain the flexibility on distribution. I just want to touch on TV Everywhere. We also believe that it is extremely important to work with our long-term distributors in expanding the television experience for consumers. It is good for the ecosystem, and we are working very closely with them as they invest capital in developing technology for better TV Everywhere experience to provide the underlying content and to assist in better consumer interfaces, to assist in greater availability of video on demand and work with them on better monetization of the on-demand viewing where there's great opportunity for us and distributors in areas such as dynamic ad insertions, just better monetization of all the content that consumers want to watch in the home and outside of the home."

As you can see from the cash flow schedule that we provided in the web deck, the Media Networks, I think, continues to generate in the area of $3.5 billion to $4 billion of free cash flow year. We expect that to continue. We made some capital investments in terms of incremental working capital, in terms of Paramount, that's to fund the incremental production and expanded production that Philippe and I discussed in our remarks. And in the future, I think we can look forward to that tapering down as we get to the production level that we need to get to for those films. One of the big variables for us that you see in the backup is cash taxes. Cash taxes benefited in 2015 from a very nice benefit associated with our acquisition of Channel 5. That has helped us and certain tax policies. Next year, we won't have the benefit of that Channel 5, so there could be an increase of $300-plus million associated on the tax line, but we're also looking at certain tax legislation that may offset some of that into the future. It's kind of hard to predict that tax line with all that tax legislation gets nailed down, but we see the company being able to generate very strong free cash flow well into the future."

We certainly have seen that in a big way with what Universal has done this year where they are -- they had moved from what was a couple of years ago, lower operating income performance than what Paramount had last year to well over $1 billion in operating income. That's just the nature of the business. For a variety of reasons having to do with issues of development, to tax availability and so forth, we just had too few movies to support the infrastructure that we have and to -- really, to generate revenues. So we think Paramount will turn around. That's why we are investing in it. We are operating Paramount efficiently. We have growth initiatives in television and animation. That will pay off. As you know, Michael, it does take a little time. Had we, for example, started the television production business a few years ago, there would be significant deficits in the start of business. We're able in today's environment to start up very successfully this television production business with almost no net cost to us in either overhead or development with a variety of shows that we have. So we're very optimistic about where Paramount can go. We do have a large number of franchises. We do have long-term relationships with some of the top talent around, ranging from recent renewal of Martin Scorsese to Michael Bay to JJ Abrams coming off the coming release of Star Wars. So just a broad variety of talent, and we believe Paramount will come back and come back strongly in the years to come."

If you look at our advertising revenues, our top 100 or so advertising clients account for more than 3/4 of our advertising revenue. These are the major marketers in the U.S. So when we talk about having 11 today and tripling them. And obviously, there's a focus of the biggest even among the 100, it really does turn into a significant portion of our advertising base, and that's what gets us over this 3-year period to having all of these measurement metrics complement the Nielsen part of our business. And we intend to grow that roster of clients from next year into the next -- into the following year. Because we have this leading capability, it is true that there are a lot of other players, new, emerging players, as well as existing ones who are interested in talking to us about opportunities to work together and driving advertising revenue.

We are going to have a leading mobile video production capability both in L.A. and New York and as well as internationally. But yes, we are willing to look at all models. Of course, it depends on the value we receive in exchange for that. So the model of having both advertising and affiliate revenue is a great model, but an ad-free model can also be good, depending on what monetization you get. And we are getting good monetization when we do SVOD deals. And that whole environment, we look at it as a totality. It's been a growth market for us. Even though content moves from platform to platform, it's been overall a steady growth market. And I believe you will see new players emerge both here in the U.S. and abroad, and that will create even more opportunity for us and our competitors."

Also, as I've touched on earlier, it's an opportunity for Paramount to produce original programming for some of those who are generating original programming and in some -- and a lot of it its production also creates opportunity internationally. Internationally, you really are seeing significant growth in new distribution platforms, not just SVOD, but just generally mobile, for example. That's creating opportunities for us over the medium and long term that just didn't exist before. And we are working hard to develop that. The other benefit of the increased bubble of original programming we're creating here the U.S. is that it is supporting our launch of many new networks internationally. Very often, those networks are being distributed in a TV Everywhere fashion with a a lot of multiplatform capability. There are actually a number of countries in the world, which, in many respects, are more advanced than the U.S. in that regard. So we are particularly optimistic on the opportunities around the world, and we have strong hold positions in the U.K. and in India, which are both great markets, and a lot of open opportunities in Latin America, in Africa, in other parts of Asia as well as Europe. For example, this month, we have launched -- we have 2 launches going on in France. We have my MTV, which is a first time for its product. If you can remember, my Nick Jr. Also, we have my MTV starting for the first time in France. And you can expect to see that in other markets. And we're also launching BET France this month.

Thank you for joining us to discuss Viacom's results for 2015's fourth quarter and full fiscal year. We are seeing real progress as the ecosystem adapts and coalesces around innovative new models both in distribution and advertising in the U.S. and around the world. We believe these changes will usher in a new period of prosperity and growth, but also know that success will require a focus on the long-term health and vitality of our business. More than ever, this is a great time to be in the content business, and those with a more long-term view that is currently in vogue will be richly rewarded. 
Viacom continues to take a leadership role in capturing the opportunities that are rapidly taking shape. We are effectively adapting to a digital, on-demand, socially driven global marketplace, even as we demonstrate quantifiable success in achieving our strategic goals. Importantly, we are also accelerating the critical initiatives that are driving improvement throughout the company.
First, I'll recap our financial performance in the quarter and the year and share some operational and strategic highlights. Tom and Wade will go into greater detail on the results in a minute.
In the fourth quarter, revenues declined 5% to $3.79 billion. Adjusted operating income was $1.06 billion, and adjusted net earnings from continuing operations were $614 million. Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations declined 10% to $1.54 per diluted share. 
For the year, revenues were $13.27 billion, a decline of 4%. Adjusted operating income totaled $3.92 billion, and adjusted net earnings from continuing operations were $2.21 billion. Full year adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 1% to $5.44, which was an all-time record for the company. 
Viacom continued to generate substantial free cash and returned $2.1 billion to shareholders in fiscal 2015 through share repurchases and dividends. As planned, we resumed share repurchases last month at a relatively modest pace thus far, as we focus on growth initiatives, while maintaining a strong financial position.
Looking back at the quarter and the full year, Viacom continued to execute on our top strategic priorities: investing in content, especially original content for all technologies; building international scale, capabilities and profitability; and expanding the use of data and technology in advertising, distribution and the viewer experience to derive additional value from our brands.
As I said earlier, our industry has been moving through a period that has challenged established patterns of media consumption and measurement of that consumption. Because of our young audiences and highly focused brands, Viacom experienced the changes early in the cycle and across more of our properties than other media companies. That transition has now taken hold across the industry, creating disruption, but also spurring action and real momentum towards solutions. As the early birds, we see that, as platforms expand and opportunities increase, fully measured consumption becomes even stronger. 
In fact, recent research revealed that young people are spending more time consuming media each day than they do sleeping. So apparently, media executives aren't the only ones losing sleep in this modern world. I am pleased to say that at Viacom, we are starting to turn the corner. Once again, in the quarter, the Viacom family of networks was #1 according to Nielsen for people 2-plus, people 18 to 34, people 18 to 49 and people 2 to 49. That's a lot of people. Ratings are improving at key networks like Nickelodeon, Nick at Nite, TV Land, BET, CMT and VH1, with additional improvement expected at our other networks as new programming kicks in. Our investment in data is producing meaningful incremental revenue, and the benefits of digital distribution continued to develop and grow. As other companies now begin their pivot through the transition, many of our Media Networks brands are already beginning to emerge, well positioned to grow and succeed.
Turning to the Media Networks results. Revenues increased 5% to $2.79 billion in the quarter. Affiliate revenues remained strong, up 15% domestically and 10% worldwide in the quarter. For the year, domestic affiliate revenues increased 8% and worldwide revenues were up 5%. We expect continued high single-digit growth in domestic affiliate revenue in fiscal 2016. 
With the renewal of our AT&T agreement at the end of the quarter, we concluded a year in which we successfully renewed affiliate deals covering close to 20% of our distribution. In addition, we closed an unprecedented Hulu deal in September that provides outstanding value for our programming while supporting the vitality of the overall distribution ecosystem.
On the advertising sales front, we delivered sequential improvement in quarterly domestic advertising revenue growth, with a decline of 7% improved from a 9% decline in Q3. While it is still early in the quarter, we expect continuing improvement in domestic ad sales this quarter, which we expect to accelerate further as our fiscal year progresses. Worldwide, the decline in the fourth quarter was 1%. For the year, worldwide advertising revenues increased 1%. 
Once again, advertising revenues substantially outpaced traditional ratings, as we continued to provide significant value-added offerings to marketing partners. And we continued to deepen our value proposition to partners, offering deep social connections to our Viacom Echo platform. 
A key component of Viacom's next-generation advertising portfolio is Vantage, our bet on sophisticated data that leverages our leadership in analytics and data aggregation for the benefit of marketing partners. It is a proven success and a platform that is in great demand among the largest and most sophisticated advertisers. Currently, we have 11 advertisers using Vantage, leading national advertisers across sectors that include automotive, beverages, consumer goods, financial services and quick-service restaurants. We are in discussions with dozens of additional Fortune 500 partners. Demand is strong and building. We anticipate that we will triple the total number of Vantage deals by next year's upfront, representing a significant portion of our advertising revenue base.  Many of our peers are beginning their own data programs. The market is moving rapidly in this direction, led by sophisticated national advertisers. This is good for the ecosystem and will create more demand. 
We are confident that Viacom will remain in the forefront as we continued to evolve and improve our proprietary products.
Our brands remain powerful. Our creative and technical talent is unmatched. And our exclusive relationships cannot be replicated, like the TiVo partnership we announced just last week. In addition, we have in the last few weeks taken a significant ownership stake in DigiTour, the leading live events provider for social media talent, with many partnership opportunities across our brands. We are deeply committed to keeping our leadership in this area and firmly believe that as others catch up, we will already be executing on the next generation of these high-margin, highly sophisticated programs for our marketing partners.
Of course, all of this continued improvement depends on great content, and our Media Networks are delivering more new original programming than ever before for every platform. Nickelodeon is a prime example of the success of this commitment. The network delivered a strong fourth quarter by launching innovative new shows and increasing the volume of high-quality premieres. Throughout the quarter, Nickelodeon had more than 100 new episodes of preschool and kids content, with positive results. PAW Patrol and Blaze and the Monster Machines are preschool hits, with LIVE+3 ratings for premieres exceeding a 10. 
Saturday nights now host 2 new hits: Henry Danger, which was the #1 live action show for kids, 2 to 11, in the fourth quarter; and Game Shakers, which has become the #1 live action show in recent weeks. Game Shakers also plays cross-platform, with its Sky Whale game already generating 3 million downloads since its September launch. August marks Nick's highest rated month of the year with kids 2 to 11 and 6 to 11. By September, Nick had taken a strong lead over its nearest competitors and has continued that trend into the current quarter, where Nickelodeon will premiere 140 new episodes and event programs in the Hard 8. 
In digital, the Nick app, Nick Jr. app and Noggin are all expanding their reach. The Nick app has surpassed $20 million installs across iOS, Android, Xbox and Roku, and the Nick Jr. app has surpassed 2 million installs, with kids spending over 100 minutes per week within the app. 
Noggin continues to perform well and will be available on Android and internationally for the first time, beginning next week.
VH1 is another success story. With new leadership in place, the network increased total day rating 6% over the fourth quarter of 2014, driven by strong Monday lineup. For the quarter, VH1 was the #1 cable network on Monday nights among women 18 to 49 and #3 among all adults 18 to 49, fueled by the Love & Hip Hop franchise. The Season 4 finale of VH1's Love & Hip Hop Atlanta was the #1 telecast on all televisions for the day among women 18 to 49 and women 18 to 34. The episode was also the #1 cable telecast among adults 18 to 49, delivering a 2.3 rating in that demo and over 3.3 million total viewers. When combined with the evening's 2 encore airings, more than 5.3 million total viewers tuned in for the Season 4 finale. 
In the current quarter, VH1 is continuing to roll with October prime time ratings up 33%. VH1 owns Monday nights as the #1 nonsports cable network for women 18 to 49. 
BET delivered sequential improvement in ratings growth in the fourth quarter, with the top 2 sitcoms on all basic cable for the key 18 to 49 demo, the Game, and Real Husbands of Hollywood. And the network delivered on their all-new reboot of the classic MTV series Punk'd, making it the 3rd highest-rated BET's series in the quarter. 
In the first quarter of fiscal 2016, BET is driving even more ratings growth, quickly bringing more quality and more volume to the schedule. The Being Mary Jane Season 3 premiere was Tuesday night's top-scripted program on cable this season among adults 18 to 49, and the West Brooks is already becoming a new reality hit. We are also looking forward to Centric Soul Train Awards at the end of this month, which is a proven viewership tentpole. And much like the wildly successful BET experience, the Soul Train Awards continues to build the scale of its weekend-long live event, reinforcing connection with fans and creating unprecedented marketing opportunities for our advertising partners.
At MTV, we've also installed new leadership. Sean Atkins joined us in October. He is an accomplished, versatile media executive, who brings excellent management skills and creative experience across developing -- across development, production and digital products. He has hit the ground running, and we expect to see significant improvement at MTV in fiscal 2016. 
Despite traditional ratings challenges, the MTV brand maintains its prowess and vitality, engaging its young audience in more and deeper ways than ever. A recent video music awards is a great example. The show attracted 10 million viewers on-air and more than 76 million video views across platforms in the first 3 days, including 12 million views on Snapchat. This show generated over 0.5 billion social impressions and also set a new record for tweets during the entertainment program. To kick off our second fiscal quarter, MTV is returning some of its biggest hits and bringing highly anticipated new series to air, including new seasons of Teen Mom OG and Teen Wolf as well as the epic fantasy drama, The Shannara Chronicles. 
Comedy Central also had a quarter successes that illustrates its continued vibrancy as the home of fresh comedic talent and evermore engaging programming. The network had its most successful Emmy season ever, with 26 nominations and 8 wins, the third most wins of any network. We couldn't be prouder of their achievements and the validation of the network's position at the center of the comedy zeitgeist. 
Comedy Central remains the destination for the most intriguing comic minds and has consistently pushed the envelope to create programming that drives culture and explodes on digital platforms among its dedicated fans. While traditional rating softened in the quarter, the rate network's homegrown hits like Inside Amy Schumer, Broad City, South Park, Drunk History and Tosh.0 continued to drive substantial gains on well-monetized digital platforms, like Hulu and the Comedy Central app. Comedy will see improvement in traditional ratings with upcoming new programs and schedule changes, and will be a big beneficiary as more complete and accurate measurement takes hold.
The network also successfully relaunched The Daily Show in September with new host Trevor Noah. Trevor has exceeded our expectations and has already built an audience that is younger, more digital and more diverse. Over the first 4 weeks, Trevor grew linear viewing among adults 18 to 24 by 20% and men 18 to 24 by 32%. And the program remains the #1 late-night show in all television with those audiences.  In addition, The Daily Show is now averaging 750,000 digital full-episode views per show, over and above the traditional measurement totals. 
Looking to the second fiscal quarter, the Comedy Central pipeline is full with 10 original series on the schedule, including Idiot Sitter, a scripted series starting Charlotte Newhouse and Julian Bell, a fan favorite from Workaholics, as well as a new multi-platform series, Not Safe with Nikki Glaser. 
We are seeing additional improvement across our portfolio. The recently completed Spike series, Ink Master, posted the highest C3 ratings in its history, up 14% from the prior season. And I Love Kellie Pickler got off to a terrific start in CMT last week, posting triple-digit ratings gains for the channel in its time slot.
As we have discussed in the past, we are hyper-focused on building upon our industry-leading footprint outside of the U.S. No other media company can match the breadth of Viacom's international network brands or our broad geographic reach. We intend to push our advantage. In that regard, fiscal 2015 was a landmark year, with the full integration of Channel 5 into our operations and the launch of 21 channels around the world, including 7 in the fourth quarter. 
Also in the quarter, Viacom International Media Networks launched Viacom Play Plex, a global suite of branded mobile apps designed to complement our linear TV channels and allow our distribution partners to deepen and improve the entertainment experience they offer their subscribers, consistent with the TV Everywhere products we offer in the U.S. These apps will be available in all 180 markets we operate in. We believe no other international entertainment company is offering this type of innovation at this scale, serving every major demographic in every major TV market. 
And last month, Viacom International Media Networks held the EMAs, our largest international music tentpole of the year. TV viewership remained strong for the show around the globe, and digital video views exploded by 340% over the last year. We also had an impressive 300 million social mentions, and #MTVEMA was the #1 worldwide trending Twitter topic on the night of the show.
At the studio, Paramount delivered one of the top 5 movies of the summer in Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation. Once again, Tom Cruise performed at a superstar level at the box office in the U.S., and particularly overseas, where we drew more than 70% of the sales revenue. 
Paramount's ability to produce and market films is stronger than ever, but we simply did not have enough films in the pipeline this year to take full advantage of our capabilities. In fiscal 2016, we have committed to returning Paramount to a full 15-film slate. In addition, Paramount Animation has a number of exciting projects on tap, including The Little Prince, which the studio will release next March. Paramount's animation team is also currently in production on Monster Trucks, Sherlock Gnomes, SpongeBob SquarePants 3 and Amusement Park. 
With 3 new shows set for early next, including School of Rock on Nickelodeon, Grease Live on Fox and Vinyl on HBO, Paramount Television continues to expand and demonstrate its creative approach to developing and producing television and entertainment. 
The division is also growing its original programming slate and a distinguished roster of creative partners, most recently announcing a straight-to-series order with Netflix for Thirteen Reasons Why, being executive-produced by Selena Gomez, and an overall television deal with Emmy Award-winning director, Cary Fukunaga. To-date, Paramount Television has 10 shows ordered to production and an additional 12 projects set up at networks and major digital outlets.
In closing, we are optimistic about the state of our industry and the significant opportunities Viacom has to benefit from changes in technology, consumption and the growing international marketplace. As we move through 2016, we are committed to: tripling our roster of Vantage clients leading into the 2016 upfront; rolling out more original programming across the company at an unprecedented level in our history; improving the scale and profitability in our international Media Networks Group; driving Paramount as significantly improved financial performance in the years ahead by returning that theatrical slate to 15 films per year, together with the continuing build-up of our television production and animation activities. 
2016 will be a significant year, as measurement and monetization come into realignment around sophisticated, data-enhanced programs that we are pioneering. The application of data insights will lead to more and more differentiation in technology-driven advertising. Consumption will continue to expand across all platforms, and international markets will present new and exciting opportunities. Of course, the turn is not fully complete. We are all learning more and more every day, but we are confident that the pace of change we have set gives us an important long-term advantage over our competition.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Wade."

Before I take you through our operating results, I want to note that our earnings release and web presentation summarizing the results for our September quarter are available on our website.Now let's take a look at our segment results.",543,"Thanks, Philippe. Before I take you through our operating results, I want to note that our earnings release and web presentation summarizing the results for our September quarter are available on our website.
Now let's take a look at our segment results. At our Media Networks segment, revenues in the quarter were up 5% compared with the prior year. Domestic revenues were up 3%, while international revenues increased 11%. Excluding a 10% unfavorable impact from foreign currency, international revenues were up 21%, primarily due to the acquisition of Channel 5.  Page 10 of our web deck provides a breakdown of our Media Networks revenue performance.
In terms of advertising, worldwide advertising revenues declined 1% in the quarter. Domestic revenues were down 7%, and the international revenues grew 45%. The increase in international advertising revenues was driven by growth in Europe, principally from Channel 5. Foreign exchange losses had a 9 percentage point negative impact on international advertising growth.
In terms of affiliate revenues, worldwide revenues were up 10%. Domestic revenues were up 15% in the quarter, while international revenues declined 14%. The growth in domestic affiliate revenues was due to the timing of product available under certain distribution agreements as well as rate increases. 
Foreign exchange had a 12 percentage point unfavorable impact on the international affiliate revenue growth. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, international affiliate revenue declined as revenue growth from new channel launches and increases in subscribers were more than offset by the timing of product available under certain distribution agreements.
Turning to expenses. Overall expenses increased 12% in the quarter. Within operating expenses, programming expense grew 19%, while distribution and other expenses increased 11%. SG&A expense increased 3% in the quarter. 
Expense growth was driven by the acquisition of Channel 5 as well as higher programming, advertising and promotion expense, primarily related to new original series and specials. 
Media Networks' adjusted operating income was down 6% for the quarter, and the adjusted operating income margin was 37%. 
Moving to Filmed Entertainment. Revenues were down 24% in the quarter, principally due to decreases in home entertainment and theatrical revenues. Foreign exchange had a 5 percentage point unfavorable impact on Filmed Entertainment revenue growth. Page 13 of the web presentation provides a breakdown of Filmed Entertainment revenues.
Theatrical revenues declined 20%. Foreign currency had a 9 percentage point unfavorable impact on theatrical revenues. Lower carryover revenues from prior period releases were partially offset by revenues from our current-quarter releases, including Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation, and Terminator Genisys. 
Home entertainment revenues declined 54%, principally due to the absence of releases in the September quarter of this year, whereas last year, we released Transformers and Noah. 
Ancillary revenues declined by 38%, due primarily to lower consumer product licensing revenues, with last year's September quarter benefiting from the release of Transformers. 
Filmed Entertainment generated adjusted operating income of $122 million in the quarter as compared to $213 million last year. The September quarter of last year benefited from both the theatrical and home entertainment performance of Transformers.
Moving to taxes. The full year adjusted effective tax rate was 31.2%, reflecting a 20 basis point improvement as compared to the prior year.
With that, I would like to turn the call over to Tom."

Let me cover our full year results as well as take -- talk about our cash flow and our debt. I'll also cover seasonal factors impacting the 2016 fiscal year that haven't already been discussed. For the full year, Viacom generated $13.3",825,"Thank you, Wade. Let me cover our full year results as well as take -- talk about our cash flow and our debt. I'll also cover seasonal factors impacting the 2016 fiscal year that haven't already been discussed. 
For the full year, Viacom generated $13.3 billion of revenue, $3.9 billion of adjusted operating income, $2.2 billion of operating free cash flow and $5.44 of adjusted earnings per share. 
That breaks down as follows: Media Networks generated revenue of $10.5 billion, which is an increase of 3% over the prior year. Adjusted operating income of $4.1 billion declined 3% as compared to 2014. Affiliate revenue grew 5% for the year, while advertising revenue increased 1%. And the Media Networks' adjusted operating income margin was 39.5%. 
Filmed Entertainment generated revenue of $2.9 billion and adjusted operating income margin of $111 million -- I'm sorry, adjusted operating income of $111 million and an operating income margin of 4%. 
For the total company, foreign currency had an unfavorable impact of 2% on revenue growth, 1% on operating income growth and $0.14 on full year EPS. As I mentioned, we generated $2.2 billion in operating cash flow for the year or $5.50 per share, which is a free cash flow yield of approximately 11%.
In terms of capital return to shareholders, for the full year, we repurchased 21 million Viacom B shares for an aggregate purchase price of $1.5 billion. In July, we also increased our dividend per share by 21% to $0.40 a share. Between our buyback and our dividend programs, we returned a total of $2.1 billion to shareholders in the fiscal year, which is a return on market capital innovation of approximately 10%. We ended the year with 50 million Viacom A shares and 348 million Viacom B shares outstanding.
Now moving on to our debt. It remains principally fixed-rate with an average cost at quarter-end of 4.6%. In September, we repaid the $250 million of outstanding of our 4.25% senior notes which came due. We also redeemed $550 million of our 6.25% senior notes, which are due in April 2016, leaving $368 million remaining outstanding. 
We ended the quarter with $12.3 billion of total debt and $506 million of cash and cash equivalent. This is an $800 million decrease in gross debt from our June quarter. As previously mentioned, we redeemed $550 million of senior notes to ensure that we stayed within our leverage ratio target. At the end of the quarter, our leverage ratio was 3x.
Now let's turn to some of the factors impacting fiscal 2016. Philippe discussed ad sales and affiliate revenues. For the full year, we expect that Media Networks' programming expense growth rate will be in the mid- to high single digits. In terms of taxes, for 2016, we are forecasting a book tax rate of approximately 32%. We will refine this as we go through the year and get a better sense of the domestic versus international profitability mix.
At Paramount, we're excited about our upcoming slate, which includes Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2 and Star Trek 3. For fiscal 2016, we expect profits to be weighted to the back half of the year, as the studio benefits from their summer releases. For the December quarter, given the softer performance of certain of our theatrical releases, we anticipate difficult bottom line comparisons to the prior year. Looking ahead at the studio's production and development pipeline, Paramount has just wrapped production on Star Trek 3, and they are currently in production on the next Jack Reacher film. Current films in preproduction include: Brad Pitt starring in a romantic thriller set in World War II by director Robert Zemeckis, and a film by award-winning filmmaker Alexander Payne, titled Downsizing. In addition, the studio is in active development on Transformers 5 as well as future installments of the franchise. And the studio extended their first-look production deal with Martin Scorsese.
In summary, we are investing in our brand, and we are building new capabilities to take advantage of the opportunities and meet the challenges as our industry continues to evolve. At Media Networks, we are growing the level of original programming. Six of our top 10 networks are seeing year-over-year ratings growth, and we continue to secure long-term affiliate deals with both traditional and digital distribution partners. At Paramount, we are developing our franchise pipeline on films, and we have made great progress in TV production in a short period of time. 
On the advertising front, we are dawn of a new age of the data-enhanced marketing. We have invested in technology and in our capabilities, which have enabled us to establish a leading position providing advanced ad sales products and solutions for our marketing partners. It is important to remember, television remains the most compelling vehicle for reaching and influencing consumers, and data-enhanced marketing will only make that more true.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to your questions."

And any thoughts on sort of the idea of holding back multiple seasons from current shows to put through TV Everywhere versus selling to SVOD? And then for Tom, I just -- I was hoping for some thoughts on free cash flow generation as you look at fiscal '16. When I look at the last 4 to 5 years, the conversion ratio has really bounced around a lot.

Yes, we have always been at the forefront of thinking through how we handle distribution of our content. Remember, we have a vast library of owned content. For many, many years, most of our networks have created original programming. While we have stepped up the level of original programming, this is nothing new for us. So we have successfully, over the last several years, generated a large amount of revenue from this new revenue stream, and we have strategically developed and chosen windows for different types of programming down to specific shows and moved around distribution of some of these shows around the existing major SVOD players in the U.S. And for example, we've seen growth in our presence in Hulu and a diminishment of our presence on Netflix. And that goes both for our networks here at Viacom and Epix. So we think that through. We look at the, not just the monetary value, but the promotional value of having shows at different points in the cycle on SVOD, and it is often useful to have prior seasons as we launch new seasons, as an example. Internationally, SVOD is a driver of growth. When you look at a country like China, which is somewhat limited in the traditional distribution of television product, you are seeing a large number, a larger number than in the U.S., of significant SVOD players. So for the first time, we see China as a potentially significant growth market not just in the film business for Hollywood but also for us in the television business. And we are seeing rapid expansion of distribution opportunities there and elsewhere as well as increases in pricing as those services grow. So we view, in this arena, as in everywhere else, that technology is our friend, and it is good to be on the content side of the business and we maintain the flexibility on distribution. I just want to touch on TV Everywhere. We also believe it is extremely important to work with our long-term distributors in expanding the television experience for consumers. It is good for the ecosystem, and we are working very closely with them as they invest capital in developing technology for better TV Everywhere experience to provide the underlying content and to assist in better consumer interfaces, to assist in greater availability of video-on-demand and work with them on better monetization of video-on-demand viewing, where there's great opportunity for us and distributors in areas such as dynamic ad insertions, just better monetization of all the content that consumers want to watch in the home and outside of the home."

We expect that to continue. We've made some capital investments in terms of incremental working capital, in terms of Paramount, that's to fund the incremental production and expanded production that Philippe and I discussed in our remarks. And in the future, I think we can look forward to that tapering down as we get to the production level that we need to get to for those films. One of the big variables for us that you see in the backup is cash taxes. Cash taxes benefited in 2015 from a very nice benefit associated with our acquisition of Channel 5. That has helped us and certain tax policies. Next year, we won't have the benefit of that Channel 5, so there could be an increase of $300-plus million associated on the tax line. But we're also looking at certain tax legislation that may offset some of that into the future. It's kind of hard to predict that tax line until that tax legislation gets nailed down, but we see the company being able to generate very strong free cash flow well into the future."

We certainly have seen that in a big way with what Universal has done this year where they are -- they have moved from, what was a couple of years ago, lower operating income performance than what Paramount had last year to well over $1 billion in operating income. That's just the nature of the business. For a variety of reasons having to do with issues in development, to cast availability and so forth, we just had too few movies to support the infrastructure that we have and really to generate revenues. So we think Paramount will turn around. That's why we are investing in it. We are operating Paramount efficiently. We have growth initiatives in television and animation. That will pay off. As you know, Michael, it does take a little time. Had we, for example, started the television production business a few years ago, there would be significant deficits in a start-up business. We are able, in today's environment, to start up very successfully this television production business with almost no net cost to us in either overhead or development with a variety of shows that we have. So we're very optimistic about where Paramount can go. We do have a large number of franchises. We do have long-term relationships with some of the top talent around, ranging from recent renewal of Martin Scorsese to Michael Bay to J.J. Abrams  coming off the -- coming release of Star Wars. So just a broad variety of talent, and we believe Paramount will come back and come back strongly in the years to come."

Obviously, there are big opportunities, as you head into -- as you have upfront discussions leading up to next year as part of the upfront sales, which is why we're targeting this tripling of Vantage clients.

If you look at our advertising revenues, our top 100-or-so advertising clients account for more than 3/4 of our advertising revenues. These are the major marketers in the U.S. So when we talk about having 11 today and tripling them -- and obviously, there's a focus of the biggest even among the 100, it really does turn into a significant portion of our advertising base, and that's what gets us over this 3-year period to having all of these measurement metrics complement the Nielsen part of our business. And we intend to grow that roster of clients from next year into the next -- into the following year. Because we have this leading capability, it is true that there are a lot of other players, new, emerging players as well as existing ones, who are interested in talking to us about opportunities to work together and driving advertise revenue.

We think there are a lot of opportunities for content owners both for existing content that we produce for television and new forms of content. What I did not mention, except touching on it in the opening remarks, is we have an opportunity to create a lot of new short-form or even longer-form content specifically for new platforms. We've announced development for platforms like Snapchat of series that are 10 seconds each. We are going to have a leading mobile video production capability both in L.A. and New York and as well as internationally. But yes, we are willing to look at all models. Of course, it depends on the value we receive in exchange for that. So the model of having both advertising and affiliate revenue is a great model, but an ad-free model can also be, good depending on what monetization you get. And we are getting good monetization when we do SVOD deals. And that whole environment, we look at it as a totality. It's been a growth market for us. Even though content moves from platform to platform, it's been overall a steady growth market. And I believe you will see new players emerge both here in the U.S. and abroad, and that will create even more opportunity for us and our competitors."

And as we are ramping up production, obviously, there's a lot of interest in what we are doing among those distributors as well as others. Also, as I touched on earlier, it's an opportunity for Paramount to produce original programming. For some of those who are generating original programming and in some -- and a lot of it its production also creates opportunity internationally. Internationally, you really are seeing significant growth in new distribution platforms, not just SVOD, but just generally mobile, for example. That's creating opportunities for us over the medium and long term that just didn't exist before, and we are working hard to develop that. The other benefit of the increased level of original programming we're creating here in the U.S. is that it is supporting our launch of many new networks internationally. Very often, those networks are being distributed in a TV Everywhere fashion with a lot of multi-platform capability. There are actually a number of countries in the world which, in many respects, are more advanced than the U.S. in that regard. So we are particularly optimistic on the opportunities around the world, and we have strong-hold positions in the U.K. and in India, which are both great markets, and a lot of open-field opportunities in Latin America, in Africa, in other parts of Asia as well as Europe. For example, this month, we have 2 launches going on in France. We have My MTV, which is a first time for its product, if you can remember, My Nick Jr. So we have My MTV starting for the first time in France, and you can expect to see that in other markets. And we are also launching BET France this month. So yes, we continue to launch new products and are in discussions with a number of players, and a lot of new players coming through our doors talking about the opportunity to take advantage of our brands and our content."

So as that evolves, and that's a long-term evolution, that will take place over the next 3 to 5 years, that will provide, I think, many advertisers and kind of certainly media companies, not only advertising, with an opportunity to get much more efficient yield and monetization associated with the consumption and viewership around each television show."

Thank you for joining us to discuss Viacom's results for 2015's fourth quarter and full fiscal year. We are seeing real progress as the ecosystem adapts and coalesces around innovative new models, both in distribution and advertising, in the U.S. and around the world. We believe these changes will usher in a new period of prosperity and growth, but also know that success will require a focus on the long-term health and vitality of our business. More than ever, this is a great time to be in the content business, and those with a more long-term view than is currently in vogue will be richly rewarded. 
Viacom continues to take a leadership role in capturing the opportunities that are rapidly taking shape. We are effectively adapting to a digital, on-demand, socially-driven global marketplace, even as we demonstrate quantifiable success in achieving our strategic goals. Importantly, we are also accelerating the critical initiatives that are driving improvement throughout the company.
First, I'll recap our financial performance in the quarter and the year and share some operational and strategic highlights. Tom and Wade will go into greater detail on the results in a moment.
In the fourth quarter, revenues declined 5% to $3.79 billion. Adjusted operating income was $1.06 billion, and adjusted net earnings from continuing operations were $614 million. Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations declined 10% to $1.54 per diluted share. 
For the year, revenues were $13.27 billion, a decline of 4%. Adjusted operating income totaled $3.92 billion, and adjusted net earnings from continuing operations were $2.21 billion. Full year adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 1% to $5.44, which was an all-time record for the company. 
Viacom continued to generate substantial free cash and returned $2.1 billion to shareholders in fiscal 2015 through share repurchases and dividends. As planned, we resumed share repurchases last month at a relatively modest pace thus far, as we focus on growth initiatives while maintaining a strong financial position.
Looking back at the quarter and the full year, Viacom continued to execute on our top strategic priorities: investing in content, especially original content for all technologies; building international scale, capabilities and profitability; and expanding the use of data and technology in advertising, distribution and the viewer experience to derive additional value from our brands.
As I said earlier, our industry has been moving through a period that has challenged established patterns of media consumption and measurement of that consumption. Because of our young audiences and highly focused brands, Viacom experienced the changes early in the cycle and across more of our properties than other media companies. That transition has now taken hold across the industry, creating disruption, but also spurring action and real momentum towards solutions. As the early birds, we see that as platforms expand and opportunities increase, fully measured consumption becomes even stronger. 
In fact, recent research revealed that young people are spending more time consuming media each day than they do sleeping. So apparently, media executives aren't the only ones losing sleep in this modern world. I am pleased to say that at Viacom, we are starting to turn the corner. Once again, in the quarter, the Viacom family of networks was #1 according to Nielsen for people 2-plus, people 18 to 34, people 18 to 49 and people 2 to 49. That's a lot of people. Ratings are improving at key networks like Nickelodeon, Nick at Nite, TV Land, BET, CMT and VH1, with additional improvement expected at our other networks as new programming kicks in. Our investment in data is producing meaningful incremental revenue, and the benefits of digital distribution continue to develop and grow. As other companies now begin their pivot through the transition, many of our Media Networks brands are already beginning to emerge, well positioned to grow and succeed.
Turning to the Media Networks results. Revenues increased 5% to $2.79 billion in the quarter. Affiliate revenues remained strong, up 15% domestically and 10% worldwide in the quarter. For the year, domestic affiliate revenues increased 8% and worldwide revenues were up 5%. We expect continued high single-digit growth in domestic affiliate revenue in fiscal 2016. 
With the renewal of our AT&T agreement at the end of the quarter, we concluded a year in which we successfully renewed affiliate deals covering close to 20% of our distribution. In addition, we closed an unprecedented Hulu deal in September that provides outstanding value for our programming while supporting the vitality of the overall distribution ecosystem.
On the advertising sales front, we delivered sequential improvement in quarterly domestic advertising revenue growth, with a decline of 7%, improved from a 9% decline in Q3. While it is still early in the quarter, we expect continuing improvement in domestic ad sales this quarter, which we expect to accelerate further as our fiscal year progresses. Worldwide, the decline in the fourth quarter was 1%. For the year, worldwide advertising revenues increased 1%. 
Once again, advertising revenue substantially outpaced traditional ratings, as we continue to provide significant value-added offerings to marketing partners. And we continue to deepen our value proposition to partners, offering deep social connections through our Viacom Echo platform. 
A key component of Viacom's next-generation advertising portfolio is Vantage, our bet on sophisticated data that leverages our leadership in analytics and data aggregation for the benefit of marketing partners. It is a proven success and a platform that is in great demand among the largest and most sophisticated advertisers. Currently, we have 11 advertisers using Vantage, leading national advertisers across sectors that include automotive, beverages, consumer goods, financial services and quick-service restaurants. We are in discussions with dozens of additional Fortune 500 partners. Demand is strong and building. We anticipate that we will triple the total number of Vantage deals by next year's upfront, representing a significant portion of our advertising revenue base. Many of our peers are beginning their own data programs. The market is moving rapidly in this direction, led by sophisticated national advertisers. This is good for the ecosystem and will create more demand. 
We are confident that Viacom will remain in the forefront as we continue to evolve and improve our proprietary products.
Our brands remain powerful. Our creative and technical talent is unmatched. And our exclusive relationships cannot be replicated, like the TiVo partnership we announced just last week. In addition, we have in the last few weeks taken a significant ownership stake in DigiTour, the leading live events provider for social media talent, with many partnership opportunities across our brands. We are deeply committed to keeping our leadership in this area and firmly believe that as others catch up, we will already be executing on the next generation of these high-margin, highly sophisticated programs for our marketing partners.
Of course, all of this continued improvement depends on great content, and our Media Networks are delivering more new original programming than ever before for every platform. Nickelodeon is a prime example of the success of this commitment. The network delivered a strong fourth quarter by launching innovative new shows and increasing the volume of high-quality premieres. Throughout the quarter, Nickelodeon had more than 100 new episodes of preschool and kids content, with positive results. PAW Patrol and Blaze and the Monster Machines are preschool hits, with LIVE+3 ratings for premieres exceeding a 10. 
Saturday nights now host 2 new hits: Henry Danger, which was the #1 live action show for kids 2 to 11 in the fourth quarter; and Game Shakers, which has become the #1 live action show in recent weeks. Game Shakers also plays cross-platform, with its Sky Whale game already generating 3 million downloads since its September launch. August marked Nick's highest rated month of the year with kids 2 to 11 and 6 to 11. By September, Nick had taken a strong lead over its nearest competitors and has continued that trend into the current quarter, where Nickelodeon will premiere 140 new episodes and event programs in the Hard 8. 
In digital, the Nick app, Nick Jr. app and Noggin are all expanding their reach. The Nick app has surpassed 20 million installs across iOS, Android, Xbox and Roku, and the Nick Jr. app has surpassed 2 million installs, with kids spending over 100 minutes per week within the app. 
Noggin continues to perform well and will be available on Android and internationally for the first time beginning next week.
VH1 is another success story. With new leadership in place, the network increased total day ratings 6% over the fourth quarter of 2014, driven by a strong Monday lineup. For the quarter, VH1 was the #1 cable network on Monday nights among women 18 to 49 and #3 among all adults 18 to 49, fueled by the Love & Hip Hop franchise. The Season 4 finale of VH1's Love & Hip Hop: Atlanta was the #1 telecast on all televisions for the day among women 18 to 49 and women 18 to 34. The episode was also the #1 cable telecast among adults 18 to 49, delivering a 2.3 rating in that demo and over 3.3 million total viewers. When combined with the evening's 2 encore airings, more than 5.3 million total viewers tuned in for the Season 4 finale. 
In the current quarter, VH1 is continuing to roll, with October prime time ratings up 33%. VH1 owns Monday nights as the #1 non-sports cable network for women 18 to 49. 
BET delivered sequential improvement in ratings growth in the fourth quarter, with the top 2 sitcoms on all basic cable for the key 18 to 49 demo, The Game and Real Husbands of Hollywood. And the network delivered on their all-new reboot of the classic MTV series Punk'd, making it the 3rd highest-rated BET series in the quarter. 
In the first quarter of fiscal 2016, BET is driving even more ratings growth, quickly bringing more quality and more volume to the schedule. The Being Mary Jane Season 3 premiere was Tuesday night's top scripted program on cable this season among adults 18 to 49, and The Westbrooks is already becoming a new reality hit. We are also looking forward to Centric's Soul Train Awards at the end of this month, which is a proven viewership tentpole. And much like the wildly successful BET Experience, the Soul Train Awards continues to build the scale of its weekend-long live event, reinforcing connections with fans and creating unprecedented marketing opportunities for our advertising partners.
At MTV, we've also installed new leadership. Sean Atkins joined us in October. He is an accomplished, versatile media executive, who brings excellent management skills and creative experience across developing -- across development, production and digital products. He has hit the ground running, and we expect to see significant improvement at MTV in fiscal 2016. 
Despite traditional ratings challenges, the MTV brand maintains its prowess and vitality, engaging its young audience in more and deeper ways than ever. The recent Video Music Awards is a great example. The show attracted 10 million viewers on-air and more than 76 million video views across platforms in the first 3 days, including 12 million views on Snapchat. The show generated over 0.5 billion social impressions and also set a new record for tweets during an entertainment program. To kick off our second fiscal quarter, MTV is returning some of its biggest hits and bringing highly anticipated new series to air, including new seasons of Teen Mom OG and Teen Wolf as well as the epic fantasy drama, The Shannara Chronicles. 
Comedy Central also had a quarter of successes that illustrates its continued vibrancy as the home of fresh comedic talent and evermore engaging programming. The network had its most successful Emmy season ever, with 26 nominations and 8 wins, the third-most wins of any network. We couldn't be prouder of their achievements and the validation of the network's position at the center of the comedy zeitgeist. 
Comedy Central remains the destination for the most intriguing comic minds and has consistently pushed the envelope to create programming that drives culture and explodes on digital platforms among its dedicated fans. While traditional ratings softened in the quarter, the network's homegrown hits like Inside Amy Schumer, Broad City, South Park, Drunk History and Tosh.0 continued to drive substantial gains on well-monetized digital platforms, like Hulu and the Comedy Central app. Comedy will see improvement in traditional ratings with upcoming new programs and schedule changes, and will be a big beneficiary as more complete and accurate measurement takes hold.
The network also successfully relaunched The Daily Show in September with new host Trevor Noah. Trevor has exceeded our expectations and has already built an audience that is younger, more digital and more diverse. Over the first 4 weeks, Trevor grew linear viewing among adults 18 to 24 by 20% and men 18 to 24 by 32%. And the program remains the #1 late-night show in all of television with those audiences. In addition, The Daily Show is now averaging 750,000 digital full-episode views per show, over and above the traditional measurement totals. 
Looking to the second fiscal quarter, the Comedy Central pipeline is full, with 10 original series on the schedule, including Idiotsitter, a scripted series starring Charlotte Newhouse and Jillian Bell, a fan favorite from Workaholics, as well as a new multi-platform series, Not Safe with Nikki Glaser. 
We are seeing additional improvement across our portfolio. The recently completed Spike series, Ink Master, posted the highest C3 ratings in its history, up 14% from the prior season. And I Love Kellie Pickler got off to a terrific start in CMT last week, posting triple-digit ratings gains for the channel in its time slot.
As we have discussed in the past, we are hyper-focused on building upon our industry-leading footprint outside of the U.S. No other media company can match the breadth of Viacom's international network brands or our broad geographic reach. We intend to push our advantage. In that regard, fiscal 2015 was a landmark year, with the full integration of Channel 5 into our operations and the launch of 21 channels around the world, including 7 in the fourth quarter. 
Also in the quarter, Viacom International Media Networks launched Viacom Play Plex, a global suite of branded mobile apps designed to complement our linear TV channels and allow our distribution partners to deepen and improve the entertainment experience they offer their subscribers, consistent with the TV Everywhere products we offer in the U.S. These apps will be available in all 180 markets we operate in. We believe no other international entertainment company is offering this type of innovation at this scale, serving every major demographic in every major TV market. 
And last month, Viacom International Media Networks held the EMAs, our largest international music tentpole of the year. TV viewership remained strong for the show around the globe, and digital video views exploded by 340% over last year. We also had an impressive 300 million social mentions, and #MTVEMA was the #1 worldwide trending Twitter topic on the night of the show.
At the studio, Paramount delivered one of the top 5 movies of the summer in Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation. Once again, Tom Cruise performed at a superstar level at the box office in the U.S., and particularly overseas, where we drew more than 70% of the sales revenue. 
Paramount's ability to produce and market films is stronger than ever, but we simply did not have enough films in the pipeline this year to take full advantage of our capabilities. In fiscal 2016, we have committed to returning Paramount to a full 15-film slate. In addition, Paramount Animation has a number of exciting projects on tap, including The Little Prince, which the studio will release next March. Paramount's animation team is also currently in production on Monster Trucks, Sherlock Gnomes, SpongeBob SquarePants 3 and Amusement Park. 
With 3 new shows set for early next year, including School of Rock on Nickelodeon, Grease Live on Fox and Vinyl on HBO, Paramount Television continues to expand and demonstrate its creative approach to developing and producing television and entertainment. 
The division is also growing its original programming slate and a distinguished roster of creative partners, most recently announcing a straight-to-series order with Netflix for Thirteen Reasons Why, being executive-produced by Selena Gomez, and an overall television deal with Emmy Award-winning director, Cary Fukunaga. To date, Paramount Television has 10 shows ordered to production and an additional 12 projects set up at networks and major digital outlets.
In closing, we are optimistic about the state of our industry and the significant opportunities Viacom has to benefit from changes in technology, consumption and the growing international marketplace. As we move through 2016, we are committed to: tripling our roster of Vantage clients leading into the 2016 upfront; rolling out more original programming across the company at an unprecedented level in our history; improving the scale and profitability in our International Media Networks group; driving Paramount to significantly improved financial performance in the years ahead by returning the theatrical slate to 15 films per year, together with the continuing build-up of our television production and animation activities. 
2016 will be a significant year, as measurement and monetization come into realignment around sophisticated, data-enhanced programs that we are pioneering. The application of data insights will lead to more and more differentiation in technology-driven advertising. Consumption will continue to expand across all platforms and international markets will present new and exciting opportunities. Of course, the turn is not fully complete. We are all learning more and more every day, but we are confident that the pace of change we have set gives us an important long-term advantage over our competition.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Wade."

Before I take you through our operating results, I want to note that our earnings release and web presentation summarizing the results for our September quarter are available on our website.Now let's take a look at our segment results.",543,"Thanks, Philippe. Before I take you through our operating results, I want to note that our earnings release and web presentation summarizing the results for our September quarter are available on our website.
Now let's take a look at our segment results. At our Media Networks segment, revenues in the quarter were up 5% compared with the prior year. Domestic revenues were up 3%, while international revenues increased 11%. Excluding a 10% unfavorable impact from foreign currency, international revenues were up 21%, primarily due to the acquisition of Channel 5. Page 10 of our web deck provides a breakdown of our Media Networks revenue performance.
In terms of advertising, worldwide advertising revenues declined 1% in the quarter. Domestic revenues were down 7% and international revenues grew 45%. The increase in international advertising revenues was driven by growth in Europe, principally from Channel 5. Foreign exchange losses had a 9 percentage point negative impact on international advertising growth.
In terms of affiliate revenues, worldwide revenues were up 10%. Domestic revenues were up 15% in the quarter, while international revenues declined 14%. The growth in domestic affiliate revenues was due to the timing of product available under certain distribution agreements as well as rate increases. 
Foreign exchange had a 12 percentage point unfavorable impact on the international affiliate revenue growth. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, international affiliate revenue declined as revenue growth from new channel launches and increases in subscribers were more than offset by the timing of product available under certain distribution agreements.
Turning to expenses. Overall expenses increased 12% in the quarter. Within operating expenses, programming expense grew 19%, while distribution and other expenses increased 11%. SG&A expense increased 3% in the quarter. 
Expense growth was driven by the acquisition of Channel 5 as well as higher programming, advertising and promotion expense, primarily related to new original series and specials. 
Media Networks adjusted operating income was down 6% for the quarter, and the adjusted operating income margin was 37%. 
Moving to Filmed Entertainment. Revenues were down 24% in the quarter, principally due to decreases in home entertainment and theatrical revenues. Foreign exchange had a 5 percentage point unfavorable impact on Filmed Entertainment revenue growth. Page 13 of the web presentation provides a breakdown of Filmed Entertainment revenues.
Theatrical revenues declined 20%. Foreign currency had a 9 percentage point unfavorable impact on theatrical revenues. Lower carryover revenues from prior period releases were partially offset by revenues from our current quarter releases, including Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation and Terminator Genisys. 
Home entertainment revenues declined 54%, principally due to the absence of releases in the September quarter of this year, whereas last year, we released Transformers and Noah. 
Ancillary revenues declined by 38%, due primarily to lower consumer product licensing revenues, with last year's September quarter benefiting from the release of Transformers. 
Filmed Entertainment generated adjusted operating income of $122 million in the quarter as compared to $213 million last year. The September quarter of last year benefited from both the theatrical and home entertainment performance of Transformers.
Moving to taxes. The full year adjusted effective tax rate was 31.2%, reflecting a 20 basis point improvement as compared to the prior year.
With that, I would like to turn the call over to Tom."

Let me cover our full year results as well as take -- talk about our cash flow and our debt. I'll also cover seasonal factors impacting the 2016 fiscal year that haven't already been discussed. For the full year, Viacom generated $13.3",825,"Thank you, Wade. Let me cover our full year results as well as take -- talk about our cash flow and our debt. I'll also cover seasonal factors impacting the 2016 fiscal year that haven't already been discussed. 
For the full year, Viacom generated $13.3 billion of revenue, $3.9 billion of adjusted operating income, $2.2 billion of operating free cash flow and $5.44 of adjusted earnings per share. 
That breaks down as follows: Media Networks generated revenue of $10.5 billion, which is an increase of 3% over the prior year. Adjusted operating income of $4.1 billion declined 3% as compared to 2014. Affiliate revenue grew 5% for the year, while advertising revenue increased 1%. And the Media Networks adjusted operating income margin was 39.5%. 
Filmed Entertainment generated revenue of $2.9 billion and adjusted operating income margin of $111 million -- I'm sorry, adjusted operating income of $111 million and an operating income margin of 4%. 
For the total company, foreign currency had an unfavorable impact of 2% on revenue growth, 1% on operating income growth and $0.14 on full year EPS. As I mentioned, we generated $2.2 billion in operating cash flow for the year or $5.50 per share, which is a free cash flow yield of approximately 11%.
In terms of capital return to shareholders, for the full year, we repurchased 21 million Viacom B shares for an aggregate purchase price of $1.5 billion. In July, we also increased our dividend per share by 21% to $0.40 a share. Between our buyback and our dividend programs, we returned a total of $2.1 billion to shareholders in the fiscal year, which is a return on market capitalization of approximately 10%. We ended the year with 50 million Viacom A shares and 348 million Viacom B shares outstanding.
Now moving on to our debt. It remains principally fixed-rate, with an average cost at quarter end of 4.6%. In September, we repaid the $250 million outstanding of our 4.25% senior notes which came due. We also redeemed $550 million of our 6.25% senior notes, which are due in April 2016, leaving $368 million remaining outstanding. 
We ended the quarter with $12.3 billion of total debt and $506 million of cash and cash equivalents. This is an $800 million decrease in gross debt from our June quarter. As previously mentioned, we redeemed $550 million of senior notes to ensure that we stayed within our leverage ratio target. At the end of the quarter, our leverage ratio was 3x.
Now let's turn to some of the factors impacting fiscal 2016. Philippe discussed ad sales and affiliate revenues. For the full year, we expect that Media Networks' programming expense growth rate will be in the mid- to high single digits. In terms of taxes, for 2016, we are forecasting a book tax rate of approximately 32%. We will refine this as we go through the year and get a better sense of the domestic versus international profitability mix.
At Paramount, we're excited about our upcoming slate, which includes Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2 and Star Trek 3. For fiscal 2016, we expect profits to be weighted to the back half of the year, as the studio benefits from their summer releases. For the December quarter, given the softer performance of certain of our theatrical releases, we anticipate difficult bottom line comparisons to the prior year. Looking ahead at the studio's production and development pipeline, Paramount has just wrapped production on Star Trek 3, and they are currently in production on the next Jack Reacher film. Current films in preproduction include: Brad Pitt starring in a romantic thriller set in World War II for director Robert Zemeckis; and a film by award-winning filmmaker Alexander Payne, titled Downsizing. In addition, the studio is in active development on Transformers 5 as well as future installments of the franchise. And the studio extended their first-look production deal with Martin Scorsese.
In summary, we are investing in our brands, and we are building new capabilities to take advantage of the opportunities and meet the challenges as our industry continues to evolve. At Media Networks, we are growing the level of original programming. Six of our top 10 networks are seeing year-over-year ratings growth, and we continue to secure long-term affiliate deals with both traditional and digital distribution partners. At Paramount, we are developing our franchise pipeline of films, and we have made great progress in TV production in a short period of time. 
On the advertising front, we are at the dawn of a new age of data-enhanced marketing. We have invested in technology and in our capabilities, which have enabled us to establish a leading position providing advanced ad sales products and solutions for our marketing partners. It is important to remember, television remains the most compelling vehicle for reaching and influencing consumers, and data-enhanced marketing will only make that more true.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to your questions."

And then for Tom, I just -- I was hoping for some thoughts on free cash flow generation as you look at fiscal '16. When I look at the last 4 to 5 years, your conversion ratio has really bounced around a lot.

Yes, we have always been at the forefront of thinking through how we handle distribution of our content. Remember, we have a vast library of owned content. For many, many years, most of our networks have created original programming. While we have stepped up the level of original programming, this is nothing new for us. So we have successfully, over the last several years, generated a large amount of revenue from this new revenue stream, and we have strategically developed and chosen windows for different types of programming down to specific shows and moved around distribution of some of these shows around the existing major SVOD players in the U.S. And for example, we've seen growth in our presence in Hulu and a diminishment of our presence on Netflix. And that goes both for our networks here at Viacom and Epix. So we think that through. We look at the, not just the monetary value, but the promotional value of having shows at different points in the cycle on SVOD, and it is often useful to have prior seasons as we launch new seasons, as an example. Internationally, SVOD is a driver of growth. When you look at a country like China, which is somewhat limited in the traditional distribution of television product, you are seeing a large number, a larger number than in the U.S., of significant SVOD players. So for the first time, we see China as a potentially significant growth market, not just in the film business for Hollywood but also for us in the television business. And we are seeing rapid expansion of distribution opportunities there and elsewhere as well as increases in pricing as those services grow. So we view, in this arena, as in everywhere else, that technology is our friend, and it is good to be on the content side of the business and we maintain the flexibility on distribution. I just want to touch on TV Everywhere. We also believe it is extremely important to work with our long-term distributors in expanding the television experience for consumers. It is good for the ecosystem, and we are working very closely with them as they invest capital in developing the technology for better TV Everywhere experience, to provide the underlying content and to assist in better consumer interfaces, to assist in greater availability of video-on-demand and work with them on better monetization of video-on-demand viewing, where there's great opportunity for us and distributors in areas such as dynamic ad insertions, just better monetization of all the content that consumers want to watch in the home and outside of the home."

We expect that to continue. We've made some capital investments in terms of incremental working capital, in terms of Paramount, that's to fund the incremental production and expanded production that Philippe and I discussed in our remarks. And in the future, I think we can look forward to that tapering down as we get to the production level that we need to get to for those films. One of the big variables for us that you see in the backup is cash taxes. Cash taxes benefited in 2015 from a very nice benefit associated with our acquisition of Channel 5. That has helped us and certain tax policies. Next year, we won't have the benefit of that Channel 5, so there could be an increase of $300-plus million associated on the tax line. But we're also looking at certain tax legislation that may offset some of that into the future. It's kind of hard to predict that tax line until that tax legislation gets nailed down, but we see the company being able to generate very strong free cash flow well into the future."

We certainly have seen that in a big way with what Universal has done this year, where they are -- they have moved from what was a couple of years ago, lower operating income performance than what Paramount had last year to well over $1 billion in operating income. That's just the nature of the business. Now for a variety of reasons having to do with issues in development, to cast availability and so forth, we just had too few movies to support the infrastructure that we have and really to generate revenues. So we think Paramount will turn around. That's why we are investing in it. We are operating Paramount efficiently. We have growth initiatives in television and animation. That will pay off. As you know, Michael, it does take a little time. Had we, for example, started the television production business a few years ago, there would be significant deficits in this startup business. We are able, in today's environment, to start up very successfully this television production business with almost no net cost to us, in either overhead or development, with the variety of shows that we have. So we're very optimistic about where Paramount can go. We do have a large number of franchises. We do have long-term relationships with some of the top talent around, ranging from the recent renewal of Martin Scorsese to Michael Bay to J.J. Abrams, coming off the upcoming release of Star Wars. So just a broad variety of talent, and we believe Paramount will come back and come back strongly in the years to come."

If you look at our advertising revenues, our top 100-or-so advertising clients account for more than 3/4 of our advertising revenues. These are the major marketers in the U.S. So when we talk about having 11 today and tripling them -- and obviously, there's a focus of the biggest even among the 100, it really does turn into a significant portion of our advertising base, and that's what gets us over this 3-year period to having all of these measurement metrics complement the Nielsen part of our business. And we intend to grow that roster of clients from next year into the next -- into the following year. Because we have this leading capability, it is true that there are a lot of other players, new, emerging players, as well as existing ones, who are interested in talking to us about opportunities to work together and driving advertise revenue.

We think there's just a lot of opportunity. Consumers are using multiple services in the course of their lives. They watch television on a big screen. They'll use their tablets. They'll watch on apps. There are new mobile products like Go90 out there. We think there are a lot of opportunities for content owners, both for existing content that we produce for television, and new forms of content. What I did not mention, except touching on it in the opening remarks, is we have an opportunity to create a lot of new short-form and even longer-form content specifically for new platforms. We've announced development for platforms like Snapchat of series that are 10 seconds each. We are going to have a leading mobile video production capability both in L.A. and New York and as well as internationally. But yes, we are willing to look at all models. Of course, it depends on what value we receive in exchange for that. So the model of having both advertising and affiliate revenue is a great model, but an ad-free model can also be good, depending on what monetization you get. And we are getting good monetization when we do SVOD deals. And that whole environment, we look at it as a totality, it's been a growth market for us. Even though content moves from platform to platform, it's been overall a steady growth market. And I believe you will see new players emerge both here in the U.S. and abroad, and that will create even more opportunity for us and our competitors."

And as we are ramping up production, obviously, there's a lot of interest in what we are doing among those distributors as well as others. Also, as I touched on earlier, it's an opportunity for Paramount to produce original programming. For some of those who are generating original programming and in some -- and a lot of this production also creates opportunity internationally. Internationally, you really are seeing significant growth in new distribution platforms, not just SVOD, but just generally mobile, for example. That's creating opportunities for us over the medium and long term that just didn't exist before, and we are working hard to develop that. The other benefit of the increased level of original programming we're creating here in the U.S. is that it is supporting our launch of many new networks internationally. Very often, those networks are being distributed in a TV Everywhere fashion with a lot of multi-platform capability. There are actually a number of countries in the world which, in many respects, are more advanced than the U.S. in that regard. So we are particularly optimistic on the opportunities around the world, and we have stronghold positions in the U.K. and in India, which are both great markets, and a lot of open-field opportunities in Latin America, in Africa, in other parts of Asia as well as Europe. For example, this month, we have 2 launches going on in France. We have My MTV, which is a first time for this product, if you can remember, My Nick Jr. So we have My MTV starting for the first time in France, and you can expect to see that in other markets. And we are also launching BET France this month. So yes, we continue to launch new products and are in discussions with a number of players, and a lot of new players coming through our doors talking about the opportunity to take advantage of our brands and our content."

So as that evolves, and that's a long-term evolution that will take place over the next 3 to 5 years, that will provide, I think, many advertisers and kind of certainly media companies, not only advertising, with an opportunity to get a much more efficient yield and monetization associated with the consumption and viewership around each television show."

Thank you for joining us to discuss Viacom's results for 2015's fourth quarter and full fiscal year. We are seeing real progress as the ecosystem adapts and coalesces around innovative new models, both in distribution and advertising, in the U.S. and around the world. We believe these changes will usher in a new period of prosperity and growth, but also know that success will require a focus on the long-term health and vitality of our business. More than ever, this is a great time to be in the content business, and those with a more long-term view than is currently in vogue will be richly rewarded. 
Viacom continues to take a leadership role in capturing the opportunities that are rapidly taking shape. We are effectively adapting to a digital, on-demand, socially-driven global marketplace, even as we demonstrate quantifiable success in achieving our strategic goals. Importantly, we are also accelerating the critical initiatives that are driving improvement throughout the company.
First, I'll recap our financial performance in the quarter and the year and share some operational and strategic highlights. Tom and Wade will go into greater detail on the results in a moment.
In the fourth quarter, revenues declined 5% to $3.79 billion. Adjusted operating income was $1.06 billion, and adjusted net earnings from continuing operations were $614 million. Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations declined 10% to $1.54 per diluted share. 
For the year, revenues were $13.27 billion, a decline of 4%. Adjusted operating income totaled $3.92 billion, and adjusted net earnings from continuing operations were $2.21 billion. Full year adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 1% to $5.44, which was an all-time record for the company. 
Viacom continued to generate substantial free cash and returned $2.1 billion to shareholders in fiscal 2015 through share repurchases and dividends. As planned, we resumed share repurchases last month at a relatively modest pace thus far, as we focus on growth initiatives while maintaining a strong financial position.
Looking back at the quarter and the full year, Viacom continued to execute on our top strategic priorities: investing in content, especially original content for all technologies; building international scale, capabilities and profitability; and expanding the use of data and technology in advertising, distribution and the viewer experience to derive additional value from our brands.
As I said earlier, our industry has been moving through a period that has challenged established patterns of media consumption and measurement of that consumption. Because of our young audiences and highly focused brands, Viacom experienced the changes early in the cycle and across more of our properties than other media companies. That transition has now taken hold across the industry, creating disruption, but also spurring action and real momentum towards solutions. As the early birds, we see that as platforms expand and opportunities increase, fully measured consumption becomes even stronger. 
In fact, recent research revealed that young people are spending more time consuming media each day than they do sleeping. So apparently, media executives aren't the only ones losing sleep in this modern world. I am pleased to say that at Viacom, we are starting to turn the corner. Once again, in the quarter, the Viacom family of networks was #1 according to Nielsen for people 2-plus, people 18 to 34, people 18 to 49 and people 2 to 49. That's a lot of people. Ratings are improving at key networks like Nickelodeon, Nick at Nite, TV Land, BET, CMT and VH1, with additional improvement expected at our other networks as new programming kicks in. Our investment in data is producing meaningful incremental revenue, and the benefits of digital distribution continue to develop and grow. As other companies now begin their pivot through the transition, many of our Media Networks brands are already beginning to emerge, well positioned to grow and succeed.
Turning to the Media Networks results. Revenues increased 5% to $2.79 billion in the quarter. Affiliate revenues remained strong, up 15% domestically and 10% worldwide in the quarter. For the year, domestic affiliate revenues increased 8% and worldwide revenues were up 5%. We expect continued high single-digit growth in domestic affiliate revenue in fiscal 2016. 
With the renewal of our AT&T agreement at the end of the quarter, we concluded a year in which we successfully renewed affiliate deals covering close to 20% of our distribution. In addition, we closed an unprecedented Hulu deal in September that provides outstanding value for our programming while supporting the vitality of the overall distribution ecosystem.
On the advertising sales front, we delivered sequential improvement in quarterly domestic advertising revenue growth, with a decline of 7%, improved from a 9% decline in Q3. While it is still early in the quarter, we expect continuing improvement in domestic ad sales this quarter, which we expect to accelerate further as our fiscal year progresses. Worldwide, the decline in the fourth quarter was 1%. For the year, worldwide advertising revenues increased 1%. 
Once again, advertising revenue substantially outpaced traditional ratings, as we continue to provide significant value-added offerings to marketing partners. And we continue to deepen our value proposition to partners, offering deep social connections through our Viacom Echo platform. 
A key component of Viacom's next-generation advertising portfolio is Vantage, our bet on sophisticated data that leverages our leadership in analytics and data aggregation for the benefit of marketing partners. It is a proven success and a platform that is in great demand among the largest and most sophisticated advertisers. Currently, we have 11 advertisers using Vantage, leading national advertisers across sectors that include automotive, beverages, consumer goods, financial services and quick-service restaurants. We are in discussions with dozens of additional Fortune 500 partners. Demand is strong and building. We anticipate that we will triple the total number of Vantage deals by next year's upfront, representing a significant portion of our advertising revenue base. Many of our peers are beginning their own data programs. The market is moving rapidly in this direction, led by sophisticated national advertisers. This is good for the ecosystem and will create more demand. 
We are confident that Viacom will remain in the forefront as we continue to evolve and improve our proprietary products.
Our brands remain powerful. Our creative and technical talent is unmatched. And our exclusive relationships cannot be replicated, like the TiVo partnership we announced just last week. In addition, we have in the last few weeks taken a significant ownership stake in DigiTour, the leading live events provider for social media talent, with many partnership opportunities across our brands. We are deeply committed to keeping our leadership in this area and firmly believe that as others catch up, we will already be executing on the next generation of these high-margin, highly sophisticated programs for our marketing partners.
Of course, all of this continued improvement depends on great content, and our Media Networks are delivering more new original programming than ever before for every platform. Nickelodeon is a prime example of the success of this commitment. The network delivered a strong fourth quarter by launching innovative new shows and increasing the volume of high-quality premieres. Throughout the quarter, Nickelodeon had more than 100 new episodes of preschool and kids content, with positive results. PAW Patrol and Blaze and the Monster Machines are preschool hits, with LIVE+3 ratings for premieres exceeding a 10. 
Saturday nights now host 2 new hits: Henry Danger, which was the #1 live action show for kids 2 to 11 in the fourth quarter; and Game Shakers, which has become the #1 live action show in recent weeks. Game Shakers also plays cross-platform, with its Sky Whale game already generating 3 million downloads since its September launch. August marked Nick's highest rated month of the year with kids 2 to 11 and 6 to 11. By September, Nick had taken a strong lead over its nearest competitors and has continued that trend into the current quarter, where Nickelodeon will premiere 140 new episodes and event programs in the Hard 8. 
In digital, the Nick app, Nick Jr. app and Noggin are all expanding their reach. The Nick app has surpassed 20 million installs across iOS, Android, Xbox and Roku, and the Nick Jr. app has surpassed 2 million installs, with kids spending over 100 minutes per week within the app. 
Noggin continues to perform well and will be available on Android and internationally for the first time beginning next week.
VH1 is another success story. With new leadership in place, the network increased total day ratings 6% over the fourth quarter of 2014, driven by a strong Monday lineup. For the quarter, VH1 was the #1 cable network on Monday nights among women 18 to 49 and #3 among all adults 18 to 49, fueled by the Love & Hip Hop franchise. The Season 4 finale of VH1's Love & Hip Hop: Atlanta was the #1 telecast on all televisions for the day among women 18 to 49 and women 18 to 34. The episode was also the #1 cable telecast among adults 18 to 49, delivering a 2.3 rating in that demo and over 3.3 million total viewers. When combined with the evening's 2 encore airings, more than 5.3 million total viewers tuned in for the Season 4 finale. 
In the current quarter, VH1 is continuing to roll, with October prime time ratings up 33%. VH1 owns Monday nights as the #1 non-sports cable network for women 18 to 49. 
BET delivered sequential improvement in ratings growth in the fourth quarter, with the top 2 sitcoms on all basic cable for the key 18 to 49 demo, The Game and Real Husbands of Hollywood. And the network delivered on their all-new reboot of the classic MTV series Punk'd, making it the 3rd highest-rated BET series in the quarter. 
In the first quarter of fiscal 2016, BET is driving even more ratings growth, quickly bringing more quality and more volume to the schedule. The Being Mary Jane Season 3 premiere was Tuesday night's top scripted program on cable this season among adults 18 to 49, and The Westbrooks is already becoming a new reality hit. We are also looking forward to Centric's Soul Train Awards at the end of this month, which is a proven viewership tentpole. And much like the wildly successful BET Experience, the Soul Train Awards continues to build the scale of its weekend-long live event, reinforcing connections with fans and creating unprecedented marketing opportunities for our advertising partners.
At MTV, we've also installed new leadership. Sean Atkins joined us in October. He is an accomplished, versatile media executive, who brings excellent management skills and creative experience across developing -- across development, production and digital products. He has hit the ground running, and we expect to see significant improvement at MTV in fiscal 2016. 
Despite traditional ratings challenges, the MTV brand maintains its prowess and vitality, engaging its young audience in more and deeper ways than ever. The recent Video Music Awards is a great example. The show attracted 10 million viewers on-air and more than 76 million video views across platforms in the first 3 days, including 12 million views on Snapchat. The show generated over 0.5 billion social impressions and also set a new record for tweets during an entertainment program. To kick off our second fiscal quarter, MTV is returning some of its biggest hits and bringing highly anticipated new series to air, including new seasons of Teen Mom OG and Teen Wolf as well as the epic fantasy drama, The Shannara Chronicles. 
Comedy Central also had a quarter of successes that illustrates its continued vibrancy as the home of fresh comedic talent and evermore engaging programming. The network had its most successful Emmy season ever, with 26 nominations and 8 wins, the third-most wins of any network. We couldn't be prouder of their achievements and the validation of the network's position at the center of the comedy zeitgeist. 
Comedy Central remains the destination for the most intriguing comic minds and has consistently pushed the envelope to create programming that drives culture and explodes on digital platforms among its dedicated fans. While traditional ratings softened in the quarter, the network's homegrown hits like Inside Amy Schumer, Broad City, South Park, Drunk History and Tosh.0 continued to drive substantial gains on well-monetized digital platforms, like Hulu and the Comedy Central app. Comedy will see improvement in traditional ratings with upcoming new programs and schedule changes, and will be a big beneficiary as more complete and accurate measurement takes hold.
The network also successfully relaunched The Daily Show in September with new host Trevor Noah. Trevor has exceeded our expectations and has already built an audience that is younger, more digital and more diverse. Over the first 4 weeks, Trevor grew linear viewing among adults 18 to 24 by 20% and men 18 to 24 by 32%. And the program remains the #1 late-night show in all of television with those audiences. In addition, The Daily Show is now averaging 750,000 digital full-episode views per show, over and above the traditional measurement totals. 
Looking to the second fiscal quarter, the Comedy Central pipeline is full, with 10 original series on the schedule, including Idiotsitter, a scripted series starring Charlotte Newhouse and Jillian Bell, a fan favorite from Workaholics as well as a new multi-platform series, Not Safe with Nikki Glaser. 
We are seeing additional improvement across our portfolio. The recently completed Spike series, Ink Master, posted the highest C3 ratings in its history, up 14% from the prior season. And I Love Kellie Pickler got off to a terrific start in CMT last week, posting triple-digit ratings gains for the channel in its time slot.
As we have discussed in the past, we are hyper-focused on building upon our industry-leading footprint outside of the U.S. No other media company can match the breadth of Viacom's international network brands or our broad geographic reach. We intend to push our advantage. In that regard, fiscal 2015 was a landmark year, with the full integration of Channel 5 into our operations and the launch of 21 channels around the world, including 7 in the fourth quarter. 
Also in the quarter, Viacom International Media Networks launched Viacom Play Plex, a global suite of branded mobile apps designed to complement our linear TV channels and allow our distribution partners to deepen and improve the entertainment experience they offer their subscribers, consistent with the TV Everywhere products we offer in the U.S. These apps will be available in all 180 markets we operate in. We believe no other international entertainment company is offering this type of innovation at this scale, serving every major demographic in every major TV market. 
And last month, Viacom International Media Networks held the EMAs, our largest international music tentpole of the year. TV viewership remained strong for the show around the globe, and digital video views exploded by 340% over last year. We also had an impressive 300 million social mentions, and #MTVEMA was the #1 worldwide trending Twitter topic on the night of the show.
At the studio, Paramount delivered one of the top 5 movies of the summer in Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation. Once again, Tom Cruise performed at a superstar level at the box office in the U.S., and particularly overseas, where we drew more than 70% of the sales revenue. 
Paramount's ability to produce and market films is stronger than ever, but we simply did not have enough films in the pipeline this year to take full advantage of our capabilities. In fiscal 2016, we have committed to returning Paramount to a full 15-film slate. In addition, Paramount Animation has a number of exciting projects on tap, including The Little Prince, which the studio will release next March. Paramount's animation team is also currently in production on Monster Trucks, Sherlock Gnomes, SpongeBob SquarePants 3 and Amusement Park. 
With 3 new shows set for early next year, including School of Rock on Nickelodeon, Grease Live on Fox and Vinyl on HBO, Paramount Television continues to expand and demonstrate its creative approach to developing and producing television and entertainment. 
The division is also growing its original programming slate and a distinguished roster of creative partners, most recently announcing a straight-to-series order with Netflix for Thirteen Reasons Why, being executive-produced by Selena Gomez, and an overall television deal with Emmy Award-winning director, Cary Fukunaga. To date, Paramount Television has 10 shows ordered to production and an additional 12 projects set up at networks and major digital outlets.
In closing, we are optimistic about the state of our industry and the significant opportunities Viacom has to benefit from changes in technology, consumption and the growing international marketplace. As we move through 2016, we are committed to: tripling our roster of Vantage clients leading into the 2016 upfront; rolling out more original programming across the company at an unprecedented level in our history; improving the scale and profitability in our International Media Networks group; driving Paramount to significantly improved financial performance in the years ahead by returning the theatrical slate to 15 films per year, together with the continuing build-up of our television production and animation activities. 
2016 will be a significant year, as measurement and monetization come into realignment around sophisticated, data-enhanced programs that we are pioneering. The application of data insights will lead to more and more differentiation in technology-driven advertising. Consumption will continue to expand across all platforms and international markets will present new and exciting opportunities. Of course, the turn is not fully complete. We are all learning more and more every day, but we are confident that the pace of change we have set gives us an important long-term advantage over our competition.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Wade."

Before I take you through our operating results, I want to note that our earnings release and web presentation summarizing the results for our September quarter are available on our website.Now let's take a look at our segment results.",543,"Thanks, Philippe. Before I take you through our operating results, I want to note that our earnings release and web presentation summarizing the results for our September quarter are available on our website.
Now let's take a look at our segment results. At our Media Networks segment, revenues in the quarter were up 5% compared with the prior year. Domestic revenues were up 3%, while international revenues increased 11%. Excluding a 10% unfavorable impact from foreign currency, international revenues were up 21%, primarily due to the acquisition of Channel 5. Page 10 of our web deck provides a breakdown of our Media Networks revenue performance.
In terms of advertising, worldwide advertising revenues declined 1% in the quarter. Domestic revenues were down 7% and international revenues grew 45%. The increase in international advertising revenues was driven by growth in Europe, principally from Channel 5. Foreign exchange losses had a 9 percentage point negative impact on international advertising growth.
In terms of affiliate revenues, worldwide revenues were up 10%. Domestic revenues were up 15% in the quarter, while international revenues declined 14%. The growth in domestic affiliate revenues was due to the timing of product available under certain distribution agreements as well as rate increases. 
Foreign exchange had a 12 percentage point unfavorable impact on the international affiliate revenue growth. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, international affiliate revenue declined as revenue growth from new channel launches and increases in subscribers were more than offset by the timing of product available under certain distribution agreements.
Turning to expenses. Overall expenses increased 12% in the quarter. Within operating expenses, programming expense grew 19%, while distribution and other expenses increased 11%. SG&A expense increased 3% in the quarter. 
Expense growth was driven by the acquisition of Channel 5 as well as higher programming, advertising and promotion expense, primarily related to new original series and specials. 
Media Networks adjusted operating income was down 6% for the quarter, and the adjusted operating income margin was 37%. 
Moving to Filmed Entertainment. Revenues were down 24% in the quarter, principally due to decreases in home entertainment and theatrical revenues. Foreign exchange had a 5 percentage point unfavorable impact on Filmed Entertainment revenue growth. Page 13 of the web presentation provides a breakdown of Filmed Entertainment revenues.
Theatrical revenues declined 20%. Foreign currency had a 9 percentage point unfavorable impact on theatrical revenues. Lower carryover revenues from prior period releases were partially offset by revenues from our current quarter releases, including Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation and Terminator Genisys. 
Home entertainment revenues declined 54%, principally due to the absence of releases in the September quarter of this year, whereas last year, we released Transformers and Noah. 
Ancillary revenues declined by 38%, due primarily to lower consumer product licensing revenues, with last year's September quarter benefiting from the release of Transformers. 
Filmed Entertainment generated adjusted operating income of $122 million in the quarter as compared to $213 million last year. The September quarter of last year benefited from both the theatrical and home entertainment performance of Transformers.
Moving to taxes. The full year adjusted effective tax rate was 31.2%, reflecting a 20 basis point improvement as compared to the prior year.
With that, I would like to turn the call over to Tom."

Let me cover our full year results as well as take -- talk about our cash flow and our debt. I'll also cover seasonal factors impacting the 2016 fiscal year that haven't already been discussed. For the full year, Viacom generated $13.3",825,"Thank you, Wade. Let me cover our full year results as well as take -- talk about our cash flow and our debt. I'll also cover seasonal factors impacting the 2016 fiscal year that haven't already been discussed. 
For the full year, Viacom generated $13.3 billion of revenue, $3.9 billion of adjusted operating income, $2.2 billion of operating free cash flow and $5.44 of adjusted earnings per share. 
That breaks down as follows: Media Networks generated revenue of $10.5 billion, which is an increase of 3% over the prior year. Adjusted operating income of $4.1 billion declined 3% as compared to 2014. Affiliate revenue grew 5% for the year, while advertising revenue increased 1%. And the Media Networks adjusted operating income margin was 39.5%. 
Filmed Entertainment generated revenue of $2.9 billion and adjusted operating income margin of $111 million -- I'm sorry, adjusted operating income of $111 million and an operating income margin of 4%. 
For the total company, foreign currency had an unfavorable impact of 2% on revenue growth, 1% on operating income growth and $0.14 on full year EPS. As I mentioned, we generated $2.2 billion in operating cash flow for the year or $5.50 per share, which is a free cash flow yield of approximately 11%.
In terms of capital return to shareholders, for the full year, we repurchased 21 million Viacom B shares for an aggregate purchase price of $1.5 billion. In July, we also increased our dividend per share by 21% to $0.40 a share. Between our buyback and our dividend programs, we returned a total of $2.1 billion to shareholders in the fiscal year, which is a return on market capitalization of approximately 10%. We ended the year with 50 million Viacom A shares and 348 million Viacom B shares outstanding.
Now moving on to our debt. It remains principally fixed-rate, with an average cost at quarter end of 4.6%. In September, we repaid the $250 million outstanding of our 4.25% senior notes which came due. We also redeemed $550 million of our 6.25% senior notes, which are due in April 2016, leaving $368 million remaining outstanding. 
We ended the quarter with $12.3 billion of total debt and $506 million of cash and cash equivalents. This is an $800 million decrease in gross debt from our June quarter. As previously mentioned, we redeemed $550 million of senior notes to ensure that we stayed within our leverage ratio target. At the end of the quarter, our leverage ratio was 3x.
Now let's turn to some of the factors impacting fiscal 2016. Philippe discussed ad sales and affiliate revenues. For the full year, we expect that Media Networks' programming expense growth rate will be in the mid- to high single digits. In terms of taxes, for 2016, we are forecasting a book tax rate of approximately 32%. We will refine this as we go through the year and get a better sense of the domestic versus international profitability mix.
At Paramount, we're excited about our upcoming slate, which includes Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2 and Star Trek 3. For fiscal 2016, we expect profits to be weighted to the back half of the year, as the studio benefits from their summer releases. For the December quarter, given the softer performance of certain of our theatrical releases, we anticipate difficult bottom line comparisons to the prior year. Looking ahead at the studio's production and development pipeline, Paramount has just wrapped production on Star Trek 3, and they are currently in production on the next Jack Reacher film. Current films in preproduction include: Brad Pitt starring in a romantic thriller set in World War II for director Robert Zemeckis; and a film by award-winning filmmaker Alexander Payne, titled Downsizing. In addition, the studio is in active development on Transformers 5 as well as future installments of the franchise. And the studio extended their first-look production deal with Martin Scorsese.
In summary, we are investing in our brands, and we are building new capabilities to take advantage of the opportunities and meet the challenges as our industry continues to evolve. At Media Networks, we are growing the level of original programming. Six of our top 10 networks are seeing year-over-year ratings growth, and we continue to secure long-term affiliate deals with both traditional and digital distribution partners. At Paramount, we are developing our franchise pipeline of films, and we have made great progress in TV production in a short period of time. 
On the advertising front, we are at the dawn of a new age of data-enhanced marketing. We have invested in technology and in our capabilities, which have enabled us to establish a leading position providing advanced ad sales products and solutions for our marketing partners. It is important to remember, television remains the most compelling vehicle for reaching and influencing consumers, and data-enhanced marketing will only make that more true.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to your questions."

And then for Tom, I just -- I was hoping for some thoughts on free cash flow generation as you look at fiscal '16. When I look at the last 4 to 5 years, your conversion ratio has really bounced around a lot.

Yes, we have always been at the forefront of thinking through how we handle distribution of our content. Remember, we have a vast library of owned content. For many, many years, most of our networks have created original programming. While we have stepped up the level of original programming, this is nothing new for us. So we have successfully, over the last several years, generated a large amount of revenue from this new revenue stream, and we have strategically developed and chosen windows for different types of programming down to specific shows and moved around distribution of some of these shows around the existing major SVOD players in the U.S. And for example, we've seen growth in our presence in Hulu and a diminishment of our presence on Netflix. And that goes both for our networks here at Viacom and Epix. So we think that through. We look at the, not just the monetary value, but the promotional value of having shows at different points in the cycle on SVOD, and it is often useful to have prior seasons as we launch new seasons, as an example. Internationally, SVOD is a driver of growth. When you look at a country like China, which is somewhat limited in the traditional distribution of television product, you are seeing a large number, a larger number than in the U.S., of significant SVOD players. So for the first time, we see China as a potentially significant growth market, not just in the film business for Hollywood but also for us in the television business. And we are seeing rapid expansion of distribution opportunities there and elsewhere as well as increases in pricing as those services grow. So we view, in this arena, as in everywhere else, that technology is our friend, and it is good to be on the content side of the business and we maintain the flexibility on distribution. I just want to touch on TV Everywhere. We also believe it is extremely important to work with our long-term distributors in expanding the television experience for consumers. It is good for the ecosystem, and we are working very closely with them as they invest capital in developing the technology for better TV Everywhere experience, to provide the underlying content and to assist in better consumer interfaces, to assist in greater availability of video-on-demand and work with them on better monetization of video-on-demand viewing, where there's great opportunity for us and distributors in areas such as dynamic ad insertions, just better monetization of all the content that consumers want to watch in the home and outside of the home."

We expect that to continue. We've made some capital investments in terms of incremental working capital, in terms of Paramount, that's to fund the incremental production and expanded production that Philippe and I discussed in our remarks. And in the future, I think we can look forward to that tapering down as we get to the production level that we need to get to for those films. One of the big variables for us that you see in the backup is cash taxes. Cash taxes benefited in 2015 from a very nice benefit associated with our acquisition of Channel 5. That has helped us and certain tax policies. Next year, we won't have the benefit of that Channel 5, so there could be an increase of $300-plus million associated on the tax line. But we're also looking at certain tax legislation that may offset some of that into the future. It's kind of hard to predict that tax line until that tax legislation gets nailed down, but we see the company being able to generate very strong free cash flow well into the future."

We certainly have seen that in a big way with what Universal has done this year, where they are -- they have moved from what was a couple of years ago, lower operating income performance than what Paramount had last year to well over $1 billion in operating income. That's just the nature of the business. Now for a variety of reasons having to do with issues in development, to cast availability and so forth, we just had too few movies to support the infrastructure that we have and really to generate revenues. So we think Paramount will turn around. That's why we are investing in it. We are operating Paramount efficiently. We have growth initiatives in television and animation. That will pay off. As you know, Michael, it does take a little time. Had we, for example, started the television production business a few years ago, there would be significant deficits in this startup business. We are able, in today's environment, to start up very successfully this television production business with almost no net cost to us, in either overhead or development, with the variety of shows that we have. So we're very optimistic about where Paramount can go. We do have a large number of franchises. We do have long-term relationships with some of the top talent around, ranging from the recent renewal of Martin Scorsese to Michael Bay to J.J. Abrams, coming off the upcoming release of Star Wars. So just a broad variety of talent, and we believe Paramount will come back and come back strongly in the years to come."

If you look at our advertising revenues, our top 100-or-so advertising clients account for more than 3/4 of our advertising revenues. These are the major marketers in the U.S. So when we talk about having 11 today and tripling them -- and obviously, there's a focus of the biggest even among the 100, it really does turn into a significant portion of our advertising base, and that's what gets us over this 3-year period to having all of these measurement metrics complement the Nielsen part of our business. And we intend to grow that roster of clients from next year into the next -- into the following year. Because we have this leading capability, it is true that there are a lot of other players, new, emerging players as well as existing ones, who are interested in talking to us about opportunities to work together and driving advertise revenue.

We think there's just a lot of opportunity. Consumers are using multiple services in the course of their lives. They watch television on a big screen. They'll use their tablets. They'll watch on apps. There are new mobile products like Go90 out there. We think there are a lot of opportunities for content owners, both for existing content that we produce for television, and new forms of content. What I did not mention, except touching on it in the opening remarks, is we have an opportunity to create a lot of new short-form and even longer-form content specifically for new platforms. We've announced development for platforms like Snapchat of series that are 10 seconds each. We are going to have a leading mobile video production capability both in L.A. and New York and as well as internationally. But yes, we are willing to look at all models. Of course, it depends on what value we receive in exchange for that. So the model of having both advertising and affiliate revenue is a great model, but an ad-free model can also be good, depending on what monetization you get. And we are getting good monetization when we do SVOD deals. And that whole environment, we look at it as a totality, it's been a growth market for us. Even though content moves from platform to platform, it's been overall a steady growth market. And I believe you will see new players emerge both here in the U.S. and abroad, and that will create even more opportunity for us and our competitors."

And as we are ramping up production, obviously, there's a lot of interest in what we are doing among those distributors as well as others. Also, as I touched on earlier, it's an opportunity for Paramount to produce original programming. For some of those who are generating original programming and in some -- and a lot of this production also creates opportunity internationally. Internationally, you really are seeing significant growth in new distribution platforms, not just SVOD, but just generally mobile, for example. That's creating opportunities for us over the medium and long term that just didn't exist before, and we are working hard to develop that. The other benefit of the increased level of original programming we're creating here in the U.S. is that it is supporting our launch of many new networks internationally. Very often, those networks are being distributed in a TV Everywhere fashion with a lot of multi-platform capability. There are actually a number of countries in the world which, in many respects, are more advanced than the U.S. in that regard. So we are particularly optimistic on the opportunities around the world, and we have stronghold positions in the U.K. and in India, which are both great markets, and a lot of open-field opportunities in Latin America, in Africa, in other parts of Asia as well as Europe. For example, this month, we have 2 launches going on in France. We have My MTV, which is a first time for this product, if you can remember, My Nick Jr. So we have My MTV starting for the first time in France, and you can expect to see that in other markets. And we are also launching BET France this month. So yes, we continue to launch new products and are in discussions with a number of players, and a lot of new players coming through our doors talking about the opportunity to take advantage of our brands and our content."

And then finally, there's game apps and apps like Noggin, which we monetize through subscription revenue or sale revenue. So that is a growing universe. And again, that's not just in a U.S. context but in an international context. And for example, the Play Plex product that our international group is launching will open up multi-platform revenue in different parts of the world, and we are working with affiliates around the world to roll that out. And we've been told by a lot of affiliates that it is the most advanced product in the marketplace and they're very pleased with it."

If you move to the VOD world, where a cable system operator has video on demand and a show is watched, you have the opportunity to really dynamically insert ads to each viewer, which results in a much increased yield in terms of the amount of revenue and monetization of each viewer watching a show. So as that evolves, and that's a long-term evolution that will take place over the next 3 to 5 years, that will provide, I think, many advertisers and kind of certainly media companies, not only advertising, with an opportunity to get a much more efficient yield and monetization associated with the consumption and viewership around each television show."
