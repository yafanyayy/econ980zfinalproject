Happy to be here to discuss the results that we reported today for both the fourth quarter and full year 2014. We are pleased to see both our fourth quarter and full year EPS growth rates at 15% and 14%, r",4076,"Well, thanks, Rick, and good afternoon, everyone. Happy to be here to discuss the results that we reported today for both the fourth quarter and full year 2014. We are pleased to see both our fourth quarter and full year EPS growth rates at 15% and 14%, respectively, within our on average and over time targets. 
This solid performance reflected familiar themes across the entire year: higher spending by our card members, modest acceleration in U.S. loan growth, credit indicators at or near historical lows, strong cost controls and a healthy balance sheet that enabled us to return a substantial amount of capital to shareholders in the form of repurchases over the past year. 
There was some complexity to our results this quarter and year as we took advantage of the Q4 gain on the sale of our investment in Concur Technologies and the Q2 gain on the creation of the Business Travel joint venture to fund incremental initiatives to position the company for the long term. This quarter, these initiatives included a restructuring, incremental investment and growth initiatives and an upfront cost related to the renewal of our relationship with Delta Air Lines.
Given the increasingly competitive environment for co-brand partnerships, we are excited to have extended our relationship with Delta for the long term. More broadly, we believe all of these incremental initiatives will provide flexibility as we deal proactively with a global economic, competitive and regulatory environment that continues to be uncertain and rapidly changing. 
As I begin with the financial summary on Page 2 of the slides, I'll discuss both the quarter and full year results as we believe this helps highlight some of the key performance trends and challenges we face as we enter 2015.
Our reported billings growth was 6% during the fourth quarter but 8% on an FX-adjusted basis as we, like many other global companies, had a significant negative impact on our growth rates this quarter from the strengthening U.S. dollar. 
For the year, we exceeded $1 trillion of spending on our network for the first time, with billed business up 9% versus last year on an FX-adjusted basis. As you can see, we've exited the year slightly below our full year FX-adjusted growth rate as we did see a modest deceleration in billings growth during the fourth quarter. I'll provide more details on our Q4 billings performance in a few minutes, though clearly, the sharp drop in gas prices and soft December retail sales for the industry had an impact on our results.
During the quarter, adjusted for the Concur gain, which is reported in revenue and for the Business Travel revenues in the prior year, adjusted revenue growth was 3% and 5% when you further adjust it for FX. The FX-adjusted growth rate is consistent with our full year performance, although I'd note that the drag from FX on our revenue and earnings increased over the course of 2014 due to the strengthening of the dollar.
Pretax income grew 12% during the quarter and 14% for the year, in part benefiting from our continued disciplined control of operating expenses. Net income grew more slowly at 11% for the quarter and 10% for the year. We have seen a higher tax rate throughout the course of the year. And the tax rate in the fourth quarter of 35% was a bit above the full year level and above what we might expect going forward.
Helping us again this year has been our share repurchase activity. Over the last 4 quarters, we have repurchased $4.4 billion of common shares, which has reduced our average shares outstanding by 4% versus the prior year. Add it all up and during 2014, we delivered fourth quarter EPS of $1.39 and full year EPS of $5.56, which were up 15% and 14%, respectively, versus the prior year and were within our on average and over time target. We were able to generate these earnings with revenue growth that was solid, given the uncertain global economic environment, disciplined expense control and the benefits of our strong capital position. These results also brought our return on equity for the period ending December 31 to 29%, well above our on average and over time target of 25%.
Let's now move on to a detailed review of our Q4 results, beginning with the impact of the Concur gain and related incremental initiatives. As you'll recall, we entered into an operating agreement and made a strategic investment in Concur back in 2008. The partnership has created significant value for both our customers and shareholders. 
During December, SAP acquired 100% of Concur, including our entire investment, triggering a pretax gain of $719 million, in line with our previous estimates. Going forward, our operating agreements with Concur are continuing, and we look forward to a continuing partnership with both SAP and Concur. 
In the quarter, consistent with our previously announced expectations, we took advantage of the gain to fund initiatives that included a restructuring and upfront cost related to our decision to accelerate the renewal of our relationship with Delta and incremental investments in growth initiatives. Given the rapid changes in our industry and the sizable set of economically attractive growth opportunities that our company has, we believe that this was the right long-term decisions for shareholders.
Starting with the restructuring charge. The actions we are taking will impact over 4,000 people at a cost of $313 million in the quarter. Total employee headcount will decline by a smaller amount, as certain of those reductions will be partially offset by jobs created elsewhere in the company. 
The actions we are taking largely represent a continuation of our strategy to further increase the overall efficiency of our organization. Our business and industry continue to be transformed by technology, which is increasingly becoming more powerful and less expensive. Technology is also changing the way our merchants and card members want to interact with us and has created new channels of communication that have increased overall card member satisfaction. 
As a result of these changes, we have the need and the opportunity to continuously evolve our organization and cost structure, giving us the ability to maintain tight control of operating expenses while still investing for growth.
We also used a portion of the Concur gain in conjunction with the renewal of our relationship with Delta Air Lines. We are excited about the new agreement with Delta, particularly given the increasingly competitive environment for co-brands. We decided to accelerate the Delta renewal as we saw an attractive opportunity to extend the long-term relationship with a key partner. 
Our new agreement and an upfront cost of approximately $109 million in Q4 related to the new contract terms around Membership Rewards, including a small impact related to a previously announced cap on point transfers into Delta's Sky Miles for Membership Rewards. This cap was removed as part of our new agreement, which we believe is good news for our card members. As a reminder, we took a similar upfront charge back in 2008 when we last renewed our partnership with Delta.
More generally, often, when long term co-brand partnerships are renewed, the new agreement will reflect shifts in market economics that have evolved over many years. All things being equal, our renewed co-branded agreement will often provide us with lower economics initially than the prior agreement and what we structured to incent growth and generate additional revenues for both parties over time. 
The magnitude of this reset can be significant, depending on the size of each partnership. Our agreement with Delta is no exception to these market realities. All told, we feel very positive about the potential of the renewed relationship to generate benefits over the longer term. However, when we think about our near-term outlook, we will need to take into account the impact of the new agreement.
Looking at the entire landscape for co-brand products, while the competitive environment has become more intense, we continue to see attractive opportunities. We've been very disciplined and selective in the partners we work with and have focused on the relationships that can offer the best value, the best growth potential and the best returns over time. 
In this context, we were also pleased to recently renew our long-term relationship with Starwood. As with Delta, we believe that this relationship provides attractive value for card members and opportunities for growth going forward.
Coming back now to how we leverage the Concur gain during the quarter on Slide 3. You see that we also made incremental investments in the diverse set of growth opportunities within our company. These investments were primarily, though not entirely, in marketing and promotion and were focused and acquisition activities across the strong suite of products we offer to consumers, small businesses and corporations around the world. 
I'd remind you that while co-brands are 1 important component of our business model, we believe that the greater breadth and global nature of our product set provide a significant competitive advantage.
Going to the numbers, while there is some subjectivity in determining the level of incremental investments that we made as a result of the Concur gain, it was a significant amount in the quarter, leaving a net gain from Concur of approximately $0.05 to $0.06. Thinking about our overall results, put in other way clearly have a negative foreign exchange impact from the strengthening U.S. dollar as well as a slightly higher tax rate in the quarter.
Let's turn now to a more detailed view, quarterly performance metrics, starting with billed business on Slide 4. During the fourth quarter, billed business growth slowed sequentially from 9% to 6% on a reported basis. The decline was impacted by the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar as FX-adjusted billings grew by 8% during the fourth quarter. 
Looking at the results by segment, you can see the growth in our U.S. consumer and small business segments slowed sequentially from 9% to 8% in Q4. This sequential decline was influenced by the large drop in gas prices and relatively soft retail sales industry-wide during the month of December. 
GNS continues to be our strongest performing segment, with FX-adjusted growth of 15% during the quarter. And while FX-adjusted growth and ICS slowed to 3% during the quarter, we saw very different performance trends by region, as you can see by moving to Slide 5. 
Here you can see the billings in our LACC region dropped more significantly during the fourth quarter due to a decline in spend at Costco Canada. While American Express cards were still accepted at Costco warehouses throughout Canada during the quarter, we began to see buildings decline after card acceptance was expanded to include other networks on October 1. I would remind you that beginning January 1, 2015, American Express cards were no longer accepted in Costco warehouses in Canada, which we expect will drive billings growth lower during 2015.
In contrast to the LACC experience, we saw continued improvement in our EMEA billings, which showed their strongest FX-adjusted growth since Q2 '11. The increase was driven primarily by strong performance in the U.K. and improved growth in Germany. All of these results outside the U.S. were impacted by foreign exchange movements, which is why we've added Slide 6 this quarter, which is a slide that shows our reported and FX-adjusted revenue growth rates for the last 8 quarters. 
As you can see, during the fourth quarter, foreign exchange had a more significant negative impact on our reported results than in prior periods, dragging adjusted revenue growth by approximately 240 basis points. To give you a better sense of the drivers here, we have also provided some background on the major concentrations of our billed business by international currency. 
The first row at the bottom of the chart shows the approximate range of billed business by card members in each market as a percentage of total company billed business, while the second row shows the year-over-year change in that foreign currency compared to the U.S. dollar. 
When you look at this slide, it is somewhat unusual that the dollar has strengthened significantly against nearly all of the international currencies where we generate a significant amount of revenue. As you know, this revenue impact is partially offset by the benefit we received from having certain expenses denominated in international currencies. 
There is a bottom line impact, especially when rates move this dramatically. As you can see in our annual report, we estimate that a 10% strengthening of the dollar against all international currencies in which we do business would cost approximately $200 million in pretax income over a 1-year period. 
So clearly, as I mentioned earlier, it was a negative impact to our bottom line [indiscernible] Over the long term, we continue to believe that being a global company, which generates revenue in a diverse set of markets around the world, is a significant benefit of our business model. However, as current trends do continue, FX rates will represent a headwind as we head into 2015.
Moving on now to loan growth on Slide 7. Loan growth was up 5% versus last year on a reported basis. We were obviously pleased though by our performance in the U.S., which constitutes the majority of our loans, as growth improved to 7% during Q4 and continues to outpace the industry. I'd note that international loan growth was down year-over-year as performance was negatively impacted by FX and also by a decline in loans within the Costco Canada co-brand portfolio.
Looking forward, we continue to believe that there are attractive opportunities to gaining greater share of loans from both our existing and new customers without significantly changing the overall risk profile of the company. Our efforts here are not about a transformational shift away from our spend-centric model but still do represent a sizable growth opportunity for our company.
So let's move now to our revenue performance on Slide 8, where you see that our reported revenue growth in Q4 was 7%. Adjusted, however, for the Concur gain, the loss of business revenues in the prior year and FX, adjusted revenue growth was 5%, which was consistent with our full year performance. 
I'd note that the Concur gain is reported in other revenue, which drove the large year-over-year increase in that line. The largest contribution to adjusted revenue growth again came greater discount revenue from higher billed business volumes. 
As we saw last quarter, there was a roughly 400 basis point gap between billed business growth and discount revenue growth. The first driver of this difference is the reported discount rate, which was down 3 basis points versus the prior year. As a reminder, we provide this reported discount rate calculation to give you some context about our pricing and point-of-sale with merchants.
This quarter's decline reflects in part our ongoing mix shift in volumes towards lower discount rate industries, though this impact was partially offset in the current quarter by the drop in Costco Canada merchant Russian volume, where we earned a lower discount rate. This quarter's discount rate was also impacted by the timing of certain merchant contract signings. 
The quarter's discount rate also reflects a modest but growing impact related to the OptBlue program, as merchant acquirers are actively signing new merchants on to the American Express network. We are encouraged by our progress in this multiyear effort. It does result in some incremental pressure on the reported discount rate as we have previously discussed. But I would remind you that a portion of this decline is offset through reduced operating expenses as OptBlue shifts the impact of certain third-party acquisition activities from operating expenses to discount revenue. We continue to believe that OptBlue will bring incremental volumes on to our network over the next several years and provide attractive economics for our business.
Coming back now to the broader relationship between discount revenue and billed business. Similar to last quarter, the other drivers of the gap between the 2 are the faster growth we are seeing in both counter [ph] revenue items such as cash incentives and GNS volumes. 
I would point out here that the relationship between discount revenue and billed business has become more complicated over time, partially due to the impact related to OptBlue I just mentioned. And so interpreting our discount rate metric in isolation has become more complex as our business has evolved.
Now turning to the other revenue line, net interest income was the other primary driver of revenue growth, growing 8% as we continue to benefit year-over-year from both lower funding costs and an increase in average loan balances. Finally, as expected, travel commissions and fees declined significantly this quarter as the revenues associated with Business Travel were no longer consolidated in our P&L.
Turning now to credit performance on Slide 9. You can see that our lending credit metrics remain near or at historically low levels. Worldwide lending rates and delinquency rates declined slightly during the quarter, though overall, the rate of improvement in these metrics has slowed in the past year. As a reminder, our objective is not necessarily to have the lowest possible write-off rate but is instead to achieve profitable growth and are in the best economics on our portfolio. Therefore, we are not planning to change the overall risk profile of the company. At some point, we would expect that write-off rates will increase somewhat from today's low levels.
In terms of lending reserve coverage levels like [indiscernible] shows the coverage remains relatively consistent after considering the impact of the seasonal ramp-up in loan balances on the months coverage metric. We believe coverage levels remain appropriate, given the risk level inherent in the portfolio. 
Putting together our solid loan growth with these credit metrics, you can see on Slide 11 the total provision in Q4 increased significantly versus the last year and the prior quarter. Although credit metrics remain low and write-offs remain a bit below the prior year, the rate of improvement has slowed. This trend, along with the growth and seasonal uptick in loan balances and some smaller specific reserve builds, are what drove the provision up 22% this quarter.
Moving next to total expenses on Slide 12. On a reported basis, expenses increased by 3% versus the prior year and Q4 and were flat for the full year, reflecting the decision to reinvest the majority of the Concur gain in Q4 and the GVT gain in Q2, partially offset by the loss of our Business Travel expenses in the prior year. I'll provide more details on our marketing and promotion and operating expenses in a few minutes, but touch first, however, on a few other items on Slide 12. 
Rewards expense grew by 10% in Q4, in part due to the $109 million impact from our renewed agreement with Delta. On a full year basis, rewards expense growth of 7% was relatively consistent with our reported proprietary billings growth. 
Also on Slide 12, the tax rate in the quarter was 35%, slightly above what we have seen in the past couple of quarters as it was impacted by the resolution of certain prior year items. Prior to this quarter, we had been trending in a tax rate of approximately 34%. And while in any given quarter, discrete items could impact the effective rate, we generally think 34% is more indicative of our underlying run rate.
Moving to marketing and promotion expenses on Slide 13. As I discussed, the 2 sizable gains we recognized in 2014 allowed us to invest in a number of attractive growth opportunities, and we believe this is the right decision to create value for shareholders. As a result, marketing and promotion expenses, where the majority of our incremental investments and growth initiatives were recorded, increased sequentially and grew 13% versus Q4 '13 and 9% on a full year basis. 
For the year, much of this spending focused on acquiring card members across our diverse set of card portfolios. These initiatives included acquisition efforts for our proprietary charge of lending products as well as opportunities in the co-brand space. Additionally, we were focused on expanding our merchant network, capturing a greater share of our card members lending, building out our GNS business and growing our newer digital businesses. 
One example of how we build relationship from small businesses across both our merchant network and our card member base was our support this past quarter of the Small Business Saturday. This initiative now takes place across 6 countries and is a great example of how our closed loop enables us to partner and provide value to both our small business merchants and our existing card member base.
Turning now to operating expense performance for Q4 on Slide 14. Our reported results continue to reflect the impact of Business Travel operations in the prior year across a number of expense categories, complicating line-by-line comparisons. 
Additionally, the impact of our restructuring charge this quarter had a substantial impact on salaries and benefits. That said, adjusting for last year's GVT operations and this year's restructuring charge, operating expenses decreased 1% in the quarter on a reported basis and increased by 1% when adjusting for FX. 
Turning to the full year. Our adjusted operating expense growth remains well contained and came in well below our 3% growth target for the year as you can see on Slide 15. We continue to demonstrate disciplined control of our operating expenses and this marked the second consecutive year that operating expense growth was significantly below the growth target that we set on our fourth quarter 2012 earnings call.
This discipline around operating expenses allowed us to continue investing for growth and provide an increased financial flexibility in an economy that remains uncertain. As we look ahead, the restructuring actions that we are taking our one part of what will allow us to remain disciplined about operating expense growth. 
Now shifting our focus towards capital. On Slide 16, the benefits of our strong capital position were on display all year, as we returned 86% of the capital generated in the year while modestly strengthening our already strong capital ratios. 
As is usual, you do see our capital ratios decline slightly sequentially during the fourth quarter due to the seasonal increase in our loan and receivable balances. A portion of the year-over-year increase in our Tier 1 capital ratio was driven by the preferred issuance we executed during the fourth quarter. And we plan to follow this with another issuance in Q1. As I discussed on the last earnings call, these issuances represent the most cost-effective way to meet our evolving capital requirements and were part of the capital plan in our 2014 CCAR [indiscernible].
Now we did, of course, complete our submission for the 2015 CCAR process earlier this month. And we expect to hear back from the Fed about our submission in March. We continue to believe that our ability to return a high level of capital to our shareholders over the past several years while continuing to increase our capital ratios illustrates the strength of both our balance sheet and our business model.
We've also worked hard to satisfy the quantitative and qualitative aspects of guidelines and continue to strengthen aspects of our capital planning processes to support this critical effort.
So coming back to our full year results. We are pleased with our performance in the current economic competitive environment. For the full year, we have per share growth of 14%, which is within our on average and over time target, while leveraging the gains provided by the Business Travel joint venture in the sale of our investment in Concur to better position the company for the future. 
Looking forward to 2015, we do face a number of increasing challenges, including global economic growth that is forecast to remain below long-term averages; foreign exchange headwinds from a strengthening U.S. dollar; intense competition in the co-brand space; and a heightened regulatory environment, particularly in the EU. Of course, many of these issues are not new. And we face these challenges from a strong position, with many growth opportunities and assets that will give us a competitive advantage. We remain confident that our business model provides the opportunity to deliver significant value to our shareholders over the longer term.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Rick for some details on our Q&A session."

Costco is a very important and long-term partner of ours. Our U.S. relationship goes back to the 90s as we think we've been great partners and have created a lot of value for their members, our card members and for both companies. Now I would point out to you that I don't think we said anything, any ongoing discussions we're having with Costco. Obviously with very important partners, we are always working every day to evolve the relationship to make it better and in fact, to make sure it's working for both parties that you can presume we're doing that with Costco as we're doing it with all of our partners at any time. And if and when we have any news, as we did with Delta, which we chose to really, we would certainly tell you. In terms of the economics of these things, you've certainly heard a number of us, both Ken and I are colleagues talk about the competitive environment for co-brands in recent months and quarters and that's true. I think you have to balance those comments with the fact that these are still one of many good economic growth opportunities we have as a company. And while yes, the environment has become competitive and well certainly, there are cases where we conclude because we're pretty selective, that we think we're better off not either getting into or proceeding with certain kinds of co-brand partnerships because we have so many other opportunities in our proprietary business. As a general matter, these still are attractive and important parts of our overall business model. And when we have great partners where our interest are really aligned, and I'll go back to the recent renewals with Delta and Starwood, we think we can create great value together and for all parties involved."

And if you look at the quarter, it was probably down around 10%. So though there's some impact on our overall billings, it's fairly modest. I think given the size of that in the context of our company, it's probably premature or early for us to try to say whether or not there is an offset as consumers and companies take the savings they're and spend elsewhere. probably just be hard for us to see given the magnitude of our overall network versus what the spend on gas is. On, we've been really pleased since we rolled the plan out early last year, with the great acceptance it's gotten in the merchant acquirer world. We've been very pleased with the progress of those acquires and then signing up new merchants. I would just remind people that as we laid out the plan early last year, this is a multiyear effort. And we are proceeding really nicely and are right on track to make very significant strides in merchant coverage over the next couple of years. There are some process, you have to expand the coverage, and you have to create awareness with card members. And that's why we've always talked about this is a multiyear effort. We're really pleased by all the early signs on, but it's not something that in the fourth quarter, I would've expected to have a particularly material impact on the overall billings."

And what we are seeing in writeoffs and delinquencies, there's really no sign of a tick upwards.

With the provision this quarter, there's really and I said 3 things going on. Number one, remember, we're growing loans 7%. You also just have a seasonal phenomenon because these balances always go up in the December quarter, and we do just the way it rules work, we do set the reserves up for those balances. And often the pattern would be that a little bit of that roll off as you get into beginning of next year. We also just had a few specific reserve items, which come and go so it's not [indiscernible] indicative of the future going forward. And we are, relative to where we were say 1 year ago, 2 years ago, at a point where we're not further improving the metrics much. They're fairly flat although they are -- have improved a little bit. So surely, those phenomenon that drove this quarter was a sizable increase in provision, the 22% increase in provision. But I think I'd be cautious about concluding from that, that all else being equal, without other changes in the environment, that you should expect a big jump off in provision next year. We'll have to see how the economy develops. We'll have to see how our metrics develop. But certainly, we don't see in our metrics any sign of a weakening consumer credit environment.

We have built, over the past 12 months, capital even though we've returned a very significant amount of capital to shareholders. We have issued this preferred.

Often, these partnerships only get renewed every quite a number of years. These are not exactly annual renewals. So when normal market economics have evolved for quite a number of years, when you renewed a contract, you can sometimes have a significant reset.

In fact, I talked to my earlier remarks about strong growth in a number of European countries, including Germany. And one of the factors helping us in Germany are some of the synergies we're beginning to see between our core card business and Loyalty Partner. On small business lending, we obviously have a tremendous franchise with small businesses. And we were certainly the first to create an organization within company extremely focused on just to how do help drive success for our small business partners. And it's given us a tremendous position in the marketplace. Small Business Saturday has been a tremendous add to the overall range of the things we do with small business partners and growing our lending efforts in small business, we would see as one of the many opportunities we have do a little bit more lending than you have seen us do the last few years. Now I want to emphasize here that we're a long, long ways from doing anything that changes our spend-centric focus. On the other hand, with our existing customer base, within our existing risk profile, with your example, small business is a really good example, we think we are really well positioned to accelerate growth rate from where we are today, and we're very focused on doing that."

And I said on earlier remarks, Delta is no exception. You do see the one piece of the economics in the charges we took in Q4. And that is that there is an impact COGS to reprice the bank of MR point so that basically tells you we're going to pay Delta a little bit more money when a Membership Rewards member transfers MR points to redeem a flight on Delta. That's actually very similar to something we did back in 2008.  In fact, the charge is almost the same size. It's something that we took back in 2008. So that's not new.

Happy to be here to discuss the results that we reported today for both the fourth quarter and full year 2014. We are pleased to see both our fourth quarter and full year EPS growth rates at 15% and 14%, r",4082,"Well, thanks, Rick, and good afternoon, everyone. Happy to be here to discuss the results that we reported today for both the fourth quarter and full year 2014. We are pleased to see both our fourth quarter and full year EPS growth rates at 15% and 14%, respectively, within our on average and over time targets.
This solid performance reflected familiar themes across the entire year: higher spending by our card members, modest acceleration in U.S. loan growth, credit indicators at or near historical lows, strong cost controls and a healthy balance sheet that enabled us to return a substantial amount of capital to shareholders in the form of repurchases over the past year.
There was some complexity to our results this quarter and year as we took advantage of the Q4 gain on the sale of our investment in Concur Technologies and the Q2 gain on the creation of the Business Travel joint venture to fund incremental initiatives to position the company for the long term. This quarter, these initiatives included a restructuring, incremental investments in growth initiatives and an upfront cost related to the renewal of our relationship with Delta Air Lines.
Given the increasingly competitive environment for co-brand partnerships, we are excited to have extended our relationship with Delta for the long term. More broadly, we believe all of these incremental initiatives will provide flexibility as we deal proactively with a global economic, competitive and regulatory environment that continues to be uncertain and rapidly changing.
As I begin with the financial summary on Page 2 of the slides, I'll discuss both the quarter and full year results as we believe this helps highlight some of the key performance trends and challenges we face as we enter 2015.
Our reported billings growth was 6% during the fourth quarter but 8% on an FX-adjusted basis, as we, like many other global companies, had a significant negative impact on our growth rates this quarter from the strengthening U.S. dollar.
For the year, we exceeded $1 trillion of spending on our network for the first time, with billed business up 9% versus last year on an FX-adjusted basis. As you can see, we exited the year slightly below our full year FX-adjusted growth rate as we did see a modest deceleration in billings growth during the fourth quarter. I'll provide more details on our Q4 billings performance in a few minutes, though clearly, the sharp drop in gas prices and soft December retail sales for the industry had an impact on our results.
During the quarter, adjusted for the Concur gain, which is reported in revenue and for the Business Travel revenues in the prior year, adjusted revenue growth was 3% and 5% when you further adjust for FX. The FX-adjusted growth rate is consistent with our full year performance, although I'd note that the drag from FX on our revenue and earnings increased over the course of 2014 due to the strengthening of the dollar.
Pretax income grew 12% during the quarter and 14% for the year, in part benefiting from our continued disciplined control of operating expenses. Net income grew more slowly at 11% for the quarter and 10% for the year. We have seen a higher tax rate throughout the course of the year. And the tax rate in the fourth quarter of 35% was a bit above the full year level and above what we might expect going forward.
Helping us again this year has been our share repurchase activity. Over the last 4 quarters, we have repurchased $4.4 billion in common shares, which has reduced our average shares outstanding by 4% versus the prior year. Add it all up and during 2014, we delivered fourth quarter EPS of $1.39 and full year EPS of $5.56, which were up 15% and 14%, respectively, versus the prior year and were within our on average and over time target. We were able to generate these earnings with revenue growth that was solid given the uncertain global economic environment, disciplined expense control and the benefits of our strong capital position. These results also brought our return on equity for the period ending December 31 to 29%, well above our on average and over time target of 25%.
Let's now move on to a detailed review of our Q4 results, beginning with the impact of the Concur gain and related incremental initiatives. As you'll recall, we entered into an operating agreement and made a strategic investment in Concur back in 2008. The partnership has created significant value for both our customers and shareholders.
During December, SAP acquired 100% of Concur, including our entire investment, triggering a pretax gain of $719 million, in line with our previous estimates. Going forward, our operating agreements with Concur are continuing, and we look forward to a continuing partnership with both SAP and Concur.
In the quarter, consistent with our previously announced expectations, we took advantage of the gain to fund initiatives that included a restructuring and upfront cost related to our decision to accelerate the renewal of our relationship with Delta and incremental investments in growth initiatives. Given the rapid changes in our industry and the sizable set of economically attractive growth opportunities that our company has, we believe that these were the right long-term decisions for shareholders.
Starting with the restructuring charge. The actions we are taking will impact over 4,000 people at a cost of $313 million in the quarter. Total employee headcount will decline by a smaller amount as certain of those reductions will be partially offset by jobs created elsewhere in the company.
The actions we are taking largely represent a continuation of our strategy to further increase the overall efficiency of our organization. Our business and industry continue to be transformed by technology, which is increasingly becoming more powerful and less expensive. Technology is also changing the way our merchants and card members want to interact with us and has created new channels of communication that have increased overall card member satisfaction.
As a result of these changes, we have the need and the opportunity to continuously evolve our organization and cost structure, giving us the ability to maintain tight control of operating expenses while still investing for growth.
We also used a portion of the Concur gain in conjunction with the renewal of our relationship with Delta Air Lines. We are excited about the new agreement with Delta, particularly given the increasingly competitive environment for co-brands. We decided to accelerate the Delta renewal as we saw an attractive opportunity to extend the long-term relationship with a key partner.
Our new agreement had an upfront cost of approximately $109 million in Q4 related to the new contract terms around Membership Rewards, including a small impact related to a previously announced cap on point transfers into Delta SkyMiles from Membership Rewards. This cap was removed as part of our new agreement, which we believe is good news for our card members. As a reminder, we took a similar upfront charge back in 2008 when we last renewed our partnership with Delta.
More generally, often, when long term co-brand partnerships are renewed, the new agreement will reflect shifts in market economics that have evolved over many years. All things being equal, a renewed co-branded agreement will often provide us with lower economics initially than the prior agreement and will be structured to incent growth and generate additional revenues for both parties over time. The magnitude of this reset can be significant depending on the size of each partnership. Our agreement with Delta is no exception to this market reality. All told, we feel very positive about the potential of the renewed relationship to generate benefits over the longer term. However, when we think about our near-term outlook, we will need to take into account the impact of the new agreement.
Looking at the entire landscape for co-brand products, while the competitive environment has become more intense, we continue to see attractive opportunities. We've been very disciplined and selective in the partners we work with and have focused on the relationships that can offer the best value, the best growth potential and the best returns over time. In this context, we were also pleased to recently renew our long-term relationship with Starwood. As with Delta, we believe that this relationship provides attractive value for card members and opportunities for growth going forward.
Coming back now to how we leveraged the Concur gain during the quarter on Slide 3. You see that we also made incremental investments in the diverse set of growth opportunities within our company. These investments were primarily, though not entirely, in marketing and promotion and were focused on acquisition activities across the strong suite of products we offer to consumers, small businesses and corporations around the world. I'd remind you that while co-brands are one important component of our business model, we believe that the greater breadth and global nature of our product set provide a significant competitive advantage.
Going to the numbers, while there is some subjectivity in determining the level of incremental investments that we made as a result of the Concur gain, it was a significant amount in the quarter, leaving a net gain from Concur of approximately $0.05 to $0.06. Thinking about our overall results, put it another way, we did clearly have a negative foreign exchange impact from the strengthening U.S. dollar, as well as a slightly higher tax rate in the quarter.
Let's turn now to a more detailed view of quarterly performance metrics, starting with billed business on Slide 4. During the fourth quarter, billed business growth slowed sequentially from 9% to 6% on a reported basis. The decline was impacted by the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar as FX-adjusted billings grew by 8% during the fourth quarter.
Looking at the results by segment, you can see that growth in our U.S. consumer and small business segments slowed sequentially from 9% to 8% in Q4. The sequential decline was influenced by the large drop in gas prices and relatively soft retail sales industry-wide during the month of December.
GNS continues to be our strongest performing segment, with FX-adjusted growth of 15% during the quarter. And while FX-adjusted growth in ICS slowed to 3% during the quarter, we saw very different performance trends by region, as you can see by moving to Slide 5.
Here, you can see the billings in our LACC region dropped more significantly during the fourth quarter due to a decline in spend at Costco Canada. While American Express cards were still accepted at Costco warehouses throughout Canada during the quarter, we began to see billings decline after card acceptance was expanded to include other networks on October 1. I would remind you that beginning January 1, 2015, American Express cards were no longer accepted in Costco warehouses in Canada, which we expect will drive billings growth lower during 2015.
In contrast to the LACC experience, we saw continued improvement in our EMEA billings, which showed their strongest FX-adjusted growth since Q2 '11. The increase was driven primarily by strong performance in the U.K. and improved growth in Germany. All of these results outside the U.S. were impacted by foreign exchange movements, which is why we've added Slide 6 this quarter, which is a slide that shows our reported and FX-adjusted revenue growth rates for the last 8 quarters.
As you can see, during the fourth quarter, foreign exchange had a more significant negative impact on our reported results than in prior periods, dragging adjusted revenue growth by approximately 240 basis points. To give you a better sense of the drivers here, we have also provided some background on the major concentrations of our billed business by international currency.
The first row at the bottom of the chart shows the approximate range of billed business by card members in each market as a percentage of total company billed business, while the second row shows the year-over-year change in that foreign currency compared to the U.S. dollar.
When you look at the slide, it is somewhat unusual that the dollar has strengthened significantly against nearly all of the international currencies where we generate a significant amount of revenue. As you know, this revenue impact is partially offset by the benefit we receive from having certain expenses denominated in international currencies. But there is a bottom line impact, especially when rates move this dramatically. As you can see in our annual report, we estimate that a 10% strengthening of the dollar against all international currencies in which we do business would cost approximately $200 million in pretax income over a 1-year period.
So clearly, as I mentioned earlier, it was a negative impact to our bottom line in the quarter. Over the long term, we continue to believe that being a global company, which generates revenue in a diverse set of markets around the world, is a significant benefit of our business model. However, if current trends do continue, FX rates will represent a headwind as we head into 2015.
Moving on now to loan growth on Slide 7. Loan growth was up 5% versus last year on a reported basis. We were obviously pleased though by our performance in the U.S., which constitutes the majority of our loans, as growth improved to 7% during Q4 and continues to outpace the industry. I'd note that international loan growth was down year-over-year as performance was negatively impacted by FX rates and also by a decline in loans within the Costco Canada co-brand portfolio.
Looking forward, we continue to believe that there are attractive opportunities to gain a greater share of loans from both our existing and new customers without significantly changing the overall risk profile of the company. Our efforts here are not about a transformational shift away from our spend-centric model, but still do represent a sizable growth opportunity for our company.
So let's move now to our revenue performance on Slide 8, where you see that our reported revenue growth in Q4 was 7%. Adjusted, however, for the Concur gain, the loss of Business Travel revenues in the prior year and FX, adjusted revenue growth was 5%, which was consistent with our full year performance.
I'd note that the Concur gain is reported in other revenue, which drove the large year-over-year increase in that line. The largest contribution to adjusted revenue growth again came from greater discount revenue from higher billed business volumes.
As we saw last quarter, there was a roughly 400-basis-point gap between billed business growth and discount revenue growth. The first driver of this difference is the reported discount rate, which was down 3 basis points versus the prior year. As a reminder, we provide this reported discount rate calculation to give you some context about our pricing in point-of-sale with merchants.
This quarter's decline reflects in part our ongoing mix shift in volumes towards lower discount rate industries, though this impact was partially offset in the current quarter by the drop in Costco Canada merchant volume, where we earn a lower discount rate. This quarter's discount rate was also impacted by the timing of certain merchant contract signings.
The quarter's discount rate also reflects a modest but growing impact related to the OptBlue program, as merchant acquirers are actively signing new merchants onto the American Express network. We are encouraged by our progress in this multiyear effort. It does result in some incremental pressure on the reported discount rate as we have previously discussed, but I would remind you that a portion of this decline is offset through reduced operating expenses as OptBlue shifts the impact of certain third-party acquisition activities from operating expenses to discount revenue. We continue to believe that OptBlue will bring incremental volumes onto our network over the next several years and provide attractive economics for our business.
Coming back now to the broader relationship between discount revenue and billed business. Similar to last quarter, the other drivers of the gap between the 2 are the faster growth we are seeing in both contra-revenue items such as cash incentives and GNS volumes.
I would point out here that the relationship between discount revenue and billed business has become more complicated over time, partially due to the impact related to OptBlue I just mentioned, and so interpreting our discount rate metric in isolation has become more complex as our business has evolved.
Now turning to the other revenue line. Net interest income was the other primary driver of revenue growth, growing 8% as we continued to benefit year-over-year from both lower funding costs and an increase in average loan balances. Finally, as expected, travel commissions and fees declined significantly this quarter as the revenues associated with Business Travel were no longer consolidated in our P&L.
Turning now to credit performance on Slide 9. You can see that our lending credit metrics remain near or at historically low levels. Worldwide lending write-off rates and delinquency rates declined slightly during the quarter, though overall, the rate of improvement in these metrics has slowed in the past year. As a reminder, our objective is not necessarily to have the lowest possible write-off rate but is instead to achieve profitable growth and to earn the best economics on our portfolio. Therefore, while we are not planning to change the overall risk profile of the company, at some point, we would expect that write-off rates will increase somewhat from today's low levels.
In terms of lending reserve coverage levels, Slide 10 shows that coverage remained relatively consistent. After considering the impact of the seasonal ramp-up in loan balances on the months coverage metric, we believe coverage levels remain appropriate given the risk level inherent in the portfolio.
Putting together our solid loan growth with these credit metrics, you can see on Slide 11 that total provision in Q4 increased significantly versus both last year and the prior quarter. Although credit metrics remain low and write-offs remain a bit below the prior year, the rate of improvement has slowed. This trend, along with the growth and seasonal uptick in loan balances and some smaller specific reserve builds, are what drove the provision up 22% this quarter.
Moving next to total expenses on Slide 12. On a reported basis, expenses increased by 3% versus the prior year in Q4 and were flat for the full year, reflecting the decision to reinvest the majority of the Concur gain in Q4 and the GBT gain in Q2, partially offset by the loss of our Business Travel expenses in the prior year. I'll provide more details on our marketing and promotion and operating expenses in a few minutes, but touch first, however, on a few other items on Slide 12.
Rewards expense grew by 10% in Q4, in part due to the $109 million impact from our renewed agreement with Delta. On a full year basis, rewards expense growth of 7% was relatively consistent with our reported proprietary billings growth.
Also on Slide 12, the tax rate in the quarter was 35%, slightly above what we have seen in the past couple of quarters as it was impacted by the resolution of certain prior year items. Prior to this quarter, we had been trending at a tax rate of approximately 34%. And while in any given quarter discrete items could impact the effective rate, we generally think 34% is more indicative of our underlying run rate.
Moving to marketing and promotion expenses on Slide 13. As I discussed, the 2 sizable gains we recognized in 2014 allowed us to invest in a number of attractive growth opportunities, and we believe this is the right decision to create value for shareholders. As a result, marketing and promotion expenses, where the majority of our incremental investments and growth initiatives were recorded, increased sequentially and grew 13% versus Q4 '13 and 9% on a full year basis.
For the year, much of this spending focused on acquiring card members across our diverse set of card portfolios. These initiatives included acquisition efforts for our proprietary charge and lending products, as well as opportunities in the co-brand space. Additionally, we were focused on expanding our merchant network, capturing a greater share of our card members lending, building out our GNS business and growing our newer digital businesses.
One example of how we build relationships with small businesses across both our merchant network and our card member base was our support this past quarter of the Small Business Saturday. This initiative now takes place across 6 countries and is a great example of how our closed loop enables us to partner and provide value to both our small business merchants and our existing card member base.
Turning now to operating expense performance for Q4 on Slide 14. Our reported results continue to reflect the impact of Business Travel operations in the prior year across a number of expense categories, complicating line-by-line comparisons.
Additionally, the impact of our restructuring charge this quarter had a substantial impact on salaries and benefits. That said, adjusting for last year's GBT operations and this year's restructuring charge, operating expenses decreased 1% in the quarter on a reported basis and increased by 1% when adjusting for FX.
Turning to the full year. Our adjusted operating expense growth remains well contained and came in well below our 3% growth target for the year as you can see on Slide 15. We continue to demonstrate disciplined control of our operating expenses, and this marked the second consecutive year that operating expense growth was significantly below the growth target that we set on our fourth quarter 2012 earnings call.
This discipline around operating expenses allowed us to continue investing for growth and provided increased financial flexibility in an economy that remains uncertain. As we look ahead, the restructuring actions that we are taking are one part of what will allow us to remain disciplined about operating expense growth.
Now shifting our focus towards capital. On Slide 16, the benefits of our strong capital position were on display all year, as we returned 86% of the capital generated in the year while modestly strengthening our already strong capital ratios.
As is usual, you do see our capital ratios decline slightly sequentially during the fourth quarter due to the seasonal increase in our loan and receivable balances. A portion of the year-over-year increase in our Tier 1 capital ratio was driven by the preferred issuance we executed during the fourth quarter. And we plan to follow this with another issuance in Q1. As I discussed on the last earnings call, these issuances represent the most cost-effective way to meet our evolving capital requirements and were part of the capital plan in our 2014 CCAR submission.
Now we did, of course, complete our submission for the 2015 CCAR process earlier this month, and we expect to hear back from the Fed about our submission in March. We continue to believe that our ability to return a high level of capital to our shareholders over the past several years while continuing to increase our capital ratios illustrates the strength of both our balance sheet and our business model. We have also worked hard to satisfy the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the Fed's guidelines and continue to strengthen aspects of our capital planning processes to support this critical effort.
So coming back to our full year results. We are pleased with our performance in the current economic and competitive environment. For the full year, we had per share growth of 14%, which is within our on average and over time target, while leveraging the gains provided by the Business Travel joint venture and the sale of our investment in Concur to better position the company for the future.
Looking forward to 2015, we do face a number of increasing challenges, including global economic growth that is forecast to remain below long-term averages; foreign exchange headwinds from a strengthening U.S. dollar; intense competition in the co-brand space; and a heightened regulatory environment, particularly in the EU. Of course, many of these issues are not new. And we face these challenges from a strong position, with many growth opportunities and assets that will give us a competitive advantage. We remain confident that our business model provides the opportunity to deliver significant value to our shareholders over the longer term.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Rick for some details on our Q&A session."

And frankly, we're also positioned to get some further help in 2016 incrementally as the initiatives take full effect."

So I think the way we think about it is, as you go forward and you think, to put your and Ken's question together about the restructuring we're just doing, we're not setting a new operating expense target publicly for now. But you're certainly not going to see it grow above 3%, and you've seen us come in pretty flat in the last 2 years well below the 3% target we set. Certainly, that's been an important part of our business model in providing the opportunity to spend on the growth opportunities we have.

Our U.S. relationship goes back to the '90s, as we think we've been great partners and have created a lot of value for their members, our card members and for both companies.

Obviously, with very important partners, we are always working every day to evolve the relationship to make it better and frankly, to make sure it's working for both parties. And you can presume we're doing that with Costco as we're doing it with all of our partners at any time. And if and when we have any news, as we did with Delta, which we chose to renew early, we would certainly tell you. In terms of thinking about the economics of these things, you've certainly heard a number of us, both Ken and I and our colleagues, talk about the competitive environment for co-brands in recent months and quarters, and that's true. I think you have to balance those comments with the fact that these are still one of many good economic growth opportunities we have in the company. And while, yes, the environment has become competitive and, well, certainly, there are cases where we conclude because we're pretty selective that we think we're better off not either getting into or proceeding with certain kinds of co-brand partnerships because we have so many other opportunities in our proprietary business. As a general matter, these still are attractive and important parts of our overall business model. And when we have great partners where our interests are really aligned, and I'll go back to the recent renewals with Delta and Starwood, we think we can create great value together and for all parties involved."

And if you look at the quarter, it was probably down around 10%. So yes, there's some impact. On our overall billings, it's fairly modest. I think given the size of that in the context of our company, it's probably premature or early for us to try to say whether or not there is an offset as consumers and companies take the savings they're getting and spend elsewhere. It would probably just be hard for us to see given the magnitude of our overall network versus what the spend on gas is. On OptBlue, we've been really pleased since we rolled the plan out early last year with the great acceptance it's gotten in the merchant acquirer world. We've been very pleased with the progress those acquires have then made at signing up new merchants. I would just remind people that as we laid out the plan early last year, this is a multiyear effort. And we are proceeding really nicely and are right on track to make very significant stride in merchant coverage over the next couple of years. There's a process, if you have to expand the coverage, then you have to create awareness with card members. And that's why we've always talked about this as a multiyear effort. But we're really pleased by all the early signs on, but it's not something that in the fourth quarter I would have expected to have a particularly material impact on the overall billings."

And what we are seeing in write-offs and delinquencies, there's really no sign of a tick upwards. I only, of course, joined the company about 1.5 years ago, and I think I've said on every single earnings call that I've done beginning in July of 2013 that while write-off rates have to eventually go up, but they have not. With the provision this quarter, there's really, as I said, 3 things going on. Number one, remember, we're growing loans 7%. You also just have a seasonal phenomenon because the balances always go up in the December quarter, and we do just the way the rules work, we do set the reserves up for those balances. And often the pattern would be that a little bit of that would roll off as you get into beginning of next year. We also just had a few specific reserve items which come and go, so it's not necessarily indicative of the future going forward. And we are, relative to where we were, say, a year ago, 2 years ago, at a point where we're not further improving the metrics much. They're fairly flat, although they are -- have improved a little bit. So surely, those phenomenon that drove this quarter was a sizable increase in provision, the 22% increase in provision. But I think I'd be cautious about concluding from that, that all else being equal, without other changes in the environment, that you should expect a big jump up in provision next year. We'll have to see how the economy develops. We'll have to see how our metrics develop. But certainly, we don't see in our metrics any sign of a weakening consumer credit environment. And gosh, when you look at unemployment rates continuing to go down, I don't think that should surprise any of us."

When you look at the evolving capital rules, it used to be that the Tier 1 capital minimums were actually below the Tier 1 common minimums, and we moved into a world where the Tier 1 capital minimums are about 150 basis points above your Tier 1 common. So if you're going to try to run the company efficiently and be governed by, to your point, in the Fed severe scenario what are you going to trip, you got to find the most cost-efficient way, if you will, to fill that 150-basis-point difference between the Tier 1 common and the Tier 1 ratio. And the preferred is clearly it for us and for many other banks. You've seen quite a surge of issuance of these kinds of securities. That's why we put it into our CCAR 2014 submission last year. It's why you will see us do another issuance in the first quarter or this quarter, and that will bring us about to where we want to be to provide that 150-basis-point buffer. Certainly, this is one component among several that we think makes our CCAR submission this year even stronger, right? We have built, over the past 12 months, capital even though we returned a very significant amount of capital to shareholders. We have issued this preferred. We continue to work on all of the qualitative processes, which we think are getting better and providing more insights to us. So we feel really good about our submission.

Two, we do have a flexible business model. And the closed loop gives us some unique ability to operate in a number of ways in response to evolving -- not just regulatory, but competitive and other environments. And you've seen us do some of those things in other parts of the world. Sometimes it takes us some time to evolve the business model. We'll have to see where the final EU rules come out. Three, I would say that there are already some things happening in Europe that are going to have an impact on us even in the near term even though the final payments directive has not been issued. And there are some changes in the rules around cross-border acquiring that we think are already and even more so in 2015 will begin to put some pressure on our discount rate in Europe. And that's just one of the many challenges that I talked about in -- as I reflected overall on the challenges we have for 2015.

Often, these partnerships only get renewed every quite a number of years. These are not exactly annual renewals. So when normal market economics have evolved for quite a number of years, when you renew the contract, you can sometimes have a significant reset. And we always structure these things so both parties have tremendous incentives to continue to grow the value, and we're pretty pleased overall with the role that all these partnerships have played in our financial performance over the years.

We will -- probably somewhat similar to the answer I gave earlier in response to things like Starwood metrics, we will, from time to time, usually in an Investor Day kind of setting, give people a few metrics. But we're really pleased with the business. I think it's also fair to say, we're also learning -- because it is a relatively new business for us -- how to better optimize some of the synergies with our core card business, and we're pleased with our progress there. In fact, I talked to my earlier remarks about the strong growth in a number of European countries, including Germany. And one of the factors helping us in Germany are some of the synergies we're beginning to see between our core card business and Loyalty Partner. On small business lending, we obviously have a tremendous franchise with small businesses. And we were certainly the first to create a organization within the company extremely focused on just trying to figure out, how do we help drive success for our small business partners? And it's given us a tremendous position in the marketplace. Small Business Saturday has been a tremendous add to the overall range of the things we do with small business partners. And growing our lending efforts in small business, we would see as one of the many opportunities we have to do a little bit more lending than you have seen us do the last few years. Now I want to emphasize here that we're a long, long ways from doing anything that changes our spend-centric focus. On the other hand, with our existing customer base, within our existing risk profile, with your example, small business is a really good example, we think we are really well positioned to accelerate growth rate from where we are today, and we're very focused on doing it."

And we're really pleased with that. And we're both very focused on growing the very mutual interest we have in a common card member and flyer base. All that said, they're a good partner, and I think we've been pretty clear that, in general, there's a reset often when you do these kinds of renewals after a long time. And I said on my earlier remarks, Delta is no exception. You do see the one piece of the economics in the charges we took in Q4. And that is that there is an impact that caused us to reprice the bank of MR points. So that basically tells you we're going to pay Delta a little bit more money when a Membership Rewards member transfers MR points to redeem a flight on Delta. That's actually very similar to something we did back in 2008. In fact, the charge is almost the same size. It's something that we took back in 2008. So that's not new. I think it's just sort of a standard part of a reset. Beyond that, I don't want to try to size the overall economics of a specific agreement as we have with Delta.

Happy to be here to discuss the results that we reported today for both the fourth quarter and full year 2014. We are pleased to see both our fourth quarter and full year EPS growth rates at 15% and 14%, r",4081,"Well, thanks, Rick, and good afternoon, everyone. Happy to be here to discuss the results that we reported today for both the fourth quarter and full year 2014. We are pleased to see both our fourth quarter and full year EPS growth rates at 15% and 14%, respectively, within our on average and over time targets.
This solid performance reflected familiar themes across the entire year: higher spending by our card members, modest acceleration in U.S. loan growth, credit indicators at or near historical lows, strong cost controls and a healthy balance sheet that enabled us to return a substantial amount of capital to shareholders in the form of repurchases over the past year.
There was some complexity to our results this quarter and year as we took advantage of the Q4 gain on the sale of our investment in Concur Technologies and the Q2 gain on the creation of the Business Travel joint venture to fund incremental initiatives to position the company for the long term. This quarter, these initiatives included a restructuring, incremental investments in growth initiatives and an upfront cost related to the renewal of our relationship with Delta Air Lines.
Given the increasingly competitive environment for co-brand partnerships, we are excited to have extended our relationship with Delta for the long term. More broadly, we believe all of these incremental initiatives will provide flexibility as we deal proactively with a global economic, competitive and regulatory environment that continues to be uncertain and rapidly changing.
As I begin with the financial summary on Page 2 of the slides, I'll discuss both the quarter and full year results as we believe this helps highlight some of the key performance trends and challenges we face as we enter 2015.
Our reported billings growth was 6% during the fourth quarter but 8% on an FX-adjusted basis, as we, like many other global companies, had a significant negative impact on our growth rates this quarter from the strengthening U.S. dollar.
For the year, we exceeded $1 trillion of spending on our network for the first time, with billed business up 9% versus last year on an FX-adjusted basis. As you can see, we exited the year slightly below our full year FX-adjusted growth rate as we did see a modest deceleration in billings growth during the fourth quarter. I'll provide more details on our Q4 billings performance in a few minutes, though clearly, the sharp drop in gas prices and soft December retail sales for the industry had an impact on our results.
During the quarter, adjusted for the Concur gain, which is reported in revenue and for the Business Travel revenues in the prior year, adjusted revenue growth was 3% and 5% when you further adjust for FX. The FX-adjusted growth rate is consistent with our full year performance, although I'd note that the drag from FX on our revenue and earnings increased over the course of 2014 due to the strengthening of the dollar.
Pretax income grew 12% during the quarter and 14% for the year, in part benefiting from our continued disciplined control of operating expenses. Net income grew more slowly at 11% for the quarter and 10% for the year. We have seen a higher tax rate throughout the course of the year. And the tax rate in the fourth quarter of 35% was a bit above the full year level and above what we might expect going forward.
Helping us again this year has been our share repurchase activity. Over the last 4 quarters, we have repurchased $4.4 billion in common shares, which has reduced our average shares outstanding by 4% versus the prior year. Add it all up and during 2014, we delivered fourth quarter EPS of $1.39 and full year EPS of $5.56, which were up 15% and 14%, respectively, versus the prior year and were within our on average and over time target. We were able to generate these earnings with revenue growth that was solid given the uncertain global economic environment, disciplined expense control and the benefits of our strong capital position. These results also brought our return on equity for the period ending December 31 to 29%, well above our on average and over time target of 25%.
Let's now move on to a detailed review of our Q4 results, beginning with the impact of the Concur gain and related incremental initiatives. As you recall, we entered into an operating agreement and made a strategic investment in Concur back in 2008. The partnership has created significant value for both our customers and shareholders.
During December, SAP acquired 100% of Concur, including our entire investment, triggering a pretax gain of $719 million, in line with our previous estimates. Going forward, our operating agreements with Concur are continuing, and we look forward to a continuing partnership with both SAP and Concur.
In the quarter, consistent with our previously announced expectations, we took advantage of the gain to fund initiatives that included a restructuring and upfront costs related to our decision to accelerate the renewal of our relationship with Delta and incremental investments in growth initiatives. Given the rapid changes in our industry and the sizable set of economically attractive growth opportunities that our company has, we believe that these were the right long-term decisions for shareholders.
Starting with the restructuring charge. The actions we are taking will impact over 4,000 people at a cost of $313 million in the quarter. Total employee headcount will decline by a smaller amount as certain of those reductions will be partially offset by jobs created elsewhere in the company.
The actions we are taking largely represent a continuation of our strategy to further increase the overall efficiency of our organization. Our business and industry continue to be transformed by technology, which is increasingly becoming more powerful and less expensive. Technology is also changing the way our merchants and card members want to interact with us and has created new channels of communication that have increased overall card member satisfaction.
As a result of these changes, we have the need and the opportunity to continuously evolve our organization and cost structure, giving us the ability to maintain tight control of operating expenses while still investing for growth.
We also used a portion of the Concur gain in conjunction with the renewal of our relationship with Delta Air Lines. We are excited about the new agreement with Delta, particularly given the increasingly competitive environment for co-brands. We decided to accelerate the Delta renewal as we saw an attractive opportunity to extend the long-term relationship with a key partner.
Our new agreement had an upfront cost of approximately $109 million in Q4 related to the new contract terms around Membership Rewards, including a small impact related to a previously announced cap on point transfers into Delta SkyMiles from Membership Rewards. This cap was removed as part of our new agreement, which we believe is good news for our card members. As a reminder, we took a similar upfront charge back in 2008 when we last renewed our partnership with Delta.
More generally, often, when long term co-brand partnerships are renewed, the new agreement will reflect shifts in market economics that have evolved over many years. All things being equal, a renewed co-branded agreement will often provide us with lower economics initially than the prior agreement and will be structured to incent growth and generate additional revenues for both parties over time. The magnitude of this reset can be significant depending on the size of each partnership. Our agreement with Delta is no exception to this market reality. All told, we feel very positive about the potential of the renewed relationship to generate benefits over the longer term. However, when we think about our near-term outlook, we will need to take into account the impact of the new agreement.
Looking at the entire landscape for co-brand products, while the competitive environment has become more intense, we continue to see attractive opportunities. We've been very disciplined and selective in the partners we work with and have focused on the relationships that can offer the best value, the best growth potential and the best returns over time. In this context, we were also pleased to recently renew our long-term relationship with Starwood. As with Delta, we believe that this relationship provides attractive value for card members and opportunities for growth going forward.
Coming back now to how we leveraged the Concur gain during the quarter on Slide 3. You see that we also made incremental investments in the diverse set of growth opportunities within our company. These investments were primarily, though not entirely, in marketing and promotion and were focused on acquisition activities across the strong suite of products we offer to consumers, small businesses and corporations around the world. I'd remind you that while co-brands are one important component of our business model, we believe that the greater breadth and global nature of our product set provide a significant competitive advantage.
Going to the numbers, while there is some subjectivity in determining the level of incremental investments that we made as a result of the Concur gain, it was a significant amount in the quarter, leaving a net gain from Concur of approximately $0.05 to $0.06. Thinking about our overall results in another way, we did clearly have a negative foreign exchange impact from the strengthening U.S. dollar, as well as a slightly higher tax rate in the quarter.
Let's turn now to a more detailed view of quarterly performance metrics, starting with billed business on Slide 4. During the fourth quarter, billed business growth slowed sequentially from 9% to 6% on a reported basis. The decline was impacted by the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar as FX-adjusted billings grew by 8% during the fourth quarter.
Looking at the results by segment, you can see that growth in our U.S. consumer and small business segments slowed sequentially from 9% to 8% in Q4. The sequential decline was influenced by the large drop in gas prices and relatively soft retail sales industry-wide during the month of December.
GNS continues to be our strongest performing segment, with FX-adjusted growth of 15% during the quarter. And while FX-adjusted growth in ICS slowed to 3% during the quarter, we saw very different performance trends by region, as you can see by moving to Slide 5.
Here, you can see the billings in our LACC region dropped more significantly during the fourth quarter due to a decline in spend at Costco Canada. While American Express cards were still accepted at Costco warehouses throughout Canada during the quarter, we began to see billings decline after card acceptance was expanded to include other networks on October 1. I would remind you that beginning January 1, 2015, American Express cards were no longer accepted in Costco warehouses in Canada, which we expect will drive billings growth lower during 2015.
In contrast to the LACC experience, we saw continued improvement in our EMEA billings, which showed their strongest FX-adjusted growth since Q2 '11. The increase was driven primarily by strong performance in the U.K. and improved growth in Germany. All of these results outside the U.S. were impacted by foreign exchange movements, which is why we've added Slide 6 this quarter, which is a slide that shows our reported and FX-adjusted revenue growth rates for the last 8 quarters.
As you can see, during the fourth quarter, foreign exchange had a more significant negative impact on our reported results than in prior periods, dragging adjusted revenue growth by approximately 240 basis points. To give you a better sense of the drivers here, we have also provided some background on the major concentrations of our billed business by international currency.
The first row at the bottom of the chart shows the approximate range of billed business by card members in each market as a percentage of total company billed business, while the second row shows the year-over-year change in that foreign currency compared to the U.S. dollar.
When you look at the slide, it is somewhat unusual that the dollar has strengthened significantly against nearly all of the international currencies where we generate a significant amount of revenue. As you know, this revenue impact is partially offset by the benefit we receive from having certain expenses denominated in international currencies. But there is a bottom line impact, especially when rates move this dramatically. As you can see in our annual report, we estimate that a 10% strengthening of the dollar against all international currencies in which we do business would cost approximately $200 million in pretax income over a 1-year period.
So clearly, as I mentioned earlier, it was a negative impact to our bottom line in the quarter. Over the long term, we continue to believe that being a global company, which generates revenue in a diverse set of markets around the world, is a significant benefit of our business model. However, if current trends do continue, FX rates will represent a headwind as we head into 2015.
Moving on now to loan growth on Slide 7. Loan growth was up 5% versus last year on a reported basis. We were obviously pleased though by our performance in the U.S., which constitutes the majority of our loans, as growth improved to 7% during Q4 and continues to outpace the industry. I'd note that international loan growth was down year-over-year as performance was negatively impacted by FX rates and also by a decline in loans within the Costco Canada co-brand portfolio.
Looking forward, we continue to believe that there are attractive opportunities to gain a greater share of loans from both our existing and new customers without significantly changing the overall risk profile of the company. Our efforts here are not about a transformational shift away from our spend-centric model, but still do represent a sizable growth opportunity for our company.
So let's move now to our revenue performance on Slide 8, where you see that our reported revenue growth in Q4 was 7%. Adjusted, however, for the Concur gain, the loss of Business Travel revenues in the prior year and FX, adjusted revenue growth was 5%, which was consistent with our full year performance.
I'd note that the Concur gain is reported in other revenue, which drove the large year-over-year increase in that line. The largest contribution to adjusted revenue growth again came from greater discount revenue from higher billed business volumes.
As we saw last quarter, there was a roughly 400-basis-point gap between billed business growth and discount revenue growth. The first driver of this difference is the reported discount rate, which was down 3 basis points versus the prior year. As a reminder, we provide this reported discount rate calculation to give you some context about our pricing in point-of-sale with merchants.
This quarter's decline reflects in part our ongoing mix shift in volumes towards lower discount rate industries, though this impact was partially offset in the current quarter by the drop in Costco Canada merchant volume, where we earn a lower discount rate. This quarter's discount rate was also impacted by the timing of certain merchant contract signings.
The quarter's discount rate also reflects a modest but growing impact related to the OptBlue program, as merchant acquirers are actively signing new merchants onto the American Express network. We are encouraged by our progress in this multiyear effort. It does result in some incremental pressure on the reported discount rate as we have previously discussed, but I would remind you that a portion of this decline is offset through reduced operating expenses as OptBlue shifts the impact of certain third-party acquisition activities from operating expenses to discount revenue. We continue to believe that OptBlue will bring incremental volumes onto our network over the next several years and provide attractive economics for our business.
Coming back now to the broader relationship between discount revenue and billed business. Similar to last quarter, the other drivers of the gap between the 2 are the faster growth we are seeing in both contra-revenue items such as cash incentives and GNS volumes.
I would point out here that the relationship between discount revenue and billed business has become more complicated over time, partially due to the impact related to OptBlue I just mentioned, and so interpreting our discount rate metric in isolation has become more complex as our business has evolved.
Now turning to the other revenue line. Net interest income was the other primary driver of revenue growth, growing 8% as we continued to benefit year-over-year from both lower funding costs and an increase in average loan balances. Finally, as expected, travel commissions and fees declined significantly this quarter as the revenues associated with Business Travel were no longer consolidated in our P&L.
Turning now to credit performance on Slide 9. You can see that our lending credit metrics remain near or at historically low levels. Worldwide lending write-off rates and delinquency rates declined slightly during the quarter, though overall, the rate of improvement in these metrics has slowed in the past year. As a reminder, our objective is not necessarily to have the lowest possible write-off rate but is instead to achieve profitable growth and to earn the best economics on our portfolio. Therefore, while we are not planning to change the overall risk profile of the company, at some point, we would expect that write-off rates will increase somewhat from today's low levels.
In terms of lending reserve coverage levels, Slide 10 shows that coverage remained relatively consistent. After considering the impact of the seasonal ramp-up in loan balances on the months coverage metric, we believe coverage levels remain appropriate given the risk level inherent in the portfolio.
Putting together our solid loan growth with these credit metrics, you can see on Slide 11 that total provision in Q4 increased significantly versus both last year and the prior quarter. Although credit metrics remain low and write-offs remain a bit below the prior year, the rate of improvement has slowed. This trend, along with the growth and seasonal uptick in loan balances and some smaller specific reserve builds, are what drove the provision up 22% this quarter.
Moving next to total expenses on Slide 12. On a reported basis, expenses increased by 3% versus the prior year in Q4 and were flat for the full year, reflecting the decision to reinvest the majority of the Concur gain in Q4 and the GBT gain in Q2, partially offset by the loss of our Business Travel expenses in the prior year. I'll provide more details on our marketing and promotion and operating expenses in a few minutes, but touch first, however, on a few other items on Slide 12.
Rewards expense grew by 10% in Q4, in part due to the $109 million impact from our renewed agreement with Delta. On a full year basis, rewards expense growth of 7% was relatively consistent with our reported proprietary billings growth.
Also on Slide 12, the tax rate in the quarter was 35%, slightly above what we have seen in the past couple of quarters as it was impacted by the resolution of certain prior year items. Prior to this quarter, we had been trending at a tax rate of approximately 34%. And while in any given quarter discrete items could impact the effective rate, we generally think 34% is more indicative of our underlying run rate.
Moving to marketing and promotion expenses on Slide 13. As I discussed, the 2 sizable gains we recognized in 2014 allowed us to invest in a number of attractive growth opportunities, and we believe this is the right decision to create value for shareholders. As a result, marketing and promotion expenses, where the majority of our incremental investments and growth initiatives were recorded, increased sequentially and grew 13% versus Q4 '13 and 9% on a full year basis.
For the year, much of this spending focused on acquiring card members across our diverse set of card portfolios. These initiatives included acquisition efforts for our proprietary charge and lending products, as well as opportunities in the co-brand space. Additionally, we were focused on expanding our merchant network, capturing a greater share of our card members lending, building out our GNS business and growing our newer digital businesses.
One example of how we build relationships with small businesses across both our merchant network and our card member base was our support this past quarter of the Small Business Saturday. This initiative now takes place across 6 countries and is a great example of how our closed loop enables us to partner and provide value to both our small business merchants and our existing card member base.
Turning now to operating expense performance for Q4 on Slide 14. Our reported results continue to reflect the impact of Business Travel operations in the prior year across a number of expense categories, complicating line-by-line comparisons.
Additionally, the impact of our restructuring charge this quarter had a substantial impact on salaries and benefits. That said, adjusting for last year's GBT operations and this year's restructuring charge, operating expenses decreased 1% in the quarter on a reported basis and increased by 1% when adjusting for FX.
Turning to the full year. Our adjusted operating expense growth remains well contained and came in well below our 3% growth target for the year as you can see on Slide 15. We continue to demonstrate disciplined control of our operating expenses, and this marked the second consecutive year that operating expense growth was significantly below the growth target that we set on our fourth quarter 2012 earnings call.
This discipline around operating expenses allowed us to continue investing for growth and provided increased financial flexibility in an economy that remains uncertain. As we look ahead, the restructuring actions that we are taking are one part of what will allow us to remain disciplined about operating expense growth.
Now shifting our focus towards capital. On Slide 16, the benefits of our strong capital position were on display all year, as we returned 86% of the capital generated in the year while modestly strengthening our already strong capital ratios.
As is usual, you do see our capital ratios decline slightly sequentially during the fourth quarter due to the seasonal increase in our loan and receivable balances. A portion of the year-over-year increase in our Tier 1 capital ratio was driven by the preferred issuance we executed during the fourth quarter. And we plan to follow this with another issuance in Q1. As I discussed on the last earnings call, these issuances represent the most cost-effective way to meet our evolving capital requirements and were part of the capital plan in our 2014 CCAR submission.
Now we did, of course, complete our submission for the 2015 CCAR process earlier this month, and we expect to hear back from the Fed about our submission in March. We continue to believe that our ability to return a high level of capital to our shareholders over the past several years while continuing to increase our capital ratios illustrates the strength of both our balance sheet and our business model. We have also worked hard to satisfy the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the Fed's guidelines and continue to strengthen aspects of our capital planning processes to support this critical effort.
So coming back to our full year results. We are pleased with our performance in the current economic and competitive environment. For the full year, we had per share growth of 14%, which is within our on average and over time target, while leveraging the gains provided by the Business Travel joint venture and the sale of our investment in Concur to better position the company for the future.
Looking forward to 2015, we do face a number of increasing challenges, including global economic growth that is forecast to remain below long-term averages; foreign exchange headwinds from a strengthening U.S. dollar; intense competition in the co-brand space; and a heightened regulatory environment, particularly in the EU. Of course, many of these issues are not new. And we face these challenges from a strong position, with many growth opportunities and assets that will give us a competitive advantage. We remain confident that our business model provides the opportunity to deliver significant value to our shareholders over the longer term.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Rick for some details on our Q&A session."

As we, of course, have been on a steady journey here for a number of years to continually evolve our business, how we operate, how we interact with the card members and our merchants, take advantage of evolving technologies, make sure we have the right footprint. And this is really a continuation of that strategy. Now some of these moves are complicated, and it will really take us the course of calendar 2015 to execute on pretty much all of the things that are in the restructuring charge that you see us taking in Q4. So there will be some benefits in 2015. The full run rate benefit of all the actions we're taking, however, you will see as we get into 2016. So I think as we look at the actions we're taking, we see it as something that will be helpful to us in 2015 to continue the kind of strong discipline you've seen us have on operating expenses. And frankly, we're also positioned to get some further help in 2016 incrementally as the initiatives take full effect."

And frankly, there are other times when there are things that we think can help drive long-term growth in the business that may run through various parts of our P&L and various parts of the expense structure that we think are the right things to do, and we don't want to preclude ourselves from spending. So I think the way we think about it is, as you go forward and you think, to put your and Ken's question together about the restructuring we're just doing, we're not setting a new operating expense target publicly for now. But you're certainly not going to see it grow above 3%, and you've seen us come in pretty flat in the last 2 years well below the 3% target we set. Certainly, that's been an important part of our business model in providing the opportunity to spend on the growth opportunities we have. And you're going to see us, I think, very focused on continuing that discipline. I just want to be a little cautious about setting an exact operating efficiency ratio target."

Our U.S. relationship goes back to the '90s, as we think we've been great partners and have created a lot of value for their members, our card members and for both companies. Now I would point out to you that I don't think we said anything about any ongoing discussions we're having with Costco. Obviously, with very important partners, we are always working every day to evolve the relationship to make it better and frankly, to make sure it's working for both parties. And you can presume we're doing that with Costco as we're doing it with all of our partners at any time. And if and when we have any news, as we did with Delta, which we chose to renew early, we would certainly tell you. In terms of thinking about the economics of these things, you've certainly heard a number of us, both Ken and I and some of our colleagues, talk about the competitive environment for co-brands in recent months and quarters, and that's true. I think you have to balance those comments with the fact that these are still one of many good economic growth opportunities we have as a company. And while, yes, the environment has become competitive and, well, certainly, there are cases where we conclude because we're pretty selective that we think we're better off not either getting into or proceeding with certain kinds of co-brand partnerships because we have so many other opportunities in our proprietary business. As a general matter, these still are attractive and important parts of our overall business model. And when we have great partners where our interests are really aligned, and I'll go back to the recent renewals with Delta and Starwood, we think we can create great value together and for all parties involved."

And if you look at the quarter, it was probably down around 10%. So yes, there's some impact. On our overall billings, it's fairly modest. I think given the size of that in the context of our company, it's probably premature or early for us to try to say whether or not there is an offset as consumers and companies take the savings they're getting and spend elsewhere. It would probably just be hard for us to see given the magnitude of our overall network versus what the spend on gas is. On OptBlue, we've been really pleased since we rolled the plan out early last year with the great acceptance it's gotten in the merchant acquirer world. We've been very pleased with the progress those acquirers have then made at signing up new merchants. I would just remind people that as we laid out the plan early last year, this is a multiyear effort. And we are proceeding really nicely and are right on track to make very significant strides in merchant coverage over the next couple of years. There's a process of you have to expand the coverage, then you have to create awareness with card members. And that's why we've always talked about this as a multiyear effort. But we're really pleased by all the early signs on, but it's not something that in the fourth quarter I would have expected to have a particularly material impact on the overall billings."

And what we are seeing in write-offs and delinquencies, there's really no sign of a tick upwards. I only, of course, joined the company about 1.5 years ago, and I think I've said on every single earnings call that I've done beginning in July of 2013 that well, write-off rates have to eventually go up, but they have not. With the provision this quarter, there's really, as I said, 3 things going on. Number one, remember, we're growing loans 7%. You also just have a seasonal phenomenon because the balances always go up in the December quarter, and we do just the way the rules work, we do set the reserves up for those balances. And often the pattern would be that a little bit of that would roll off as you get into beginning of next year. We also just had a few specific reserve items which come and go, so it's not necessarily indicative of the future going forward. And we are, relative to where we were, say, a year ago, 2 years ago, at a point where we're not further improving the metrics much. They're fairly flat, although they are -- have improved a little bit. So surely, those phenomenon that drove this quarter was a sizable increase in provision, the 22% increase in provision. But I think I'd be cautious about concluding from that, that all else being equal, without other changes in the environment, that you should expect a big jump up in provision next year. We'll have to see how the economy develops. We'll have to see how our metrics develop. But certainly, we don't see in our metrics any sign of a weakening consumer credit environment.

When you look at the evolving capital rules, it used to be that the Tier 1 capital minimums were actually below the Tier 1 common minimums, and we moved into a world where the Tier 1 capital minimums are about 150 basis points above your Tier 1 common. So if you're going to try to run the company efficiently and be governed by, to your point, in the Fed severe scenario what are you going to trip, you got to find the most cost-efficient way, if you will, to fill that 150-basis-point difference between the Tier 1 common and the Tier 1 ratio. And the preferred is clearly it for us and for many other banks. You've seen quite a surge of issuance of these kinds of securities. That's why we put it into our CCAR 2014 submission last year. It's why you will see us do another issuance in the first quarter or this quarter, and that will bring us about to where we want to be to provide that 150-basis-point buffer. Certainly, this is one component among several that we think makes our CCAR submission this year even stronger, right? We have built, over the past 12 months, capital even though we returned a very significant amount of capital to shareholders. We have issued this preferred. We continue to work on all of the qualitative processes, which we think are getting better and providing more insights to us. So we feel really good about our submission.

Two, we do have a flexible business model. And the closed loop gives us some unique ability to operate in a number of ways in response to evolving -- not just regulatory, but competitive and other environments. And you've seen us do some of those things in other parts of the world. Sometimes it takes us some time to evolve the business model. We'll have to see where the final EU rules come out. Three, I would say that there are already some things happening in Europe that are going to have an impact on us even in the near term even though the final payments directive has not been issued. And there are some changes in the rules around cross-border acquiring that we think are already and even more so in 2015 will begin to put some pressure on our discount rate in Europe.

When you talk about the impact, I guess what I was very much trying to communicate in my comments earlier is that we are in these co-brand relationships for the long term, just like we run the company for the long term. Often, these partnerships only get renewed every quite a number of years. These are not exactly annual renewals. So when normal market economics have evolved for quite a number of years, when you renew the contract, you can sometimes have a significant reset. And we always structure these things so both parties have tremendous incentives to continue to grow the value, and we're pretty pleased overall with the role that all these partnerships have played in our financial performance over the years.

And we're very pleased, and I think you can continue to expect us to expand to new countries. In terms of breaking it out, I think we're still a ways from that. We will -- probably somewhat similar to the answer I gave earlier in response to things like Starwood metrics, we will, from time to time, usually in an Investor Day kind of setting, give people a few metrics. But we're really pleased with the business. I think it's also fair to say, we're also learning -- because it is a relatively new business for us -- how to better optimize some of the synergies with our core card business, and we're pleased with our progress there. In fact, I talked in my earlier remarks about the strong growth in a number of European countries, including Germany. And one of the factors helping us in Germany are some of the synergies we're beginning to see between our core card business and Loyalty Partner. On small business lending, we obviously have a tremendous franchise with small businesses. And we were certainly the first to create a organization within the company extremely focused on just trying to figure out, how do we help drive success for our small business partners? And it's given us a tremendous position in the marketplace. Small Business Saturday has been a tremendous add to the overall range of the things we do with small business partners. And growing our lending efforts in small business, we would see as one of the many opportunities we have to do a little bit more lending than you have seen us do the last few years. Now I want to emphasize here that we're a long, long ways from doing anything that changes our spend-centric focus. On the other hand, with our existing customer base, within our existing risk profile, with your example of small business as a really good example, we think we are really well positioned to accelerate growth rate from where we are today, and we're very focused on doing it."

All that said, they're a good partner, and I think we've been pretty clear that, in general, there's a reset often when you do these kinds of renewals after a long time. And I said on my earlier remarks, Delta is no exception. You do see the one piece of the economics in the charges we took in Q4. And that is that there is an impact that caused us to reprice the bank of MR points. So that basically tells you we're going to pay Delta a little bit more money when a Membership Rewards member transfers MR points to redeem a flight on Delta. That's actually very similar to something we did back in 2008. In fact, the charge is almost the same size as something that we took back in 2008. So that's not new.

Good afternoon, everyone. Overall, Q1 was a solid quarter for the company. Consistent with the framework and financial outlook we presented at investor day last month. The quarter provided solid core underlying performance as well as",3730,"Well, thanks, Rick. Good afternoon, everyone. 
Overall, Q1 was a solid quarter for the company. Consistent with the framework and financial outlook we presented at investor day last month. The quarter provided solid core underlying performance as well as several discrete impacts including the strengthening of the U.S. dollar and various changes to our co-brand relationships. 
As you recall, we discussed at investor day our expectations for the first quarter. And in fact, EPS growth of 11% did come in better than our full year outlook and even a little better than we thought a few weeks ago, in part due to the timing of our incremental spending on growth initiatives which will ramp up over the course of the year along with some other timing benefits that we don't expect to repeat as we go through the year. I'll discuss these items in more detail later in my remarks.
Importantly for these reasons, our full year 2015 EPS outlook remains unchanged as we continue to expect EPS growth to be flat to modestly down.
Looking back to the financial outlook framework from investor day, our core underlying performance remained consistent and continued to be driven by solid revenue growth of 5% after adjusting for FX and Business Travel revenues than the prior year, disciplined cost controls and a strong balance sheet that enabled us to return a substantial amount of capital to shareholders in the form of repurchases over the past year.
Our results also reflect some of the discrete impacts that we discussed a few weeks ago. In the co-brand space, we are seeing the impact from the termination of our relationship with Costco in Canada as well as the recent impact from the early renewals we have done with several other co-brand partners including Delta, Starwood and Cathay Pacific. In addition, the U.S. dollar continued to strengthen during the first quarter and represented a significant headwind to our quarterly earnings performance. 
Importantly, during the quarter we also continued to have strong momentum on key initiatives. Highlights included the expansion of our small merchant coverage through [indiscernible], the announcement of the Plenti loyalty coalition program in the U.S., assigning of a new Charles Schwab co-brand along with the renewal of our co-brand relationship with British Airways in Iberia, as well as the announcement just today of our wearable payments partnership with Java. We are also very pleased with our strong 2015 CCAR performance which will provide us with the flexibility to increase our dividend and share repurchases going forward. 
As we discussed at investor day, we believe that these developments are indicative of the many attractive opportunities for growth that we have over the longer term.
So that is the quarter in a simple summary. As we get into the detail, I will warn you that lapping the impact of 2015's Global Business Travel and Concur transactions along with the 2015 discrete impacts of FX and our co-brand changes, all combined to make understanding our results this year a bit more complex than usual.
To begin now with our financial results for Q1. As you can see on Slide 2, reported Billings growth was 3%. Like many other global companies, the strength of the U.S. dollar had a significant impact on our growth rates this quarter. As the dollar continued to strengthen, the magnitude of the FX impact increased. And for the first quarter, depressed our growth by nearly 4 percentage points. As a result, FX-adjusted Billings growth was 7%, significantly higher than our reported rate. 
I'll provide more details e-mails on our Billings performance shortly. But lower gas prices in the U.S. and our termination of our relationship with Costco in Canada clearly had an impact on our results.
Reported revenue growth of negative 3% was, of course, also impacted by FX as well as the inclusion of Business Travel revenues in the prior year. Excluding these items, adjusted revenue growth was 5% consistent with both the prior quarter and recent trends.
Net income grew by 6% helped by disciplined expense control and lower provision costs, both of which also reflected some timing benefits in the quarter, which helped to offset the discrete impacts of FX and the changes in our co-brand relationships. 
Below the net income line, we continue to leverage our strong capital position to provide significant returns to our shareholders. Over the past year, we have repurchased 48 million shares which translated to a 4% decline in average shares outstanding. This decline in shares outstanding along with a modestly lower tax rate drove the 11% diluted EPS growth that we generated during the first quarter. This performance also resulted in an ROE of 29% for the period, ending March 31, well above our on-average and overtime target of 25% and demonstrate the continued strength of our business model.
Let's now move to a more detailed review of our key performance drivers during the first quarter, starting with Billed Business on Slide 3. On an FX adjusted basis, Billings growth slowed modestly from 8% in Q4 to 7% during the quarter.
Looking at the results by segment. In our U.S. Consumer and Small Business segment, growth also decelerated slightly to 7% in Q1. This performance was impacted by the more than 30% decline in gas prices year-over-year as well as slower retail sales growth consistent with industrywide trends in the U.S. I would note that in the U.S., we did not see any material impact on our Billings growth from the announced termination next year of our relationship with Costco. As we would have expected however, we have started to see some slowing of new Costco co-brand card acquisitions, which along with any future customer behavior changes that we may experience, will likely begin to impact our performance somewhat later this year. 
It's also worth noting on Billings that the deceleration in Q1 was more pronounced in our GCS segment where Billings were up 4% on an FX-adjusted basis as we seem to see a slowdown in spending across a number of corporate customers primarily in the U.S.
GNS continues to be our strongest Billings growth segment with FX-adjusted growth of 16% during the quarter. This continued strong growth demonstrates the diversity of our business model, given the much higher than company average returns on equity we achieved in the GNS business.
Finally, ICS FX-adjusted growth was 2% during Q1. But as we began to see last quarter, we saw very different trends by region, as you can see on Slide 4. 
The slowdown in international regions came primarily from LACC where volumes were down 4% versus the prior year driven by a drop-off in Canadian billings. As you recall, we began to see volumes slow in Canada during Q4 when card acceptance at Costco in Canada was expanded to include other networks. Beginning January 1, American Express products were no longer accepted in Costco warehouses in Canada and we are now seeing the full impact from the termination of this relationship on Billed Business.
In contrast to LACC, we saw improved growth in the JAPA region, which was again the fastest-growing region in the quarter, up 16% on an FX-adjusted basis. This solid performance continued to be powered by strong growth in China and Japan.
In all international regions, you see that like other U.S. companies with a significant global footprint, our reported results are being significantly impacted by changes in foreign exchange rates. To provide you with some additional perspective here, on Slide 5, we have again included a comparison of our reported and FX-adjusted revenue growth rates for the last 8 quarters. As you can see in the trajectory of the blue dotted line on the slide, our adjusted revenue growth remains consistent with recent trends in the 5% range. However, during the first quarter foreign exchange had a more significant negative impact on our results than in prior periods, dragging adjusted revenue growth down by nearly 4 percentage points. At current FX rates, we would expect to see a similar drag in the second quarter.
As you can see in the second row, the bottom of the chart, the dollar has strengthened by 10% to 30% year-over-year against the currencies that we are most exposed to outside the U S. Now, of course, this revenue impact is partially offset by the benefit we receive from having certain expenses denominated in international currencies. But there is a bottom line impact especially when rates move this dramatically.
Over the longer term, we continue to believe that being a global company that generates revenue in a diverse set of markets around the world is a strength of our business model. 
As we discussed at Investor Day, however, if the current rates hold, FX will continue to have a significant discrete impact for the balance of the year.
Turning now to loans. You see on Slide 6 that worldwide loans are up 4% versus the prior year. Consistent with historical seasonal trends, we did see a drop-off in loan balances versus year end and a small sequential increase in net interest yields during the first quarter. In the U.S., which constitutes the majority of our loan portfolio, growth was relatively consistent to prior quarter at 7%. 
On the international side, reported loan balances were down year-over-year due to the negative impact from FX rates and the decline in loans related to the Costco Canada co-brand portfolio.
Stepping back, our loan growth has consistently been above the industry over the past 2 years. And we talked at Investor Day about the opportunity to continue this trend by growing share with existing card members as well as attracting new customers to our franchise.
Having said this, however, I'd also remind you that net interest income this quarter still made up only 18% of our total revenues. And given the expected runoff in loans associated with the Costco U.S. co-brand portfolio next year, even if we continue to grow our core loan portfolio at the higher rates we have seen, our overall business model will remain very spend focused.
So now putting together our billings and loan performance, you see on Slide 7 that revenues declined 3% on a reported basis but increased by 5% after adjusting for FX and Business Travel revenues in the prior year. I'll note that revenue growth during the current quarter does reflect a portion of the negative impact from our co-brand partnership early renewals as well as a larger impact versus Q4 from the termination of our relationship with Costco in Canada. 
Even with these discrete impacts, however, adjusted revenue growth of 5% is consistent with the recent trend, illustrating the ongoing strength of our underlying core business.
The 2 largest components of revenue are of course discount revenue and net interest income. To start with the former, during the first quarter, discount revenue grew by 1%, which was approximately 200 basis points below the reported growth in Billed business of 3%. The first driver of this difference was a decline in our reported discount rate which was down 2 basis points versus the prior year. This year-over-year decline is slightly smaller than in recent quarters in part because the decline in Costco Canada merchant volume, where we're in a much lower discount rate, actually raises the company average discount rate. The discount rate also reflects continued growth in our [indiscernible] program as merchant acquirers actively sign up new merchants onto the American Express network.
As Ed discussed at Investor Day, 14 of the top 15 merchant acquirers in the U.S. are now part of [indiscernible]. Last year, when Andre Williams introduced this new program to you at the February financial community meeting, he said that we expect to increase our small merchant acquisition by 50% or more for the next several years starting in 2015. And while this is obviously a multiyear effort, we, in fact, signed more than 400,000 new small merchants last year in 2014. So we are clearly off to a good start. We are also undertaking similar efforts to improve our small merchant coverage in many other markets around the world.
Also contributing to the gap between discount revenue and billed business growth was faster growth in both GNS volumes and Concur revenue items, including cash incentives and certain payments related to our renewed co-brand relationships.
Turning to the other key component of revenue, net interest income. We saw a healthy 8% growth rate driven by our continued efforts to grow our loan portfolio as well as lower funding costs. As the majority of our loan portfolio is in the U.S., the impact of FX is smaller on net interest income than on other revenue lines.
Moving now to credit performance on Slide 8. You can see that our lending credit metrics remain at or near historically low levels and then our write-off and delinquency rates both remained relatively consistent with recent trends. 
As you can see on Slide 9, despite this steady lending credit performance, provision expense dropped 13% versus the prior year. Typically, we experienced a reserve release during Q1 due to the seasonal decline in loans and receivable balances versus year end. The increase in the reserve release versus the prior year is largely due to charge card with the prior period including a modest reserve build.
Moving to our lending reserve coverage levels on Slide 10. Coverage remained relatively consistent after considering the impact of the seasonal decline in loans and receivables I just mentioned. We believe coverage levels remain appropriate given the risk level inherent in the portfolio.
Thinking about the balance of the year, it is important to note that we would expect reserves to build modestly in line with loan growth and any changes in credit performance. Therefore, we would expect provision to increase year-over-year and to represent a headwind to growth for the remainder of 2015. 
Moreover, as we discussed at Investor Day, we did build into our multiyear financial outlook an assumption that we would see some steady upward tick in write-off rates and a modest build in reserves over the outlook period.
Moving below revenue, now to expenses on Slide 11. On a reported basis, expenses declined by 5% versus the prior year. Excluding Business Travel expenses incurred in 2014, adjusted total expenses increased by 1% and also, of course, benefited somewhat from the strength of the U.S. dollar. 
I'll come back to operating expenses and marketing and promotion in a moment. First, however, I'll touch on a few other items on this slide. 
Rewards expense grew by 4% which is relatively consistent with our reported Billed Business growth. Now rewards expense in the current quarter does include a portion of the discrete impact from our renewed co-brand relationships. The results increase in our rewards card, however, was partially offset by some timing benefits this quarter related to our Membership Rewards program.
Next, while it's a relatively small percentage of total expenses, cost of Card Member services increased significantly year-over-year by 18%. As background, a portion of the expenses in this line are related to the payments we may provide partners for services such as baggage fees, companion tickets and airport lounge access, which have increased as a result of our renewed co-brand relationships. For the remainder of 2015, given that Q1 of last year also included elevated costs in cost of Card Member services, we would expect to see an even higher level of growth for this line item.
Last on Slide 11, the tax rate during the first quarter was 34% which was relatively consistent with recent quarters but slightly below the prior year. As we mentioned at Investor Day, our assumption is that the tax rate will remain roughly in line with recent performance during 2015.
Let's turn now to marketing and promotion expenses which account for the majority of our spending on growth initiatives. Slide 12 shows the trend of these costs. And you see that while this quarter's marketing and promotion expenses were 4% higher than the prior year, you'll also notice that these costs have historically been much lower during each year's first quarter. More broadly as we think about 2015, we continued to evolve our plans around the timing and level of incremental spending on growth initiatives. As we have said, the majority but not all of this spending will occur in marketing and promotion. Considering this, we would expect marketing and promotion expenses to be relatively similar with the elevated levels of 2014 which you can see on this slide included higher level of expenses in Q2 when we had the Business Travel joint venture transaction gain and in Q4 when we had the Concur gain. While we could've made the decision to reduce investments from their elevated 2014 levels, as we discussed at Investor Day, we believe that the right decision for shareholders to best position the company from the medium to long-term is to keep investments on an elevated level this year in anticipation of the termination of our relationship in Costco in the U.S. during early 2016.
As Kenneth and Steve discussed in detail a few weeks ago, the incremental spending in 2015 will focus on the many growth opportunities that we see across all segments in our company, including our efforts to capture a meaningful portion of the spend and lend of our Costco card members in the U.S.
Turning now to operating expense performance on Slide 13. Our reported results continue to reflect the impact of Business Travel in the prior year across a number of expense categories complicating line by line comparisons. That said, excluding Business Travel expenses incurred in the prior year, adjusted operating expenses in total decreased by 2% in the quarter. I'll also note that during the quarter, we benefited from some specific items at the other net line which we do not expect to repeat going forward. As you think about the balance of the year, I'd also point out that operating expenses have historically been lower during Q1.
Moving to Slide 14. Adjusted operating expense growth of course remained well below our stated 3% growth target. As we've discussed at Investor Day, maintaining disciplined control of our expenses particularly operating expenses remains a key driver of our earnings performance. As Steve noted that day, however, we are not achieving this disciplined expense control or cut back in investment levels but rather through ongoing efforts to increase the efficiency of the organization. We continue to make substantial investments within operating expenses to support our growth initiative.
now switching to our capital performance on Slide 15. During the current quarter, we returned 65% of the capital we generated to shareholders while strengthening our already strong capital ratios. As I mentioned at Investor Day, share repurchases of approximately $750 million for the first quarter were below the amount included in our 2014 CCAR submission due to some nuances in the 2014 CCAR rules associated with the capital generated by employee plans. These rules have evolved for future CCAR periods but these caused our Q1 payout ratio to be somewhat lower than in recent quarters. 
I'd also point out that the 2015 CCAR process gives all participants more flexibility on the timing of share repurchases across the 5-quarter CCAR approval period. Accordingly, the exact timing and size of our repurchases in 2015 will be driven by many factors, including but not limited to, the levels of our earnings and the demand for other capital uses.
Looking at our capital ratios on the bottom of the slide, you'll see a more significant increase year-over-year in our Tier 1 capital ratio. This was driven by the $1.6 billion in preferred issuances we executed during the last 2 quarters.
As a reminder, we will see the EPS impact from the dividend payments associated with these issuances beginning in Q2. These payments will reduce our net income available to common shareholders by approximately $20 million each quarter.
Stepping back from these quarterly results. Our strong relative performance in the 2015 CCAR process and the FEDs non objection to our capital plan clearly illustrates the strength of our capital position and business model. This reinforces our confidence in the company's ability to generate capital while maintaining its financial strength. And we remain committed to using that capital strength to create value for our shareholders.
Before moving on to your questions, let me make just a few final comments, stepping away from the complexity I just took you through and going back to the key themes at our results. We believe that our core underlying performance this quarter was solid and reflected the continued strength of our business model and the trends we discussed last month at Investor Day. Earnings per share growth of 11% was better than our full year 2015 outlook in part due to some specific benefits in Q1, most notably in provision and operating expenses and also because we have not seen a ramp-up in incremental spending and growth initiatives. Clearly, given our 11% EPS growth in Q1, simple math would indicate that EPS growth would have to be negative for the balance of the year to meet our continued outlook for full year EPS growth to be flat to modestly down.
Looking at the second quarter in particular, I would remind you that you will begin to see the impact from our recent preferred share issuances and that the prior year EPS of $1.43 included in that benefit from the Business Travel joint venture transaction. Considering this, while it is obviously very early in the quarter, we would expect earnings per share in Q2 to be more significantly down from last year. All this is consistent with our previous comments that quarterly earnings performance would be more uneven than it has been historically when we go through this transitional period. Given this dynamic, our focus has been on our full year earnings outlook rather than our performance in any individual quarter. When we consider our Q1 performance and our Q2 comments in the context of the multiyear financial outlook that we reviewed at Investor Day, we believe we are on track and are continuing to do the right things to position the company for the long-term.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Rick for some details on our Q&A session."

Maybe let me start by providing just a little bit of context for Canada. Because we've given a fairly unusual amount of color around the U.S. where we've pointed out that, that relationship consists of about 70% of the co-brand spend being out of store. We also talked about the co-brand in the U.S. accounting for about 8% of global billings. Just to draw a contrast to Canada, in Canada, the Costco co-brand and Costco as a merchant have represented a more significant portion of our country total billings in Canada. The other probably 2 very important differences to point out to you are that the portion of the spend on the Costco Canada co-brand that was in store was much higher, it was about 60% in-store and of course in Canada there was no sale of the portfolio. So with all that as context, you are correct that this is the first full quarter since the termination of acceptance of Amex products in Canada on January 1. As you would expect, that means all of the in-store spend goes away. But we, while it's still early, I would say continue to be pleased as you heard us say in a couple forums by our efforts to capture the spend and lend of the Canadian Costco card members. And of course in Canada, we did issue a new cash back card. As you would expect, we are very focused on those customers who clearly have an affinity with the American Express brand. And I'd say there have been significant learnings and we are encouraged by them and we are being very thoughtful about how we will apply them in the U.S. As you would expect, Sanjay, I probably don't want to provide a lot of color and detail beyond that general statement. But we are encouraged one quarter end."

I really, in terms of the progress, potential outcome done on any portfolio sale, I can't really comment beyond what we've already said, which is we'll just have to see. There's a process and we'll see how it plays out. In terms of the financial outlook we have provided, I would remind everyone that we did not include any assumption about a gain on the sale of the portfolio. So any gain would be incremental to the outlook we laid out. When you think about capital applications obviously, if there is a portfolio sale, there's a significant reduction in risk weighted assets since the Costco, the U.S. loan portfolio, as we previously talked about, constituted about 20% of our global loan portfolio. Than, in and of itself, depending upon how quickly we ramp our efforts elsewhere to replace that spend, that, of course, frees up some capital. And to the extent there is a sale and there is a gain, I think it's fair to say that we would have to look at the timing and amount of any gain and think about what portion of it we might want to use to make sure we're fully funding our efforts to capture the future spend and lend of our relationships with the Costco card members and what portion should drop to bottom line, including we have a very strong balance sheet already. And I think we've demonstrated a very strong and steady commitment to using that balance sheet to return capital to the shareholders. It's also fair to say though that the nature and timing of the CCAR process means there's often a lag between big developments that impact capital and our ability to run them through the CCAR process. So we'll kind of have to see how this plays out. But hopefully, that gives you a sense, Don, about how we're thinking about the various components."

Let me make a few comments. One of the reasons why we have continued to talk a little bit about an expectation that you'll see more quarterly unevenness in our earnings is we think that the prudent thing here is to be a little flexible around the timing and amounts that we choose to spend around one of the things that we will be ramping, our growth spending initiatives or our growth initiatives spending, that's focusing on the capturing of future spend and lend from our relationship with the Costco card members. It's a very complex process between now and 2016 that will play out in that relationship and we need a little bit of flexibility that will determine when we choose ramp-up some of our marketing efforts and when we don't. Certainly, that is one of the elements though when you think about what is different this year potentially next year about the range of things that we do growth spending on. We have a very rich pool of very dedicated American Express card members and we will do our best to capture their future spend and lend. The second thing I want to point out for 2015 is we are very excited about the launch of Plenti since we [indiscernible] for coalition. As you would imagine or as you would recall, we have a pretty well traud [ph] track with the loyalty coalition business as we've launched it in other countries for understanding the flow. As you know, from the first year of launch, which is more of an investment year and then the program then matures in the coming years. So I think it's fair to say that we want to make sure that this is a really strong launch and we're putting a lot of resource towards that in 2015 and that's probably a little different in terms of the profile that you would've seen last year and a little different than what you will see next year as the program moves beyond the launch phase. Beyond those 2 things, I would say, really that we will be investing in the range of growth opportunities we have across the company. We try to do a few pretty thorough review of those at Investor Day and clearly spend the company. And you'll see us continue to invest in some of the international markets where we've seen particularly higher rates of growth. Maybe you'll see us continue to invest around our small business and middle-market efforts. You'll see us continue to invest in some of the areas where we believe expanding the breadth of the demographic that our brand reaches out to is producing new opportunities and you'll see us continue to do some things that we think will drive this steady growth and lending that you see above industry averages. So that's probably how we think about the spending overall."

So we have a range of businesses across American Express and, of course, we have a fairly unique business model in our core business. That range of businesses in that business model, produce a tremendous return on equity relative to most of our peers in financial services. And so we are thrilled that we have an ROE, which this quarter was 29% and we have got a really strong track record of meeting our more than 25% target. And I think it's a real commentary on the strength of our business model. But we shouldn't confuse that with hurdle rates for incremental investments or for how we think about bidding for business. Because of course if you really look at our cost of capital, you will of course get to numbers far, far below 25% and I could spend the rest of the call getting philosophical about exactly how you might calculate our cost of capital and we look at it as you would expect in many ways. But suffice it to say, it is much below 25% and it is somewhere around the 10% range depending on which measure you want to look at. And when we're thinking about incremental opportunities in a bidding situation, I don't really believe that we would take a different economic choice based strictly on a hurdle rate. Now we do make choices based on the next part of your question though, which is, we do have a range of opportunities in our business and we generate a range of returns on equity and retain a range of returns on an incremental dollar of expense spending as well. And so when we think about opportunity, we're always making sure that anything we do is going to generate incremental value for our shareholders and be above our returns on capital. But we also have to think about the range of opportunities and the financial and managerial resources that we have to allocate across those opportunities. And one of the things you've heard us talk a fair amount about, going all the way back to the February 12 investor call that Ken and I had on Costco, is as we thought about where we are with Costco, one of the things we thought about was the range of other opportunities we have, some of the non-financial -- financial constraints that a future contract might have entailed. And when we baked all of those things together, we came to the conclusion than in the long run we will be better off pursuing another path. But I think it will be a real misnomer for anyone to conclude from that, that, oh American Express is never going to pursue a transaction or piece of business that has a return on equity below 25%, so they're not competitive. Our job is to create value for shareholders. And of course, I'd like to create the highest possible ROE. I'd like to create it in the highest possible parts of our business. But if I can create a new chunk of business at something that is closer to our hurdle rate, we will absolutely of course pursue that business if it's the best alternative in the long run for the company."

I would have to call this quarter's provision, one that is certainly off the normal trend. I talked in my remarks about the fact that of course you have a normal Q4 to Q1 decline in your loan and receivable balances and that does generally drive a seasonal, therefore, decline in your reserves and that happened this year as it did last year. However, you have a combination of the fact that last year's first quarter had a few various more specific items that happened to drive that number up a little bit. This quarter we had some of the kind of specific adjustments or items that you have every quarter in the provision that happened to drive it down a little bit. If you put those 2 together and you suddenly get a really big year-over-year difference. I think the more -- which is why also in my remarks try to point people to, I think the more important thing to think about here is as we look at the rest of 2015 and, boy, the current economic environment, we expect write-off trends to escape pretty strong. However, we've been steadily growing our loan balances and you'd expect the reserves to build along with those loan balances and some of these specific items that drove the Q1 result, we wouldn't necessarily expect to repeat.

In essence, at the beginning of the quarter, we do a bunch of hedging that unwinds as to yet at the end of the quarter so we're not further impacted by anything that happens in the quarter. That obviously have 0 impact on our longer trend around the year-over-year declines. And as we think about doing any other kind of strategy longer-term to hedge our conclusion at the end of the day is that we think there's value in the diverse set of global businesses we have. We think in the long run, the currencies go up and down, and do we equilibrate over time. And that the operational costs and frankly the volatility that the accounting drives for any longer-term hedging strategy has caused us to shy away from it. So that's how we think about hedging. On the U.S., obviously, we'll have to see where the economy goes as we get into the rest of the year. I think it's fair to say from our experience in the first quarter, we haven't started to see estimates of GDP growth in the U.S. or elsewhere. But I think when we look at our own experience and some of the external data around retail sales, when we look at what's happening to gas prices, when we look at some of the -- admittedly, some of the anecdotal stories we hear in our Corporate Card business, it suggests to us that it was certain enough, the most robust of quarters for economic growth. So really in that environment for us to -- once you adjust for FX and last year's Business Travel to get 5% revenue growth, we feel pretty good about. When you think about the rest of the year, you are correct, I mean, we are off beat about OptBlue. It is a multiyear effort. I want to be clear that when Andre Williams on our team talked about it in the February financial community meeting last year, we talked about it in the context of 2015 to 2017. In that vein, we are encouraged that we actually signed up 400,000 merchants in 2014 and that is sort of, before we told you we sort of, ramped the program to March[ph] . So we do think, as we get into the latter part of 2015 that we should begin to see a meaningful benefit from OptBlue and we remain very encouraged by it. We obviously remain very encouraged by [indiscernible]. Our steady growth in the U.S. on growing our lend portfolio, we expect to able to continue and we think we're doing that without materially changing the risk profile of the company by really focusing on capturing a fair share of our card member spend. We are excited about our continued efforts around broadening the reach of the brand with things like the Everyday Card and we're excited about things like Plenti. And if you haven't focused on it, I'll point out that we are going to launch a Plenti co-brand, which we think will be a very interesting play it's just one more step on our pathway of broadening the demographic reach of the brand and the franchise. So we'll have to see where the economy goes and what the environment does but those are probably one of the things we're thinking about as we look at the rest of the year."

And what I would tell you for now, is certainly we see the billings impact [indiscernible] the drop from oil prices, remember it's 2% to 3% of our billings, so 30% drop costs about 1 point of billings growth. We do see some drop in spend from some of the oil services companies in the grand scheme of our overall billings. However, that does not total up to anything that is significant for us. We have not seen any significant deterioration in credit yet either by industry or parts of the U.S. or parts of the globe that are particularly driven by an oil economy. But believe me, we are watching all of that like a hawk. It's also difficult for us to say whether other people are taking their monies, their savings from slightly lower oil prices and using it to spur more spending elsewhere, that's tough for us to say I'm not saying its not happening by it. And I'm not sure we can really see any of it. So to come all the way back to the origin of your question, which is what's driving the sharper sequential decline in Corporate Card, I think we've done an [indiscernible] to say it doesn't appear to be isolated to oil services, it doesn't appear to be isolated to any particular industry or geography.

Because in the U.S. in fact, our loan growth is [indiscernible] 7% and has been about 6% to 7% rate for the last couple of quarters and I would say that if you look at the kinds of things that Ed in particular talked about in Investor Day, this is an area where we think we can run that number a little bit higher than in the current industry environment without any material change in our risk profile by continuing to grow from a marketing perspective, new customers as well as within existing customers both bring in or borrowing focused customers as well as capture more of our fair share of borrowing behavior of our existing customers. We're pretty upbeat about that, I think it's a real opportunity for the company. Internationally, we have a much, much smaller loan portfolio. We do think we can achieve steady growth that's masked right now by the very significant foreign exchange impacts you see and the fact that this goes into our third point, there was a loan portfolio associated with Costco Canada. While we didn't sell the portfolio as you would expect because, as I said earlier in response to a question, because 60% of the spend on the Canadian Costco co-brand was in-store as that's been [indiscernible] January 1, you'll see a more rapid decline in some of the loan balances as well so that will drag on the international piece a little bit. The third component to think about is Costco in the U.S. So we can't be sure of the outcome of any potential sale of the portfolio. But if that portfolio were to be sold, that represents 20% of our loans. So you could accelerate your growth excluding that by significant amounts of 7%, it's still going to take you a long time frankly to get back to even where we are today in terms of the overall loan portfolio and what that means for the spend centricity if you will of our overall income statement. So it's a long winded answer to your question but I think you do have to think about loan growth on the context of those 3 categories. So I think we have time for one last question, operator."

When you look at our open business which on the issuing side target small businesses, it's really all about helping drive the success of those businesses and giving them access to spend capacity that our business model and our charge card model really is able to fairly uniquely provide them.

We think it's a real value add for our partners, particularly some of our smaller business partners. So hopefully that strategy all fits together. It's really part of what we have to do everyday.

Overall, Q1 was a solid quarter for the company, consistent with the framework and financial outlook we presented at Investor Day last month. The quarter reflected solid core underlying performance as we",3740,"Well, thanks, Rick, and good afternoon, everyone. 
Overall, Q1 was a solid quarter for the company, consistent with the framework and financial outlook we presented at Investor Day last month. The quarter reflected solid core underlying performance as well as several discrete impacts, including the strengthening of the U.S. dollar and various changes to our co-brand relationships. 
As you recall, we discussed at Investor Day our expectations for the first quarter. And in fact, EPS growth of 11% did come in better than our full year outlook and even a little better than we thought a few weeks ago, in part due to the timing of our incremental spending on growth initiatives, which will ramp up over the course of the year, along with some other timing benefits that we don't expect to repeat as we go through the year. I'll discuss these items in more detail later in my remarks. Importantly for these reasons, our full year 2015 EPS outlook remains unchanged as we continue to expect EPS growth to be flat to modestly down.
Looking back to the financial outlook framework from Investor Day, our core underlying performance remained consistent and continued to be driven by solid revenue growth of 5% after adjusting for FX and Business Travel revenues in the prior year, disciplined cost controls and a strong balance sheet that enabled us to return a substantial amount of capital to shareholders in the form of repurchases over the past year.
Our results also reflect some of the discrete impacts that we discussed a few weeks ago. In the co-brand space, we are seeing the impact from the termination of our relationship with Costco in Canada as well as the reset impact from the early renewals we have done with several other co-brand partners, including Delta, Starwood and Cathay Pacific. In addition, the U.S. dollar continued to strengthen during the first quarter and represented a significant headwind to our quarterly earnings performance. 
Importantly, during the quarter, we also continued to have strong momentum on key initiatives. Highlights included the expansion of our small merchant coverage through OptBlue, the announcement of the Plenti loyalty coalition program in the U.S., assigning of a new Charles Schwab co-brand along with the renewal of our co-brand relationship with British Airways in Iberia as well as the announcement just today of our wearable payments partnership with Jawbone. We were also very pleased by our strong 2015 CCAR performance, which will provide us with the flexibility to increase our dividend and share repurchases going forward. As we discussed at Investor Day, we believe that these developments are indicative of the many attractive opportunities for growth that we have over the longer term.
So that is the quarter in a simple summary. As we get into the details, I will warn you that lapping the impact of 2014's Global Business Travel and Concur transactions, along with the 2015 discrete impacts of FX and our co-brand changes, all combined to make understanding our results this year a bit more complex than usual.
To begin now with our financial results for Q1, as you can see on Slide 2, reported billings growth was 3%. Like many other global companies, the strength of the U.S. dollar had a significant impact on our growth rates this quarter. As the dollar continued to strengthen, the magnitude of the FX impact increased and, for the first quarter, depressed our growth by nearly 4 percentage points. As a result, FX adjusted billings growth was 7%, significantly higher than our reported rate. I'll provide more details on our billings performance shortly. But lower gas prices in the U.S. and the termination of our relationship with Costco in Canada clearly had an impact on our results.
Reported revenue growth of negative 3% was, of course, also impacted by FX as well as the inclusion of Business Travel revenues in the prior year. Excluding these items, adjusted revenue growth was 5%, consistent with both the prior quarter and recent trends.
Net income grew by 6%, helped by disciplined expense control and lower provision costs, both of which also reflected some timing benefits in the quarter, which helped to offset the discrete impacts of FX and the changes in our co-brand relationships. 
Below the net income line, we continued to leverage our strong capital position to provide significant returns to our shareholders. Over the past year, we have repurchased 48 million shares, which translated to a 4% decline in average shares outstanding. This decline in shares outstanding, along with a modestly lower tax rate, drove the 11% diluted EPS growth that we generated during the first quarter. This performance also resulted in an ROE of 29% for the period ending March 31, well above our on-average and overtime target of 25% and demonstrate the continued strength of our business model.
Let's now move to a more detailed review of our key performance drivers during the first quarter, starting with billed business on Slide 3. On an FX adjusted basis, billings growth slowed modestly from 8% in Q4 to 7% during the quarter.
Looking at the results by segment. In our U.S. consumer and small business segment, growth also decelerated slightly to 7% in Q1. This performance was impacted by the more than 30% decline in gas prices year-over-year as well as slower retail sales growth consistent with industry-wide trends in the U.S. 
I would note that in the U.S., we did not see any material impact on our billings growth from the announced termination next year of our relationship with Costco. As we would have expected, however, we have started to see some slowing of new Costco co-brand card acquisitions, which, along with any future customer behavior changes that we may experience, will likely begin to impact our performance somewhat later this year. 
It's also worth noting on billings that the deceleration in Q1 was more pronounced in our GCS segment where billings were up 4% on an FX adjusted basis as we seem to see a slowdown in spending across a number of corporate customers primarily in the U.S.
GNS continues to be our strongest billings growth segment with FX adjusted growth of 16% during the quarter. This continued strong growth demonstrates the diversity of our business model, given the much higher than company average returns on equity we achieved in the GNS business.
Finally, ICS FX adjusted growth was 2% during Q1. But as we began to see last quarter, we saw very different trends by region, as you can see on Slide 4. 
The slowdown in international regions came primarily from LACC where volumes were down 4% versus the prior year, driven by a drop-off in Canadian billings. As you recall, we began to see volumes slow in Canada during Q4 when card acceptance at Costco in Canada was expanded to include other networks. Beginning January 1, American Express products were no longer accepted in Costco warehouses in Canada, and we are now seeing the full impact from the termination of this relationship on billed business.
In contrast to LACC, we saw improved growth in the JAPA region, which was again the fastest-growing region in the quarter, up 16% on an FX adjusted basis. This solid performance continued to be powered by strong growth in China and Japan.
In all international regions, you see that like other U.S. companies with a significant global footprint, our reported results are being significantly impacted by changes in foreign exchange rates. 
To provide you with some additional perspective here, on Slide 5, we have again included a comparison of our reported and FX adjusted revenue growth rates for the last 8 quarters. 
As you can see in the trajectory of the blue dotted line on the slide, our adjusted revenue growth remains consistent with recent trends in the 5% range. However, during the first quarter, foreign exchange had a more significant negative impact on our results than in prior periods, dragging adjusted revenue growth down by nearly 4 percentage points. At current FX rates, we would expect to see a similar drag in the second quarter.
As you can see in the second row, the bottom of the chart, the dollar has strengthened by 10% to 30% year-over-year against the currencies that we are most exposed to outside the U S. Now, of course, this revenue impact is partially offset by the benefit we receive from having certain expenses denominated in international currencies, but there is a bottom line impact especially when rates move this dramatically.
Over the longer term, we continued to believe that being a global company that generates revenue in a diverse set of markets around the world is a strength of our business model. 
As we discussed at Investor Day, however, if the current rates hold, FX will continue to have a significant discrete impact for the balance of the year.
Turning now to loans. You see on Slide 6 that worldwide loans are up 4% versus the prior year. Consistent with historical seasonal trends, we did see a drop-off in loan balances versus year end and a small sequential increase in net interest yields during the first quarter. In the U.S., which constitutes the majority of our loan portfolio, growth was relatively consistent to prior quarter at 7%. 
On the international side, reported loan balances were down year-over-year due to the negative impact from FX rates and the decline in loans related to the Costco Canada co-brand portfolio.
Stepping back, our loan growth has consistently been above the industry over the past 2 years, and we talked at Investor Day about the opportunity to continue this trend by growing share with existing card members as well as attracting new customers to our franchise.
Having said this, however, I'd also remind you that net interest income this quarter still made up only 18% of our total revenues. And given the expected runoff in loans associated with the Costco U.S. co-brand portfolio next year, even if we continue to grow our core loan portfolio at the higher rates we have seen, our overall business model will remain very spend-focused.
So now putting together our billings and loan performance, you see on Slide 7 that revenues declined 3% on a reported basis but increased by 5% after adjusting for FX and Business Travel revenues in the prior year. I'll note that revenue growth during the current quarter does reflect a portion of the negative impact from our co-brand partnership early renewals as well as a larger impact versus Q4 from the termination of our relationship with Costco in Canada. 
Even with these discrete impacts, however, adjusted revenue growth of 5% is consistent with the recent trend, illustrating the ongoing strength of our underlying core business.
The 2 largest components of revenue are, of course, discount revenue and net interest income. To start with the former, during the first quarter, discount revenue grew by 1%, which was approximately 200 basis points below the reported growth in billed business of 3%. The first driver of this difference was a decline in our reported discount rate which was down 2 basis points versus the prior year. This year-over-year decline is slightly smaller than in recent quarters, in part because the decline in Costco Canada merchant volume, where we are in the much lower discount rate, actually raises the company average discount rate. The discount rate also reflects continued growth in our OptBlue program as merchant acquirers actively sign up new merchants onto the American Express network.
As Ed discussed at Investor Day, 14 of the top 15 merchant acquirers in the U.S. are now part of OptBlue. Last year, when Anre Williams introduced this new program to you at the February Financial Community Meeting, he said that we expect to increase our small merchant acquisition by 50% or more for the next several years starting in 2015. And while this is obviously a multi-year effort, we, in fact, signed more than 400,000 new small merchants last year in 2014. So we are clearly off to a good start. We are also undertaking similar efforts to improve our small merchant coverage in many other markets around the world.
Also contributing to the gap between discount revenue and billed business growth was faster growth in both GNS volumes and Concur revenue items, including cash incentives and certain payments related to our renewed co-brand relationships.
Turning to the other key component of revenue, net interest income. We saw a healthy 8% growth rate driven by our continued efforts to grow our loan portfolio as well as lower funding costs. As the majority of our loan portfolio is in the U.S., the impact of FX is smaller on net interest income than on other revenue lines.
Moving now to credit performance on Slide 8. You can see that our lending credit metrics remain at or near historically low levels and that our write-off and delinquency rates both remained relatively consistent with recent trends. 
As you can see on Slide 9, despite this steady lending credit performance, provision expense dropped 13% versus the prior year. Typically, we experienced a reserve release during Q1 due to the seasonal decline in loans and receivable balances versus year end. The increase in the reserve release versus the prior year is largely due to charge card, where the prior period included a modest reserve build.
Moving to our lending reserve coverage levels on Slide 10. Coverage remained relatively consistent after considering the impact of the seasonal decline in loans and receivables I just mentioned. We believe coverage levels remain appropriate given the risk level inherent in the portfolio.
Thinking about the balance of the year, it is important to note that we would expect reserves to build modestly in line with loan growth and any changes in credit performance. Therefore, we would expect provision to increase year-over-year and to represent a headwind to growth for the remainder of 2015. 
Moreover, as we discussed at Investor Day, we did build into our multi-year financial outlook an assumption that we would see some steady upward tick in write-off rates and a modest build in reserves over the outlook period.
Moving below revenue now to expenses on Slide 11. On a reported basis, expenses declined by 5% versus the prior year. Excluding Business Travel expenses incurred in 2014, adjusted total expenses increased by 1% and also, of course, benefited somewhat from the strength of the U.S. dollar. 
I'll come back to operating expenses and marketing and promotion in a moment. First, however, I'll touch on a few other items on this slide. 
Rewards expense grew by 4%, which is relatively consistent with our reported billed business growth. Now rewards expense in the current quarter does include a portion of the discrete impact from our renewed co-brand relationships. The resulting [ph] increase in our rewards cost, however, was partially offset by some timing benefits this quarter related to our Membership Rewards program.
Next, while it's a relatively small percentage of total expenses, cost of card member services increased significantly year-over-year by 18%. As background, a portion of the expenses in this line are related to the payments we may provide partners for services such as baggage fees, companion tickets and airport lounge access, which have increased as a result of our renewed co-brand relationships. For the remainder of 2015, given that Q1 of last year also included elevated costs and costs of card member Services, we would expect to see an even higher level of growth for this line item.
Last on Slide 11. The tax rate during the first quarter was 34%, which was relatively consistent with recent quarters but slightly below the prior year. As we mentioned at Investor Day, our assumption is that the tax rate will remain roughly in line with recent performance during 2015.
Let's turn now to marketing and promotion expenses, which account for the majority of our spending on growth initiatives. Slide 12 shows the trend of these costs. And you see that while this quarter's marketing and promotion expenses were 4% higher than the prior year, you'll also notice that these costs have historically been much lower during each year's first quarter. More broadly as we think about 2015, we continued to evolve our plans around the timing and level of incremental spending on growth initiatives. As we have said, the majority but not all of this spending will occur in marketing and promotion. Considering this, we would expect marketing and promotion expenses to be relatively similar with the elevated levels of 2014, which you can see on this slide included higher levels of expenses in Q2 when we had the Business Travel joint venture transaction gain and in Q4 when we had the Concur gain. While we could have made the decision to reduce investments from their elevated 2014 levels, as we discussed at Investor Day, we believe that the right decision for shareholders to best position the company for the medium to long term is to keep investments at an elevated level this year in anticipation of the termination of our relationship with Costco in the U.S. during early 2016.
As Kenneth and Steve discussed in detail a few weeks ago, the incremental spending in 2015 will focus on the many growth opportunities that we see across all segments in our company, including our efforts to capture a meaningful portion of the spend and lend of our Costco card members in the U.S.
Turning now to operating expense performance on Slide 13. Our reported results continue to reflect the impact of Business Travel in the prior year across a number of expense categories complicating line by line comparisons. That said, excluding Business Travel expenses incurred in the prior year, adjusted operating expenses in total decreased by 2% in the quarter. I'll also note that during the quarter, we benefited from some specific items at the other net line, which we do not expect to repeat going forward. As you think about the balance of the year, I'd also point out that operating expenses have historically been lower during Q1.
Moving to Slide 14. Adjusted operating expense growth, of course, remained well below our stated 3% growth target. As we've discussed at Investor Day, maintaining disciplined control of our expenses, particularly operating expenses, remains a key driver of our earnings performance. As Steve noted that day, however, we are not achieving this disciplined expense control through a cutback in investment levels but rather through ongoing efforts to increase the efficiency of the organization. We continue to make substantial investments within operating expenses to support our growth initiatives.
Now switching to our capital performance on Slide 15. During the current quarter, we returned 65% of the capital we generated to shareholders while strengthening our already strong capital ratios. As I mentioned at Investor Day, share repurchases of approximately $750 million for the first quarter were below the amount included in our 2014 CCAR submission due to some nuances in the 2014 CCAR rules associated with the capital generated by employee plans. These rules have evolved for future CCAR periods but did cause our Q1 payout ratio to be somewhat lower than in recent quarters. 
I'd also point out that the 2015 CCAR process gives all participants more flexibility on the timing of share repurchases across the 5-quarter CCAR approval period. Accordingly, the exact timing and size of our repurchases in 2015 will be driven by many factors, including but not limited to the levels of our earnings and the demand for other capital uses.
Looking at our capital ratios on the bottom of the slide, you see a more significant increase year-over-year in our Tier 1 capital ratio. This was driven by the $1.6 billion in preferred issuances we executed during the last 2 quarters.
As a reminder, we will see the EPS impact from the dividend payments associated with these issuances beginning in Q2. These payments will reduce our net income available to common shareholders by approximately $20 million each quarter.
Stepping back from these quarterly results. Our strong relative performance in the 2015 CCAR process and the Fed non-objection to our capital plan clearly illustrate the strength of our capital position and business model. This reinforces our confidence in the company's ability to generate capital while maintaining its financial strength, and we remain committed to using that capital strength to create value for our shareholders.
Before moving on to your questions, let me make just a few final comments, stepping away from the complexity I just took you through and going back to the key themes in our results. We believe that our core underlying performance this quarter was solid and reflected the continued strength of our business model and the trends we discussed last month at Investor Day. Earnings per share growth of 11% was better than our full year 2015 outlook in part due to some specific benefits in Q1, most notably in provision and operating expenses, and also because we have not yet seen a ramp-up in incremental spending on growth initiatives. Clearly, given our 11% EPS growth in Q1, simple math would indicate that EPS growth would have to be negative for the balance of the year to meet our continued outlook for full year EPS growth to be flat to modestly down.
Looking at the second quarter, in particular, I would remind you that you will begin to see the impact from our recent preferred share issuances and that the prior year EPS of $1.43 included a net benefit from the Business Travel joint venture transaction. Considering this, while it is obviously very early in the quarter, we would expect earnings per share in Q2 to be more significantly down from last year. All this is consistent with our previous comments that quarterly earnings performance will be more uneven than it has been historically while we go through this transitional period. Given this dynamic, our focus has been on our full year earnings outlook rather than our performance in any individual quarter. When we consider our Q1 performance and our Q2 comments in the context of the multi-year financial outlook that we reviewed at Investor Day, we believe we are on track and are continuing to do the right things to position the company for the long term.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Rick for some details on our Q&A session."

Maybe let me start by providing just a little bit of context for Canada, because we've given a fairly unusual amount of color around the U.S. where we've pointed out that, that relationship consists of about 70% of the co-brand spend being out of store and also talked about the co-brand in the U.S. accounting for about 8% of global billings. Just to draw a contrast to Canada, in Canada, the Costco co-brand and Costco as a merchant are representing a more significant portion of our country total billings in Canada. The other probably 2 very important differences to point out to you are that the portion of spend on the Costco Canada co-brand that was in-store was much higher. It was about 60% in-store. And of course, in Canada, there was no sale of the portfolio. So with all that as context, you are correct that this is the first full quarter since the termination of acceptance of Amex products in Canada on January 1. As you would expect, that means all of the in-store spend goes away. But we, while it's still early, I would say continue to be pleased, as you've now heard us say in a couple forums, by our efforts to capture the spend and lend of the Canadian Costco card members. And of course, in Canada, we did issue a new cash back card. As you would expect, we are very focused on those customers who clearly have an affinity with the American Express brand. And I'd say there have been significant learnings, and we are encouraged by them. And we are being very thoughtful about how we will apply them in the U.S. As you would expect, Sanjay, I probably don't want to provide a lot of color and detail beyond that general statement, but we're encouraged one quarter in."

I really -- in terms of the progress, potential outcome done on any portfolio sale, I can't really comment beyond what we've already said, which is we'll just have to see. There's a process and we'll see how it plays out. In terms of the financial outlook we have provided, I would remind everyone that we did not include any assumption about a gain on the sale of the portfolio. So any gain would be incremental to the outlook we laid out. When you think about capital implications, obviously, if there is a portfolio sale, there's a significant reduction in risk weighted assets since the Costco, the U.S. loan portfolio, as we previously talked about, constituted about 20% of our global loan portfolio. That -- in and of itself, depending upon how quickly we ramp our efforts elsewhere to replace that spend, that, of course, frees up some capital. And to the extent there is a sale and there is a gain, I think it's fair to say that we'd have to look at the timing and amount of any gain and think about what portion of it we might want to use to make sure we're fully funding our efforts to capture the future spend and lend of our relationships with the Costco card members and what portion should drop to the bottom line, including we have a very strong balance sheet already. And I think we've demonstrated a very strong and steady commitment to using that balance sheet to return capital to shareholders. It's also fair to say though that the nature and timing of the CCAR process means there's often a lag between big developments that impact capital and our ability to run them through the CCAR process. So we'll kind of have to see how this plays out. But hopefully, that gives you a sense, Don, of how we're thinking about the various components."

Let me make a few comments. One of the reasons why we have continued to talk a little bit about an expectation that you'll see more quarterly unevenness in our earnings is we think the prudent thing here is to be a little flexible around the timing and amounts that we choose to spend around one of the things that we will be ramping, our growth spending initiatives -- or our growth initiatives spending on, that's focusing on the capturing of future spend and lend from our relationship with the Costco card members. It's a very complex process between now and 2016 that will play out in that relationship. And we need a little bit of flexibility that will determine when we choose to ramp up some of our marketing efforts and when we don't. Certainly, that is one of the elements though when you think about what is different this year, potentially next year, about the range of things that we do growth spending on. We have a very rich pool of very dedicated American Express card members, and we will do our best to capture their future spend and lend. The second thing I might point out for 2015 is we are very excited about the launch of Plenti since you brought up [indiscernible] coalition. As you would imagine or as you would recall, we have a pretty well trod track with the loyalty coalition business as we've launched it in other countries for understanding the flow as you go from the first year of launch, which is more of an investment year and as the program then matures in the coming years. So I think it's fair to say that we want to make sure this is a really strong launch. And we're putting a lot of resource towards that in 2015, and that's probably a little different in terms of the profile that you would have seen last year and a little different than what you will see next year as the program moves beyond the launch phase. Beyond those 2 things, I would say, really, that we will be investing in the range of growth opportunities we have across the company. We try to do a pretty thorough overview of those at Investor Day and then clearly expand [ph] the company. So we'll -- you'll see us continue to invest in some of the international markets where we've seen particularly higher rates of growth. Maybe you'll see us continue to invest around our small business and middle-market efforts. You'll see us continue to invest in some of the areas where we believe expanding the breadth of the demographic that our brand reaches out to is producing new opportunities. And you'll see us continue to do some things that we think will drive this steady growth in lending that you've seen above industry averages. So that's probably how we think about the spending overall."

So we have a range of businesses across American Express, and, of course, we have a fairly unique business model in our core business. That range of businesses and that business model produce a tremendous return on equity relative to most of our peers in financial services. And so we are thrilled that we have an ROE, which this quarter was 29%, and we have a really strong track record of meeting our more than 25% target. And I think it's a real commentary on the strength of our business model. But we shouldn't confuse that with hurdle rates for incremental investments or for how we think about bidding for business. Because, of course, if you really look at our cost of capital, you will, of course, get to numbers far, far below 25%. And I could spend the rest of the call getting philosophical about exactly how you might calculate our cost of capital and we look at it as you would expect in many ways. But suffice it to say, it is much below 25%, and it is somewhere around the 10% range, depending on which measure you want to look at. And when we're thinking about incremental opportunities in a bidding situation, I don't really believe that we would take a different economic choice based strictly on a hurdle rate. Now we do make choices based on the next part of your question, though, which is we do have a range of opportunities in our business and we generate a range of returns on equity and a range of returns on an incremental dollar of expense spending as well. And so when we think about opportunities, we're always making sure that anything we do is going to generate incremental value for our shareholders and be above our returns on capital. But we also have to think about the range of opportunities and the financial and managerial resources that we have to allocate across those opportunities. And one of the things you've heard us talk a fair amount about, going all the way back to the February 12 Investor Call that Ken and I had on Costco, is as we thought about where we were with Costco, one of the things we really thought about was the range of other opportunities we have, some of the non-financial constraints that a future contract might have entailed. And when we baked all of those things together, we came to the conclusion that in the long run, we would be better off pursuing another path. But I think it would be a real misnomer for anyone to conclude from that, that, oh, American Express is never going to pursue a transaction or a piece of business that has a return on equity below 25%, so they're not competitive. And our job is to create value for our shareholders. And if -- of course, I'd like to create it at the highest possible ROE. I'd like to create it in the highest possible parts of our business. But if I can create a new chunk of business at something that is closer to our hurdle rate, we will absolutely, of course, pursue that business if it's the best alternative in the long run for the company."

I would have to call this quarter's provision, one that is certainly off the normal trend. I talked in my remarks about the fact that, of course, you have a normal Q4 to Q1 decline in your loan and receivable balances and that does generally drive a seasonal, therefore, decline in your reserves. And that happened this year as it did last year. However, you have a combination of the fact that last year's first quarter had a few various, more specific items that happened to drive that number up a little bit. This quarter, we had some of the kinds of specific adjustments or items that you have every quarter and the provision that happened to drive it down a little bit. You put those 2 together and you suddenly get a really big year-over-year difference. I think the more -- which is why I also in my remarks try to point people to, I think, the more important thing to think about here is as we look at the rest of 2015, boy, in the current economic environment, we'd expect write-off trends to escape pretty strong. However, we've been steadily growing our loan balances, and you'd expect reserves to build along with those loan balances. And some of the specific items that drove the Q1 result, we wouldn't necessarily expect to repeat. So you put all that together and I would expect to see provision going up year-over-year in 2015. And then I'd also just remind you that in terms of what assumptions we made in the financial outlook we've given for 2016 and 2017, we did assume in 2016 and '17 that you do see some modest uptick in write-off rates and hence provision and reserves."

Now, certainly, there are some things that could drive you above that. If there is a gain on a sale, for example, that is clearly not in our outlook and would be incremental. But we just don't know enough about the final outcome and the timing of the final outcome to be specific beyond the comments I just made."

On hedging, so we do some foreign exchange hedging, but it's really about, frankly, helping us have a clear view from a planning perspective within a quarter. It helps us know what the FX impact is going to be. In essence, at the beginning of the quarter, we do a bunch of hedging that unwinds as you get to the end of the quarter. So you're not further impacted by anything that happens in the quarter. That obviously has 0 impact on our longer-term trend or on the year-over-year declines. And as we think about doing any other kind of strategy, longer term, to hedge, our conclusion at the end of the day is that we think there's value in the diverse set of global businesses we have. We think in the long run, currencies go up and down and tend to equilibrate over time. And that the frictional costs and, frankly, the volatility that the accounting drives for any longer-term hedging strategy has caused us to shy away from it. So that's how we think about hedging. On the U.S., obviously, we'll have to see where the economy goes as we get into the rest of the year. I think it's fair to say from our experience in the first quarter, we haven't started to see estimates of GDP growth in the U.S. or elsewhere. But I think when we look at our own experience and some of the external data around retail sales, when we look at what's happening to gas prices, when we look at some of the -- admittedly, some anecdotal stories we hear in our Corporate Card business, it suggests to us that it was certainly not the most robust of quarters for economic growth. So really, in that environment, for us to -- once you adjust for FX and last year's Business Travel get to 5% revenue growth, we actually feel pretty good about it. When you think about the rest of the year, you are correct, I mean, we're upbeat about OptBlue. It is a multi-year effort. I want to be clear that when Anre Williams on our team first talked about it in the February Financial Community Meeting last year, we talked about it in the context of sort of 2015 to 2017. In that vein, we are encouraged that we actually signed up 400,000 merchants in 2014, and that was sort of before we told you we start to ramp the program much. So we do think, as we get into the latter part of 2015, that we should begin to see a meaningful benefit from OptBlue, and we remain very encouraged by it. And we obviously remain very encouraged by lots of other things in the market. Our steady growth in the U.S. and growing our lend portfolio, we expect to be able to continue. And we think we are doing that without materially changing the risk profile of the company by really focusing on capturing a fairer share of our card member spend. We're excited about our continued efforts around broadening the reach of the brand with things like the Everyday Card, and we're excited about things like Plenti. If you haven't focused on it, I'll point out to you, we are going to launch a Plenti co-brand, which we think will be a very interesting play. It's just one more step on our pathway of broadening the demographic reach of the brand and the franchise. So we'll have to see where the economy goes and what the environment does; but those are probably some of the things we're thinking about as we look at the rest of the year."

As we have dug into that a little bit, it is primarily driven by the U.S. and seems to be a little bit more striking in our larger accounts in the U.S. In terms of what this means for the broader economy 6 months from now, I guess I'd be cautious. One, if you look at corporate spending, it tends to be a little bit more volatile than some of our other segments because companies have gotten pretty good over the years at turning on and off their travel spend and other T&E spend in response to their own business challenges and own sense of the economic environment. I think in any part of our business, we're always cautious about saying does 1 quarter make trend. So we'll have to see. I guess I'd say its a note of caution for us, but I wouldn't want to read too much into it at this point in time."

So maybe I'll even take this opportunity to step back a little bit. Certainly, we are watching very closely across our global portfolio for any impact, both billings and credit, arising from the rather dramatic drop in oil prices. And what I would tell you for now is, certainly, we see the billings impact with the drop in oil prices. Remember, it's 2% to 3% of our billings, so a 30% drop costs about 1 point of billings growth. We do see some drop in spend from some of the oil services companies in the grand scheme of our overall billings. However, that does not total up to anything that is significant for us. We have not seen any significant deterioration in credit yet either by industry or parts of the U.S. or parts of the globe that are particularly driven by an oil economy. But believe me, we are watching all of that like a hawk. It's also difficult for us to say, well, are people taking the monies, their savings from slightly lower oil prices and using it to spur more spending elsewhere, that's tough for us to see. I'm not saying it's not happening, but I'm not sure we can really see any of it. So to come all the way back to the origin of your question, which is what's driving the sharper sequential decline in Corporate Card, I think we've done enough work to say it doesn't appear to be isolated to oil services. It doesn't appear to be isolated to any particular industry or geography, any -- with any finer point than it is primarily U.S., not in other parts of the world."

Because in the U.S., in fact, our loan growth is [indiscernible] 7% and has been running up at the 6% to 7% rate for the last couple of quarters. And I would say that if you look at the kinds of things that Ed, in particular, talked about at Investor Day, this is an area where we think we could run that number up a little higher than that in the current industry environment without any material change in our risk profile by continuing to grow from a marketing perspective, new customers as well as within existing customers, both bring in our borrowing focused customers as well as capture more of our fair share of the borrowing behavior of our existing customers. We're pretty upbeat about that. I think it's a real opportunity for the company. Internationally, we have a much, much smaller loan portfolio. We do think we can achieve steady growth that's masked right now by the very significant foreign exchange impacts you see and the fact that, and this goes in our third point, there was a loan portfolio associated with Costco Canada. While we didn't sell the portfolio, as you would expect, because the -- as I said earlier in response to a question, because 60% of the spend on the Canadian Costco co-brand was in-store, as that spend went away January 1, you see a more rapid decline in some of the loan balances as well. So that will drag on the international piece a little bit. The third component to think about is Costco in the U.S. So we can't be sure of the outcome of any potential sale of the portfolio. But if that portfolio were to be sold, it represents 20% of our loans. So you could accelerate your growth, excluding that, by a significant amount from 7%. It's still going to take you a long time, frankly, to get back to even where we are today in terms of the overall loan portfolio and what that means for the spend-centricity, if you will, of our overall income statement. So long-winded answer to your question, but I think you do have to think about loan growth in the context of those 3 categories. So I think we have time for one last question, operator."

We're very excited about the OptBlue program, and we think it is making it easier for smaller merchants to work with us. We think it's going to expand their business opportunities, and we're very excited about what it will do for merchant coverage over the next few years. We do lots of things to try to help small businesses operate better. When you look at our open business, which on the issuing side targets small businesses, it's really all about helping drive the success of those businesses and giving them access to spend capacity that our business model and our charge card model really is able to fairly uniquely provide them. And we really try to use that and have used it over the years to drive to a very significant position in small businesses. Things we do like Small Business Saturday are another example of what we do to help drive value and support for our merchants. Merchant financing in that context is just another extension of the same driver we have to constantly work at how do we find new ways to add value to merchants. Very excited about merchant financing and we think it is not only a good opportunity for us to, in a very thoughtful, measured risk profile-centric way, grow our financing portfolio. We think it's a real value add for our partners, particularly some of our smaller business partners. So hopefully that strategy all fits together. It's really part of what we have to do every day.

I would summarize by coming back to the fact that we think our results in the first quarter reflect solid core underlying performance. When you think about our Q1 performance and what I said today about Q2 and when you think about it in the context of the multi-year financial outlook that we reviewed at Investor Day, we think we're on track, and we're continuing to do the right things to position the company for the long term.

Overall, Q1 was a solid quarter for the company, consistent with the framework and financial outlook we presented at Investor Day last month. The quarter reflected solid core underlying performance as we",3740,"Well, thanks, Rick, and good afternoon, everyone. 
Overall, Q1 was a solid quarter for the company, consistent with the framework and financial outlook we presented at Investor Day last month. The quarter reflected solid core underlying performance as well as several discrete impacts, including the strengthening of the U.S. dollar and various changes to our co-brand relationships. 
As you recall, we discussed at Investor Day our expectations for the first quarter. And in fact, EPS growth of 11% did come in better than our full year outlook and even a little better than we thought a few weeks ago, in part due to the timing of our incremental spending on growth initiatives, which will ramp up over the course of the year, along with some other timing benefits that we don't expect to repeat as we go through the year. I'll discuss these items in more detail later in my remarks. Importantly for these reasons, our full year 2015 EPS outlook remains unchanged as we continue to expect EPS growth to be flat to modestly down.
Looking back to the financial outlook framework from Investor Day, our core underlying performance remained consistent and continued to be driven by solid revenue growth of 5% after adjusting for FX and Business Travel revenues in the prior year, disciplined cost controls and a strong balance sheet that enabled us to return a substantial amount of capital to shareholders in the form of repurchases over the past year.
Our results also reflect some of the discrete impacts that we discussed a few weeks ago. In the co-brand space, we are seeing the impact from the termination of our relationship with Costco in Canada as well as the reset impact from the early renewals we have done with several other co-brand partners, including Delta, Starwood and Cathay Pacific. In addition, the U.S. dollar continued to strengthen during the first quarter and represented a significant headwind to our quarterly earnings performance. 
Importantly, during the quarter, we also continued to have strong momentum on key initiatives. Highlights included the expansion of our small merchant coverage through OptBlue, the announcement of the Plenti loyalty coalition program in the U.S., the signing of a new Charles Schwab co-brand along with the renewal of our co-brand relationship with British Airways in Iberia as well as the announcement just today of our wearable payments partnership with Jawbone. We were also very pleased by our strong 2015 CCAR performance, which will provide us with the flexibility to increase our dividend and share repurchases going forward. As we discussed at Investor Day, we believe that these developments are indicative of the many attractive opportunities for growth that we have over the longer term.
So that is the quarter in a simple summary. As we get into the details, I will warn you that lapping the impact of 2014's Global Business Travel and Concur transactions, along with the 2015 discrete impacts of FX and our co-brand changes, all combined to make understanding our results this year a bit more complex than usual.
To begin now with our financial results for Q1, as you can see on Slide 2, reported billings growth was 3%. Like many other global companies, the strength of the U.S. dollar had a significant impact on our growth rates this quarter. As the dollar continued to strengthen, the magnitude of the FX impact increased and, for the first quarter, depressed our growth by nearly 4 percentage points. As a result, FX adjusted billings growth was 7%, significantly higher than our reported rate. I'll provide more details on our billings performance shortly. But lower gas prices in the U.S. and the termination of our relationship with Costco in Canada clearly had an impact on our results.
Reported revenue growth of negative 3% was, of course, also impacted by FX as well as the inclusion of Business Travel revenues in the prior year. Excluding these items, adjusted revenue growth was 5%, consistent with both the prior quarter and recent trends.
Net income grew by 6%, helped by disciplined expense control and lower provision costs, both of which also reflected some timing benefits in the quarter, which helped to offset the discrete impacts of FX and the changes in our co-brand relationships. 
Below the net income line, we continued to leverage our strong capital position to provide significant returns to our shareholders. Over the past year, we have repurchased 48 million shares, which translated to a 4% decline in average shares outstanding. This decline in shares outstanding, along with a modestly lower tax rate, drove the 11% diluted EPS growth that we generated during the first quarter. This performance also resulted in an ROE of 29% for the period ending March 31, well above our on-average and over time target of 25% and demonstrate the continued strength of our business model.
Let's now move to a more detailed review of our key performance drivers during the first quarter, starting with billed business on Slide 3. On an FX adjusted basis, billings growth slowed modestly from 8% in Q4 to 7% during the quarter.
Looking at the results by segment. In our U.S. consumer and small business segment, growth also decelerated slightly to 7% in Q1. This performance was impacted by the more than 30% decline in gas prices year-over-year as well as slower retail sales growth consistent with industry-wide trends in the U.S. 
I would note that in the U.S., we did not see any material impact on our billings growth from the announced termination next year of our relationship with Costco. As we would have expected, however, we have started to see some slowing of new Costco co-brand card acquisitions, which, along with any future customer behavior changes that we may experience, will likely begin to impact our performance somewhat later this year. 
It's also worth noting on billings that the deceleration in Q1 was more pronounced in our GCS segment where billings were up 4% on an FX adjusted basis as we seem to see a slowdown in spending across a number of corporate customers primarily in the U.S.
GNS continues to be our strongest billings growth segment with FX adjusted growth of 16% during the quarter. This continued strong growth demonstrates the diversity of our business model, given the much higher than company average returns on equity we achieved in the GNS business.
Finally, ICS FX adjusted growth was 2% during Q1. But as we began to see last quarter, we saw very different trends by region, as you can see on Slide 4. 
The slowdown in international regions came primarily from LACC where volumes were down 4% versus the prior year, driven by a drop-off in Canadian billings. As you recall, we began to see volumes slow in Canada during Q4 when card acceptance at Costco in Canada was expanded to include other networks. Beginning January 1, American Express products were no longer accepted in Costco warehouses in Canada, and we are now seeing the full impact from the termination of this relationship on billed business.
In contrast to LACC, we saw improved growth in the JAPA region, which was again the fastest-growing region in the quarter, up 16% on an FX adjusted basis. This solid performance continued to be powered by strong growth in China and Japan.
In all international regions, you see that like other U.S. companies with a significant global footprint, our reported results are being significantly impacted by changes in foreign exchange rates. 
To provide you with some additional perspective here, on Slide 5, we have again included a comparison of our reported and FX adjusted revenue growth rates for the last 8 quarters. 
As you can see in the trajectory of the blue dotted line on the slide, our adjusted revenue growth remains consistent with recent trends in the 5% range. However, during the first quarter, foreign exchange had a more significant negative impact on our results than in prior periods, dragging adjusted revenue growth down by nearly 4 percentage points. At current FX rates, we would expect to see a similar drag in the second quarter.
As you can see in the second row, the bottom of the chart, the dollar has strengthened by 10% to 30% year-over-year against the currencies that we are most exposed to outside the U S. Now, of course, this revenue impact is partially offset by the benefit we receive from having certain expenses denominated in international currencies, but there is a bottom line impact especially when rates move this dramatically.
Over the longer term, we continued to believe that being a global company that generates revenue in a diverse set of markets around the world is a strength of our business model. 
As we discussed at Investor Day, however, if the current rates hold, FX will continue to have a significant discrete impact for the balance of the year.
Turning now to loans. You see on Slide 6 that worldwide loans are up 4% versus the prior year. Consistent with historical seasonal trends, we did see a drop-off in loan balances versus year end and a small sequential increase in net interest yields during the first quarter. In the U.S., which constitutes the majority of our loan portfolio, growth was relatively consistent to prior quarter at 7%. 
On the international side, reported loan balances were down year-over-year due to the negative impact from FX rates and the decline in loans related to the Costco Canada co-brand portfolio.
Stepping back, our loan growth has consistently been above the industry over the past 2 years, and we talked at Investor Day about the opportunity to continue this trend by growing share with existing card members as well as attracting new customers to our franchise.
Having said this, however, I'd also remind you that net interest income this quarter still made up only 18% of our total revenues. And given the expected runoff in loans associated with the Costco U.S. co-brand portfolio next year, even if we continue to grow our core loan portfolio at the higher rates we have seen, our overall business model will remain very spend-focused.
So now putting together our billings and loan performance, you see on Slide 7 that revenues declined 3% on a reported basis but increased by 5% after adjusting for FX and Business Travel revenues in the prior year. I'll note that revenue growth during the current quarter does reflect a portion of the negative impact from our co-brand partnership early renewals as well as a larger impact versus Q4 from the termination of our relationship with Costco in Canada. 
Even with these discrete impacts, however, adjusted revenue growth of 5% is consistent with the recent trend, illustrating the ongoing strength of our underlying core business.
The 2 largest components of revenue are, of course, discount revenue and net interest income. To start with the former, during the first quarter, discount revenue grew by 1%, which was approximately 200 basis points below the reported growth in billed business of 3%. The first driver of this difference was a decline in our reported discount rate which was down 2 basis points versus the prior year. This year-over-year decline is slightly smaller than in recent quarters, in part because the decline in Costco Canada merchant volume, where we earned a much lower discount rate, actually raises the company average discount rate. The discount rate also reflects continued growth in our OptBlue program as merchant acquirers actively sign up new merchants onto the American Express network.
As Ed discussed at Investor Day, 14 of the top 15 merchant acquirers in the U.S. are now part of OptBlue. Last year, when Anre Williams introduced this new program to you at the February Financial Community Meeting, he said that we expect to increase our small merchant acquisition by 50% or more for the next several years starting in 2015. And while this is obviously a multi-year effort, we, in fact, signed more than 400,000 new small merchants last year in 2014. So we are clearly off to a good start. We are also undertaking similar efforts to improve our small merchant coverage in many other markets around the world.
Also contributing to the gap between discount revenue and billed business growth was faster growth in both GNS volumes and Concur revenue items, including cash incentives and certain payments related to our renewed co-brand relationships.
Turning to the other key component of revenue, net interest income. We saw a healthy 8% growth rate driven by our continued efforts to grow our loan portfolio as well as lower funding costs. As the majority of our loan portfolio is in the U.S., the impact of FX is smaller on net interest income than on other revenue lines.
Moving now to credit performance on Slide 8. You can see that our lending credit metrics remain at or near historically low levels and that our write-off and delinquency rates both remained relatively consistent with recent trends. 
As you can see on Slide 9, despite this steady lending credit performance, provision expense dropped 13% versus the prior year. Typically, we experienced a reserve release during Q1 due to the seasonal decline in loans and receivable balances versus year end. The increase in the reserve release versus the prior year is largely due to charge card, where the prior period included a modest reserve build.
Moving to our lending reserve coverage levels on Slide 10. Coverage remained relatively consistent after considering the impact of the seasonal decline in loans and receivables I just mentioned. We believe coverage levels remain appropriate given the risk level inherent in the portfolio.
Thinking about the balance of the year, it is important to note that we would expect reserves to build modestly in line with loan growth and any changes in credit performance. Therefore, we would expect provision to increase year-over-year and to represent a headwind to growth for the remainder of 2015. 
Moreover, as we discussed at Investor Day, we did build into our multi-year financial outlook an assumption that we would see some steady upward tick in write-off rates and a modest build in reserves over the outlook period.
Moving below revenue now to expenses on Slide 11. On a reported basis, expenses declined by 5% versus the prior year. Excluding Business Travel expenses incurred in 2014, adjusted total expenses increased by 1% and also, of course, benefited somewhat from the strength of the U.S. dollar. 
I'll come back to operating expenses and marketing and promotion in a moment. First, however, I'll touch on a few other items on this slide. 
Rewards expense grew by 4%, which is relatively consistent with our reported billed business growth. Now rewards expensed in the current quarter does include a portion of the discrete impact from our renewed co-brand relationships. The resulting increase in our rewards cost, however, was partially offset by some timing benefits this quarter related to our Membership Rewards program.
Next, while it's a relatively small percentage of total expenses, cost of card member services increased significantly year-over-year by 18%. As background, a portion of the expenses in this line are related to the payments we may provide partners for services such as baggage fees, companion tickets and airport lounge access, which have increased as a result of our renewed co-brand relationships. For the remainder of 2015, given that Q1 of last year also included elevated costs and costs of card member Services, we would expect to see an even higher level of growth for this line item.
Last on Slide 11. The tax rate during the first quarter was 34%, which was relatively consistent with recent quarters but slightly below the prior year. As we mentioned at Investor Day, our assumption is that the tax rate will remain roughly in line with recent performance during 2015.
Let's turn now to marketing and promotion expenses, which account for the majority of our spending on growth initiatives. Slide 12 shows the trend of these costs. And you see that while this quarter's marketing and promotion expenses were 4% higher than the prior year, you'll also notice that these costs have historically been much lower during each year's first quarter. More broadly as we think about 2015, we continued to evolve our plans around the timing and level of incremental spending on growth initiatives. As we have said, the majority but not all of this spending will occur in marketing and promotion. Considering this, we would expect marketing and promotion expenses to be relatively similar with the elevated levels of 2014, which you can see on this slide included higher levels of expenses in Q2 when we had the Business Travel joint venture transaction gain and in Q4 when we had the Concur gain. While we could have made the decision to reduce investments from their elevated 2014 levels, as we discussed at Investor Day, we believe that the right decision for shareholders to best position the company for the medium to long term is to keep investments at an elevated level this year in anticipation of the termination of our relationship with Costco in the U.S. during early 2016.
As Kenneth and Steve discussed in detail a few weeks ago, the incremental spending in 2015 will focus on the many growth opportunities that we see across all segments in our company, including our efforts to capture a meaningful portion of the spend and lend of our Costco card members in the U.S.
Turning now to operating expense performance on Slide 13. Our reported results continue to reflect the impact of Business Travel in the prior year across a number of expense categories complicating line by line comparisons. That said, excluding Business Travel expenses incurred in the prior year, adjusted operating expenses in total decreased by 2% in the quarter. I'll also note that during the quarter, we benefited from some specific items at the other net line, which we do not expect to repeat going forward. As you think about the balance of the year, I'd also point out that operating expenses have historically been lower during Q1.
Moving to Slide 14. Adjusted operating expense growth, of course, remained well below our stated 3% growth target. As we've discussed at Investor Day, maintaining disciplined control of our expenses, particularly operating expenses, remains a key driver of our earnings performance. As Steve noted that day, however, we are not achieving this disciplined expense control through a cutback in investment levels but rather through ongoing efforts to increase the efficiency of the organization. We continue to make substantial investments within operating expenses to support our growth initiatives.
Now switching to our capital performance on Slide 15. During the current quarter, we returned 65% of the capital we generated to shareholders while strengthening our already strong capital ratios. As I mentioned at Investor Day, share repurchases of approximately $750 million for the first quarter were below the amount included in our 2014 CCAR submission due to some nuances in the 2014 CCAR rules associated with the capital generated by employee plans. These rules have evolved for future CCAR periods but did cause our Q1 payout ratio to be somewhat lower than in recent quarters. 
I'd also point out that the 2015 CCAR process gives all participants more flexibility on the timing of share repurchases across the 5-quarter CCAR approval period. Accordingly, the exact timing and size of our repurchases in 2015 will be driven by many factors, including but not limited to the levels of our earnings and the demand for other capital uses.
Looking at our capital ratios on the bottom of the slide, you see a more significant increase year-over-year in our Tier 1 capital ratio. This was driven by the $1.6 billion in preferred issuances we executed during the last 2 quarters.
As a reminder, we will see the EPS impact from the dividend payments associated with these issuances beginning in Q2. These payments will reduce our net income available to common shareholders by approximately $20 million each quarter.
Stepping back from these quarterly results. Our strong relative performance in the 2015 CCAR process and the Feds non-objection to our capital plan clearly illustrate the strength of our capital position and business model. This reinforces our confidence in the company's ability to generate capital while maintaining its financial strength, and we remain committed to using that capital strength to create value for our shareholders.
Before moving on to your questions, let me make just a few final comments, stepping away from the complexity I just took you through and going back to the key themes in our results. We believe that our core underlying performance this quarter was solid and reflected the continued strength of our business model and the trends we discussed last month at Investor Day. Earnings per share growth of 11% was better than our full year 2015 outlook in part due to some specific benefits in Q1, most notably in provision and operating expenses, and also because we have not yet seen a ramp-up in incremental spending on growth initiatives. Clearly, given our 11% EPS growth in Q1, simple math would indicate that EPS growth would have to be negative for the balance of the year to meet our continued outlook for full year EPS growth to be flat to modestly down.
Looking at the second quarter, in particular, I would remind you that you will begin to see the impact from our recent preferred share issuances and that the prior year EPS of $1.43 included a net benefit from the Business Travel joint venture transaction. Considering this, while it is obviously very early in the quarter, we would expect earnings per share in Q2 to be more significantly down from last year. All this is consistent with our previous comments that quarterly earnings performance will be more uneven than it has been historically while we go through this transitional period. Given this dynamic, our focus has been on our full year earnings outlook rather than our performance in any individual quarter. When we consider our Q1 performance and our Q2 comments in the context of the multi-year financial outlook that we reviewed at Investor Day, we believe we are on track and are continuing to do the right things to position the company for the long term.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Rick for some details on our Q&A session."

Maybe let me start by providing just a little bit of context for Canada, because we've given a fairly unusual amount of color around the U.S. where we've pointed out that, that relationship consists of about 70% of the co-brand spend being out of store and also talked about the co-brand in the U.S. accounting for about 8% of global billings. Just to draw a contrast to Canada, in Canada, the Costco co-brand and Costco as a merchant are representing a more significant portion of our country total billings in Canada. The other probably 2 very important differences to point out to you are that the portion of spend on the Costco Canada co-brand that was in-store was much higher. It was about 60% in-store. And of course, in Canada, there was no sale of the portfolio. So with all that as context, you are correct that this is the first full quarter since the termination of acceptance of Amex products in Canada on January 1. As you would expect, that means all of the in-store spend goes away. But we, while it's still early, I would say continue to be pleased, as you've now heard us say in a couple forums, by our efforts to capture the spend and lend of the Canadian Costco card members. And of course, in Canada, we did issue a new cash back card. As you would expect, we are very focused on those customers who clearly have an affinity with the American Express brand. And I'd say there have been significant learnings, and we are encouraged by them. And we are being very thoughtful about how we will apply them in the U.S. As you would expect, Sanjay, I probably don't want to provide a lot of color and detail beyond that general statement, but we're encouraged one quarter in."

I really -- in terms of the progress, potential outcome done on any portfolio sale, I can't really comment beyond what we've already said, which is we'll just have to see. There's a process and we'll see how it plays out. In terms of the financial outlook we have provided, I would remind everyone that we did not include any assumption about a gain on the sale of the portfolio. So any gain would be incremental to the outlook we laid out. When you think about capital implications, obviously, if there is a portfolio sale, there's a significant reduction in risk weighted assets since the Costco, the U.S. loan portfolio, as we previously talked about, constituted about 20% of our global loan portfolio. That -- in and of itself, depending upon how quickly we ramp our efforts elsewhere to replace that spend, that, of course, frees up some capital. And to the extent there is a sale and there is a gain, I think it's fair to say that we'd have to look at the timing and amount of any gain and think about what portion of it we might want to use to make sure we're fully funding our efforts to capture the future spend and lend of our relationships with the Costco card members and what portion should drop to the bottom line, including we have a very strong balance sheet already. And I think we've demonstrated a very strong and steady commitment to using that balance sheet to return capital to shareholders. It's also fair to say though that the nature and timing of the CCAR process means there's often a lag between big developments that impact capital and our ability to run them through the CCAR process. So we'll kind of have to see how this plays out. But hopefully, that gives you a sense, Don, of how we're thinking about the various components."

Let me make a few comments. One of the reasons why we have continued to talk a little bit about an expectation that you'll see more quarterly unevenness in our earnings is we think the prudent thing here is to be a little flexible around the timing and amounts that we choose to spend around one of the things that we will be ramping, our growth spending initiatives -- or our growth initiatives spending on, that's focusing on the capturing of future spend and lend from our relationship with the Costco card members. It's a very complex process between now and 2016 that will play out in that relationship. And we need a little bit of flexibility that will determine when we choose to ramp up some of our marketing efforts and when we don't. Certainly, that is one of the elements though when you think about what is different this year, potentially next year, about the range of things that we do growth spending on. We have a very rich pool of very dedicated American Express card members, and we will do our best to capture their future spend and lend. The second thing I might point out for 2015 is we are very excited about the launch of Plenti since you brought up loyalty coalition. As you would imagine or as you would recall, we have a pretty well trod track with the loyalty coalition business as we've launched it in other countries for understanding the flow as you go from the first year of launch, which is more of an investment year and as the program then matures in the coming years. So I think it's fair to say that we want to make sure this is a really strong launch. And we're putting a lot of resource towards that in 2015, and that's probably a little different in terms of the profile that you would have seen last year and a little different than what you will see next year as the program moves beyond the launch phase. Beyond those 2 things, I would say, really, that we will be investing in the range of growth opportunities we have across the company. We try to do a pretty thorough overview of those at Investor Day and then clearly expand [ph] the company. So we'll -- you'll see us continue to invest in some of the international markets where we've seen particularly higher rates of growth. Maybe you'll see us continue to invest around our small business and middle-market efforts. You'll see us continue to invest in some of the areas where we believe expanding the breadth of the demographic that our brand reaches out to is producing new opportunities. And you'll see us continue to do some things that we think will drive this steady growth in lending that you've seen above industry averages. So that's probably how we think about the spending overall."

So we have a range of businesses across American Express, and, of course, we have a fairly unique business model in our core business. That range of businesses and that business model produce a tremendous return on equity relative to most of our peers in financial services. And so we are thrilled that we have an ROE, which this quarter was 29%, and we have a really strong track record of meeting our more than 25% target. And I think it's a real commentary on the strength of our business model. But we shouldn't confuse that with hurdle rates for incremental investments or for how we think about bidding for business. Because, of course, if you really look at our cost of capital, you will, of course, get to numbers far, far below 25%. And I could spend the rest of the call getting philosophical about exactly how you might calculate our cost of capital and we look at it as you would expect in many ways. But suffice it to say, it is much below 25%, and it is somewhere around the 10% range, depending on which measure you want to look at. And when we're thinking about incremental opportunities in a bidding situation, I don't really believe that we would take a different economic choice based strictly on a hurdle rate. Now we do make choices based on the next part of your question, though, which is we do have a range of opportunities in our business and we generate a range of returns on equity and a range of returns on an incremental dollar of expense spending as well. And so when we think about opportunities, we're always making sure that anything we do is going to generate incremental value for our shareholders and be above our returns on capital. But we also have to think about the range of opportunities and the financial and managerial resources that we have to allocate across those opportunities. And one of the things you've heard us talk a fair amount about, going all the way back to the February 12 Investor Call that Ken and I had on Costco, is as we thought about where we were with Costco, one of the things we really thought about was the range of other opportunities we have, some of the non-financial constraints that a future contract might have entailed. And when we baked all of those things together, we came to the conclusion that in the long run, we would be better off pursuing another path. But I think it would be a real misnomer for anyone to conclude from that, that, oh, American Express is never going to pursue a transaction or a piece of business that has a return on equity below 25%, so they're not competitive. And our job is to create value for our shareholders. And if -- of course, I'd like to create it at the highest possible ROE. I'd like to create it in the highest possible parts of our business. But if I can create a new chunk of business at something that is closer to our hurdle rate, we will absolutely, of course, pursue that business if it's the best alternative in the long run for the company."

I would have to call this quarter's provision, one that is certainly off the normal trend. I talked in my remarks about the fact that, of course, you have a normal Q4 to Q1 decline in your loan and receivable balances and that does generally drive a seasonal, therefore, decline in your reserves. And that happened this year as it did last year. However, you have a combination of the fact that last year's first quarter had a few various, more specific items that happened to drive that number up a little bit. This quarter, we had some of the kinds of specific adjustments or items that you have every quarter and the provision that happened to drive it down a little bit. You put those 2 together and you suddenly get a really big year-over-year difference. I think the more -- which is why I also in my remarks try to point people to, I think, the more important thing to think about here is as we look at the rest of 2015, boy, in the current economic environment, we'd expect write-off trends to escape pretty strong. However, we've been steadily growing our loan balances, and you'd expect reserves to build along with those loan balances. And some of the specific items that drove the Q1 result, we wouldn't necessarily expect to repeat. So you put all that together and I would expect to see provision going up year-over-year in 2015. And then I'd also just remind you that in terms of what assumptions we made in the financial outlook we've given for 2016 and 2017, we did assume in 2016 and '17 that you do see some modest uptick in write-off rates and hence provision and reserves."

And we built an outlook that, to be explicit, does not include any potential gain on a sale. So we think -- pretty much no matter what assumption you might want to make about the resolution around the portfolio, we think we have enough levers in our business to hit the outlook we've given you for 2016. Now, certainly, there are some things that could drive you above that. If there is a gain on a sale, for example, that is clearly not in our outlook and would be incremental. But we just don't know enough about the final outcome and the timing of the final outcome to be specific beyond the comments I just made."

On hedging, so we do some foreign exchange hedging, but it's really about, frankly, helping us have a clear view from a planning perspective within a quarter. It helps us know what the FX impact is going to be. In essence, at the beginning of the quarter, we do a bunch of hedging that unwinds as you get to the end of the quarter. So you're not further impacted by anything that happens in the quarter. That obviously has 0 impact on our longer-term trend or on the year-over-year declines. And as we think about doing any other kind of strategy, longer term, to hedge, our conclusion at the end of the day is that we think there's value in the diverse set of global businesses we have. We think in the long run, currencies go up and down and tend to equilibrate over time. And that the frictional costs and, frankly, the volatility that the accounting drives for any longer-term hedging strategy has caused us to shy away from it. So that's how we think about hedging. On the U.S., obviously, we'll have to see where the economy goes as we get into the rest of the year. I think it's fair to say from our experience in the first quarter, we haven't started to see estimates of GDP growth in the U.S. or elsewhere. But I think when we look at our own experience and some of the external data around retail sales, when we look at what's happening to gas prices, when we look at some of the -- admittedly, some anecdotal stories we hear in our Corporate Card business, it suggests to us that it was certainly not the most robust of quarters for economic growth. So really, in that environment, for us to -- once you adjust for FX and last year's Business Travel get to 5% revenue growth, we actually feel pretty good about it. When you think about the rest of the year, you are correct, I mean, we're upbeat about OptBlue. It is a multi-year effort. I want to be clear that when Anre Williams on our team first talked about it in the February Financial Community Meeting last year, we talked about it in the context of sort of 2015 to 2017. In that vein, we are encouraged that we actually signed up 400,000 merchants in 2014, and that was sort of before we told you we start to ramp the program much. So we do think, as we get into the latter part of 2015, that we should begin to see a meaningful benefit from OptBlue, and we remain very encouraged by it. And we obviously remain very encouraged by lots of other things in the market. Our steady growth in the U.S. and growing our lend portfolio, we expect to be able to continue. And we think we are doing that without materially changing the risk profile of the company by really focusing on capturing a fairer share of our card member spend. We're excited about our continued efforts around broadening the reach of the brand with things like the Everyday Card, and we're excited about things like Plenti. If you haven't focused on it, I'll point out to you, we are going to launch a Plenti co-brand, which we think will be a very interesting play. It's just one more step on our pathway of broadening the demographic reach of the brand and the franchise. So we'll have to see where the economy goes and what the environment does; but those are probably some of the things we're thinking about as we look at the rest of the year."

So what I think it does to us as well -- strike us is that in the Corporate Card segment, you saw a sequential slowing from 8% in Q4 to 4% in Q1, and that's clearly a much sharper sequential slowing than you've seen elsewhere. As we have dug into that a little bit, it is primarily driven by the U.S. and seems to be a little bit more striking in our larger accounts in the U.S. In terms of what this means for the broader economy 6 months from now, I guess I'd be cautious. One, if you look at corporate spending, it tends to be a little bit more volatile than some of our other segments because companies have gotten pretty good over the years at turning on and off their travel spend and other T&E spend in response to their own business challenges and own sense of the economic environment. I think in any part of our business, we're always cautious about saying does 1 quarter make a trend? So we'll have to see. I guess I'd say its a note of caution for us, but I wouldn't want to read too much into it at this point in time."

So maybe I'll even take this opportunity to step back a little bit. Certainly, we are watching very closely across our global portfolio for any impact, both billings and credit, arising from the rather dramatic drop in oil prices. And what I would tell you for now is, certainly, we see the billings impact with the drop in oil prices. Remember, it's 2% to 3% of our billings, so a 30% drop costs us about 1 point of billings growth. We do see some drop in spend from some of the oil services companies in the grand scheme of our overall billings. However, that does not total up to anything that is significant for us. We have not seen any significant deterioration in credit yet either by industry or parts of the U.S. or parts of the globe that are particularly driven by an oil economy. But believe me, we are watching all of that like a hawk. It's also difficult for us to say, well, are people taking the monies, their savings from slightly lower oil prices and using it to spur more spending elsewhere, that's tough for us to see. I'm not saying it's not happening, but I'm not sure we can really see any of it. So to come all the way back to the origin of your question, which is what's driving the sharper sequential decline in Corporate Card, I think we've done enough work to say it doesn't appear to be isolated to oil services. It doesn't appear to be isolated to any particular industry or geography, any -- with any finer point than it is primarily U.S., not in other parts of the world."

Because in the U.S., in fact, our loan growth this quarter was 7% and has been running up at the 6% to 7% rate for the last couple of quarters. And I would say that if you look at the kinds of things that Ed, in particular, talked about at Investor Day, this is an area where we think we could run that number up a little higher than that in the current industry environment without any material change in our risk profile by continuing to build from a marketing perspective, new customers as well as within existing customers, both bring in more borrowing focused customers as well as capture more of our fair share of the borrowing behavior of our existing customers. We're pretty upbeat about that and think it's a real opportunity for the company. Internationally, we have a much, much smaller loan portfolio. We do think we can achieve steady growth. That's masked right now by the very significant foreign exchange impacts you see and the fact that, and this goes in our third point, there was a loan portfolio associated with Costco Canada. While we didn't sell the portfolio, as you would expect, because the -- as I said earlier in response to a question, because 60% of the spend on the Canadian Costco co-brand was in-store, as that spend went away January 1, you see a more rapid decline in some of the loan balances as well. So that will drag on the international piece a little bit. The third component to think about is Costco in the U.S. So we can't be sure of the outcome of any potential sale of the portfolio. But that portfolio, if it were to be sold, it represents 20% of our loans. So you could accelerate your growth, excluding that, by a significant amount from 7%. It's still going to take you a long time, frankly, to get back to even where we are today in terms of the overall loan portfolio and what that means for the spend-centricity, if you will, of our overall income statement. So long-winded answer to your question, but I think you do have to think about loan growth in the context of those 3 categories. So I think we have time for one last question, operator."

And in some ways, I think the way I would tie it together, my answer is to say, remember, one of the aspects of our unique closed loop model is we work extremely hard every day not just to generate value for our card members, but we work extremely hard every day to figure out how we generate more value for our merchants. We're very excited about the OptBlue program, and we think it is making it easier for smaller merchants to work with us. We think it's going to expand their business opportunities, and we're very excited about what it will do for merchant coverage over the next few years. We do lots of things to try to help small businesses operate better. When you look at our open business, which on the issuing side targets small businesses, it's really all about helping drive the success of those businesses and giving them access to spend capacity that our business model and our charge card model really is able to fairly uniquely provide them. And we really try to use that and have used it over the years to drive to a very significant position in small businesses. Things we do like Small Business Saturday are another example of what we do to help drive value and support for our merchants. Merchant financing in that context is just another extension of the same driver we have to constantly work at how do we find new ways to add value to merchants. Very excited about merchant financing and we think it is not only a good opportunity for us to, in a very thoughtful, measured risk profile-centric way, grow our financing portfolio. We think it's a real value add for our partners, particularly some of our smaller business partners. So hopefully that strategy all fits together. It's really part of what we have to do every day. 
So with that, I would like to thank you, all, for joining tonight's call and participating in the Q&A session. I would summarize by coming back to the fact that we think our results in the first quarter reflect solid core underlying performance. When you think about our Q1 performance and what I said today about Q2 and when you think about it in the context of the multi-year financial outlook that we reviewed at Investor Day, we think we're on track, and we're continuing to do the right things to position the company for the long term.

Overall, Q1 was a solid quarter for the company, consistent with the framework and financial outlook we presented at Investor Day last month. The quarter reflected solid core underlying performance as we",3740,"Well, thanks, Rick, and good afternoon, everyone. 
Overall, Q1 was a solid quarter for the company, consistent with the framework and financial outlook we presented at Investor Day last month. The quarter reflected solid core underlying performance as well as several discrete impacts, including the strengthening of the U.S. dollar and various changes to our co-brand relationships. 
As you recall, we discussed at Investor Day our expectations for the first quarter. And in fact, EPS growth of 11% did come in better than our full year outlook and even a little better than we thought a few weeks ago, in part due to the timing of our incremental spending on growth initiatives, which will ramp up over the course of the year, along with some other timing benefits that we don't expect to repeat as we go through the year. I'll discuss these items in more detail later in my remarks. Importantly for these reasons, our full year 2015 EPS outlook remains unchanged as we continue to expect EPS growth to be flat to modestly down.
Looking back to the financial outlook framework from Investor Day, our core underlying performance remained consistent and continued to be driven by solid revenue growth of 5% after adjusting for FX and Business Travel revenues in the prior year, disciplined cost controls and a strong balance sheet that enabled us to return a substantial amount of capital to shareholders in the form of repurchases over the past year.
Our results also reflect some of the discrete impacts that we discussed a few weeks ago. In the co-brand space, we are seeing the impact from the termination of our relationship with Costco in Canada as well as the reset impact from the early renewals we have done with several other co-brand partners, including Delta, Starwood and Cathay Pacific. In addition, the U.S. dollar continued to strengthen during the first quarter and represented a significant headwind to our quarterly earnings performance. 
Importantly, during the quarter, we also continued to have strong momentum on key initiatives. Highlights included the expansion of our small merchant coverage through OptBlue, the announcement of the Plenti loyalty coalition program in the U.S., the signing of a new Charles Schwab co-brand along with the renewal of our co-brand relationship with British Airways in Iberia as well as the announcement just today of our wearable payments partnership with Jawbone. We were also very pleased by our strong 2015 CCAR performance, which will provide us with the flexibility to increase our dividend and share repurchases going forward. As we discussed at Investor Day, we believe that these developments are indicative of the many attractive opportunities for growth that we have over the longer term.
So that is the quarter in a simple summary. As we get into the details, I will warn you that lapping the impact of 2014's Global Business Travel and Concur transactions, along with the 2015 discrete impacts of FX and our co-brand changes, all combined to make understanding our results this year a bit more complex than usual.
To begin now with our financial results for Q1, as you can see on Slide 2, reported billings growth was 3%. Like many other global companies, the strength of the U.S. dollar had a significant impact on our growth rates this quarter. As the dollar continued to strengthen, the magnitude of the FX impact increased and, for the first quarter, depressed our growth by nearly 4 percentage points. As a result, FX adjusted billings growth was 7%, significantly higher than our reported rate. I'll provide more details on our billings performance shortly. But lower gas prices in the U.S. and the termination of our relationship with Costco in Canada clearly had an impact on our results.
Reported revenue growth of negative 3% was, of course, also impacted by FX as well as the inclusion of Business Travel revenues in the prior year. Excluding these items, adjusted revenue growth was 5%, consistent with both the prior quarter and recent trends.
Net income grew by 6%, helped by disciplined expense control and lower provision costs, both of which also reflected some timing benefits in the quarter, which helped to offset the discrete impacts of FX and the changes in our co-brand relationships. 
Below the net income line, we continued to leverage our strong capital position to provide significant returns to our shareholders. Over the past year, we have repurchased 48 million shares, which translated to a 4% decline in average shares outstanding. This decline in shares outstanding, along with a modestly lower tax rate, drove the 11% diluted EPS growth that we generated during the first quarter. This performance also resulted in an ROE of 29% for the period ending March 31, well above our on-average and over time target of 25% and demonstrate the continued strength of our business model.
Let's now move to a more detailed review of our key performance drivers during the first quarter, starting with billed business on Slide 3. On an FX adjusted basis, billings growth slowed modestly from 8% in Q4 to 7% during the quarter.
Looking at the results by segment. In our U.S. consumer and small business segment, growth also decelerated slightly to 7% in Q1. This performance was impacted by the more than 30% decline in gas prices year-over-year as well as slower retail sales growth consistent with industry-wide trends in the U.S. 
I would note that in the U.S., we did not see any material impact on our billings growth from the announced termination next year of our relationship with Costco. As we would have expected, however, we have started to see some slowing of new Costco co-brand card acquisitions, which, along with any future customer behavior changes that we may experience, will likely begin to impact our performance somewhat later this year. 
It's also worth noting on billings that the deceleration in Q1 was more pronounced in our GCS segment where billings were up 4% on an FX adjusted basis as we seem to see a slowdown in spending across a number of corporate customers primarily in the U.S.
GNS continues to be our strongest billings growth segment with FX adjusted growth of 16% during the quarter. This continued strong growth demonstrates the diversity of our business model, given the much higher than company average returns on equity we achieved in the GNS business.
Finally, ICS FX adjusted growth was 2% during Q1. But as we began to see last quarter, we saw very different trends by region, as you can see on Slide 4. 
The slowdown in international regions came primarily from LACC where volumes were down 4% versus the prior year, driven by a drop-off in Canadian billings. As you recall, we began to see volumes slow in Canada during Q4 when card acceptance at Costco in Canada was expanded to include other networks. Beginning January 1, American Express products were no longer accepted in Costco warehouses in Canada, and we are now seeing the full impact from the termination of this relationship on billed business.
In contrast to LACC, we saw improved growth in the JAPA region, which was again the fastest-growing region in the quarter, up 16% on an FX adjusted basis. This solid performance continued to be powered by strong growth in China and Japan.
In all international regions, you see that like other U.S. companies with a significant global footprint, our reported results are being significantly impacted by changes in foreign exchange rates. 
To provide you with some additional perspective here, on Slide 5, we have again included a comparison of our reported and FX adjusted revenue growth rates for the last 8 quarters. 
As you can see in the trajectory of the blue dotted line on the slide, our adjusted revenue growth remains consistent with recent trends in the 5% range. However, during the first quarter, foreign exchange had a more significant negative impact on our results than in prior periods, dragging adjusted revenue growth down by nearly 4 percentage points. At current FX rates, we would expect to see a similar drag in the second quarter.
As you can see in the second row, the bottom of the chart, the dollar has strengthened by 10% to 30% year-over-year against the currencies that we are most exposed to outside the U S. Now, of course, this revenue impact is partially offset by the benefit we receive from having certain expenses denominated in international currencies, but there is a bottom line impact especially when rates move this dramatically.
Over the longer term, we continued to believe that being a global company that generates revenue in a diverse set of markets around the world is a strength of our business model. 
As we discussed at Investor Day, however, if the current rates hold, FX will continue to have a significant discrete impact for the balance of the year.
Turning now to loans. You see on Slide 6 that worldwide loans are up 4% versus the prior year. Consistent with historical seasonal trends, we did see a drop-off in loan balances versus year end and a small sequential increase in net interest yields during the first quarter. In the U.S., which constitutes the majority of our loan portfolio, growth was relatively consistent to prior quarter at 7%. 
On the international side, reported loan balances were down year-over-year due to the negative impact from FX rates and the decline in loans related to the Costco Canada co-brand portfolio.
Stepping back, our loan growth has consistently been above the industry over the past 2 years, and we talked at Investor Day about the opportunity to continue this trend by growing share with existing card members as well as attracting new customers to our franchise.
Having said this, however, I'd also remind you that net interest income this quarter still made up only 18% of our total revenues. And given the expected runoff in loans associated with the Costco U.S. co-brand portfolio next year, even if we continue to grow our core loan portfolio at the higher rates we have seen, our overall business model will remain very spend-focused.
So now putting together our billings and loan performance, you see on Slide 7 that revenues declined 3% on a reported basis but increased by 5% after adjusting for FX and Business Travel revenues in the prior year. I'll note that revenue growth during the current quarter does reflect a portion of the negative impact from our co-brand partnership early renewals as well as a larger impact versus Q4 from the termination of our relationship with Costco in Canada. 
Even with these discrete impacts, however, adjusted revenue growth of 5% is consistent with the recent trend, illustrating the ongoing strength of our underlying core business.
The 2 largest components of revenue are, of course, discount revenue and net interest income. To start with the former, during the first quarter, discount revenue grew by 1%, which was approximately 200 basis points below the reported growth in billed business of 3%. The first driver of this difference was a decline in our reported discount rate which was down 2 basis points versus the prior year. This year-over-year decline is slightly smaller than in recent quarters, in part because the decline in Costco Canada merchant volume, where we earned a much lower discount rate, actually raises the company average discount rate. The discount rate also reflects continued growth in our OptBlue program as merchant acquirers actively sign up new merchants onto the American Express network.
As Ed discussed at Investor Day, 14 of the top 15 merchant acquirers in the U.S. are now part of OptBlue. Last year, when Anre Williams introduced this new program to you at the February Financial Community Meeting, he said that we expect to increase our small merchant acquisition by 50% or more for the next several years starting in 2015. And while this is obviously a multi-year effort, we, in fact, signed more than 400,000 new small merchants last year in 2014. So we are clearly off to a good start. We are also undertaking similar efforts to improve our small merchant coverage in many other markets around the world.
Also contributing to the gap between discount revenue and billed business growth was faster growth in both GNS volumes and Concur revenue items, including cash incentives and certain payments related to our renewed co-brand relationships.
Turning to the other key component of revenue, net interest income. We saw a healthy 8% growth rate driven by our continued efforts to grow our loan portfolio as well as lower funding costs. As the majority of our loan portfolio is in the U.S., the impact of FX is smaller on net interest income than on other revenue lines.
Moving now to credit performance on Slide 8. You can see that our lending credit metrics remain at or near historically low levels and that our write-off and delinquency rates both remained relatively consistent with recent trends. 
As you can see on Slide 9, despite this steady lending credit performance, provision expense dropped 13% versus the prior year. Typically, we experienced a reserve release during Q1 due to the seasonal decline in loans and receivable balances versus year end. The increase in the reserve release versus the prior year is largely due to charge card, where the prior period included a modest reserve build.
Moving to our lending reserve coverage levels on Slide 10. Coverage remained relatively consistent after considering the impact of the seasonal decline in loans and receivables I just mentioned. We believe coverage levels remain appropriate given the risk level inherent in the portfolio.
Thinking about the balance of the year, it is important to note that we would expect reserves to build modestly in line with loan growth and any changes in credit performance. Therefore, we would expect provision to increase year-over-year and to represent a headwind to growth for the remainder of 2015. 
Moreover, as we discussed at Investor Day, we did build into our multi-year financial outlook an assumption that we would see some steady upward tick in write-off rates and a modest build in reserves over the outlook period.
Moving below revenue now to expenses on Slide 11. On a reported basis, expenses declined by 5% versus the prior year. Excluding Business Travel expenses incurred in 2014, adjusted total expenses increased by 1% and also, of course, benefited somewhat from the strength of the U.S. dollar. 
I'll come back to operating expenses and marketing and promotion in a moment. First, however, I'll touch on a few other items on this slide. 
Rewards expense grew by 4%, which is relatively consistent with our reported billed business growth. Now rewards expensed in the current quarter does include a portion of the discrete impact from our renewed co-brand relationships. The resulting increase in our rewards cost, however, was partially offset by some timing benefits this quarter related to our Membership Rewards program.
Next, while it's a relatively small percentage of total expenses, cost of card member services increased significantly year-over-year by 18%. As background, a portion of the expenses in this line are related to the payments we may provide partners for services such as baggage fees, companion tickets and airport lounge access, which have increased as a result of our renewed co-brand relationships. For the remainder of 2015, given that Q1 of last year also included elevated costs and costs of card member Services, we would expect to see an even higher level of growth for this line item.
Last on Slide 11. The tax rate during the first quarter was 34%, which was relatively consistent with recent quarters but slightly below the prior year. As we mentioned at Investor Day, our assumption is that the tax rate will remain roughly in line with recent performance during 2015.
Let's turn now to marketing and promotion expenses, which account for the majority of our spending on growth initiatives. Slide 12 shows the trend of these costs. And you see that while this quarter's marketing and promotion expenses were 4% higher than the prior year, you'll also notice that these costs have historically been much lower during each year's first quarter. More broadly as we think about 2015, we continued to evolve our plans around the timing and level of incremental spending on growth initiatives. As we have said, the majority but not all of this spending will occur in marketing and promotion. Considering this, we would expect marketing and promotion expenses to be relatively similar with the elevated levels of 2014, which you can see on this slide included higher levels of expenses in Q2 when we had the Business Travel joint venture transaction gain and in Q4 when we had the Concur gain. While we could have made the decision to reduce investments from their elevated 2014 levels, as we discussed at Investor Day, we believe that the right decision for shareholders to best position the company for the medium to long term is to keep investments at an elevated level this year in anticipation of the termination of our relationship with Costco in the U.S. during early 2016.
As Kenneth and Steve discussed in detail a few weeks ago, the incremental spending in 2015 will focus on the many growth opportunities that we see across all segments in our company, including our efforts to capture a meaningful portion of the spend and lend of our Costco card members in the U.S.
Turning now to operating expense performance on Slide 13. Our reported results continue to reflect the impact of Business Travel in the prior year across a number of expense categories complicating line by line comparisons. That said, excluding Business Travel expenses incurred in the prior year, adjusted operating expenses in total decreased by 2% in the quarter. I'll also note that during the quarter, we benefited from some specific items at the other net line, which we do not expect to repeat going forward. As you think about the balance of the year, I'd also point out that operating expenses have historically been lower during Q1.
Moving to Slide 14. Adjusted operating expense growth, of course, remained well below our stated 3% growth target. As we've discussed at Investor Day, maintaining disciplined control of our expenses, particularly operating expenses, remains a key driver of our earnings performance. As Steve noted that day, however, we are not achieving this disciplined expense control through a cutback in investment levels but rather through ongoing efforts to increase the efficiency of the organization. We continue to make substantial investments within operating expenses to support our growth initiatives.
Now switching to our capital performance on Slide 15. During the current quarter, we returned 65% of the capital we generated to shareholders while strengthening our already strong capital ratios. As I mentioned at Investor Day, share repurchases of approximately $750 million for the first quarter were below the amount included in our 2014 CCAR submission due to some nuances in the 2014 CCAR rules associated with the capital generated by employee plans. These rules have evolved for future CCAR periods but did cause our Q1 payout ratio to be somewhat lower than in recent quarters. 
I'd also point out that the 2015 CCAR process gives all participants more flexibility on the timing of share repurchases across the 5-quarter CCAR approval period. Accordingly, the exact timing and size of our repurchases in 2015 will be driven by many factors, including but not limited to the levels of our earnings and the demand for other capital uses.
Looking at our capital ratios on the bottom of the slide, you see a more significant increase year-over-year in our Tier 1 capital ratio. This was driven by the $1.6 billion in preferred issuances we executed during the last 2 quarters.
As a reminder, we will see the EPS impact from the dividend payments associated with these issuances beginning in Q2. These payments will reduce our net income available to common shareholders by approximately $20 million each quarter.
Stepping back from these quarterly results. Our strong relative performance in the 2015 CCAR process and the Feds non-objection to our capital plan clearly illustrate the strength of our capital position and business model. This reinforces our confidence in the company's ability to generate capital while maintaining its financial strength, and we remain committed to using that capital strength to create value for our shareholders.
Before moving on to your questions, let me make just a few final comments, stepping away from the complexity I just took you through and going back to the key themes in our results. We believe that our core underlying performance this quarter was solid and reflected the continued strength of our business model and the trends we discussed last month at Investor Day. Earnings per share growth of 11% was better than our full year 2015 outlook in part due to some specific benefits in Q1, most notably in provision and operating expenses, and also because we have not yet seen a ramp-up in incremental spending on growth initiatives. Clearly, given our 11% EPS growth in Q1, simple math would indicate that EPS growth would have to be negative for the balance of the year to meet our continued outlook for full year EPS growth to be flat to modestly down.
Looking at the second quarter, in particular, I would remind you that you will begin to see the impact from our recent preferred share issuances and that the prior year EPS of $1.43 included a net benefit from the Business Travel joint venture transaction. Considering this, while it is obviously very early in the quarter, we would expect earnings per share in Q2 to be more significantly down from last year. All this is consistent with our previous comments that quarterly earnings performance will be more uneven than it has been historically while we go through this transitional period. Given this dynamic, our focus has been on our full year earnings outlook rather than our performance in any individual quarter. When we consider our Q1 performance and our Q2 comments in the context of the multi-year financial outlook that we reviewed at Investor Day, we believe we are on track and are continuing to do the right things to position the company for the long term.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Rick for some details on our Q&A session."

Maybe let me start by providing just a little bit of context for Canada, because we've given a fairly unusual amount of color around the U.S. where we've pointed out that, that relationship consists of about 70% of the co-brand spend being out of store and also talked about the co-brand in the U.S. accounting for about 8% of global billings. Just to draw a contrast to Canada, in Canada, the Costco co-brand and Costco as a merchant are representing a more significant portion of our country total billings in Canada. The other probably 2 very important differences to point out to you are that the portion of spend on the Costco Canada co-brand that was in-store was much higher. It was about 60% in-store. And of course, in Canada, there was no sale of the portfolio. So with all that as context, you are correct that this is the first full quarter since the termination of acceptance of Amex products in Canada on January 1. As you would expect, that means all of the in-store spend goes away. But we, while it's still early, I would say continue to be pleased, as you've now heard us say in a couple forums, by our efforts to capture the spend and lend of the Canadian Costco card members. And of course, in Canada, we did issue a new cash back card. As you would expect, we are very focused on those customers who clearly have an affinity with the American Express brand. And I'd say there have been significant learnings, and we are encouraged by them. And we are being very thoughtful about how we will apply them in the U.S. As you would expect, Sanjay, I probably don't want to provide a lot of color and detail beyond that general statement, but we're encouraged one quarter in."

I really -- in terms of the progress, potential outcome done on any portfolio sale, I can't really comment beyond what we've already said, which is we'll just have to see. There's a process and we'll see how it plays out. In terms of the financial outlook we have provided, I would remind everyone that we did not include any assumption about a gain on the sale of the portfolio. So any gain would be incremental to the outlook we laid out. When you think about capital implications, obviously, if there is a portfolio sale, there's a significant reduction in risk weighted assets since the Costco, the U.S. loan portfolio, as we previously talked about, constituted about 20% of our global loan portfolio. That -- in and of itself, depending upon how quickly we ramp our efforts elsewhere to replace that spend, that, of course, frees up some capital. And to the extent there is a sale and there is a gain, I think it's fair to say that we'd have to look at the timing and amount of any gain and think about what portion of it we might want to use to make sure we're fully funding our efforts to capture the future spend and lend of our relationships with the Costco card members and what portion should drop to the bottom line, including we have a very strong balance sheet already. And I think we've demonstrated a very strong and steady commitment to using that balance sheet to return capital to shareholders. It's also fair to say though that the nature and timing of the CCAR process means there's often a lag between big developments that impact capital and our ability to run them through the CCAR process. So we'll kind of have to see how this plays out. But hopefully, that gives you a sense, Don, of how we're thinking about the various components."

Let me make a few comments. One of the reasons why we have continued to talk a little bit about an expectation that you'll see more quarterly unevenness in our earnings is we think the prudent thing here is to be a little flexible around the timing and amounts that we choose to spend around one of the things that we will be ramping, our growth spending initiatives -- or our growth initiatives spending on, that's focusing on the capturing of future spend and lend from our relationship with the Costco card members. It's a very complex process between now and 2016 that will play out in that relationship. And we need a little bit of flexibility that will determine when we choose to ramp up some of our marketing efforts and when we don't. Certainly, that is one of the elements though when you think about what is different this year, potentially next year, about the range of things that we do growth spending on. We have a very rich pool of very dedicated American Express card members, and we will do our best to capture their future spend and lend. The second thing I might point out for 2015 is we are very excited about the launch of Plenti since you brought up loyalty coalition. As you would imagine or as you would recall, we have a pretty well-trod track with the loyalty coalition business as we've launched it in other countries for understanding the flow as you go from the first year of launch, which is more of an investment year and as the program then matures in the coming years. So I think it's fair to say that we want to make sure this is a really strong launch. And we're putting a lot of resource towards that in 2015, and that's probably a little different in terms of the profile that you would have seen last year and a little different than what you will see next year as the program moves beyond the launch phase. Beyond those 2 things, I would say, really, that we will be investing in the range of growth opportunities we have across the company. We try to do a pretty thorough overview of those at Investor Day and then clearly expand [ph] the company. So we'll -- you'll see us continue to invest in some of the international markets where we've seen particularly higher rates of growth. Maybe you'll see us continue to invest around our small business and middle-market efforts. You'll see us continue to invest in some of the areas where we believe expanding the breadth of the demographic that our brand reaches out to is producing new opportunities. And you'll see us continue to do some things that we think will drive this steady growth in lending that you've seen above industry averages. So that's probably how we think about the spending overall."

So we have a range of businesses across American Express, and, of course, we have a fairly unique business model in our core business. That range of businesses and that business model produce a tremendous return on equity relative to most of our peers in financial services. And so we are thrilled that we have an ROE, which this quarter was 29%, and we have a really strong track record of meeting our more than 25% target. And I think it's a real commentary on the strength of our business model. But we shouldn't confuse that with hurdle rates for incremental investments or for how we think about bidding for business. Because, of course, if you really look at our cost of capital, you will, of course, get to numbers far, far below 25%. And I could spend the rest of the call getting philosophical about exactly how you might calculate our cost of capital and we look at it as you would expect in many ways. But suffice it to say, it is much below 25%, and it is somewhere around the 10% range, depending on which measure you want to look at. And when we're thinking about incremental opportunities in a bidding situation, I don't really believe that we would take a different economic choice based strictly on a hurdle rate. Now we do make choices based on the next part of your question, though, which is we do have a range of opportunities in our business and we generate a range of returns on equity and a range of returns on an incremental dollar of expense spending as well. And so when we think about opportunities, we're always making sure that anything we do is going to generate incremental value for our shareholders and be above our returns on capital. But we also have to think about the range of opportunities and the financial and managerial resources that we have to allocate across those opportunities. And one of the things you've heard us talk a fair amount about, going all the way back to the February 12 Investor Call that Ken and I had on Costco, is as we thought about where we were with Costco, one of the things we really thought about was the range of other opportunities we have, some of the non-financial constraints that a future contract might have entailed. And when we baked all of those things together, we came to the conclusion that in the long run, we would be better off pursuing another path. But I think it would be a real misnomer for anyone to conclude from that, that, oh, American Express is never going to pursue a transaction or a piece of business that has a return on equity below 25%, so they're not competitive. And our job is to create value for our shareholders. And if -- of course, I'd like to create it at the highest possible ROE. I'd like to create it in the highest possible parts of our business.

I would have to call this quarter's provision, one that is certainly off the normal trend. I talked in my remarks about the fact that, of course, you have a normal Q4 to Q1 decline in your loan and receivable balances and that does generally drive a seasonal, therefore, decline in your reserves. And that happened this year as it did last year. However, you have a combination of the fact that last year's first quarter had a few various, more specific items that happened to drive that number up a little bit. This quarter, we had some of the kinds of specific adjustments or items that you have every quarter and the provision that happened to drive it down a little bit. You put those 2 together and you suddenly get a really big year-over-year difference. I think the more -- which is why I also in my remarks try to point people to, I think, the more important thing to think about here is as we look at the rest of 2015, boy, in the current economic environment, we'd expect write-off trends to escape pretty strong. However, we've been steadily growing our loan balances, and you'd expect reserves to build along with those loan balances. And some of the specific items that drove the Q1 result, we wouldn't necessarily expect to repeat. So you put all that together and I would expect to see provision going up year-over-year in 2015. And then I'd also just remind you that in terms of what assumptions we made in the financial outlook we've given for 2016 and 2017, we did assume in 2016 and '17 that you do see some modest uptick in write-off rates and hence provision and reserves."

On hedging, so we do some foreign exchange hedging, but it's really about, frankly, helping us have a clear view from a planning perspective within a quarter. It helps us know what the FX impact is going to be. In essence, at the beginning of the quarter, we do a bunch of hedging that unwinds as you get to the end of the quarter. So you're not further impacted by anything that happens in the quarter. That obviously has 0 impact on our longer-term trend or on the year-over-year declines. And as we think about doing any other kind of strategy, longer term, to hedge, our conclusion at the end of the day is that we think there's value in the diverse set of global businesses we have. We think in the long run, currencies go up and down and tend to equilibrate over time. And that the frictional costs and, frankly, the volatility that the accounting drives for any longer-term hedging strategy has caused us to shy away from it. So that's how we think about hedging. On the U.S., obviously, we'll have to see where the economy goes as we get into the rest of the year. I think it's fair to say from our experience in the first quarter, we haven't started to see estimates of GDP growth in the U.S. or elsewhere. But I think when we look at our own experience and some of the external data around retail sales, when we look at what's happening to gas prices, when we look at some of the -- admittedly, some anecdotal stories we hear in our Corporate Card business, it suggests to us that it was certainly not the most robust of quarters for economic growth. So really, in that environment, for us to -- once you adjust for FX and last year's Business Travel get to 5% revenue growth, we actually feel pretty good about it. When you think about the rest of the year, you are correct, I mean, we're upbeat about OptBlue. It is a multi-year effort. I want to be clear that when Anre Williams on our team first talked about it in the February Financial Community Meeting last year, we talked about it in the context of sort of 2015 to 2017. In that vein, we are encouraged that we actually signed up 400,000 merchants in 2014, and that was sort of before we told you we start to ramp the program much. So we do think, as we get into the latter part of 2015, that we should begin to see a meaningful benefit from OptBlue, and we remain very encouraged by it. And we obviously remain very encouraged by lots of other things in the market. Our steady growth in the U.S. and growing our lend portfolio, we expect to be able to continue. And we think we are doing that without materially changing the risk profile of the company by really focusing on capturing a fairer share of our card member spend. We're excited about our continued efforts around broadening the reach of the brand with things like the Everyday Card, and we're excited about things like Plenti. If you haven't focused on it, I'll point out to you, we are going to launch a Plenti co-brand, which we think will be a very interesting play. It's just one more step on our pathway of broadening the demographic reach of the brand and the franchise. So we'll have to see where the economy goes and what the environment does; but those are probably some of the things we're thinking about as we look at the rest of the year."

So what I think it does to us as well -- strike us is that in the Corporate Card segment, you saw a sequential slowing from 8% in Q4 to 4% in Q1, and that's clearly a much sharper sequential slowing than you've seen elsewhere. As we have dug into that a little bit, it is primarily driven by the U.S. and seems to be a little bit more striking in our larger accounts in the U.S. In terms of what this means for the broader economy 6 months from now, I guess I'd be cautious. One, if you look at corporate spending, it tends to be a little bit more volatile than some of our other segments because companies have gotten pretty good over the years at turning on and off their travel spend and other T&E spend in response to their own business challenges and own sense of the economic environment. I think in any part of our business, we're always cautious about saying does 1 quarter make a trend? So we'll have to see. I guess I'd say it’s a note of caution for us, but I wouldn't want to read too much into it at this point in time."

So maybe I'll even take this opportunity to step back a little bit. Certainly, we are watching very closely across our global portfolio for any impact, both billings and credit, arising from the rather dramatic drop in oil prices. And what I would tell you for now is, certainly, we see the billings impact with the drop in oil prices. Remember, it's 2% to 3% of our billings, so a 30% drop costs us about 1 point of billings growth. We do see some drop in spend from some of the oil services companies in the grand scheme of our overall billings. However, that does not total up to anything that is significant for us. We have not seen any significant deterioration in credit yet either by industry or parts of the U.S. or parts of the globe that are particularly driven by an oil economy. But believe me, we are watching all of that like a hawk. It's also difficult for us to say, well, are people taking the monies, their savings from slightly lower oil prices and using it to spur more spending elsewhere, that's tough for us to see. I'm not saying it's not happening, but I'm not sure we can really see any of it. So to come all the way back to the origin of your question, which is what's driving the sharper sequential decline in Corporate Card, I think we've done enough work to say it doesn't appear to be isolated to oil services. It doesn't appear to be isolated to any particular industry or geography, any -- with any finer point than it is primarily U.S., not in other parts of the world."

Because in the U.S., in fact, our loan growth this quarter was 7% and has been running up at the 6% to 7% rate for the last couple of quarters. And I would say that if you look at the kinds of things that Ed, in particular, talked about at Investor Day, this is an area where we think we could run that number up a little higher than that in the current industry environment without any material change in our risk profile by continuing to build from a marketing perspective, new customers as well as within existing customers, both bring in more borrowing focused customers as well as capture more of our fair share of the borrowing behavior of our existing customers. We're pretty upbeat about that and think it's a real opportunity for the company. Internationally, we have a much, much smaller loan portfolio. We do think we can achieve steady growth. That's masked right now by the very significant foreign exchange impacts you see and the fact that, and this goes in our third point, there was a loan portfolio associated with Costco Canada. While we didn't sell the portfolio, as you would expect, because the -- as I said earlier in response to a question, because 60% of the spend on the Canadian Costco co-brand was in-store, as that spend went away January 1, you see a more rapid decline in some of the loan balances as well. So that will drag on the international piece a little bit. The third component to think about is Costco in the U.S. So we can't be sure of the outcome of any potential sale of the portfolio. But that portfolio, if it were to be sold, it represents 20% of our loans. So you could accelerate your growth, excluding that, by a significant amount from 7%. It's still going to take you a long time, frankly, to get back to even where we are today in terms of the overall loan portfolio and what that means for the spend-centricity, if you will, of our overall income statement. So long-winded answer to your question, but I think you do have to think about loan growth in the context of those 3 categories. So I think we have time for one last question, operator."

We're very excited about the OptBlue program, and we think it is making it easier for smaller merchants to work with us. We think it's going to expand their business opportunities, and we're very excited about what it will do for merchant coverage over the next few years. We do lots of things to try to help small businesses operate better. When you look at our open business, which on the issuing side targets small businesses, it's really all about helping drive the success of those businesses and giving them access to spend capacity that our business model and our charge card model really is able to fairly uniquely provide them. And we really try to use that and have used it over the years to drive to a very significant position in small businesses. Things we do like Small Business Saturday are another example of what we do to help drive value and support for our merchants. Merchant financing in that context is just another extension of the same driver we have to constantly work at how do we find new ways to add value to merchants. Very excited about merchant financing and we think it is not only a good opportunity for us to, in a very thoughtful, measured risk profile-centric way, grow our financing portfolio. We think it's a real value add for our partners, particularly some of our smaller business partners. So hopefully that strategy all fits together. It's really part of what we have to do every day.

I would summarize by coming back to the fact that we think our results in the first quarter reflect solid core underlying performance. When you think about our Q1 performance and what I said today about Q2 and when you think about it in the context of the multi-year financial outlook that we reviewed at Investor Day, we think we're on track, and we're continuing to do the right things to position the company for the long term.

Overall, our results this quarter reflected what we consider solid core underlying earnings performance. Reported Q2 EPS of $1.42 was relatively consistent with the prior year, while understanding our performance is more complex than usual this quarter for several reasons.
As expected, the results reflected discrete impacts, including a significantly stronger U.S. dollar versus last year, the impact of various changes to our co-brand partnerships and the initial stages of a ramp-up in spending on growth initiatives.
On a year-over-year basis this quarter, EPS growth was also impacted by the prior year net benefit related to the Business Travel joint venture transaction and of course, Business Travel's Q2 '14 operating results.
Looking through the complexity of these items, our core underlying earnings performance was generally consistent with the financial outlook framework that we first shared with you at our Investor Day in March. We continue to view this framework as a useful way to understand the drivers of our performance through the period of the multiyear financial outlook we first provided in February this year. Accordingly, we have included this financial outlook framework as the first slide in our earnings presentation today.
Looking at our results through this lens, we saw a revenue growth of 5% after adjusting for FX in the prior year impact of Business Travel revenues. We built upon this revenue performance with disciplined expense control and the return of significant amounts of capital to shareholders. This solid core performance included making strong progress on some key initiatives. Highlights included the launch of the Plenti loyalty coalition program in the U.S., the expansion of our OptBlue small merchant program in Canada, the rollout of 2 new Centurion airport lounges, refreshes of our gold and Starwood's products as well as the launch earlier this month of Amex Express Checkout, our online merchant checkout solution. As we expected, our solid core underlying performance was impacted by the discrete impacts from the strong dollar in FX along with the changes in our co-brand partnerships.
In terms of our spending on incremental growth initiatives, we are really just starting to ramp this up, and you will see them much more concentrated in the second half of the year. As a result of all this, while year-to-date, our earnings are up approximately 5% versus last year, we would expect earnings per share for the second half of the year to be down versus the prior year, consistent with our discussions on Investor Day. For these reasons, our full year 2015 EPS outlook remains unchanged as we continue to expect earnings per share for the full year to be flat to modestly down.
Just where in this range we end up will be a function of the level of incremental spending we do during the second half of the year along with our billings and revenue trends. 
We also believe our out to return to positive earnings per share growth in 2016 and to be within our target range of 12% to 15% earnings per share growth in 2017 remains appropriate. As you recall, this outlook does not contemplate the impact of any restructuring charges or other contingencies.
Now to turn to a high-level review of our financial results for Q2. As you can see on Slide 3, reported billings growth was 2%. On an FX-adjusted basis, billings grew 6%, significantly higher than our reported rate, but modestly slower than the first quarter. I'll provide more details on our billing performance shortly, but we did see some deceleration in volume growth in the U.S. that was partially offset by improving growth across most international markets.
Reported revenue growth was down 4% due to the inclusion of Business Travel revenue in the prior year and the stronger U.S. dollar. Excluding these items, adjusted revenue growth was 5%. 
Net income was down 4% versus the prior year. The decline was primarily driven by the net benefit related to the Business Travel joint venture transaction and Business Travel operating income in Q2 '14, which together, contributed approximately $0.08 to EPS in the prior year.
Below the net income line, we made our first preferred dividend payment during the second quarter, which reduced EPS by approximately $0.02. 
We also continued to leverage our strong capital position to provide significant returns to our shareholders. Over the past year, we have repurchased 51 million common shares, which translated to a 4% decline in average shares outstanding. This decline
[Audio Gap]
for 25% [ph] and demonstrated the continued strength of our business model.
Let's now move to a more detailed review of our key performance drivers during the second quarter, starting with billed business on Slide 4. 
On an FX-adjusted basis, billings growth slowed modestly from 7% in Q1 to 6% in Q2. As you can see, the primary driver of that decline is the U.S. where we saw growth of 5%, down from 6% in Q1. I'll provide more details on the drivers of the U.S. performance by segment in a few minutes.
Across our international regions, we saw strong growth in JAPA, which was again the fastest-growing region in the quarter, up 16% on an FX-adjusted basis. This solid performance continued to be powered by strong growth in China and Japan. 
We also saw improved performance in EMEA, where the growth in the U.K. remains in the double digits. The decline in volumes in the LACC region was driven by Canada, which is being impacted by the end of our relationship with Costco in Canada. Outside of Canada, we are seeing improved performance in LACC, particularly in Mexico, where growth has accelerated during 2015.
To turn to Costco in Canada for just a moment. While it is still early, we're continued to be pleased by our efforts to capture the spend of the Costco co-brand, card members. As you recall, in September 2014, we launched a new cash back card in Canada that was offered to former Costco Canada card members and it appears to be resonating well. Through the second quarter, we have been able to retain over half of the outer store spend related to the former Canadian Costco co-brand product.
Now I would pause here and highlight that this result is very specific to the Costco relationship in Canada and had little relevance for the U.S. As he said, the 2 situations are very different, with the most important distinction being that there was no portfolio of sale in Canada. If you assume there is a portfolio of sale in the U.S., it would have a profound impact on our ability to capture the spend and lend of the Costco card members in the U.S. Obviously, the sale itself automatically moves the card member relationship. In addition, as you might expect, when a portfolio is sold, there are likely to be contractual restrictions on what types of marketing activities the seller is permitted to engage in. We realize that all of you remain extremely interested in the status of our Costco co-brand portfolio sale discussions with Citi. The reality is this is a very complex transaction, and I can't comment on the specifics during the negotiation. I will remind you, though, that our contract with Costco imposes its own constraints on the sale process. We will, of course, abide by the contract, and we'll continue to update you as appropriate.
To return to Billings now and to provide you with some additional perspective on our international performance, we included Slide 5 this quarter, which shows total international volume growth with and without Canadian volumes on an FX-adjusted basis. As depicted by the green line on the slide, international volume [indiscernible], excluding Canada, increased to 13% during Q2, and this trend is being driven by improved performance across all of our international regions, excluding Canada.
Looking at the results by segment on Slide 6. We saw a sequential decline in growth in GCS where billings were up 2% on an FX-adjusted basis. Similar to last quarter, we continued to see slower spending across a number of corporate customers, primarily in the U.S.
In our U.S. consumer and small business segment, we also saw some deceleration in growth to 6% in Q2. This performance continues to be impacted by gas prices, which were down 27% year-over-year. I would remind you that gas billings comprise about 2% to 3% of our volumes. The U.S. billings performance also reflects the current external economic environment, which remains uneven.
Another driver of the sequential change in billings growth in the USCS segment was our Costco U.S. portfolio. Historically, Costco billings have tended to generally grow in line with the USCS average growth rate. But in the quarter, while still positive, Costco co-brand card growth rates slowed to well below the segment average. The slower growth is in part due to a decrease in new card acquisitions. As you would expect, during the wind-down period, we have agreed with Costco to reduce our joint marketing efforts.
Turning to GNS. This continues to be our strongest billings growth segment, with FX-adjusted growth of 16% during the current quarter. This consistently strong growth demonstrates the diversity of our business model given the much higher-than-average returns on equity of the GNS business and the fact that more than 85% of GNS volumes are from international markets. And again, I'd remind you that the slower growth in ICS is being driven by the end of our relationship with Costco in Canada, which I just discussed.
In all international regions, you see that like other U.S. companies with the significant global footprint, our reported results are being significantly impacted by changes in foreign exchange rates. Over the past year, the dollar has strengthened by 10% to 30% year-over-year against the currencies that we are most exposed to outside the U S. as you can see at the bottom of Slide 7.
Looking at the comparison of our reported and FX-adjusted revenue growth rates for the last 8 quarters, as you can see in the trajectory of the blue dotted line on the slide, our adjusted revenue growth remains consistent with recent trends in the 5% range. However, during the second quarter, foreign exchange had a slightly larger impact on our results than in Q1, dragging adjusted revenue growth down by 4 percentage points.
As you know, this revenue impact is partially offset by the benefit we received from having certain expenses denominated in international currencies, but there is a bottom line impact, especially when rates move this dramatically. Over the longer term, we continue to believe that being a global company that generates revenue in a diverse set of markets around the world is a strength, our business model. At current FX rates, we would expect to see a similar drag in the third quarter on a smaller impacted Q4 as we begin to lap the significant strengthening of the dollar that occurred at the end of last year.
Turning now to loans. You see on Slide 8 that worldwide loans were up 4% versus the prior year. In the U.S., which constitutes the majority of our loan portfolio, growth continues to outpace the industry and was relatively consistent with prior quarter at 7%. Looking forward, we continue to believe that there are attractive opportunities to gain a greater share of loans from both our existing and new customers without significantly changing the overall risk profile of the company.
Regarding the Costco loan portfolio in the U.S., which we consider, of course, to be a very high quality portfolio, we have previously disclosed that it made up about 20% of worldwide loans as of the end of 2014. It remains at approximately 20% of worldwide loans today, while the growth rate in the portfolio is starting to slow in line with spending.
On the international side, reported loan balances were down year-over-year due to the negative impact of FX rates and an expected decline in loans related to the Costco Canada co-brand portfolio.
So putting it all together on the revenue slide on Slide 9. You can see that revenues declined by 4% on a reported basis but increased by 5% when adjusting for FX and Business Travel revenues in the prior year. While this adjusted growth was consistent with last quarter, we did this quarter had the benefit related to certain merchant rebates accruals, and we also had some unfavorable timing impacts in the prior year. These items collectively benefited the year-over-year discount revenue growth rate and also resulted in a 1 basis point increase in the reported discount rate versus the prior year. These specific impacts as well as the decline in Costco Canada merchant volume where we are the much lower discount rate more than offset the expected downward impact on the reported discount rate from growth in the OptBlue program and industry mix changes. 
I'd remind you that from quarter-to-quarter, individual merchant-related items can costs fluctuations in the reported discount rate. More broadly, we said for a number of years that you should expect to see the reported discount rate decline 2 to 3 basis points a year on average due to changes in the mix and spending by location and industry; volume-related pricing discounts, competition; and more recently, growth of OptBlue amongst other factors.
Regarding OptBlue, we have pipelinbeen pleased with the progress we have made signing up merchant acquirers for the program and the pace at which those acquirers have added new merchants to our network. Year-to-date, we have signed up over 700,000 new merchants in the U.S. through OptBlue, and we are focused on driving card member spending to those incremental merchants.
We are also undertaking similar efforts to improve our small merchant coverage in many other markets around the world as evidenced by the launch of the OptBlue program in Canada this quarter.
Coming back to our revenue performance more broadly. As we've seen in prior quarters, the gap between total discount revenue and total billed business growth was again impacted by GNS and cash rebate products growing faster than the company average.
Before moving on, let me first touch on a couple other items on this slide, starting with the other key component of revenue, net interest income. Here, we saw a healthy 8% growth rate driven by our continued efforts to grow our loan portfolio as well as lower funding costs. As the majority of our loan portfolio is in the U.S., the impact of FX is smaller on net interest income than on other revenue lines.
Turning to net card fees, other commissions and fees and other revenue. These lines were all impacted to a greater extent by foreign exchange and also reflected growth in loyalty coalition revenue and some timing items in the prior year.
As we discussed in Investor Day, the loyalty coalition business as one of our most important initiatives to find profitable growth and adjacencies, and we have been expanding the business into our acquisition of Loyalty Partner in 2011. The program is a tangible example of how we can leverage our digital capabilities to provide value for merchants while creating a new revenue stream for the company. 
During the quarter, together with our merchant partners, we were pleased to launch Plenti, our loyalty coalition program in U S. While it is still very early days, we have been encouraged by the initial response and already has more than 20 million total collectors.
Moving now to credit performance on Slide 10. You can see that our lending credit metrics remain at or near historically low levels, with our write-off rates declining slightly versus last quarter and delinquency rates remained flat. As you can see on Slide 11, this steady lending credit performance as well as lower write-off rate in our charge card portfolio and benefits from FX helped drive a 4% decline in provision versus the prior year. While we experienced a year-over-year decline in provision this quarter, looking ahead, we would expect reserves to build modestly in line with loan growth and any changes in credit performance. Therefore, we would expect provision to increase year-over-year and represent a headwind to growth in the second half of 2015. Moreover, as we discussed in Investor Day, we did build into our multiyear financial outlook an assumption that we would see some steady upward tick and write-off rates and a modest build in reserves over the outlook period.
Shifting now to expenses on Slide 12. On a reported basis, expenses declined 4% versus the prior year. Clearly, there are a number of items impacting expense growth year-over-year, including the Business Travel joint venture-related items and Business Travel operating expenses in the prior year. Expenses also benefited year-over-year from the change in foreign exchange rates. I'll walk you through these impacts in more detail as we review marketing and promotion and operating expenses performance in a few moments.
First, however, let me touch on a few other items on this slide. Rewards expense grew by 1%, which was a bit slower than reported billed business growth. Growth this quarter does include a portion of the discrete impact from our renewed co-brand partnerships. However, that impact was more than offset by a decline in Membership Rewards-related expenses, in part due to an enhancement to the ultimate redemption rate estimation process in certain international markets that occurred last year.
Turning to cost of card member services. You see a significant year-over-year increase of 26% consistent with the commentary provided last quarter. As you recall, a portion of the expenses in this line has increased as a result of our renewed co-brand partnerships, and we would expect these elevated levels of growth to continue for the remainder of 2015.
Let's focus now on marketing and promotion expenses on Slide 13 and make a few points. First, recall that last year in Q2, we leveraged the gain from the Business Travel joint venture transaction to support an elevated level of spend. Lacking this elevated level, along with this year's beneficial impact from FX, led to the decline of 21% you see year-over-year.
Second, we have been clear since the Costco decision was made in February that we intend for spend on incremental growth initiatives during full year 2015 to be relatively similar with the elevated level we were at in full year 2014. This remains our intention. I would also point out that while the largest piece of this incremental spending will throw to the marketing and promotion line of portion well also in operating expenses Concur revenue.
Last. Looking at Slide 13, you see that we were still in the process of ramping up our initiatives in Q2. You should expect to see marketing and promotion spend increase substantially in the second half of the year.
As we have said, the elevated level of spending in 2015 will focus on the many growth opportunities that we have across our company. It will support key initiatives, including acquiring new card members, gaining additional spend and lend from existing consumer small business and middle-market customers, expanding our presence internationally, growing our merchant networks in program such as OptBlue, building our loyalty coalition business with things like the launch of Plenti in the U.S. and introducing new digital capabilities.
Turning now to operating expense performance on Slide 14. Our reported results continued to reflect the impact of Business Travel in the prior year across the number of expense categories, complicating line by line comparisons. Additionally, this quarter's results were significantly impacted by last year's items related to the creation of the Business Travel joint venture. Excluding expenses related to the Business Travel joint venture transaction as well as expenses from Business Travel operations in 2014, adjusting operating expenses in total decreased by 5% in the quarter, aided in part by a benefit of FX.
Moving to Slide 15. Adjusted operating expense growth year-to-date remains well below our 3% growth target. As Steve squarely noted in our Investor Day in March, however, we are not achieving this disciplined expense control for a cutback in investment levels, but rather through ongoing efforts to increase the efficiency of the organization. We continued to make strategic investments within operating expenses to support our growth initiatives. This is just one example. Earlier this month, we leveraged our unique technology assess to launch Amex Express Checkout, which allows Amex card members to check out clearly and securely on merchant websites using their Amex login credentials.
Looking ahead for the second half of the year, I point out again that a portion of the incremental spending on growth initiatives will hit operating expenses, including technology initiatives to enhance our small business and corporate capabilities.
Now shifting to capital performance on Slide 16. During the current quarter, we returned 97% of the capital we generated to shareholders while maintaining our already strong capital ratios. Our Q2 performance demonstrates our confidence in the company's ability to generate capital while maintaining its financial strength, and we remain committed to using that capital strength to create value for our shareholders. 
Looking at the capital ratios on the bottom of the slide, I'd remind you that the greater year-over-year increase in the Tier 1 capital ratio was driven by our recent preferred issuances. We made our first dividend payment this quarter. This payment is recognized as a reduction of earnings available to common shareholders and, therefore, reduced our EPS by 1% during Q2.
Let me now provide an update on the DOJ lawsuit before I conclude and take your questions. We are disappointed at our request for a stay of the decision when the injunction was denied this quarter. We have, of course, moved foreword to comply the trial court's remedy. As a result of this day being denied, we can no longer enforce certain contractual provisions that prevent U.S. merchants from steering customers to use other credit and charge cards. We are appealing to trial courts ruling, because we believe it will not provide any benefit to consumers and well, in fact, our competition.
Steering is not a good thing for this service, and we believe many merchants agree. At this point, given that the remedy just took effect earlier this week, it's too early to tell what the impact in the marketplace will be. We are staying focused on delivering value to merchants and deeply believe in the strength of our value proposition.
I'd also remind you that there are a number of other private merchant litigation cases. The Eastern District of New York and other proceedings seeking monetary damages that will begin to progress as our appeal is being heard.
So let me now conclude by stepping away from some of the complexity I just took you through and going back to the key things in our results. Our results show solid core earnings performance built upon our financial model of having diversified growth businesses, disciplined expense controls and capital strength. While billed business growth overall slowed modestly from the first quarter, we saw positive momentum across many areas of our business, including international merchant acquisition and loyalty coalition.
Going forward given our 5% EPS growth year-to-date, simple math would indicate that EPS growth will have to be negative for the balance of the year to meet our continued outlook for full year EPS growth to be flat to modestly down. As I mentioned, the biggest driver where we will end up within this EPS range will be the level of incremental spending on growth initiatives over the balance of the year as well as our billings and revenue trends.
Going back to our Investor Day in March, we discussed our plan to leverage incremental spending in 2015 to help drive sustainable growth going forward. We continue to believe this is the appropriate long-term strategy, and also that we have a range of attractive growth opportunities. All this is also consistent with our previous comments that quarterly earnings performance will be more uneven than it has been historically while we go through this transitional period. Given this dynamic, our focus is that on our full year earnings outlook, rather than our performance in any individual quarter.
Stepping back, as we've discussed in multiple forums over the past couple of years, we of, course, have 3 on-average and overtime financial targets, generating EPS growth of 12% to 15%, our return on equity of 25% or better and revenue growth of above 8%. Clearly, our top focus when we think about these targets is generating consistent EPS growth of 12% to 15%, which is in most environments, we have a fairly good track record of achieving over the 20-plus years that the targets have been in place. Our recent revenue performance has been below our aspirational 8% target, and we expect to remain below that level during the near term given some of the discrete impacts on our performance I noted earlier as well as the current low inflation and low growth economic environment. However, when you think about our financial targets, the revenue target is just one of the facilitating levers that we use to help drive 12% to 15% EPS growth. We have consistently demonstrated that we can achieve our EPS target across a variety of different economic environments without having 8% revenue growth.
In the context of our year-to-date results, we believe that our core earnings performance continues to demonstrate the strength of our business model, and we are doing the right things to position the company for the long term.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Toby for some details on our Q&A session."

Thank you. So the point I was trying to make in my remarks were we can now give you a little bit information that are trying to help you understand what's going on in Canada where there was no portfolio sale, where we were able to the issue cards with in fact, the same card member and we're pleased that we're tracking to retain over half of the outer store spend. As I give people that detail, I think it's really important to realize that, that is a completely different situation from what may happen in the U S. And if you assume there is a portfolio sale in the U.S. where all the card members are automatically moved to new cards from a new issuer. If you assume that in general, these contracts, to your point, Sanjay, have restrictions around marketing, I want to caution people that you would expect to get a very, very different outcome from what is happening in Canada if that's the way the U.S. were to play out. When you think about portfolio sale and assuming there is a gain, we've been I think consistent for quite sometime in saying that we would use that gain or these portions of that gain to help fund continued spending on a variety of growth initiatives. And when you think about our company and our growth opportunities, we have many, many opportunities to grow in every part of our business and every part of the globe. And so the efforts we may or may not make at times around Costco card members are just one small piece with a much broader pie of opportunities we see to really effectively continue to spend an elevated levels, marketing, promotion and certain other things. So I wouldn't overly try to tie, Sanjay, the elevated levels of spending with any particular segment, including the Costco segment. It's really an elevated level of funding that we are applying to the best opportunities we have, which occur all across our business."

I wouldn't -- I'd be cautious about going back and looking at analogies from 2010 and 2011. It's a very, very different situation.

But as we've long said, the reality is there are always impacts in these situations on our business, some of which can create challenges. Of course, we talked in this particular case in particular about the fact that there's some new cross-border dynamics that's putting some pressure on our discount rates in Europe. All that said, one of the strengths of our business model is we're out there everyday having to prove our value to card members and merchants and everyday evolving the way we work with both to demonstrate that value. That does give us an ability to flex and demonstrate our value in ways that others can't necessarily in this regulatory environment. So we are working hard to manage some of the negative impacts of the regulation and use other parts of it to find ways to be even more creative by adding value to merchants and our card members.

We, of course, are unusual in that a rising rate environment isolation, if you hold everything else steady, it's a negative for us and we put a number in our 10-K, just use round numbers, that says revenue -- all else being equal,",293,"So good question, David. We, of course, are unusual in that a rising rate environment isolation, if you hold everything else steady, it's a negative for us and we put a number in our 10-K, just use round numbers, that says revenue -- all else being equal, 100 basis point rise and all interest rates will cost us around $200 million a year. When you look at the outlook we provided, we built and we're trying to be realistic in that outlook and so we built a steadily rising rate environment into that outlook. For that matter, I'd remind you, we also built a little bit steady uptick in some of the provision costs as well. So relative to our outlook, you would have to have a spike in interest rates that was much quicker and larger than what the general economic consensus has been to cause us to see any impact relative to that outlook. In terms of how we think about offsetting the impact of those rising interest costs, if you look historically, there is usually so natural hedge here because as a general matter, central banks and the Fed tend to raise rates more when there's a little bit stronger economic environment. It raise it a little less when the economic environment is not so strong and obviously the rest of our business benefits tremendously when there's a little bit stronger economic environment. Beyond that, the reality is we -- the largest source of our position on our interest rates is the strength of our charge card franchise. We love that business. We think it's a great business and so it just comes with this one aspect that we have to manage as interest just rates and some inevitably rise."

I think there's a couple of aspects to this. So because you first have to close the actual coverage gap, and then you have to make progress on closing the perception gap and there's a time lag as you do well those things. So the program that we've first began to talk about a little over a year ago was one where we so in a boy, if you play out the incremental merchants that we think we can get if you look at just the cycle of most merchants and how often they re-up the smaller merchants with acquirers, then you have a multiyear process here before we believe we can get to the point where, in fact, you signed on most merchants in the U.S. relative for MasterCard Visa. Including at a process that then extends beyond that to mask that with perceptions and to drive card members to those merchants. If you think about the things I said a few minutes ago, as I pointed out that we're really pleased with our progress this year on OptBlue and we signed 700,000 new merchants under it, we also have to wait until you get them signed up, then you have to go through a process to drive business to those merchants. And we're engaged in that, and we're certainly not in a point today where we would say that we have materially closed the coverage gaps and we're not going to go out and start talking with that until we've gotten further into this. So this is clearly a multiyear effort, because you're talking about a couple of million merchants, who ultimately have to add onto the role. And it's a multiyear effort to change perceptions, but we're really pleased with the way it's going. We feel strongly that when you take a multiyear view of this company, this is a really important part of our growth story, and we will continue to give you a sense each quarter of how it's going."

When we changed that plan in February and decided to go down a different path and concluded that we think in the long run, we can generate more value for our shareholders with the past we've now gone down, we really had to do a little bit of a reset. And we've managed the company for the long term. We want to be thoughtful when we choose to do something as dramatic as we've done, go to our shareholders and say we're going to ramp up spending this year and it's going to result in not a lot of earnings growth and, in fact, EPS is going to be down a little bit this year. We want to be really thoughtful about the way we deploy those resources.

Number one, ultimately this is about broad customer value proposition. Rewards is 1 component of that. We have a grand. We have a reputation for security and trust and service. We try to leverage those things. Second, we have a very broad portfolio of products in the U.S., and we do that because we think there's tremendous value in making sure you're delivering the different customers segments the things they value the most, whether it be cash back rewards products; things that use our Membership Rewards programs, which is, of course, still by far the largest and most diversified rewards programs; or our many co-brand products. And by focusing on the broader customer value proposition, by making sure we're being really thoughtful about how we segment the different customer groups and produce something that they're going to most highly value, we think we can get to the best possible result both for both our card members and our shareholders without having to compete dollar for dollar on every single aspect and every single product. So we feel good about some of the latest things we've launched and certainly the big launch in the last 12 months was around the everyday card last year.

That decline actually relates to 1 product with actually maybe 1 large customer and it's an airline fuel-buying product, very, very low margin product. It's an old airline CFO. I'd point out the airlines are little flushed with cash right now, so they're sort of minimizing the use of these products, which help them out with cash flow. That's what caused the drop from 4% to 2% as you go from Q2 to Q1. Now 4% is still a little number. And as I said last quarter, boy, as we have really scrubbed all our customer base, all you can -- all I can tell you is it is U.S.-driven, international markets. It is very broad, it is read in terms of the slowdown and just the organic growth spending trends amongst our midsized and larger clients, T&E-oriented and seems to be very broad spreads.

On credit, you're correct. We've built in both in the back half of this year as well as into our '16 and '17 outlook, some modest and steady uptick in the provision and growth of the loan provisions. Clearly, we have a very steady track record now and growing our loans above the industry average. What happens is that is more benign. Well, that will be very good thing. What I would say in terms of the bottom line is what we are trying to be true to at this point is the financial outlook that we've provided to people and making sure we are really well positioned to demonstrate and to execute upon once we've left all the FX, once we've left all the co-brand changes, once we've left Costco in the U.S., demonstrating to people that the business model, the financial model that had produced [ph] 12 to 15 EPS growth rates, 12% to 15% is in place and is working well. And so credit is a little bit more benign.

I'll go back to that's why I said so far this year, we're pleased with all the sign-ups and we're very focused now of continuing the sign-ups but also beginning to drive more business to those merchants. I would say we are -- remain on track for this year for the program overall to be a positive to our bottom line when you look at the net of all of the positives and negatives, and we are tracking to our plan over a couple of years to much more significantly close the coverage gap. So Cheryl, thank you for that last question and thanks to everybody for joining us on tonight's call. I guess I'd go back probably to where I started and where I ended earlier, which is there is a lot of complexity in our results but we think that this quarter does again reflect solid core underlying performance. With that, I will wish you all a good evening and thank you for your continued interest in American Express."

Overall, our results this quarter reflected what we consider solid core underlying earnings performance. Reported Q2 EPS of $1.42 was relatively consistent with the prior year, while understanding our performance is more complex than usual this quarter for several reasons.
As expected, the results reflected discrete impacts, including a significantly stronger U.S. dollar versus last year, the impact of various changes to our co-brand partnerships and the initial stages of a ramp-up in spending on growth initiatives.
On a year-over-year basis this quarter, EPS growth was also impacted by the prior year net benefit related to the Business Travel joint venture transaction and of course, Business Travel's Q2 '14 operating results.
Looking through the complexity of these items, our core underlying earnings performance was generally consistent with the financial outlook framework that we first shared with you at our Investor Day in March. We continue to view this framework as a useful way to understand the drivers of our performance through the period of the multiyear financial outlook we first provided in February this year. Accordingly, we have included this financial outlook framework as the first slide in our earnings presentation today.
Looking at our results through this lens, we saw a revenue growth of 5% after adjusting for FX in the prior year impact of Business Travel revenues. We built upon this revenue performance with disciplined expense control and the return of significant amounts of capital to shareholders. This solid core performance included making strong progress on some key initiatives. Highlights included the launch of the Plenti Loyalty Coalition Program in the U.S., the expansion of our OptBlue small merchant program in Canada, the rollout of 2 new Centurion airport lounges, refreshes of our Gold and Starwood's products as well as the launch earlier this month of Amex Express Checkout, our online merchant checkout solution. As we expected, our solid core underlying performance was impacted by the discrete impacts from the strong dollar in FX, along with the changes in our co-brand partnerships.
In terms of our spending on incremental growth initiatives, we are really just starting to ramp these up, and you will see them much more concentrated in the second half of the year. As a result of all this, while year-to-date, our earnings are up approximately 5% versus last year, we would expect earnings per share for the second half of the year to be down versus the prior year, consistent with our discussions on Investor Day. For these reasons, our full year 2015 EPS outlook remains unchanged as we continue to expect earnings per share for the full year to be flat to modestly down.
Just where in this range we end up will be a function of the level of incremental spending we do during the second half of the year, along with our billings and revenue trends. 
We also believe our outlook to return to positive earnings per share growth in 2016 and to be within our target range of 12% to 15% earnings per share growth in 2017 remains appropriate. As you recall, this outlook does not contemplate the impact of any restructuring charges or other contingencies.
Now to turn to a high-level review of our financial results for Q2, as you can see on Slide 3, reported billings growth was 2%. On an FX-adjusted basis, billings grew 6%, significantly higher than our reported rate, but modestly slower than the first quarter. I'll provide more details on our billing performance shortly, but we did see some deceleration in volume growth in the U.S. that was partially offset by improving growth across most international markets.
Reported revenue growth was down 4% due to the inclusion of Business Travel revenues in the prior year and the stronger U.S. dollar. Excluding these items, adjusted revenue growth was 5%. 
Net income was down 4% versus the prior year. The decline was primarily driven by the net benefit related to the Business Travel joint venture transaction and Business Travel operating income in Q2 '14, which together contributed approximately $0.08 to EPS in the prior year.
Below the net income line, we made our first preferred dividend payment during the second quarter, which reduced EPS by approximately $0.02. 
We also continued to leverage our strong capital position to provide significant returns to our shareholders. Over the past year, we have repurchased 51 million common shares, which translated to a 4% decline in average shares outstanding. This decline in shares outstanding benefited EPS, which as down only 1% versus the prior year, despite the 4% drop in net income. This performance resulted in an ROE of 28% for the period ended June 30, well above our on average and overtime target of 25% and demonstrated the continued strength of our business model.
Let's now move to a more detailed review of our key performance drivers during the second quarter, starting with billed business on Slide 4. 
On an FX-adjusted basis, billings growth slowed modestly from 7% in Q1 to 6% in Q2. As you can see, the primary driver of that decline is the U.S. where we saw growth of 5%, down from 6% in Q1. I'll provide more details on the drivers of the U.S. performance by segment in a few minutes.
Across our international regions, we saw strong growth in JAPA, which was again the fastest-growing region in the quarter, up 16% on an FX-adjusted basis. This solid performance continued to be powered by strong growth in China and Japan. 
We also saw improved performance in EMEA, where the growth in the U.K. remains in the double digits. The decline in volumes in the LACC region was driven by Canada, which is being impacted by the end of our relationship with Costco in Canada. Outside of Canada, we are seeing improved performance in LACC, particularly in Mexico, where growth has accelerated during 2015.
To turn to Costco in Canada for just a moment. While it is still early, we're continued to be pleased by our efforts to capture the spend of the Costco co-brand card members. As you recall, in September 2014, we launched a new cash back card in Canada that was offered to former Costco Canada card members and it appears to be resonating well. Through the second quarter, we have been able to retain over half of the out-of-store spend related to the former Canadian Costco co-brand product.
Now I would pause here and highlight that this result is very specific to the Costco relationship in Canada and has a little relevance to the U.S. As we said, the 2 situations are very different, with the most important distinction being that there was no portfolio sale in Canada. If you assume there is a portfolio sale in the U.S., it would have a profound impact on our ability to capture the spend and lend of the Costco card members in the U.S. Obviously, the sale itself automatically moves the card member relationship. 
In addition, as you might expect, when a portfolio is sold, there are likely to be contractual restrictions on what types of marketing activities the seller is permitted to engage in. We realize that all of you remain extremely interested in the status of our Costco co-brand portfolio sale discussions with Citi. The reality is this is a very complex transaction, and I can't comment on the specifics during the negotiation. I will remind you, though, that our contract with Costco imposes its own constraints on the sale process. We will, of course, abide by the contract, and we'll continue to update you as appropriate.
To return to billings now and to provide you with some additional perspective on our international performance, we included Slide 5 this quarter, which shows total international volume growth with and without Canadian volumes on an FX-adjusted basis. As depicted by the green line on the slide, international volume growth excluding Canada, increased to 13% during Q2, and this trend is being driven by improved performance across all of our international regions, excluding Canada.
Looking at the results by segment on Slide 6. We saw a sequential decline in growth in GCS where billings were up 2% on an FX-adjusted basis. Similar to last quarter, we continue to see slower spending across a number of corporate customers, primarily in the U.S.
In our U.S. consumer and small business segment, we also saw some deceleration in growth to 6% in Q2. This performance continues to be impacted by gas prices, which were down 27% year-over-year. I would remind you that gas billings comprise about 2% to 3% of our volumes. The U.S. billings performance also reflects the current external economic environment, which remains uneven.
Another driver of the sequential change in billings growth in the USCS segment was our Costco U.S. portfolio. Historically, Costco billings have tended to generally grow in line with the USCS average growth rate. But in the quarter, while still positive, Costco co-brand card growth rates slowed to well below the segment average. The slower growth is in part due to a decrease in new card acquisitions. As you would expect, during the wind-down period, we have agreed with Costco to reduce our joint marketing efforts.
Turning to GNS. This continues to be our strongest billings growth segment, with FX-adjusted growth of 16% during the current quarter. This consistently strong growth demonstrates the diversity of our business model given the much higher-than-average returns on equity of the GNS business and the fact that more than 85% of GNS volumes are from international markets. And again, I'd remind you that the slower growth in ICS is being driven by the end of our relationship with Costco in Canada, which I just discussed.
In all international regions, you see that like other U.S. companies with a significant global footprint, our reported results are being significantly impacted by changes in foreign exchange rates. Over the past year, the dollar has strengthened by 10% to 30% year-over-year against the currencies that we are most exposed to outside the U.S., as you can see at the bottom of Slide 7.
Looking at the comparison of our reported and FX-adjusted revenue growth rates for the last 8 quarters, as you can see in the trajectory of the blue dotted line on the slide, our adjusted revenue growth remains consistent with recent trends in the 5% range. However, during the second quarter, foreign exchange had a slightly larger impact on our results than in Q1, dragging adjusted revenue growth down by 4 percentage points.
As you know, this revenue impact is partially offset by the benefit we received from having certain expenses denominated in international currencies, but there is a bottom line impact, especially when rates move this dramatically. Over the longer term, we continue to believe that being a global company that generates revenue in a diverse set of markets around the world is a strength of our business model. At current FX rates, we would expect to see a similar drag in the third quarter, but a smaller impact in Q4 as we begin to lap the significant strengthening of the dollar that occurred at the end of last year.
Turning now to loans. You see on Slide 8 that worldwide loans were up 4% versus the prior year. In the U.S., which constitutes the majority of our loan portfolio, growth continues to outpace the industry and was relatively consistent with the prior quarter at 7%. Looking forward, we continue to believe that there are attractive opportunities to gain a greater share of loans from both our existing and new customers without significantly changing the overall risk profile of the company.
Regarding the Costco loan portfolio in the U.S., which we consider, of course, to be a very high quality portfolio, we have previously disclosed that it made up about 20% of worldwide loans as of the end of 2014. It remains at approximately 20% of worldwide loans today, while the growth rate in the portfolio is starting to slow in line with spending.
On the international side, reported loan balances were down year-over-year due to the negative impact from FX rates and an expected decline in loans related to the Costco Canada co-brand portfolio.
So putting it all together on the revenue side on Slide 9, you can see that revenues declined by 4% on a reported basis but increased by 5% when adjusting for FX and Business Travel revenues in the prior year. While this adjusted growth was consistent with last quarter, we did this quarter have a benefit related to certain merchant rebates accruals, and we also had some unfavorable timing impacts in the prior year. These items collectively benefited the year-over-year discount revenue growth rate and also resulted in a 1-basis-point increase in the reported discount rate versus the prior year. These specific impacts as well as the decline in Costco Canada merchant volume, where we earned a much lower discount rate, more than offset the expected downward impact on the reported discount rate from growth in the OptBlue program and industry mix changes. 
I'd remind you that from quarter-to-quarter, individual merchant-related items can cause fluctuations in the reported discount rate. More broadly, we've said for a number of years that you should expect to see the reported discount rate decline 2 to 3 basis points a year on average due to changes in the mix of spending by location and industry; volume-related pricing discounts; competition; and more recently, growth of OptBlue, amongst other factors.
Regarding OptBlue, we have been pleased with the progress we have made signing up merchant acquirers for the program and the pace at which those acquirers have added new merchants to our network. Year-to-date, we have signed up over 700,000 new merchants in the U.S. through OptBlue, and we are focused on driving card member spending to those incremental merchants.
We are also undertaking similar efforts to improve our small merchant coverage in many other markets around the world as evidenced by the launch of the OptBlue program in Canada this quarter.
Coming back to our revenue performance more broadly. As we've seen in prior quarters, the gap between total discount revenue and total billed business growth was again impacted by GNS and cash rebate products growing faster than the company average.
Before moving on, let me first touch on a couple other items on this slide, starting with the other key component of revenue, net interest income. Here we saw a healthy 8% growth rate driven by our continued efforts to grow our loan portfolio as well as lower funding costs. As the majority of our loan portfolio is in the U.S., the impact of FX is smaller on net interest income than on other revenue lines.
Turning to net card fees, other commissions and fees and other revenue. These lines were all impacted to a greater extent by foreign exchange and also reflected growth in loyalty coalition revenue and some timing items in the prior year.
As we discussed at Investor Day, the loyalty coalition business is one of our most important initiatives to find profitable growth in adjacencies, and we have been expanding the business into our acquisition of Loyalty Partner in 2011. The program is a tangible example of how we can leverage our digital capabilities to provide value for merchants while creating a new revenue stream for the company. 
During the quarter, together with our merchant partners, we were pleased to launch Plenti, our loyalty coalition program in the U.S. While it is still very early days, we have been encouraged by the initial response and the program already has more than 20 million total collectors.
Moving now to credit performance on Slide 10. You can see that our lending credit metrics remain at or near historically low levels, with our write-off rates declining slightly versus last quarter and our delinquency rate remaining flat. As you can see on Slide 11, this steady lending credit performance as well as lower write-off rates in our charge card portfolio and benefits from FX helped to drive a 4% decline in provision versus the prior year. 
Though we experienced a year-over-year decline in provision this quarter, looking ahead, we would expect reserves to build modestly in line with loan growth and any changes in credit performance. Therefore, we would expect provision to increase year-over-year and represent a headwind to growth in the second half of 2015. Moreover, as we discussed at Investor Day, we did build into our multiyear financial outlook an assumption that we would see some steady upward tick in write-off rates and a modest build in reserves over the outlook period.
Shifting now to expenses on Slide 12. On a reported basis, expenses declined 4% versus the prior year. Clearly, there are a number of items impacting expense growth year-over-year, including the Business Travel joint venture-related items and Business Travel operating expenses in the prior year. Expenses also benefited year-over-year from the change in foreign exchange rates. I'll walk you through these impacts in more detail as we review marketing and promotion and operating expenses performance in a few moments.
First, however, let me touch on a few other items on this slide. Rewards expense grew by 1%, which was a bit slower than reported billed business growth. Growth this quarter does include a portion of the discrete impact from our renewed co-brand partnerships. However, that impact was more than offset by a decline in Membership Rewards-related expenses, in part due to an enhancement to the ultimate redemption rate estimation process in certain international markets that occurred last year.
Turning to cost of card member services. You see a significant year-over-year increase of 26% consistent with the commentary provided last quarter. As you recall, a portion of the expenses in this line has increased as a result of our renewed co-brand partnerships, and we would expect these elevated levels of growth to continue for the remainder of 2015.
Let's focus now on marketing and promotion expenses on Slide 13 and make a few points. First, recall that last year in Q2, we leveraged the gain from the Business Travel joint venture transaction to support an elevated level of spend. Lapping this elevated level, along with this year's beneficial impact from FX, led to the decline of 21% you see year-over-year.
Second, we have been clear since the Costco decision was made in February that we intend for spend on incremental growth initiatives during full year 2015 to be relatively similar with the elevated level we were at in full year 2014. This remains our intention. I would also point out that while the largest piece of this incremental spending will flow through the marketing and promotional line, a portion will also hit operating expenses contra revenue.
Last. Looking at Slide 13, you see that we were still in the process of ramping up our initiatives in Q2. You should expect to see marketing and promotion expense increase substantially in the second half of the year.
As we have said, the elevated level of spending in 2015 will focus on the many growth opportunities that we have across our company. It will support key initiatives, including acquiring new card members, gaining additional spend and lend from existing consumer small business and middle-market customers, expanding our presence internationally, growing our merchant networks in programs such as OptBlue, building our loyalty coalition business with things like the launch of Plenti in the U.S. and introducing new digital capabilities.
Turning now to operating expense performance on Slide 14. Our reported results continued to reflect the impact of Business Travel in the prior year across a number of expense categories, complicating line by line comparisons. Additionally, this quarter's results were significantly impacted by last year's items related to the creation of the Business Travel joint venture. Excluding expenses related to the Business Travel joint venture transaction as well as expenses from Business Travel operations in 2014, adjusted operating expenses in total decreased by 5% in the quarter, aided in part by a benefit from FX.
Moving to Slide 15. Adjusted operating expense growth year-to-date remains well below our 3% growth target. As Steve Squeri noted in our Investor Day in March, however, we are not achieving this disciplined expense control for a cutback in investment levels, but rather through ongoing efforts to increase the efficiency of the organization. 
We continue to make strategic investments within operating expenses to support our growth initiatives. This is just one example. Earlier this month, we leveraged our unique technology and assets to launch Amex Express Checkout, which allows Amex card members to check out clearly and securely on merchant websites using their Amex login credentials.
Looking ahead to the second half of the year, point out again that a portion of the incremental spending on growth initiatives will hit operating expenses, including technology initiatives to enhance our small business and corporate capabilities.
Now shifting to capital performance on Slide 16. During the current quarter, we returned 97% of the capital we generated to shareholders while maintaining our already strong capital ratios. Our Q2 performance demonstrates our confidence in the company's ability to generate capital while maintaining its financial strength, and we remain committed to using that capital strength to create value for our shareholders. 
Looking at the capital ratios on the bottom of the slide, I'd remind you that the greater year-over-year increase in the Tier 1 capital ratio was driven by our recent preferred issuances. We made our first dividend payment this quarter. This payment is recognized as a reduction of earnings available to common shareholders and, therefore, reduced our EPS by 1% during Q2.
Let me now provide an update on the DoJ lawsuit before I conclude and take your questions. We are disappointed that our request for a stay of the decision in the injunction was denied this quarter. We have, of course, moved forward to comply the trial court's remedy. As a result of the stay being denied, we can no longer enforce certain contractual provisions that prevent U.S. merchants from steering customers to use other credit and charge cards. We are appealing the trial court's ruling, because we believe it will not provide any benefit to consumers and will, in fact, harm competition.
Steering is not a good thing for consumers, and we believe many merchants agree. At this point, given that the remedy just took effect earlier this week, it's too early to tell what the impact in the marketplace will be. We are staying focused on delivering value to merchants and deeply believe in the strength of our value proposition.
I'd also remind you that there are a number of other private merchant litigation cases. The Eastern District of New York and other proceedings seeking monetary damages that will begin to progress as our appeal is being heard.
So let me now conclude by stepping away from some of the complexity I just took you through and going back to the key themes in our results. Our results show solid core earnings performance built upon our financial model of having diversified growth businesses, disciplined expense controls and capital strength. While billed business growth overall slowed modestly from the first quarter, we saw positive momentum across many areas of our business, including international merchant acquisition and loyalty coalition.
Going forward, given our 5% EPS growth year-to-date, simple math would indicate that EPS growth will have to be negative for the balance of the year to meet our continued outlook for full year EPS growth to be flat to modestly down. As I mentioned, the biggest driver where we will end up within this EPS range will be the level of incremental spending on growth initiatives over the balance of the year as well as our billings and revenue trends.
Going back to our Investor Day in March, we discussed our plan to leverage incremental spending in 2015 to help drive sustainable growth going forward. We continue to believe this is the appropriate long-term strategy, and also that we have a range of attractive growth opportunities. All this is also consistent with our previous comments that quarterly earnings performance will be more uneven than it has been historically while we go through this transitional period. Given this dynamic, our focus is that on our full year earnings outlook, rather than our performance in any individual quarter.
Stepping back, as we've discussed in multiple forums over the past couple of years, we of, course, have 3 on-average and overtime financial targets: generating EPS growth of 12% to 15%, return a on equity of 25% or better and revenue growth of above 8%. Clearly, our top focus when we think about these targets is generating consistent EPS growth of 12% to 15%, which in most environments, we have a fairly good track record of achieving over the 20-plus years that the targets have been in place. Our recent revenue performance has been below our aspirational 8% target, and we expect to remain below that level during the near term given some of the discrete impacts on our performance I noted earlier as well as the current low inflation and low growth economic environment. 
However, when you think about our financial targets, the revenue target is just one of the facilitating levers that we use to help drive 12% to 15% EPS growth. We have consistently demonstrated that we can achieve our EPS target across a variety of different economic environments without having 8% revenue growth.
In the context of our year-to-date results, we believe that our core earnings performance continues to demonstrate the strength of our business model, and that we are doing the right things to position the company for the long term.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Toby for some details on our Q&A session."

Thank you. So the points I was trying to make in my remarks were we can now give you a little bit information and are trying to help you understand what's going on in Canada where there was no portfolio sale, where we were able to reissue cards with, in fact, the same card member and where we're pleased that we're tracking to retain over half of the outer store spend. As I give people that detail, I think it's really important to realize that, that is a completely different situation from what may happen in the U.S. And if you assume there is a portfolio sale in the U.S. where all the card members are automatically moved to new cards from a new issuer. Then if you assume that in general, these contracts, to your point, Sanjay, have restrictions around marketing, I want to caution people that you would expect to get a very, very different outcome from what is happening in Canada if that's the way the U.S. were to play out. When you think about a portfolio sale and assuming there is a gain, we've been I think consistent for quite sometime in saying that we would use that gain or these portions of that gain to help fund continued spending on a variety of growth initiatives. And when you think about our company and our growth opportunities, we have many, many opportunities to grow in every part of our business in every part of the globe. And so the efforts we may or may not make at times around Costco card members are just one small piece what is a much broader pie of opportunities we see to really effectively continue to spend in elevated levels, marketing, promotion and certain other things. So I wouldn't overly try to tie, Sanjay, the elevated levels of spending with any particular segment, including the Costco segment.

You obviously are looking to increase ad in the back half of the year. Looking back at some of the recent experience going back to 2010 and '11 where you really did increase spending pretty dramatically then to drive growth, it -- the levels that you accelerated spending at that time were considerably higher than what I think you're basically guiding to for the back half of the year. So I guess the question is do you think that taking marketing and promotion expense to say somewhere in the 34, 35, 36 basis points per unit billing is going to be sufficient to get to the growth you need to achieve your targets? And if I'm thinking about it wrong, is there a way to dimensionalize that?"

When you look at, in fact, one of the slides in the presentation today, which lays out the last 8 or 9 quarters of spending around marketing and promotion, I would say if you steer at that slide a little bit, it gives -- will give you a more realistic sense of the range of spending that we would consider elevated and that we would consider a range where we can very efficiently and very effectively, in today's environment, deploy all the dollars. I wouldn't -- I'd be cautious about going back and looking at analogies from 2010 and 2011. It's a very, very different situation. So I think if you look at that more recent set of histories and think about the highest levels, that's probably more what we think we can target and be really effective."

Let me step back and say clearly, as a general matter, we don't think regulation is a good thing for consumers and merchants and for this category. When you look at the European union regulation and the final layout of it, it certainly confirms our view that most of the reforms are really targeted at addressing concerns around Visa and MasterCard's interchange practices. But as we've long said, the reality is there are always impacts in these situations on our business, some of which can create challenges for us. We have talked in this particular case in particular about the fact that there are some new cross-border dynamics that's putting some pressure on our discount rates in Europe. All that said, one of the strengths of our business model is we're out there every day having to prove our value to card members and merchants and every day evolving the way we work with both to demonstrate that value. That does give us an ability to flex and demonstrate our value in ways that others can't necessarily in this regulatory environment. So we are working hard to manage some of the negative impacts of the regulation and use other parts of it to find ways to be even more creative about adding value to merchants and our card members. And I would say, well, obviously, the legislation hasn't had any or much material impact yet, we're pleased with the results we see right now in Europe, and we're going to work really, really hard try to continue those."

We, of course, are unusual in that a rising rate environment in isolation, if you hold everything else steady, is a negative for us and we put a number in our 10-K, just use round numbers that says for every -- all else being equal, 100 basis point rise in all interest rates will cost us around $200 million a year. When you look at the outlook we provided, we built it -- we're trying to be realistic in that outlook and so we built a steadily rising rate environment into that outlook. For that matter, I'd remind you, we also built a little bit steady uptick in some of the provision costs as well. So relative to our outlook, you would have to have a spike in interest rates that was much quicker and larger than what the general economic consensus has been to cause us to see any impact relative to that outlook. In terms of how we think about offsetting the impact of those rising interest costs, if you look historically, there is usually some natural hedge here because as a general matter, central banks and the Fed tend to raise rates more when there's a little bit stronger economic environment and raise it a little less when the economic environment is not so strong, and obviously the rest of our business benefits tremendously when there's a little bit stronger economic environment. Beyond that, the reality is we -- the largest source of our position on our sensitivity, the interest rates is the strength of our charge card franchise. We love that business. We think it's a great business. And so it just comes with this one aspect that we have to manage as interest rates at some point inevitably rise."

I think there's a couple of aspects to this. So because you first have to close the actual coverage gap and then you have to make progress on closing the perception gap, and there's a time lag as you do both those things. So the program that we've first began to talk about a little over a year ago was one where we said, boy, if you play out the incremental merchants that we think we can get, if you look at just the cycle of most merchants and how often they re-up the smaller merchants with acquirers, then you have a multiyear process here before we believe we can get to the point where, in fact, you signed on most merchants in the U.S. relative through MasterCard, Visa. You could have a process that then extends beyond that to mask that with perceptions and to drive card members to those merchants. If you think about the things I said a few minutes ago, as I pointed out, they we're really pleased with our progress this year on OptBlue and we signed 700,000 new merchants under it. We also have to wait until you get them signed up, and then you have to go through a process to drive business to those merchants. And we're engaged in that, and we're certainly not in the point today where we would say that we have materially closed the coverage gaps. We're not going to go out and start talking about that until we've gotten further into this. So this is clearly a multiyear effort, because you're talking about a couple of million merchants you ultimately have to add onto the role. And it's a multiyear effort to change perceptions, but we're really pleased with the way it's going. We feel strongly that when you take a multiyear view of this company, this is a really important part of our growth story, and we will continue to give you a sense each quarter of how it's going."

When we changed that plan in February and decided to go down a different path and concluded that we think in the long run we can generate more value for our shareholders with the past we've now gone down, we really had to do a little bit of a reset. And we managed the company for the long term. We want to be thoughtful when we choose to do something as dramatic as we've done, go to our shareholders and say we're going to ramp up spending this year and it's going to result in not a lot of earnings growth and, in fact, EPS can even be down a little bit this year. We want to be really thoughtful about the way we deploy those resources.

We try to leverage those things. Second, we have a very broad portfolio of products in the U.S., and we do that because we think there's tremendous value in making sure you're delivering to different customer segments the things they value the most, whether it be cash back rewards products; things that use our Membership Rewards programs, which is of course still by far the largest and most diversified rewards programs; or our many co-brand products. And by focusing on the broader customer value proposition, by making sure we're being really thoughtful about how we segment the different customer groups and produce something that they're going to most highly value, we think we can get to the best possible result both for both our card members and our shareholders without having to compete dollar for dollar on every single aspect in every single product.

There was a sequential decline here, Q1 to Q2, from 4% to 2%. That decline actually relates to one product with actually maybe one large customer and it's an airline fuel-buying product, very, very low margin product. As an old airline CFO, I'd point out the airlines are a little flushed with cash right now, and so they're sort of minimizing their use of these products, which help them out with cash flow. That's what caused the drop from 4% to 2% as you go from Q2 to Q1. Now 4% is still a low number. And as I said last quarter, boy, as we have really scrubbed all our customer base, all you can -- all I can tell you is it is U.S.-driven, not the international markets. It is very broad, it is read in terms of a slowdown and just the organic growth spending trends amongst our midsized and larger clients, T&E-oriented and it seems to be very broad spread. So you can draw different conclusions from that.

And so if credit is a little bit more benign, we will frankly look to see whether we are operating within the financial outlook that we have and whether we have other growth initiative funding that we, in fact, think it could be for our shareholders, very profitably redeployed or whether we want to take it to the bottom line to make sure we feel comfortable that we can come in with the kind of outlook we've provided. So while there's always a lot of moving pieces, we'll have to see where they all come out. But hopefully, Mark, that gives you at least some sense of how we will think about things."

So there's a -- not to get overly tactical here, but you have to get the merchant signed up. The reality is we have trained over many decades. Our card members do look for little stickers in the window. And so you literally send teams of people out to make sure stickers were going up in the windows and that helps. There's an element of educating our card members. Now here, there's sort of a -- you have to think about the pacing and the timing. You wouldn't necessarily, if you were, Cheryl, an Amex card member, which I'm sure you are, of course, want to get an e-mail from us every single time we signed up any merchant within 10 miles of you because you get tired of seeing all the e-mails and you ignore them. So you kind of have to be thoughtful about when is the right time to communicate in the most impactful way to our card members and when do you make sure you're doing that soon enough so the merchants who sign up start to see Amex card members and feel good about what they have done. So there is no magic here. It's a matter of balancing some of those basic blocking and tackling things we need to do, but we're very focused on it. I'll go back to that's why I said so far this year, we're pleased with all the sign-ups and we are very focused now of continuing the sign-ups but also beginning to drive more business to those merchants. I would say we are -- remain on track for this year for the program overall to be a positive to our bottom line when you look at the net of all the positives and negatives, and we are tracking to our plan over a couple of years to much more significantly close the coverage gap.
So Cheryl, thank you for that last question and thanks to everybody for joining us on tonight's call. I guess I'd go back probably to where I started and where I ended earlier, which is there is a lot of complexity in our results but we think that this quarter does again reflect solid core underlying performance.

Overall, our results this quarter reflected what we consider solid core underlying earnings performance. Reported Q2 EPS of $1.42 was relatively consistent with the prior year, while understanding our performance is more complex than usual this quarter for several reasons.
As expected, the results reflected discrete impacts, including a significantly stronger U.S. dollar versus last year, the impact of various changes to our co-brand partnerships and the initial stages of a ramp-up in spending on growth initiatives.
On a year-over-year basis this quarter, EPS growth was also impacted by the prior year net benefit related to the Business Travel joint venture transaction and, of course, Business Travel's Q2 '14 operating results.
Looking through the complexity of these items, our core underlying earnings performance was generally consistent with the financial outlook framework that we first shared with you at our Investor Day in March. We continue to view this framework as a useful way to understand the drivers of our performance through the period of the multiyear financial outlook we first provided in February this year. Accordingly, we have included this financial outlook framework as the first slide in our earnings presentation today.
Looking at our results through this lens, we saw a revenue growth of 5% after adjusting for FX and the prior year impact of Business Travel revenues. We built upon this revenue performance with disciplined expense control and the return of significant amounts of capital to shareholders. This solid core performance included making strong progress on some key initiatives. Highlights included the launch of the Plenti Loyalty Coalition Program in the U.S., the expansion of our OptBlue small merchant program in Canada, the rollout of 2 new Centurion airport lounges, refreshes of our Gold and Starwood's products, as well as the launch earlier this month of Amex Express Checkout, our online merchant checkout solution. As we expected, our solid core underlying performance was impacted by the discrete impacts from the strong dollar in FX, along with the changes in our co-brand partnerships.
In terms of our spending on incremental growth initiatives, we are really just starting to ramp these up, and you will see them much more concentrated in the second half of the year. As a result of all this, while year-to-date our earnings are up approximately 5% versus last year, we would expect earnings per share for the second half of the year to be down versus the prior year, consistent with our discussions on Investor Day. For these reasons, our full year 2015 EPS outlook remains unchanged as we continue to expect earnings per share for the full year to be flat to modestly down. Just where in this range we end up will be a function of the level of incremental spending we do during the second half of the year, along with our billings and revenue trends. 
We also believe our outlook, to return to positive earnings per share growth in 2016 and to be within our target range of 12% to 15% earnings per share growth in 2017, remains appropriate. As you recall, this outlook does not contemplate the impact of any restructuring charges or other contingencies.
Now to turn to a high-level review of our financial results for Q2, as you can see on Slide 3, reported billings growth was 2%. On an FX-adjusted basis, billings grew 6%, significantly higher than our reported rate, but modestly slower than the first quarter. I'll provide more details on our billing performance shortly, but we did see some deceleration in volume growth in the U.S. that was partially offset by improving growth across most international markets.
Reported revenue growth was down 4% due to the inclusion of Business Travel revenues in the prior year and the stronger U.S. dollar. Excluding these items, adjusted revenue growth was 5%. 
Net income was down 4% versus the prior year. The decline was primarily driven by the net benefit related to the Business Travel joint venture transaction and Business Travel operating income in Q2 '14, which together contributed approximately $0.08 to EPS in the prior year.
Below the net income line, we made our first preferred dividend payment during the second quarter, which reduced EPS by approximately $0.02. 
We also continued to leverage our strong capital position to provide significant returns to our shareholders. Over the past year, we have repurchased 51 million common shares, which translated to a 4% decline in average shares outstanding. This decline in shares outstanding benefited EPS, which was down only 1% versus the prior year, despite the 4% drop in net income. This performance resulted in an ROE of 28% for the period ended June 30, well above our on-average and overtime target of 25% and demonstrated the continued strength of our business model.
Let's now move to a more detailed review of our key performance drivers during the second quarter, starting with billed business on Slide 4. On an FX-adjusted basis, billings growth slowed modestly from 7% in Q1 to 6% in Q2. As you can see, the primary driver of that decline is the U.S., where we saw growth of 5%, down from 6% in Q1. I'll provide more details on the drivers of the U.S. performance by segment in a few minutes.
Across our international regions, we saw strong growth in JAPA, which was again the fastest-growing region in the quarter, up 16% on an FX-adjusted basis. This solid performance continued to be powered by strong growth in China and Japan. 
We also saw improved performance in EMEA, where the growth in the U.K. remains in the double digits. The decline in volumes in the LACC region was driven by Canada, which is being impacted by the end of our relationship with Costco in Canada. Outside of Canada, we are seeing improved performance in LACC, particularly in Mexico, where growth has accelerated during 2015.
To turn to Costco in Canada for just a moment. While it is still early, we continued to be pleased by our efforts to capture the spend of the Costco co-brand card members. As you recall, in September 2014, we launched a new cash back card in Canada that was offered to former Costco Canada card members and it appears to be resonating well. Through the second quarter, we have been able to retain over half of the out-of-store spend related to the former Canadian Costco co-brand product.
Now, I would pause here and highlight that this result is very specific to the Costco relationship in Canada and has little relevance to the U.S. As we said, the 2 situations are very different, with the most important distinction being that there was no portfolio sale in Canada. If you assume there was a portfolio sale in the U.S., it would have a profound impact on our ability to capture the spend and lend of the Costco card members in the U.S. Obviously, the sale itself automatically moves the card member relationship. 
In addition, as you might expect, when a portfolio is sold, there are likely to be contractual restrictions on what types of marketing activities the seller is permitted to engage in. We realize that all of you remain extremely interested in the status of our Costco co-brand portfolio sale discussions with Citi. The reality is this is a very complex transaction, and I can't comment on the specifics during the negotiation. I will remind you, though, that our contract with Costco imposes its own constraints on the sale process. We will, of course, abide by the contract, and we'll continue to update you as appropriate.
To return to billings now and to provide you with some additional perspective on our international performance, we included Slide 5 this quarter, which shows total international volume growth with and without Canadian volumes on an FX-adjusted basis. As depicted by the green line on the slide, international volume growth, excluding Canada, increased to 13% during Q2, and this trend is being driven by improved performance across all of our international regions, excluding Canada.
Looking at the results by segment on Slide 6. We saw a sequential decline in growth in GCS where billings were up 2% on an FX-adjusted basis. Similar to last quarter, we continue to see slower spending across a number of corporate customers, primarily in the U.S.
In our U.S. consumer and small business segment, we also saw some deceleration in growth to 6% in Q2. This performance continues to be impacted by gas prices, which were down 27% year-over-year. I would remind you that gas billings comprise about 2% to 3% of our volumes. The U.S. billings performance also reflects the current external economic environment, which remains uneven.
Another driver of the sequential change in billings growth in the USCS segment was our Costco U.S. portfolio. Historically, Costco billings have tended to generally grow in line with the USCS average growth rate. But in the quarter, while still positive, Costco co-brand card growth rates slowed to well below the segment average. The slower growth is in part due to a decrease in new card acquisitions. As you would expect, during the wind-down period, we have agreed with Costco to reduce our joint marketing efforts.
Turning to GNS. This continues to be our strongest billings growth segment, with FX-adjusted growth of 16% during the current quarter. This consistently strong growth demonstrates the diversity of our business model given the much higher-than-average returns on equity of the GNS business and the fact that more than 85% of GNS volumes are from international markets. And again, I'd remind you that the slower growth in ICS is being driven by the end of our relationship with Costco in Canada, which I just discussed.
In all international regions, you see that like other U.S. companies with a significant global footprint, our reported results are being significantly impacted by changes in foreign exchange rates. Over the past year, the dollar has strengthened by 10% to 30% year-over-year against the currencies that we are most exposed to outside the U.S., as you can see at the bottom of Slide 7.
Looking at the comparison of our reported and FX-adjusted revenue growth rates for the last 8 quarters, as you can see in the trajectory of the blue dotted line on the slide, our adjusted revenue growth remains consistent with recent trends, in the 5% range. However, during the second quarter, foreign exchange had a slightly larger impact on our results than in Q1, dragging adjusted revenue growth down by 4 percentage points.
As you know, this revenue impact is partially offset by the benefit we received from having certain expenses denominated in international currencies, but there is a bottom line impact, especially when rates move this dramatically. Over the longer term, we continue to believe that being a global company that generates revenue in a diverse set of markets around the world is a strength of our business model. At current FX rates, we would expect to see a similar drag in the third quarter, but a smaller impact in Q4 as we begin to lap the significant strengthening of the dollar that occurred at the end of last year.
Turning now to loans. You see on Slide 8 that worldwide loans were up 4% versus the prior year. In the U.S., which constitutes the majority of our loan portfolio, growth continues to outpace the industry and was relatively consistent with the prior quarter at 7%. Looking forward, we continue to believe that there are attractive opportunities to gain a greater share of loans from both our existing and new customers without significantly changing the overall risk profile of the company.
Regarding the Costco loan portfolio in the U.S., which we consider, of course, to be a very high-quality portfolio, we have previously disclosed that it made up about 20% of worldwide loans as of the end of 2014. It remains at approximately 20% of worldwide loans today, though the growth rate in the portfolio is starting to slow in line with spending.
On the international side, reported loan balances were down year-over-year due to the negative impact from FX rates and an expected decline in loans related to the Costco Canada co-brand portfolio.
So putting it all together on the revenue side on Slide 9. You can see that revenues declined by 4% on a reported basis but increased by 5% when adjusting for FX and Business Travel revenues in the prior year. While this adjusted growth was consistent with last quarter, we did this quarter have a benefit related to certain merchant rebates accruals, and we also had some unfavorable timing impacts in the prior year. These items collectively benefited the year-over-year discount revenue growth rate and also resulted in a 1-basis-point increase in the reported discount rate versus the prior year. These specific impacts, as well as the decline in Costco Canada merchant volume, where we earned a much lower discount rate, more than offset the expected downward impact on the reported discount rate from growth in the OptBlue program and industry mix changes. 
I'd remind you that from quarter-to-quarter, individual merchant-related items can cause fluctuations in the reported discount rate. More broadly, we've said for a number of years that you should expect to see the reported discount rate decline 2 to 3 basis points a year on average due to changes in the mix of spending by location and industry; volume-related pricing discounts; competition; and more recently, growth of OptBlue, amongst other factors.
Regarding OptBlue, we have been pleased with the progress we have made signing up merchant acquirers for the program and the pace at which those acquirers have added new merchants to our network. Year-to-date, we have signed up over 700,000 new merchants in the U.S. through OptBlue, and we are focused on driving card member spending to those incremental merchants.
We are also undertaking similar efforts to improve our small merchant coverage in many other markets around the world, as evidenced by the launch of the OptBlue program in Canada this quarter.
Coming back to our revenue performance more broadly. As we've seen in prior quarters, the gap between total discount revenue and total billed business growth was again impacted by GNS and cash rebate products growing faster than the company average.
Before moving on, let me first touch on a couple other items on this slide, starting with the other key component of revenue, net interest income. Here we saw a healthy 8% growth rate driven by our continued efforts to grow our loan portfolio as well as lower funding costs. As the majority of our loan portfolio is in the U.S., the impact of FX is smaller on net interest income than on other revenue lines.
Turning to net card fees, other commissions and fees and other revenue. These lines were all impacted to a greater extent by foreign exchange and also reflected growth in loyalty coalition revenue and some timing items in the prior year.
As we discussed at Investor Day, the loyalty coalition business is one of our most important initiatives to find profitable growth in adjacencies, and we have been expanding the business into our acquisition of Loyalty Partner in 2011. The program is a tangible example of how we can leverage our digital capabilities to provide value for merchants while creating a new revenue stream for the company. 
During the quarter, together with our merchant partners, we were pleased to launch Plenti, our loyalty coalition program in the U.S. While it is still very early days, we have been encouraged by the initial response and the program already has more than 20 million total collectors.
Moving now to credit performance on Slide 10. You can see that our lending credit metrics remain at or near historically low levels, with our write-off rates declining slightly versus last quarter and our delinquency rate remaining flat. As you can see on Slide 11, this steady lending credit performance as well as lower write-off rates in our charge card portfolio and benefits from FX helped to drive a 4% decline in provision versus the prior year. 
Though we experienced a year-over-year decline in provision this quarter, looking ahead, we would expect reserves to build modestly in line with loan growth and any changes in credit performance. Therefore, we would expect provision to increase year-over-year and represent a headwind to growth in the second half of 2015. Moreover, as we discussed at Investor Day, we did build into our multiyear financial outlook an assumption that we would see some steady upward tick in write-off rates and a modest build in reserves over the outlook period.
Shifting now to expenses on Slide 12. On a reported basis, expenses declined 4% versus the prior year. Clearly, there are a number of items impacting expense growth year-over-year, including the Business Travel joint venture-related items and Business Travel operating expenses in the prior year. Expenses also benefited year-over-year from the change in foreign exchange rates. I'll walk you through these impacts in more detail as we review marketing and promotion and operating expenses performance in a few moments.
First, however, let me touch on a few other items on this slide. Rewards expense grew by 1%, which was a bit slower than reported billed business growth. Growth this quarter does include a portion of the discrete impact from our renewed co-brand partnerships. However, that impact was more than offset by a decline in Membership Rewards-related expenses, in part due to an enhancement to the ultimate redemption rate estimation process in certain international markets that occurred last year.
Turning to cost of card member services. You see a significant year-over-year increase of 26% consistent with the commentary provided last quarter. As you recall, a portion of the expenses in this line has increased as a result of our renewed co-brand partnerships, and we would expect these elevated levels of growth to continue for the remainder of 2015.
Let's focus now on marketing and promotion expenses on Slide 13 and make a few points. First, recall that last year in Q2, we leveraged the gain from the Business Travel joint venture transaction to support an elevated level of spend. Lapping this elevated level, along with this year's beneficial impact from FX, led to the decline of 21% you see year-over-year.
Second, we have been clear since the Costco decision was made in February that we intend for spend on incremental growth initiatives during full year 2015 to be relatively similar with the elevated level we were at in full year 2014. This remains our intention. I would also point out that while the largest piece of this incremental spending will flow through the marketing and promotional line, a portion will also hit operating expenses contra revenue.
Last. Looking at Slide 13, you see that we were still in the process of ramping up our initiatives in Q2. You should expect to see marketing and promotion expense increase substantially in the second half of the year.
As we have said, the elevated level of spending in 2015 will focus on the many growth opportunities that we have across our company. It will support key initiatives, including acquiring new card members, gaining additional spend and lend from existing consumer small business and middle-market customers, expanding our presence internationally, growing our merchant networks in programs such as OptBlue, building our loyalty coalition business with things like the launch of Plenti in the U.S. and introducing new digital capabilities.
Turning now to operating expense performance on Slide 14. Our reported results continued to reflect the impact of Business Travel in the prior year across a number of expense categories, complicating line-by-line comparisons. Additionally, this quarter's results were significantly impacted by last year's items related to the creation of the Business Travel joint venture. Excluding expenses related to the Business Travel joint venture transaction, as well as expenses from Business Travel operations in 2014, adjusted operating expenses in total decreased by 5% in the quarter, aided in part by a benefit from FX.
Moving to Slide 15. Adjusted operating expense growth year-to-date remains well below our 3% growth target. As Steve Squeri noted at our Investor Day in March, however, we are not achieving this disciplined expense control for a cutback in investment levels, but rather through ongoing efforts to increase the efficiency of the organization. 
We continue to make strategic investments within operating expenses to support our growth initiatives. This is just one example. Earlier this month, we leveraged our unique technology and assets to launch Amex Express Checkout, which allows Amex card members to check out clearly and securely on merchant websites using their Amex login credentials.
Looking ahead to the second half of the year, I point out again that a portion of the incremental spending on growth initiatives will hit operating expenses, including technology initiatives to enhance our small business and corporate capabilities.
Now shifting to capital performance on Slide 16. During the current quarter, we returned 97% of the capital we generated to shareholders while maintaining our already strong capital ratios. Our Q2 performance demonstrates our confidence in the company's ability to generate capital while maintaining its financial strength, and we remain committed to using that capital strength to create value for our shareholders. 
Looking at the capital ratios on the bottom of the slide, I'd remind you that the greater year-over-year increase in the Tier 1 capital ratio was driven by our recent preferred issuances and we made our first dividend payment this quarter. This payment is recognized as a reduction of earnings available to common shareholders and, therefore, reduced our EPS by 1% during Q2.
Let me now provide an update on the DOJ lawsuit before I conclude and take your questions. We are disappointed that our request for a stay of the decision in the injunction was denied this quarter. We have, of course, moved forward to comply with the trial court's remedy. As a result of the stay being denied, we can no longer enforce certain contractual provisions that prevent U.S. merchants from steering customers to use other credit and charge cards. We are appealing the trial court's ruling, because we believe it will not provide any benefit to consumers and will, in fact, harm competition.
Steering is not a good thing for consumers, and we believe many merchants agree. At this point, given that the remedy just took effect earlier this week, it's too early to tell what the impact in the marketplace will be. We are staying focused on delivering value to merchants and deeply believe in the strength of our value proposition.
I'd also remind you that there are a number of other private merchant litigation cases in the Eastern District of New York and other proceedings seeking monetary damages that will begin to progress as our appeal is being heard.
So let me now conclude by stepping away from some of the complexity I just took you through and going back to the key themes in our results. Our results show solid core earnings performance built upon our financial model of having diversified growth businesses, disciplined expense controls and capital strength. While billed business growth overall slowed modestly from the first quarter, we saw positive momentum across many areas of our business, including international merchant acquisition and loyalty coalition.
Going forward, given our 5% EPS growth year-to-date, simple math would indicate that EPS growth will have to be negative for the balance of the year to meet our continued outlook for full year EPS growth to be flat to modestly down. As I mentioned, the biggest driver of where we will end up within this EPS range will be the level of incremental spending on growth initiatives over the balance of the year, as well as our billings and revenue trends.
Going back to our Investor Day in March, we discussed our plan to leverage incremental spending in 2015 to help drive sustainable growth going forward. We continue to believe this is the appropriate long-term strategy, and also that we have a range of attractive growth opportunities. All this is also consistent with our previous comments that quarterly earnings performance will be more uneven than it has been historically while we go through this transitional period. Given this dynamic, our focus is that on our full year earnings outlook, rather than our performance in any individual quarter.
Stepping back, as we've discussed in multiple forums over the past couple of years, we, of course, have 3 on-average and over-time financial targets: generating EPS growth of 12% to 15%; a return on equity of 25% or better; and revenue growth of above 8%. Clearly, our top focus when we think about these targets is generating consistent EPS growth of 12% to 15%, which, in most environments, we have a fairly good track record of achieving over the 20-plus years that the targets have been in place. Our recent revenue performance has been below our aspirational 8% target, and we expect to remain below that level during the near term given some of the discrete impacts on our performance I noted earlier, as well as the current low inflation and low growth economic environment. 
However, when you think about our financial targets, the revenue target is just one of the facilitating levers that we use to help drive 12% to 15% EPS growth. We have consistently demonstrated that we can achieve our EPS target across a variety of different economic environments without having 8% revenue growth.
In the context of our year-to-date results, we believe that our core earnings performance continues to demonstrate the strength of our business model, and that we are doing the right things to position the company for the long term.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Toby for some details on our Q&A session."

Thank you. So the points I was trying to make in my remarks were we can now give you a little bit information and are trying to help you understand what's going on in Canada where there was no portfolio sale, where we were able to reissue cards with, in fact, the same card number and where we're pleased that we're tracking to retain over half of the outer store spend. As I give people that detail, I think it's really important to realize that, that is a completely different situation from what may happen in the U.S. And if you assume there is a portfolio sale in the U.S. where all the card members are automatically moved to new cards from a new issuer. Then if you assume that in general, these contracts, to your point, Sanjay, have restrictions around marketing, I want to caution people that you would expect to get a very, very different outcome from what is happening in Canada and if that's the way the U.S. were to play out. When you think about a portfolio sale and assuming there’s a gain, we've been, I think, consistent for quite some time in saying that we would use that gain, or at least portions of that gain, to help fund continued spending on a variety of growth initiatives. And when you think about our company and our growth opportunities, we have many, many opportunities to grow in every part of our business in every part of the globe. And so the efforts we may or may not make at times around Costco card members are just one small piece of what is a much broader pie of opportunities we see to really effectively continue to spend at elevated levels, marketing, promotion and certain other things. So I wouldn't overly try to tie, Sanjay, the elevated levels of spending with any particular segment, including the Costco segment. It's really an elevated level of funding that we are applying to the best opportunities we have, which occur all across our business."

You obviously are looking to increase that in the back half of the year. Looking back at some of the recent experience going back to 2010 and '11 where you really did increase spending pretty dramatically then to drive growth, it -- the levels that you accelerated spending at that time were considerably higher than what I think you're basically guiding to for the back half of the year. So I guess the question is do you think that taking up marketing and promotion expense to say somewhere in the 34, 35, 36 basis points per unit of billing is going to be sufficient to get to the growth you need to achieve your targets?

On the other hand, we want to be really prudent about only focusing on those opportunities that offer really good returns for our shareholders. When you look at, in fact, one of the slides in the presentation today, which lays out the last 8 or 9 quarters of spending around marketing and promotion, I would say if you steer at that slide a little bit, it gives -- will give you a more realistic sense of the range of spending that we would consider elevated and that we would consider a range where we can, very efficiently and very effectively in today's environment, deploy all the dollars. I wouldn't -- I'd be cautious about going back and looking at analogies from 2010 and 2011. It's a very, very different situation. So I think if you look at that more recent set of histories and think about the highest levels, that's probably more what we think we can target and be really effective."

Let me step back and say clearly, as a general matter, we don't think regulation is a good thing for consumers and merchants and for this category. When you look at the European Union regulation and the final layout of it, it certainly confirms our view that most of the reforms are really targeted at addressing concerns around Visa and MasterCard's interchange practices. But as we've long said, the reality is there are always impacts in these situations on our business, some of which can create challenges for us. We've talked, in this particular case, in particular about the fact that there are some new cross-border dynamics that are putting some pressure on our discount rates in Europe. All that said, one of the strengths of our business model is we're out there every day having to prove our value to card members and merchants and every day evolving the way we work with both to demonstrate that value. That does give us an ability to flex and demonstrate our value in ways that others can't necessarily in this regulatory environment. So we are working hard to manage some of the negative impacts of the regulation and use other parts of it to find ways to be even more creative about adding value to merchants and our card members. And I would say, while, obviously, the legislation hasn't had any or much material impact yet, we're pleased with the results we see right now in Europe, and we're going to work really, really hard to try to continue those."

We, of course, are unusual in that a rising rate environment in isolation, if you hold everything else steady, is a negative for us and we put a number in our 10-K, just to use round numbers, that says for every -- all else being equal, 100 basis point rise in all interest rates will cost us around $200 million a year. When you look at the outlook we've provided, we built it -- we're trying to be realistic in that outlook and so we built a steadily rising rate environment into that outlook. For that matter, I'd remind you, we also built a little bit of steady uptick in some of the provision costs as well. So relative to our outlook, you would have to have a spike in interest rates that was much quicker and larger than what the general economic consensus has been to cause us to see any impact relative to that outlook. In terms of how we think about offsetting the impact of those rising interest costs, if you look historically, there is usually some natural hedge here because as a general matter, central banks and the Fed tend to raise rates more when there's a little bit stronger economic environment and raise it a little less when the economic environment is not so strong, and obviously, the rest of our business benefits tremendously when there's a little bit stronger economic environment. Beyond that, the reality is we -- the largest source of our position on our sensitivity to interest rates is the strength of our charge card franchise. We love that business. We think it's a great business. And so it just comes with this one aspect that we have to manage as interest rates, at some point, inevitably rise."

I think there's a couple aspects to this. So -- because you first have to close the actual coverage gap and then you have to make progress on closing the perception gap, and there's a time lag as you do both those things. So the program that we first began to talk about a little over a year ago was one where we said, boy, if you play out the incremental merchants that we think we can get, if you look at just the cycle of those merchants and how often they re-up the smaller merchants with acquirers, then you have a multiyear process here before we believe we can get to the point where, in fact, you signed on most merchants in the U.S. relative through a MasterCard, Visa. You could have a process that then extends beyond that to match that with perceptions and to drive card members to those merchants. If you think about the things I said a few minutes ago, as I pointed out, that we're really pleased with our progress this year on OptBlue and we've signed 700,000 new merchants under it, we also have to wait until you get them signed up, and then you have to go through a process to drive business to those merchants. And we're engaged in that, and we're certainly not to the point today where we would say that we have materially closed the coverage gap. So we're not going to go out and start talking about that until we've gotten further into this. So this is clearly a multiyear effort, because you're talking about a couple of million merchants you ultimately have to add onto the roll. And it's a multiyear effort to change perceptions, but we're really pleased with the way it's going.

And we manage the company for the long term. We want to be thoughtful when we choose to do something as dramatic as we've done, go to our shareholders and say we're going to ramp up spending this year and it's going to result in not a lot of earnings growth and, in fact, EPS could even be down a little bit this year.

There was a sequential decline here, Q1 to Q2, from 4% to 2%. That decline actually relates to one product with actually maybe one large customer and it's an airline fuel-buying product, very, very low-margin product. As an old airline CFO, I'd point out the airlines are a little flush with cash right now, and so they're sort of minimizing their use of these products, which help them out with cash flow. That's what caused the drop from 4% to 2% as you go from Q2 to Q1. Now, 4% is still a low number. And as I said last quarter, boy, as we have really scrubbed all our customer base, all you can -- all I can tell you is it is U.S.-driven, not international markets. It is very broadly spread in terms of a slowdown in just the organic growth spending trends amongst our midsized and larger clients. It's T&E-oriented and hence, the very broad spread. So you can draw different conclusions from that: If there's companies tightening TV budgets as they think about the economic environment; is it a little bit of fare pressure on the airlines; lots of -- there'd be lots of different theories and you can add your own, but that's -- those are the facts as we see them."

One part of that process is notifying all of our merchants of their right to steer, and that will be happening, per the order, in the next several weeks. There's other aspects to it, but that's certainly one of the most important parts. As we think about the order, I think the first thing I would say is when you -- as we sit here and think about it today, we believe that in the near term, the financial impact of this order is within the financial outlook that we provided at Investor Day, reiterated it again today. Clearly, in the longer term, we're going to have to see how the marketplace reacts to the order and think about what impact that's going to have on our business modeling. So that's where we are with the DOJ. Much more straightforward question, yes, we took a restructuring charge last year that involves about 4,000 employees. We are well into that, however, there is still a significant portion still to come. Some of this involves fairly complex moves as we right-shore. Interestingly enough, a lot of this is moving from one non-U.S. location to another non-U.S. location. In some of our other operations, that has to be done very thoughtfully. And so there's a very experienced team that's doing this who is involved in that process, but they won't be done until much closer to the end of this year."

So on FX, essentially, what is built into our multiyear financial outlook, to use broad strokes, is roughly the rates you see today. And so to the extent -- because it's hard to imagine, these may be famous last words, that you could have another move as dramatic as you have had in the last 12 months beyond where we are today. If you do, that will be a tough headwind for us that we'll do our best to manage. I'd just remind you that the movement of the U.S. dollar so far, so fast against so many currencies all at once, as it's done in the last 9 months, you have to go back quite a number of decades to find another move like that. So it could happen but we'll have to see. On credit, you're correct; we built in both in the back half of this year, as well as into our '16 and '17 outlook, some modest and steady uptick in the provision and growth of the loan provisions. Clearly, we have a very steady track record now in growing our loans above the industry average. What happens if that is more benign? Well, that will be a very good thing. What I would say in terms of the bottom line is what we are trying to be true to at this point is the financial outlook that we've provided to people and making sure we are really well positioned to demonstrate and to execute upon once we've lapped all the FX, once we've lapped all the co-brand changes, once we've lapped Costco in the U.S., demonstrating to people that the business model and financial model that have produced 12 to 15 EPS growth rates, 12% to 15%, is in place and is working well. And so if credit is a little bit more benign, we will frankly look to see whether we are operating within the financial outlook that we have and whether we have other growth initiative funding that we, in fact, think it could be for our shareholders, very profitably redeployed or whether we want to take it to the bottom line to make sure we feel comfortable that we can come in with the kind of outlook we've provided. So boy, there's always a lot of moving pieces, we'll have to see where they all come out. But hopefully, Mark, that gives you at least some sense of how we will think about things."

So there's a -- not to get overly tactical here, but you have to get the merchants signed up. The reality is we have trained, over many decades, our card members do look for little stickers in the window. And so you literally send teams of people out to make sure stickers are going up in the windows and that helps. There's an element of educating our card members. Now here, there's sort of a -- you have to think about the pacing and the timing. You wouldn't necessarily, if you were, Cheryl, an Amex card member, which I'm sure you are, of course, want to get an e-mail from us every single time we signed up any merchant within 10 miles of you because you'd get tired of seeing all the e-mails and you'd ignore them. So you kind of have to be thoughtful about when is the right time to communicate in the most impactful way to our card members and when do you make sure you're doing that soon enough so the merchants who sign up start to see Amex card members and feel good about what they've done. So there's no magic here. It's a matter of balancing some of those basic blocking and tackling things we need to do, but we're very focused on it. I'll go back to that's why I said so far this year, we're pleased with all the sign-ups and we are very focused now on continuing the sign-ups but also beginning to drive more business to those merchants. I would say we are -- remain on track for this year for the program overall to be a positive to our bottom line, when you look at the net of all the positives and negatives, and we are tracking to our plan over a couple of years to much more significantly close the coverage gap.
So Cheryl, thank you for that last question and thanks to everybody for joining us on tonight's call. I guess I'd go back probably to where I started and where I ended earlier, which is there is a lot of complexity in our results but we think that this quarter does, again, reflect solid core underlying performance.

Overall, our third quarter performance was in line with our 2015 financial outlook and reflected the headwinds that we've been managing throughout 2015 within a challenging economic, competitive and regulatory environment.
Consistent with the expectations that we discussed publicly in mid-September, reported Q3 EPS of $1.24 was down 11% versus the prior year. And on an FX-adjusted basis, we did see a modest slowing sequentially in the billings growth rate from 6% to 5% and saw adjusted revenue growth slowed [ph] from 5% in Q2 to 3% in Q3.
As in the first 2 quarters of 2015, our third quarter results continued to reflect the discrete impacts from various changes to certain of our co-brand partnerships and a significantly stronger U.S. dollar versus last year, both of which I'll quantify later in my remarks.
The decline in earnings versus the prior year was also in part driven by increased spending on growth initiatives. I'd remind you that as we considered earlier this year the implications of the pending termination in 2016 of our relationship with Costco in the U.S., we made the decision to increase spending in 2015 across a range of business opportunities to best position the company for long-term growth. While our reported results reflect these discrete impacts, overall performance continued to reflect healthy loan growth, strong cardmember and merchant acquisitions, write-off rates at historically low levels, disciplined operating expense control and the benefits of our strong capital position. Through all of this, we continued to drive an ROE above our on average and overtime target of 25%, demonstrating the continued strength of our business model.
As we turn to the slides, we are once again beginning our presentation with a financial outlook framework that we first shared at Investor Day in March, as we believe it remains a useful framework for discussing the drivers of our current performance.
I'll provide more details on the specific drivers as we review our reported results, but overall, we believe we are doing the right things to achieve our multi-year outlook and position the company for the long term.
Speaking ahead to Q4, we expect the results to reflect some of the same headwinds as the current quarter, including incremental spending on growth initiatives as well as the discrete impacts from changes in our co-brand relationships and a stronger U.S. dollar. I'd also remind you that in Q4 '14, we had a net benefit related to the sale of our investment in Concur. Throughout this year, we had said that our full year 2015 outlook was for EPS to be flat to modestly down versus the prior year. To be more specific, as we sit here today with 1 quarter left in the year, we estimate that full year 2015 EPS will be between $5.20 and $5.35. We believe our outlook to return to positive earnings per share growth in 2016 and within our target range of 12% to 15% in 2017 remains appropriate. As you recall, our outlook for 2015 to 2017 does not contemplate the impacts of any restructuring charges or other contingencies.
Now we turn to a review of our financial results on Slide 3. Billings were flat versus the prior year on a reported basis. Adjusted for FX, billings growth was 5% during Q3, reflecting slower volume growth across our U.S. consumer and corporate portfolios. I'll provide more details on our billed business performance shortly. 
Reported revenues were down 1%, but were up 3% after adjusting for FX. This is lower than the adjusted Q2 revenue growth rate, in part due to the modestly slower billings growth and the merchant rebate accrual benefit that impacted discount revenue last quarter.
Net income was down 14% year-over-year, primarily reflecting an increase in spending on growth initiatives and the discrete impacts from changes to our co-brand relationships and the stronger U.S. dollar. We estimate that the changes in our co-brand relationships reduced EPS by approximately 5% during the quarter, and that the negative impact from FX further reduced EPS by another approximately 4% to 5%. 
Below the net income line, we continued to leverage our strong capital position to provide significant returns to shareholders and have repurchased 56 million shares over the past 12 months, which has reduced our average share count by 5%. As a result, EPS was down 11% versus the prior year despite the 14% drop in net income and a $0.02 EPS impact related to our preferred dividend payment. As we have said previously, we expect that our quarterly earnings performance will be more uneven during this transitional period, and certainly, you saw that in our results this quarter. Our focus continues to be on the earnings outlook for each year and the long term as opposed to the performance at any given quarter.
Turning to our billings performance by region on Slide 4. On an FX-adjusted basis, billings growth was 5% during the quarter versus 6% in Q2, driven by a sequential decline in U.S. volume growth. I'll provide more context on the U.S. results in a few minutes, so let me begin with a review of the international billings trends.
While we continue to face an evolving regulatory landscape going forward, we have seen very solid performance trends across our international regions over the last several quarters. JAPA remained our fastest growth region, with volumes up 14% on an FX-adjusted basis. The strong performance was again powered by Japan and China. While performance in China remains robust, year-over-year growth was lower than in Q2, which drove a deceleration in regional volume growth and also in the GNS segment, as you will see on the next slide. As a reminder, while China does impact our billings growth rates, it is a very small impact on our revenue and earnings due to the low margin that all networks earned on spending within China today.
Moving to the EMEA region. Volume growth remained consistent at 9% on an FX-adjusted basis, including double-digit growth in the U.K. The year-over-year decline in LACC volumes is being driven by Canada, which is being impacted by the end of our relationship with Costco in Canada. This will continue to impact our volume growth until Q1 2016, although it will begin to lessen next quarter as Costco began accepting other network products in its Canadian warehouses during Q4 2014. Outside of Canada, LACC regional growth remains in the double digits, including strong performance in Mexico and Argentina during Q3.
Overall, international performance excluding Canada continued to be strong, with volumes up 11% on an FX-adjusted basis versus the prior year during Q3. We are pleased with our progress outside the U.S., which reflects strong performance in the consumer and network businesses where we've seen encouraging returns on our recent growth initiatives. As the largest global issue is, we constantly balance global strategies and local execution, seeking to leverage our best practices, capabilities and learnings in all the markets in which we compete.
Looking at the results by segment now on Slide 5. We saw slower growth in GCS where billings were up 1% on an FX-adjusted basis and in our USPS segment where volume growth slowed to 5% versus 6% last quarter.
As I mentioned in my initial comments, billings growth, particularly in the U.S., continues to be impacted by a number of headwinds during 2015. 
To provide a bit of color on this, on average, we are seeing lower average transaction sizes in the U.S. as opposed to card members using their American Express cards less frequently. In total, U.S. transactions increased 7% versus the prior year, but the average transaction size was down 3%. We are clearly seeing this impact on gas spending where for the industry, average gas prices are down 25% versus the prior year. Lower average transaction sizes are also a driver within airlines spending, which constitutes 7% of our total volumes in the U.S. and is down 3% year-over-year. But this decrease is consistent with the recent trends in average ticket prices and revenue performance across the U.S. airline industry. The slower airline spend had a larger relative impact within GCS, where airlines make up approximately 25% total spend.
Also in GCS, we saw slowdown in growth across middle-market customers in the U.S. Despite this near-term performance, we do see opportunities to accelerate growth in this segment, as we continue to focus and leverage our efforts to bring together some of the unique products and services we can offer to middle-market customers.
And last, moving back to the USCS segment, consistent with the prior quarter, we saw volumes on the Costco co-brand products soften, although the loan portfolio from Costco remained approximately 20% of worldwide loans as of the end of Q3.
More broadly on Costco, we have not seen a significant earnings impact from Costco in the U.S. as lower volume growth to date has been offset by reduced marketing expenses associated with the co-brand portfolio.
One other Costco point. We do realize that all of you remain extremely in our seat and the status of our Costco co-brand portfolio sale discussion with Citi. The reality is this is a very complex transaction, and I don't think it would be appropriate to comment on the specifics during the discussions. We will provide more detail on the outcome and its applications for our 2016 EPS outlook as soon as the discussions are complete.
Moving on now to loan growth on Slide 6. You can see that worldwide loans increased by 4% versus last year. In the U.S., which constitutes the majority of our loans, growth was steady at 7% during Q3 and continues to outpace the industry. International loan balances remain down year-over-year due to FX and the end of our Costco relationship in Canada. Excluding the negative impact of FX in Canadian loan balances, however, international loan growth improved to 9% during Q3. So we are pleased with the underlying trends of loan growth. We continue to believe that there are opportunities to increase our share of lending from both existing and new customers globally without significantly changing the overall risk profile of the company.
Unlike other U.S. companies with a significant global footprint, our reported results are being significantly impacted by changes in foreign exchange rates. Over the past year, the dollar has strengthened significantly year-over-year against the currency, so we are most exposed to outside the U.S., as you can see at the bottom, Slide 7. The dollar strength will have an impact in our performance for the balance of the year and could impact 2016 as well.
Looking at the comparison of our reported and FX-adjusted revenue growth rates. You can see the difference between our reported revenue growth and our FX-adjusted revenue growth remained relatively consistent as FX dragged our reported revenue growth by approximately 400 basis points in both Q2 and Q3.
When rates move this dramatically, there is also a bottom line impact. And as I mentioned earlier, we estimate that the strengthening of the dollar reduced our EPS by approximately 4% to 5% during the quarter.
Over the longer term, we continue to believe that being a global company that generates revenue in a diverse set of markets around the world is the strength of our business model.
So let's move now to our revenue performance on Slide 8, where you see that our reported revenues were down 1% versus the prior year but increased 3% on an FX-adjusted basis. As I just discussed, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar had a significant impact on a number of revenue lines, including discount revenue, net card fees and other commissions, which all increased year-over-year after adjusting for FX. Other revenue also grew versus Q3 '14 after adjusting for FX and the gains from the sales of ICBC and Concur shares in the prior year.
FX-adjusted revenue growth of 3% did slow sequentially versus the prior quarter. This was in part due to the modest slowing in billed business growth that I discussed. I'd also remind you that our second quarter results included a benefit in discount revenue related to certain merchant rebate accruals, which resulted in a year-over-year increase in the discount rate during Q2.
The 2 basis point year-over-year decline in the discount rate this quarter was in part driven by the growth of the OptBlue program as well as the continued downward pressure that we traditionally have from changes in mix in competition. These impacts were partially offset by the decline in Costco Canada merchant volume, where we earned a much lower-than-average discount rate.
We continue to make steady progress with the OptBlue program. With the recent addition of Chase payment check, all of the top 10 U.S. merchant acquirers have now signed up to join the OptBlue program. We are signing a significant number of new merchants to our program and are focused on driving greater awareness and card member spending at these new Amex accepting locations over time.
Continuing with merchant-related items in the U.S. It's now been approximately 3 months since the DOJ's remedy to effect. While the remedy has not yet had an impact on our business, it is still too early to tell what the longer-term impact in the marketplace will be.
Before moving on from Slide 8, I would say we are pleased with the strong growth of 8% in net interest income, driven by our continued progress in growing loan portfolio and lower funding costs.
Turning to credit performance on Slide 9. We are pleased that our lending credit metrics remain at low levels, with our write-off rate declining slightly versus last quarter and our delinquency rates remaining flat.
Moving to Slide 10. Our credit performance during the quarter combined with higher loan balances to drive an 8% year-over-year increase in provision, which included a $53 million reserve billed. Our credit metrics had been steadily improving since the downturn. They have generally stabilized at the current levels at the course -- over the course of the past year. Therefore, reserve releases from improved credit performance are no longer offsetting the additional reserves needed for higher loan balances. This performance is in line with our expectations that our provision would increase year-over-year and in part reflects the steady growth we are seeing in the loan portfolio.
Going forward, we do continue to anticipate that write-off rates will gradually increase from today's low levels, in part due to the seasoning of our newer loan. This is consistent with our comments from Investor Day about expecting to see some steady upward tick in write-off rates and a modest build in reserves over the outlook period.
Moving to expense performance on Slide 11. Our total expenses increased by 3% during the current quarter. Performance differed significantly across P&L lines and all expenses benefited from the year-over-year change in FX rates. On an FX-adjusted basis, total expenses increased by 7% during the quarter. I'll walk you through the details of marketing and promotion and operating expenses in a few minutes, but let me first touch on a few other items on this slide.
Rewards expense increased 4% versus the prior year, a bit above the growth in proprietary billings, which excludes GNS. Performance this quarter includes a portion of the discrete impact from our renewed co-brand relationships. Our renewed co-brand relationships continued to have a more significant impact on the costs of card services, which was up 31% versus the prior year.
As I mentioned earlier, we estimate that all of the changes in our co-brand relationships reduced EPS by approximately 5% this quarter. This estimate includes the impact of our renewed co-brand relationships with Delta, Starwood, Cathay Pacific, British Airways and Iberia as well as the net impact in our Canadian business from the end of our Costco relationship. The co-brand impact is primarily concentrated in costs of card member services and rewards expenses, although there is an impact on the revenue growth as well.
Let's now turn to marketing and promotion on Slide 12. Marketing and promotion expenses were $847 million in the quarter and were up significantly from Q2 due to the higher spending on growth initiatives we did this quarter. On a year-over-year basis, marketing and promotion was 8% higher than the prior year but was up 14% after adjusting for FX. The increase in M&P this quarter is consistent with our expectations, as we have been clear since the Costco decision earlier this year that we intend for the spending on growth initiatives during full year 2015 to be at or slightly higher than the elevated levels of full year 2014. We have also highlighted that the increase would be more concentrated in the third and fourth quarters.
To provide some additional perspective about our growth initiatives spending, we included the breakdown on Slide 13 that we have previously shared in mid-September. We continue to feel that this slide is a helpful way to think about what we broadly considered to be our spending on growth initiatives within the company.
As you can see, while a large portion of this spending occurs within marketing and promotion, a significant amount also occurs within operating expenses. And some of the impact also shows up at this [indiscernible] revenue. I can make a few comments related specifically to the increased spending during the third quarter. 
A large portion of the increase in marketing and promotion during Q3 was focused on our efforts to attract new card members across our consumer, small business, corporate franchises around the globe. For example, in our U.S. consumer business, we went up acquisition efforts for our cash rebate products as well as our Gold charge card and Starwood preferred Guest credit card, both of which were recently refreshed with several new card member benefits. We also increased our spending on longer-term technology initiatives, including efforts to enhance the digital capabilities that we provide to middle-market corporations and small businesses.
The higher spending during Q3 also helped drive progress across a number of business initiatives, including adding stamps to our merchant acceptance network, rolling out Apple Pay to our Corporate Card and U.K. card members as well as the continued expansion of the Plenti Loyalty Coalition Program.
So as I just mentioned, the efforts to attract new card members are one of the key focus areas for our incremental growth initiative spending. In this context, we are pleased to see that these efforts drove a significant increase in new cards acquired across our U.S. consumer, small business and corporate issuing businesses during the current quarter, as you can see on Slide 14. Now obviously, it will take time for the benefits from these new acquisitions to impact our results, which is why our focus has consistently been on our performance over the multiyear outlook period.
Moving to operating expenses on Slide 15. Operating expenses were down 1% year-over-year and increased 3% on an FX-adjusted basis. As I mentioned, operating expense performance this quarter reflected an increased level of spending on growth initiatives, including a number of technology initiatives. As a portion of the spending on these technology initiatives hits the professional services and occupancy and equipment lines, to provide a bit more detail on just what is included [indiscernible]. 
Starting with professional services, I would point out that the majority of expenses in this line are related to the technology costs that we pay third parties. This P&L line also includes the fees we pay third parties for credit and collection activities as well as some of the incentives we pay merchant acquirers.
Similarly, moving to occupancy and equipment, over 75% of the costs on this line on a year-to-date basis are related to data processing, including the license fees we pay technology providers and depreciation costs associated with our technology hardware and software. The remainder consists primarily of depreciation expense on office, equipment and buildings and the rent we pay for office space around the world.
Similar to our performance across other operating expense lines, we have gained efficiency in our professional services and occupancy and equipment services overtime, as we have rationalized our technology infrastructure and location footprint around the world. We believe there is a sustained opportunity to deliver operating leverage going forward, as technology continues to become cheaper and more powerful each year and our customers and merchants increasingly demonstrate a preference to engage with us through more digital channels.
Moving on, let me touch specifically on the 21% increase in occupancy and equipment expense this quarter. The increase was driven by a $91 million impairment charge related to previously capitalized software development costs, primarily within enterprise growth, including the decision not to continue with certain investments within the group. We continuously evaluate our investments across the company to ensure that we are deploying the right level of resources against our most attractive opportunities. In this context, we decided to pull back on certain initiatives in enterprise growth during the current quarter, including the decision to not proceed with the launch of our serve product in Mexico. These decisions are aligned with some recent organizational changes with Enterprise Growth, including consolidating the serve platform and related capabilities under Steve Squire.
More broadly, we continually look at ways to make our overall organization more effective, streamlining the processes that cut across multiple parts of the company and focusing the organization on our most attractive growth opportunities in both the consumer and business-to-business space.
As we set priorities for 2016 and beyond, we will focus on those opportunities that can produce the best returns, and we will be ensuring that we have the proper operating structure to deliver results in the most efficient and effective way.
To conclude now on operating expenses and moving to Slide 16, despite the greater spending on technology initiatives in the quarter, adjusted operating expenses are down 3% on a year-to-date basis and up 1% on an FX-adjusted basis, both well below our 3% target for 2015.
Now shifting to our capital performance on Slide 17. During the quarter, we returned well over 100% of the capital we generated to shareholders while maintaining our strong capital ratios. Our Q3 performance again demonstrates our confidence in the company's ability to generate capital while maintaining its financial strength and also demonstrates our ongoing commitment to using that capital strength to create value for our shareholders.
So let me now conclude by stepping away from some of the complexity I just took you through and going back to the key themes in our results. Overall, our Q3 performance reflected the headwinds and challenges that we've been managing throughout 2015. As expected, earnings were down year-over-year due to the ramp-up in spending on growth initiatives and a discrete impacts from changes in our co-brand relationships and a stronger U.S. dollar. In addition, billings and revenue growth continue to be impacted by the challenging economic, competitive and regulatory environment. Against this backdrop, we continue to move ahead with initiatives to build our business for the years ahead. We're investing substantially more in marketing incentives and technology to attract new card members and additional spending to our network. We're expanding card acceptance at an accelerated pace among small merchants and added Sam's Club, the eighth largest retailer in the U.S. to our network earlier this month.
We're broadening our relationship with card members to accommodate more of their borrowing needs, and our loan portfolio continued its steady growth this quarter. The flexibility to invest in these and other growth initiatives comes in part from our ongoing progress in containing operating expenses throughout the company. We also continue to benefit from a strong balance sheet that allows us to return a substantial portion of our earnings to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. We remain committed to these actions and believe that these are the right things to do to achieve our multiyear outlook and position the company for the long term.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Toby for some details on our Q&A session."

Certainly, in the U.S. consumer business in particular, we have been seeing very nice growth in our Cashback products. And as you know, the accounting for our Cashback products does push -- does make the Cashback a counter revenue. So when you look at the discount rate that we report, what we try to do is reflect the actual economics that we're getting at the point-of-sale at the merchants, and so we try to -- we take that out of that calculation. When you do the straight calculation off the income statement of just discount revenue over billed business, you are capturing the higher growth rates of the Cashback products. All that said, I would say that in the grand scheme of the company overall, the Cashback products still are a relatively modest part of the overall portfolio, which is why we don't specifically call out the impact in this on the revenue in both [indiscernible]. In terms of Loyalty Partner, what I would say to remind everyone, we have a business that is more mature in a variety of other countries around the globe like Germany, Poland, India. It's a little bit newer in Mexico and in Italy, and we're really pleased with the way to business is developed in all of those countries as it has gotten to profitability. When you go to the U.S., we're really pleased and excited about the launch of Plenti earlier this year. It's very, very early days in the U.S. and so we're very encouraged by the growth that we've seen and the number of members that Plenti has been able to attract. I think you've heard several of the other partners in Plenti talk about their review of the progress, and it's all very positive. What I would say on the U.S. is it's still early days and we will need to see how it progresses over the next year or 2 before it having a more material impact on the company's financial results."

I may parse it into pieces talking little bit about GNS, a little bit about the U.S. and share and maybe a little bit about corporate so of each of those. If you look at GNS, just to remind everyone, our GNS business generates about 85% or so of its billings outside the U.S. and about 15% come from in the U.S. And so you really have a broad range of market conditions. You have markets like the U.S., Australia, the U.K. where we run a network business side-by-side with our proprietary business. And I think they have a lot of markets around the globe. China being a good example where through our partner in effect the GNS business at how we operate American Express through a franchise model. So across that many different markets, I think it's a little challenging to generalize share, but I would make the general point that we're really pleased with the growth rates we're seeing in GNS everywhere in the world. And share is something that we probably think about differently in each market depending on whether it's a pure GNS market or a combined proprietary and GNS market, but I would say we feel very good about our share trends on a combined basis outside the U.S. When you take out the 1 challenge we have in Canada I think we -- when you look at our overall international growth rates will match up very well in most recent quarter with a broader set of competitors [indiscernible]. But if you turn to the U.S., you talked about U.S. share, we probably have a lot -- a little bit of share in the U.S. in recent quarters, but I'd make a broader point that over the last 5 years of extra gain quite a bit of share in the U.S. And we think about our prospects over the longer term. We also are focused at the end of day in our share of industry profits and industry revenues. We actually think we've done pretty well, including in recent quarters, our [indiscernible]. We're very thoughtful about what opportunities are going to produce the best returns for our shareholders and sometimes that does not always lead you to the same answer and what might produce our largest billings share. For the last part of your question, to go to corporate in particular in the U.S. As I said in my remarks, the slowdown in airline spend, this new airline CFO, it's really remarkable when you look at both the large profits are the airliner are generating right now, even the drop in their fuel prices but also the pretty tough revenue they're in with industry revenues and industry unit revenues in the U.S. down. I know that's just reflected in our numbers, where we don't think and losing it, share when we look at numbers but the average transaction size is just trending right along with the airline industry spend. That does particularly impact our corporate business since airlines are about 25% of that business. And we have seen a lot of slowdown in the middle market part of our corporate business as I mentioned in my remarks. But let me tell you over the medium to long term, we continue to see this area of the middle market section of the business in the U.S. is a real growth opportunity for us, that's why we made some of the organizational changes we made earlier this year putting together our corporate card business and our open franchise under the leadership of Steve Square, because that's why talked a little bit about some of the technology initiatives spending we're doing to strengthen and refine some of our public's targeted at that segment. So we haven't lost any of our enthusiasm for growth opportunities in that segment over the medium to long term, but you have seen a number of factors that saw this down this quarter."

What I would point out is we see growth opportunities across lots of the pieces of our portfolio. And the reason you heard of us talk about since earlier this year, being at an elevated level of growth-oriented spending in 2015 is because we want to do exactly what you just suggested, which is as we think about the termination of the Costco U.S. contract some time in 2016, we think we have a lot of growth opportunities. We think in a significant fixed cost business, it makes a lot of sense to seize as many of the growth opportunities as we tend now to position ourselves for that Costco change in 2016. When you think about what we're acquiring, we feel really good about the average quality of the accounts we're requiring. And in terms of cost of acquiring those accounts, when we look at historical trends, we also feel really good that we are spending more absolute dollars. That's what the elevated level of growth spending is all about and it's being reflected in a much higher level of new account cards acquired, and the average costs is pretty similar to what we've historically experienced. So to the other part of your question was why don't you do even more? Well, we're always balancing our financial managerial and marketing resources and trying to make trade-offs that we think are optimal for our shareholders. So we are -- we believe we're going as aggressively as we can and should be given the range of opportunities. I would just say we're encouraged by the progress we saw this last quarter."

If you go back to February when we first provided an outlook, and I suppose it was a little bit to how you want to define modestly down. The reason we gave a range, if you go back to the beginning of 2015, is we wanted to make sure in the current environment, we're giving ourselves the flexibility to do the right things for the company for the long term. If you think about the question that Bob just asked, we are pleased by what we saw in the outcome or some of the fruits of the higher levels of spending we did in Q3. And that does suggest to us that we should continue to pursue many of those growth opportunities and see a pretty elevated level of spending to do it. And that does drivers more than the modestly down part of our original guidance and the flat part of our guidance. I don't want to downplay the fact that as you've seen the last couple of years, it's also a tough economic environment. If you go back to January and February as we were putting our into place and you look at all the economic forecast and we just based our own plans on the consensus economic forecast, we don't try to say recent forecast better than anybody else. The actual have all come in below but the consensus was earlier this year. And well, we're used to that. Part of the flexibility in our business model is we've got a lot of levers to pull to make sure we can react to that, but that has been a challenging thing for us. Gas prices staying down has been challenging. Foreign exchange getting a little worse. When we first provided an outlook for 2015, the U.S. dollar on a weighted average basis versus the range of currencies that matter to us was probably down around 10%. It's gone down close to another 10% since then. So all those things are factors. What we're trying to focus on are the core underlying things that will really determined the run rate of the company as we get past a range of the challenges facing us in the near term here, and we feel pretty good about those trends."

So nothing that we have seen that I just talked about in response to Bill's question are things that we don't think are manageable within all of the levers we have to pull thinking about 2016. Second, when you think about Costco, I'd remind you that when we first, back on February 12 provided our 3-year financial outlook, we said we're confident that we can achieve the 2016 outlook we then provided, which is a return to positive growth certainly regardless of what happens with the Costco portfolio. So we still don't know what the outcome is going to be of around the portfolio. When we do, we will talk about you publicly quickly. And the when will do, that will allow us, Sanjay, to be more precise because there's a lot of -- there's quite a range of outcomes around the portfolio and I think we know there's a think it's tough to give you a number. But what I wanted to come back to is what we're -- what I'm trying to make is that the underlying performance [indiscernible] back to a positive earnings performance in 2015. Sorry, we lost our mics here. If you think about what the drivers are next year, well, just think about our financial framework. So the co-brand headwinds that we've had all of 2015, 5% was the headwind this quarter dropped away as you get into 2016. FX particularly this quarter is a big headwind as opposed the dollar could move another 10% or 20% over the course of the next 4 quarters. And if it does, that will be a headwind for us. But if it doesn't, you should have an easier compare next year from an FX perspective. You brought up costs. You are correct that, in fact, when you look at some of the actions that are behind the restructuring charge we took at the end of 2014, many of those savings won't really get to full year run rate until you get to 2016. I'd also remind you that we've said all along that we will be mindful as we think about volume trends in Costco going away about what further steps we can take to make other improvements in our cost structure. So all of those things, Sanjay, to conclude combined to say what my view of what this company can generate in 2016 is really the same today as it was in February when we first provided the guidance. And my view of 2015 is we really have come in within the envelope that we've set for ourselves, leaving ourselves enough flexibility to make the right decisions to run the company for the long term."

We are continually looking at all of the choices we have about where we invest our management and financial resources in order to produce the best outcome for our shareholders. And we continually learn from things we try. We continually need to react to the evolving competitive and regulatory environment in which we operate. And so one of the things that we've done over the last quarter is make some different decisions about product strategies and resource allocation around a number of the businesses for Enterprise Growth. As you do that from a pure accounting perspective, the reality in a company like ours where you're developing a lot of software and where you capitalize a fair amount of that softwares is you sometimes end up with things on the balance sheet that would relate to the products that are deemphasizing or not there to continue with. One of the example sided cotton my remarks is we had planned to launch the serve products in Mexico. That may still be a good idea at this point, but we decided looking around at all of the other opportunities. That's not something we want to further invest in right now, and that does drive pulling some assets on the balance sheet. So all of that leads you to certainly not a growing event. This is a onetime sort of charge that is reflective of decisions the were made this quarter. I would just make the observation that I tried to be pretty clear in my remarks that in the current challenging, competitive and regulatory and economic environment, you will see is continually making changes to the organization and to where we choose to put resources. And that may, from time to time, drive other kinds of one-time charges or contingencies. That won't stop us from doing things that we think are in the best interests of long-term value creation for our shareholders."

Look, it's a challenging competitive environment, and we would not dispute that in any way. I think I started my earlier comments by saying it's a pretty challenging environment. All of that said, our goal in American Express is to take the many fairly unique strengths that we have and find ways to really create great offerings from our card members and our merchants in ways that are not necessarily easily replicable. The strength of our brand is something I think nobody else can really matched. The breadth of our product line, Which allows us to offer both targeted value propositions, everybody who is listening to this call will have a different range of things that they value most. And we think that the best of our product line really allows us to hone in on the many different demographic groups and targets that we have and we think can provide value for us. Our reputation for service, our global reach, the size and scale of our proprietary rewards program, Membership Rewards, some of the data and analytics we get from the closed loop and the way that allows us to be very targeted in our marketing and very targeted in how we work with our merchants and how we put together offers, those are all the kinds of things that we tried very hard to leverage. So that as we think about what is undoubtedly a very competitive environment, we're not just out there saying, boy, can we offer a 10 basis points more on a cash back card than everybody else because that's going to be the whole determinant. You've heard me say on these calls before, there will always be some portion of card members who actually do want to go to our website, pop the map and saying what card is going to produce the best match for me. And we're going to have a tougher time using our -- some of our differentiated strengths for that segment. In our experience, that is still a minority customers, and we think the breadth of our product line in the many strengths we have allow us to compete in ways that produce better outcomes for shareholders."

We've based it on the view that we have many growth opportunities, and that's what we're pursuing. We're really pleased that if you just look at the new cards acquired numbers this quarter comes from every part of our company. Now certainly one of the avenues for growth is there's some portion of Costco card members who have strong ties to American Express, and we'd love to work at capturing the spend and lend those people, subject to, I've always said many times, the normal provisions you would expect in most of these kinds of contracts. They put a lot of limitations around how you specifically market to the Costco card member. So we are very diligent about making sure we adhere to the spirit and letter of that contract. So our marketing efforts are really about how do we just, in general, market to all the many groups across the U.S. and across the globe that we think are attractive candidates to be card members of American Express.

For those who are going to engage in when borrowing behavior, that balance that has to build. As a general matter, I really think of getting to the part where you're having meaningful bottom line contribution from new cards or acquirers being something that happens in the second and third year.

I would probably answer as precise as any of us would like. I'd make a couple of points. Our transaction growth has been to make a general statement fairly consistent over the last couple of years in around that 7% level. What is quite striking in recent quarters is the way the average transaction size is really -- the trend line has really changed. Certainly, some of the things we do about our steady efforts to drive more every day spend, you would expect over a long period of time in a gradual rate had an impact here. But what you really see is quite different. And then there's a little bit more tied to timing to gas prices going down to some of the challenges the airlines have had on the revenue side. And in fact, we see the added transaction size coming down across other categories like retail as well. So I have to tell you at this point, we're still spending a lot of time thinking ourselves about just what it all means. I think there's probably a little bit of influence from some of the things we're doing internally, but I think there's a lot of influence from a variety of external factors and just watch what's going on in the overall very low inflation to some many categories frankly, negative inflation in an economy that we're not dnow doing business in."

So we have, in our view, a long ways to go over the next few years just to stay in place in terms of the current contribution that lend makes to the overall economics of the company. And that's highly we do in The U.S. consumer business, some of our other businesses see a little bit of opportunity to continue on the path we've been on for a few years, which is when you look at our own customers, we under index on our share, getting our share of the borrowing behavior versus the share of their spend behavior we get.

So I think we'll have to see how this goes. I will tell you that sitting here today, we're pretty pleased by this year's results. And you already see changes at the competitive environment, as a number of issuers have announced pullbacks on the products or rewards they're able to offer.

Overall, our third quarter performance was in line with our 2015 financial outlook and reflected the headwinds that we've been managing throughout 2015 within a challenging economic, competitive and regulatory environment.
Consistent with the expectations that we discussed publicly in mid-September, reported Q3 EPS of $1.24 was down 11% versus the prior year. And on an FX-adjusted basis, we did see a modest slowing sequentially in the billings growth rate from 6% to 5% and saw adjusted revenue growth slow from 5% in Q2 to 3% in Q3.
As in the first 2 quarters of 2015, our third quarter results continued to reflect the discrete impacts from various changes to certain of our co-brand partnerships and a significantly stronger U.S. dollar versus last year, both of which I'll quantify later in my remarks.
The decline in earnings versus the prior year was also in part driven by increased spending on growth initiatives. I'd remind you that as we considered earlier this year the implications of the pending termination in 2016 of our relationship with Costco in the U.S., we made the decision to increase spending in 2015 across a range of business opportunities to best position the company for long-term growth. While our reported results reflect these discrete impacts, overall performance continued to reflect healthy loan growth, strong cardmember and merchant acquisitions, write-off rates at historically low levels, disciplined operating expense control and the benefits of our strong capital position. Through all of this, we continued to drive an ROE above our on-average and over-time target of 25%, demonstrating the continued strength of our business model.
As we turn to the slides, we are once again beginning our presentation with a financial outlook framework that we first shared at Investor Day in March as we believe it remains a useful framework for discussing the drivers of our current performance.
I'll provide more details on the specific drivers as we review our reported results, but overall, we believe we are doing the right things to achieve our multiyear outlook and position the company for the long term.
Thinking ahead to Q4, we expect the results to reflect some of the same headwinds as the current quarter, including incremental spending on growth initiatives as well as the discrete impacts from changes in our co-brand relationships and a stronger U.S. dollar. I'd also remind you that in Q4 '14, we had a net benefit related to the sale of our investment in Concur. Throughout this year, we have said that our full year 2015 outlook was for EPS to be flat to modestly down versus the prior year. To be more specific, as we sit here today with 1 quarter left in the year, we estimate that full year 2015 EPS will be between $5.20 and $5.35. We believe our outlook to return to positive earnings per share growth in 2016 and within our target range of 12% to 15% in 2017 remains appropriate. As you recall, our outlook for 2015 to 2017 does not contemplate the impact of any restructuring charges or other contingencies.
Now to turn to a review of our financial results on Slide 3. Billings were flat versus the prior year on a reported basis. Adjusted for FX, billings growth was 5% during Q3, reflecting slower volume growth across our U.S. consumer and corporate portfolios. I'll provide more details on our billed business performance shortly. 
Reported revenues were down 1%, but were up 3% after adjusting for FX. This is lower than the adjusted Q2 revenue growth rate, in part due to the modestly slower billings growth and the merchant rebate accrual benefit that impacted discount revenue last quarter.
Net income was down 14% year-over-year, primarily reflecting an increase in spending on growth initiatives and the discrete impacts from changes to our co-brand relationships and the stronger U.S. dollar. We estimate that the changes in our co-brand relationships reduced EPS by approximately 5% during the quarter and that the negative impact from FX further reduced EPS by another approximately 4% to 5%. 
Below the net income line, we continued to leverage our strong capital position to provide significant returns to shareholders and have repurchased 56 million shares over the past 12 months, which has reduced our average share count by 5%. As a result, EPS was down 11% versus the prior year despite the 14% drop in net income and a $0.02 EPS impact related to our preferred dividend payment. As we have said previously, we expect that our quarterly earnings performance will be more uneven during this transitional period, and certainly, you saw that in our results this quarter. Our focus continues to be on the earnings outlook for each year and the long term as opposed to the performance at any given quarter.
Turning to our billings performance by region on Slide 4. On an FX-adjusted basis, billings growth was 5% during the quarter versus 6% in Q2, driven by a sequential decline in U.S. volume growth. I'll provide more context on the U.S. results in a few minutes, so let me begin with a review of the international billings trends.
While we continue to face an evolving regulatory landscape going forward, we have seen very solid performance trends across our international regions over the last several quarters. JAPA remained our fastest growth region, with volumes up 14% on an FX-adjusted basis. The strong performance was again powered by Japan and China. While performance in China remains robust, year-over-year growth was lower than in Q2, which drove a deceleration in regional volume growth and also in the GNS segment as you will see on the next slide. As a reminder, while China does impact our billings growth rates, it has a very small impact on our revenue and earnings due to the low margin that all networks earn on spending within China today.
Moving to the EMEA region. Volume growth remained consistent at 9% on an FX-adjusted basis, including double-digit growth in the U.K. The year-over-year decline in LACC volumes is being driven by Canada, which is being impacted by the end of our relationship with Costco in Canada. This will continue to impact our volume growth until Q1 2016, although it will begin to lessen next quarter as Costco began accepting other network products in its Canadian warehouses during Q4 2014. Outside of Canada, LACC regional growth remains in the double digits, including strong performance in Mexico and Argentina during Q3.
Overall, international performance, excluding Canada, continued to be strong, with volumes up 11% on an FX-adjusted basis versus the prior year during Q3. We are pleased with our progress outside the U.S., which reflects strong performance in the consumer and network businesses, where we've seen encouraging returns on our recent growth initiatives. As the largest global issuer, we constantly balance global strategies and local execution, seeking to leverage our best practices, capabilities and learnings in all the markets in which we compete.
Looking at the results by segment now on Slide 5. We saw slower growth in GCS, where billings were up 1% on an FX-adjusted basis, and in our USCS segment, where volume growth slowed to 5% versus 6% last quarter.
As I mentioned in my initial comments, billings growth, particularly in the U.S., continues to be impacted by a number of headwinds during 2015. 
To provide a bit of color on this, on average, we are seeing lower average transaction sizes in the U.S. as opposed to cardmembers using their American Express cards less frequently. In total, U.S. transactions increased 7% versus the prior year, but the average transaction size was down 3%. We are clearly seeing this impact on gas spending, where for the industry, average gas prices are down 25% versus the prior year. Lower average transaction sizes are also a driver within airline spending, which constitutes 7% of our total volumes in the U.S. and is down 3% year-over-year. And this decrease is consistent with the recent trends in average ticket prices and revenue performance across the U.S. airline industry. The slower airline spend had a larger relative impact within GCS, where airlines make up approximately 25% total spend.
Also in GCS, we saw a slowdown in growth across middle-market customers in the U.S. Despite this near-term performance, we do see opportunities to accelerate growth in this segment as we continue to focus and leverage our efforts to bring together some of the unique products and services we can offer to middle-market customers.
And last, moving back to the USCS segment, consistent with the prior quarter, we saw volumes on the Costco co-brand products soften, although the loan portfolio from Costco remained approximately 20% of worldwide loans as of the end of Q3.
More broadly on Costco, we have not seen a significant earnings impact from Costco in the U.S. as lower volume growth to date has been offset by reduced marketing expenses associated with the co-brand portfolio.
One other Costco point. We do realize that all of you remain extremely interested in the status of our Costco co-brand portfolio sale discussions with Citi. The reality is, this is a very complex transaction, and I don't think it would be appropriate to comment on the specifics during the discussions. We will provide more detail on the outcome and its implications for our 2016 EPS outlook as soon as the discussions are complete.
Moving on now to loan growth on Slide 6. You can see that worldwide loans increased by 4% versus last year. In the U.S., which constitutes the majority of our loans, growth was steady at 7% during Q3 and continues to outpace the industry. International loan balances remain down year-over-year due to FX and the end of our Costco relationship in Canada. Excluding the negative impact of FX in Canadian loan balances, however, international loan growth improved to 9% during Q3. So we are pleased with the underlying trends of loan growth. We continue to believe that there are opportunities to increase our share of lending from both existing and new customers globally without significantly changing the overall risk profile of the company.
Unlike other U.S. companies with a significant global footprint, our reported results are being significantly impacted by changes in foreign exchange rates. Over the past year, the dollar has strengthened significantly year-over-year against the currencies that we are most exposed to outside the U.S. as you can see at the bottom of Slide 7. The dollar strength will have an impact on our performance for the balance of the year and could impact 2016 as well.
Looking at the comparison of our reported and FX-adjusted revenue growth rates. You can see the difference between our reported revenue growth and our FX-adjusted revenue growth remained relatively consistent as FX dragged our reported revenue growth by approximately 400 basis points in both Q2 and Q3.
When rates move this dramatically, there is also a bottom line impact. And as I mentioned earlier, we estimate that the strengthening of the dollar reduced our EPS by approximately 4% to 5% during the quarter.
Over the longer term, we continue to believe that being a global company that generates revenue in a diverse set of markets around the world is the strength of our business model.
So let's move now to our revenue performance on Slide 8, where you see that our reported revenues were down 1% versus the prior year but increased 3% on an FX-adjusted basis. As I just discussed, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar had a significant impact on a number of revenue lines, including discount revenue, net card fees and other commissions, which all increased year-over-year after adjusting for FX. Other revenue also grew versus Q3 '14 after adjusting for FX and the gains from the sales of ICBC and Concur shares in the prior year.
FX-adjusted revenue growth of 3% did slow sequentially versus the prior quarter. This was in part due to the modest slowing in billed business growth that I discussed. I'd also remind you that our second quarter results included a benefit in discount revenue related to certain merchant rebate accruals, which resulted in a year-over-year increase in the discount rate during Q2.
The 2 basis-point year-over-year decline in the discount rate this quarter was in part driven by the growth of the OptBlue program as well as the continued downward pressure that we traditionally have from changes in mix and competition. These impacts were partially offset by the decline in Costco Canada merchant volume, where we earned a much lower-than-average discount rate.
We continue to make steady progress with the OptBlue program. With the recent addition of Chase Paymentech, all of the top 10 U.S. merchant acquirers have now signed up to join the OptBlue program. We are signing a significant number of new merchants through the program and are focused on driving greater awareness and cardmember spending at these new Amex-accepting locations over time.
Continuing with merchant-related items in the U.S. It's now been approximately 3 months since the DOJ's remedy took effect. While the remedy has not yet had an impact on our business, it is still too early to tell what the longer-term impact in the marketplace will be.
Before moving on from Slide 8, I would say we are pleased with the strong growth of 8% in net interest income, driven by our continued progress in growing the loan portfolio and lower funding costs.
Turning to credit performance on Slide 9. We are pleased that our lending credit metrics remain at low levels, with our write-off rate declining slightly versus last quarter and our delinquency rates remaining flat.
Moving to Slide 10. Our credit performance during the quarter combined with higher loan balances to drive an 8% year-over-year increase in provision, which included a $53 million reserve build. All credit metrics had been steadily improving since the downturn. They have generally stabilized at their current levels at the course -- over the course of the past year. Therefore, reserve releases from improved credit performance are no longer offsetting the additional reserves needed for higher loan balances. This performance is in line with our expectations that would provision -- would increase year-over-year and in part reflects the steady growth we are seeing in the loan portfolio.
Going forward, we do continue to anticipate that write-off rates will gradually increase from today's low levels, in part due to the seasoning of our newer loan vintages. This is consistent with our comments from Investor Day about expecting to see some steady upward tick in write-off rates and a modest build in reserves over the outlook period.
Moving to expense performance on Slide 11. Our total expenses increased by 3% during the current quarter. Performance differed significantly across P&L lines, and all expenses benefited from the year-over-year change in FX rates. On an FX-adjusted basis, total expenses increased by 7% during the quarter. I'll walk you through the details of marketing and promotion and operating expenses in a few minutes, but let me first touch on a few other items on this slide.
Rewards expense increased 4% versus the prior year, a bit above the growth in proprietary billings, which excludes GNS. Performance this quarter includes a portion of the discrete impact from our renewed co-brand relationships. Our renewed co-brand relationships continued to have a more significant impact on the cost of card services, which was up 31% versus the prior year.
As I mentioned earlier, we estimate that all of the changes in our co-brand relationships reduced EPS by approximately 5% this quarter. This estimate includes the impact of our renewed co-brand relationships with Delta, Starwood, Cathay Pacific, British Airways and Iberia as well as the net impact on our Canadian business from the end of our Costco relationship. The co-brand impact is primarily concentrated in cost of cardmember services and rewards expenses, although there is an impact on the revenue growth as well.
Let's now turn to marketing and promotion on Slide 12. Marketing and promotion expenses were $847 million in the quarter and were up significantly from Q2 due to the higher spending on growth initiatives we did this quarter. On a year-over-year basis, marketing and promotion was 8% higher than the prior year, but was up 14% after adjusting for FX. The increase in M&P this quarter is consistent with our expectations as we have been clear since the Costco decision earlier this year that we intend for the spending on growth initiatives during full year 2015 to be at or slightly higher than the elevated levels of full year 2014. We have also highlighted that the increase would be more concentrated in the third and fourth quarters.
To provide some additional perspective about our growth initiative spending, we included the breakdown on Slide 13 that we had previously shared in mid-September. We continue to feel that this slide is a helpful way to think about what we broadly consider to be our spending on growth initiatives within the company.
As you can see, while a large portion of this spending occurs within marketing and promotion, a significant amount also occurs within operating expenses. And some of the impact also shows up as contra-revenue. I can make a few comments related specifically to the increased spending during the third quarter. 
A large portion of the increase in marketing and promotion during Q3 was focused on our efforts to attract new cardmembers across our consumer, small business and corporate franchises around the globe. For example, in our U.S. consumer business, we ramped up acquisition efforts for our cash rebate products as well as our Gold charge card and Starwood Preferred Guest Credit Card, both of which were recently refreshed with several new cardmember benefits. We also increased our spending on longer-term technology initiatives, including efforts to enhance the digital capabilities that we provide to middle-market corporations and small businesses.
The higher spending during Q3 also helped drive progress across a number of business initiatives, including adding Sam's to our merchant acceptance network, rolling out Apple Pay to our Corporate Card and U.K. cardmembers as well as the continued expansion of the Plenti loyalty coalition program.
So as I just mentioned, the efforts to attract new cardmembers are one of the key focus areas for our incremental growth initiative spending. In this context, we are pleased to see that these efforts drove a significant increase in new cards acquired across our U.S. consumer, small business and corporate issuing businesses during the current quarter as you can see on Slide 14. Now obviously, it will take time for the benefits from these new acquisitions to impact our results, which is why our focus has consistently been on our performance over the multiyear outlook period.
Moving to operating expenses on Slide 15. Operating expenses were down 1% year-over-year and increased 3% on an FX-adjusted basis. As I mentioned, operating expense performance this quarter reflected an increased level of spending on growth initiatives, including a number of technology initiatives. As a portion of the spending on these technology initiatives hits the professional services and occupancy and equipment lines, I'll provide a bit more detail on just what is included in these expense categories. 
Starting with professional services, I would point out that the majority of expenses in this line are related to the technology costs that we pay third parties. This P&L line also includes the fees we pay third parties for credit and collection activities as well as some of the incentives we pay merchant acquirers.
Similarly, moving to occupancy and equipment, over 75% of the costs on this line on a year-to-date basis are related to data processing, including the license fees we pay technology providers and depreciation costs associated with our technology hardware and software. The remainder consists primarily of depreciation expense on office equipment and buildings and the rent we pay for office space around the world.
Similar to our performance across other operating expense lines, we have gained efficiency in our professional services and occupancy and equipment expenses over time as we have rationalized our technology infrastructure and location footprint around the world. We believe there is a sustained opportunity to deliver operating leverage going forward as technology continues to become cheaper and more powerful each year and our customers and merchants increasingly demonstrate a preference to engage with us through more digital channels.
Now moving on, let me touch specifically on the 21% increase in occupancy and equipment expense this quarter. The increase was driven by a $91 million impairment charge related to previously capitalized software development costs primarily within Enterprise Growth, including the decision not to continue with certain investments within the group. We continuously evaluate our investments across the company to ensure that we are deploying the right level of resources against our most attractive opportunities. In this context, we decided to pull back on certain initiatives in Enterprise Growth during the current quarter, including the decision to not proceed with the launch of our Serve product in Mexico. These decisions are aligned with some recent organizational changes with Enterprise Growth, including consolidating the Serve platform and related capabilities under Steve Squeri.
More broadly, we continually look at ways to make our overall organization more effective, streamlining the processes that cut across multiple parts of the company and focusing the organization on our most attractive growth opportunities in both the consumer and business-to-business space.
As we set priorities for 2016 and beyond, we will focus on those opportunities that can produce the best returns and we will be ensuring that we have the proper operating structure to deliver results in the most efficient and effective way.
To conclude now on operating expenses and moving to Slide 16, despite the greater spending on technology initiatives in the quarter, adjusted operating expenses are down 3% on a year-to-date basis and up 1% on an FX-adjusted basis, both well below our 3% target for 2015.
Now shifting to our capital performance on Slide 17. During the quarter, we returned well over 100% of the capital we generated to shareholders while maintaining our strong capital ratios. Our Q3 performance again demonstrates our confidence in the company's ability to generate capital while maintaining its financial strength and also demonstrates our ongoing commitment to using that capital strength to create value for our shareholders.
So let me now conclude by stepping away from some of the complexity I just took you through and going back to the key themes in our results. Overall, our Q3 performance reflected the headwinds and challenges that we've been managing throughout 2015. As expected, earnings were down year-over-year due to the ramp-up in spending on growth initiatives and the discrete impacts from changes in our co-brand relationships and a stronger U.S. dollar. In addition, billings and revenue growth continue to be impacted by the challenging economic, competitive and regulatory environment. Against this backdrop, we continue to move ahead with initiatives to build our business for the years ahead. We're investing substantially more in marketing incentives and technology to attract new cardmembers and additional spending to our network. We're expanding card acceptance at an accelerated pace among small merchants and added Sam's Club, the eighth largest retailer in the U.S. to our network earlier this month.
We're broadening our relationship with cardmembers to accommodate more of their borrowing needs, and our loan portfolio continued steady growth this quarter. The flexibility to invest in these and other growth initiatives comes in part from our ongoing progress in containing operating expenses throughout the company. We also continue to benefit from a strong balance sheet that allows us to return a substantial portion of our earnings to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. We remain committed to these actions and believe that these are the right things to do to achieve our multiyear outlook and position the company for the long term.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Toby for some details on our Q&A session."

Certainly, in the U.S. consumer business in particular, we have been seeing very nice growth in our Cashback products. And as you know, the accounting for our Cashback products does push -- it does make the Cashback a contra-revenue. So when you look at the discount rate that we report, what we try to do is reflect the actual economics that we're getting at the point-of-sale at the merchants, and so we try to -- we take that out of that calculation. When you do the straight calculation off the income statement of just discount revenue over billed business, you are capturing the higher growth rates of the Cashback products. All that said, I would say that in the grand scheme of the company overall, the Cashback products still are a relatively modest part of the overall portfolio, which is why we don't specifically call out the impact it has on the revenue of both rates. In terms of Loyalty Partner, what I would say is to remind everyone we have a business that is more mature in a variety of other countries around the globe like Germany, Poland, India. It's a little bit newer in Mexico and in Italy. And we're really pleased with the way the business has developed in all of those countries as it has gotten to profitability. When you go to the U.S., we're really pleased and excited about the launch of Plenti earlier this year. It's very, very early days in the U.S. and so we're very encouraged by the growth that we've seen and the number of members that Plenti has been able to attract. I think you've heard several of the other partners in Plenti talk about their view of the progress and it's all very positive. What I would say on the U.S. is it's still early days and we will need to see how it progresses over the next year or 2 before it begins to have a more material impact on the company's financial results."

I may parse it into pieces talking a little bit about GNS, a little bit about the U.S. and share and then maybe a little bit about corporate, sort of each of those briefly. If you look at GNS, just to remind everyone, our GNS business generates about 85% or so of its billings outside the U.S. and about 15% come from -- in the U.S. And so you really have a broad range of market conditions. You have markets like the U.S., Australia, the U.K., where we run a network business side-by-side with our proprietary business. And then you have a lot of markets around the globe. China being a good example, where through our partner, in effect, the GNS business and how we operate American Express through a franchise model. So across that many different markets, I think it's a little challenging to generalize about share, but I would make the general point that we're really pleased with the growth rates we're seeing in GNS everywhere in the world. And share is something that we probably think about differently in each market depending on whether it's a pure GNS market or a combined proprietary and GNS market, but I would say we feel very good about our share trends on a combined basis outside the U.S. And when you take out the one challenge we have in Canada, I think we -- when you look at our overall international growth rates, it will match up very well in the most recent quarter with the broader set of competitors that we see there. But if you turn to the U.S., you talked about U.S. share, and we probably have a lot -- a little bit of share in the U.S. in recent quarters, but I'd make a broader point that over the last 5 years, we've actually gained quite a bit of share in the U.S. and we think about our prospects over the longer term. We also are focused at the end of the day in our share of industry profits and industry revenues. And we actually think we've done pretty well, including in recent quarters, on that front. We're very thoughtful about what opportunities are going to produce the best returns for our shareholders and sometimes that does not always lead you to the same answer and what might produce a largest billings share. For the last part of your question, if you go to corporate in particular in the U.S., as I said in my remarks, the slowdown in airline spend, as an old airline CFO, it is really remarkable when you look at both the large profits the airlines are generating right now, given the drop in fuel prices, but also the pretty tough revenue environment they're in, with industry revenues and industry unit revenues in the U.S. down. That's just reflected in our numbers, where we don't think we're losing share when we look at numbers of transactions, but the average transaction size is just trending right along with the airline industry spend. That does particularly impact our corporate business, since airlines are about 25% of that business. And we have seen a little bit of slowdown in the middle-market part of our corporate business, as I mentioned in my remarks. But -- and I would tell you, over the medium to long term, we continue to see this area of the middle-market section of business in the U.S. is a real growth opportunity for us, that's why we made some of the organizational changes we made earlier this year putting together our Corporate Card business and our open franchise under the leadership of Steve Squeri because -- that's why I talked a little bit about some of the technology initiative spending we're doing to strengthen and refine some of our products targeted at that segment. So we haven't lost any of our enthusiasm for the growth opportunities in that segment in the medium to long term, but you have seen a number of factors that saw this down this quarter."

What I would point out is we see growth opportunities across lots of the pieces of our portfolio. And the reason you've heard us talk about since earlier this year, being at an elevated level of growth-oriented spending in 2015 is because we want to do exactly what you just suggested, which is as we think about the termination of the Costco U.S. contract sometime in 2016, we think we have a lot of growth opportunities. We think in a significant fixed cost business, it makes a lot of sense to seize as many of the growth opportunities as we tend now to position ourselves for that Costco change in 2016. When you think about what we're acquiring, we feel really good about the average quality of the accounts we're acquiring. And in terms of cost of acquiring those accounts, when we look at historical trends, we also feel really good that we are spending more absolute dollars. That's what the elevated level of growth spending is all about and it's being reflected in a much higher level of new cards acquired, and the average costs is pretty similar to what we've historically experienced. So I suppose the other part of your question was why don't you do even more? Well, we're always balancing our financial, managerial and marketing resources and trying to make trade-offs that we think are optimal for our shareholders. So we are -- we believe we're going as aggressively as we can and should be given the range of opportunities. I would just say we're encouraged by the progress we saw this last quarter."

I know you said that the results were in line with your expectations, but I think the reason people are asking is because the 2015 target EPS growth range of $5.20 to $5.35 that you provided implies in the area of, I think, like 3.5% to kind of 6.5%, negative 6.5% growth. And I think people are viewing that as worse than the flat to slightly negative growth range that you've given previously. And so I was just hoping that maybe you could just speak to that?"

I think, as we look at 2015 on the earnings side, the reality is it will come in very much in the range that we originally envisioned. If you go back to February when we first provided an outlook, and I suppose it goes a little bit to how you want to define modestly down. The reason we gave a range, if you go back to the beginning of 2015, is we wanted to make sure in the current environment, we're giving ourselves the flexibility to do the right things for the company for the long term. If you think about the question that Bob just asked, we are pleased by what we saw in the outcome or some of the fruits of the higher levels of spending we did in Q3. And that does suggest to us that we should continue to pursue many of those growth opportunities and stay at a pretty elevated level of spending to do it. And that does drive us probably more towards the modestly down part of our original guidance than the flat part of our guidance. I don't want to downplay the fact that as you've seen in the last couple of years, it's also a tough economic environment. If you go back to January and February as we were putting our plans into place and you look at all the economic forecast and we just based our own plans on the consensus economic forecast, we don't try to say recent forecast better than anybody else, the actuals have all come in below what the consensus was earlier this year. And well, we're used to that. Part of the flexibility in our business model is we've got a lot of levers to pull to make sure we can react to that, but that has been a challenging thing for us. Gas prices staying down has been challenging. Foreign exchange getting a little worse. When we first provided an outlook for 2015, the U.S. dollar on a weighted average basis versus the range of currencies that matter to us was probably down around 10%. It's gone down close to another 10% since then. So all those things are factors. What we're trying to focus on are the core underlying things that will really determine the run rate of the company as we get past a range of the challenges facing us in the near term here, and we feel pretty good about those trends."

I want to make sure I get them all. No, all really good questions. So how do we define growth? I guess, what I would tell you is that our review of sort of absolute levels of what we believe we can achieve in 2016 has not changed at all since February. So nothing that we have seen that I just talked about in response to Bill's question are things that we don't think are manageable within all of the levers we have to pull thinking about 2016. Second, when you think about Costco, I'd remind you that when we first, back on February 12, provided our 3-year financial outlook, we said we're confident that we can achieve the 2016 outlook we then provided, which was a return to positive growth sort of regardless of what happens with the Costco portfolio. So we still don't know what the outcome is going to be around the portfolio. When we do, we will talk about it publicly quickly. And when we do, that will allow us, Sanjay, to be more precise because there's a lot of -- there's quite a range of outcomes around the portfolio, and until we know those, it's tough to give you a number. But what I want to come back to is what we're -- point I'm trying to make is that the underlying performance [indiscernible] back to a positive earnings performance in 2015. Sorry, we lost our lights here. If you think about what the drivers are next year, well, just think about our financial framework. So the co-brand headwinds that we've had all of 2015, 5% was the headwind this quarter, drop away as you get into 2016. FX, well, particularly this quarter, is a big headwind. Now -- as opposed to dollar could move another 10% or 20% over the course of the next 4 quarters. And if it does, that will be a headwind for us. But if it doesn't, you should have an easier compare next year from an FX perspective. You brought up costs. You are correct that, in fact, when you look at some of the actions that are behind the restructuring charge we took at the end of 2014, many of those savings won't really get to full year run rate until you get to 2016. I'd also remind you that we've said all along that we will be mindful as we think about volume trends in Costco going away about what further steps we can take to make other improvements in our cost structure. So all of those things, Sanjay, to conclude, combined to say my view of what this company can generate in 2016 is really the same today as it was in February when we first provided the guidance. And my view of 2015 is we really have come in within the envelope that we set for ourselves, leaving ourselves enough flexibility to make the right decisions to run the company for the long term."

We are continually looking at all of the choices we have about where we invest our management and financial resources in order to produce the best outcome for our shareholders. And we continually learn from things we try. We continually need to react to the evolving competitive and regulatory environment in which we operate. And so one of the things that we've done over the last quarter is make some different decisions about product strategies and resource allocation around a number of the businesses that's part of Enterprise Growth. As you do that from a pure accounting perspective, the reality in a company like ours where you're developing a lot of software and where you capitalize a fair amount of that software is you sometimes end up with things on the balance sheet that relate to products that you're deemphasizing or not going to continue with. One of the examples I did call out in my remarks is we had planned to launch the Serve products in Mexico. That may still be a good idea at some point, but we decided looking around at all of our other opportunities that's not something we want to further invest in right now, and that does drive pulling some assets off the balance sheet. So all of that leads you to it. This is certainly not a growing event. This is a onetime sort of charge that is reflective of decisions that were made this quarter. I would just make the observation that I tried to be pretty clear in my remarks that in the current challenging, competitive regulatory and economic environment, you will see is continually making changes to the organization and to where we choose to put resources. And that may, from time to time, drive other kinds of onetime charges or contingencies. That won't stop us from doing things that we think are in the best interests of long-term value creation for our shareholders."

Look, it's a challenging competitive environment and we would not dispute that in any way. And I think I started my earlier comments by saying it's a pretty challenging environment. All that said, our goal at American Express is to take the many fairly unique strengths that we have and find ways to really create great offerings for our card members and our merchants in ways that are not necessarily easily replicable. The strength of our brand is something I think nobody else can really match. The breadth of our product line, which allows us to offer very targeted value propositions, because everybody who is listening to this call will have a different range of things that they value most, and we think the breadth of our product line really allows us to hone in on the many different demographic groups and targets that we have who we think we can provide value for. Our reputation for service, our global reach, the size and scale of our proprietary rewards program, Membership Rewards, some of the data and analytics we get from the closed loop and the way that allows us to be very targeted in our marketing and very targeted in how we work with our merchants and how we put together offers, those are all the kinds of things that we try very hard to leverage. So that as we think about what is undoubtedly a very competitive environment, we're not just out there saying, boy, can we offer 10 basis points more on a cash back card than everybody else because that's going to be the whole determinant. You've heard me say on these calls before, there will always be some portion of card members who actually do want to go to a website, pop the math in and say what card is going to produce the best match for me. And we're going to have a tougher time using our -- some of our differentiated strengths for that segment. In our experience, that is still minority customers, and we think the breadth of our product line and the many strengths we have allow us to compete in ways that produce better outcomes for our shareholders."

We're really pleased that if you just look at the new cards, acquired numbers this quarter comes from every part of our company. Now certainly, one of the avenues for growth is there's some portion of Costco card members who have strong ties to American Express, and we'd love to work at capturing the spend and lend those people, subject to, as I've also said many times, the normal provisions you would expect in most of these kinds of contracts that put a lot of limitations around how you specifically market to the Costco card member. So we are very diligent about making sure we adhere to the spirit and letter of that contract. So our marketing efforts are really about how do we just, in general, market to all the many groups across the U.S. and across the globe that we think are attractive candidates to be card members of American Express.

What is quite striking in recent quarters is the way the average transaction size is really -- the trend line has really changed. Certainly, some of the things we do about our steady efforts to drive more every day spend, you would expect over a long period of time at a gradual rate to have an impact here. But what you really see is quite different. And there's a little bit more tied in timing to gas prices going down to some of the challenges the airlines have had on the revenue side.

So if you look overall at American Express, net interest income is, depending on how you want to measure it, 15% to 20% of our P&L. That's unlike any of our competitors where the numbers are 50% to 90%. We have a very spend-centric collection of businesses. When the Costco loan portfolio goes away in 2016, that's 20% of the loan portfolio that drive that net interest income. So we have, in our view, a long ways to go over the next few years just to stay in place in terms of the current contribution that lend makes to the overall economics of the company. And that's why we do in the U.S. consumer business, I think also some of our other businesses, see a little bit of opportunity to continue on the path we've been on for a few years, which is when you look at our own customers, we under index on our share, getting our share of their borrowing behavior versus the share of their spend behavior we get. That to us is just an opportunity too obvious for us not to continually work at it. And that's really what has allowed us for many quarters now to steadily grow our loan balances above where the industry was going in the U.S. while you hear us over and over again say but we're comfortable that we're doing that without materially changing the risk profile of the company. So that's really all you see going on here. And as I said, I think we will be quite some time once the Costco loan portfolio goes away before we even get back to where we are today. But the exciting thing to us is we see a long ramp that should allow us to continue to grow loans in the U.S. a little bit faster than the industry changing the risk profile of the company."

We said for a while that when you look at the EU regulation, which to remind everyone, is it targeted Visa and MasterCard with cap interchange rates, that will put some downward pressure on our discount rates. And frankly, you see that downward pressure even this year. Despite that, we're actually pretty please with our performance in Europe this year. And I would point out to you that we have long head in Europe, in most countries, areas by country, but in most countries, a significant premium to MasterCard and Visa. So that's not a new phenomenon. What the interchange regulation will do is put downward pressure on us, not to go to the point where the interchange is capped, but put pressure on us to move it down probably to keep the differential more similar. So I think we'll have to see how this goes. I will tell you that sitting here today, we're pretty pleased by this year's results. And you already see changes in the competitive environment as a number of issuers have announced pullbacks on the products or rewards they're able to offer. And like all of these things, our challenge and opportunity is to try to find ways to mitigate the obvious downside, which is it will put some downward pressure on our discount rates in Europe. But try to offset that with saying but what other opportunities does it create to perhaps do some things that others can't. And at the end of the day, I think what the European regulations are really seeing is a competitive, a more competitive European environment. Our market shares in most of those countries are quite small, so we'd love to be more competitive and find ways to grow over time, but we'll have to see.

Overall, our third quarter performance was in line with our 2015 financial outlook and reflected the headwinds that we've been managing throughout 2015 including a challenging economic, competitive and regulatory environment.
Consistent with the expectations that we discussed publicly in mid-September, reported Q3 EPS of $1.24 was down 11% versus the prior year. And on an FX-adjusted basis, we did see a modest slowing sequentially in the billings growth rate from 6% to 5% and saw adjusted revenue growth slow from 5% in Q2 to 3% in Q3.
As in the first 2 quarters of 2015, our third quarter results continued to reflect the discrete impacts from various changes to certain of our co-brand partnerships and a significantly stronger U.S. dollar versus last year, both of which I'll quantify later in my remarks.
The decline in earnings versus the prior year was also in part driven by increased spending on growth initiatives. I'd remind you that as we considered earlier this year the implications of the pending termination in 2016 of our relationship with Costco in the U.S., we made the decision to increase spending in 2015 across a range of business opportunities to best position the company for long-term growth. While our reported results reflect these discrete impacts, overall performance continued to reflect healthy loan growth, strong cardmember and merchant acquisitions, write-off rates at historically low levels, disciplined operating expense control and the benefits of our strong capital position. Through all of this, we continued to drive an ROE above our on-average and over-time target of 25%, demonstrating the continued strength of our business model.
As we turn to the slides, we are once again beginning our presentation with a financial outlook framework that we first shared at Investor Day in March as we believe it remains a useful framework for discussing the drivers of our current performance.
I'll provide more details on the specific drivers as we review our reported results, but overall, we believe we are doing the right things to achieve our multiyear outlook and position the company for the long term.
Thinking ahead to Q4, we expect the results to reflect some of the same headwinds as the current quarter, including incremental spending on growth initiatives as well as the discrete impacts from changes in our co-brand relationships and a stronger U.S. dollar. I'd also remind you that in Q4 '14, we had a net benefit related to the sale of our investment in Concur. Throughout this year, we have said that our full year 2015 outlook was for EPS to be flat to modestly down versus the prior year. To be more specific, as we sit here today with 1 quarter left in the year, we estimate that full year 2015 EPS will be between $5.20 and $5.35. We believe our outlook to return to positive earnings per share growth in 2016 and within our target range of 12% to 15% in 2017 remains appropriate. As you recall, our outlook for 2015 to 2017 does not contemplate the impact of any restructuring charges or other contingencies.
Now to turn to a review of our financial results on Slide 3. Billings were flat versus the prior year on a reported basis. Adjusted for FX, billings growth was 5% during Q3, reflecting slower volume growth across our U.S. consumer and corporate portfolios. I'll provide more details on our billed business performance shortly. 
Reported revenues were down 1%, but were up 3% after adjusting for FX. This is slower than the adjusted Q2 revenue growth rate, in part due to the modestly slower billings growth and the merchant rebate accrual benefit that impacted discount revenue last quarter.
Net income was down 14% year-over-year, primarily reflecting an increase in spending on growth initiatives and the discrete impacts from changes to our co-brand relationships and the stronger U.S. dollar. We estimate that the changes in our co-brand relationships reduced EPS by approximately 5% during the quarter and that the negative impact from FX further reduced EPS by another approximately 4% to 5%. 
Below the net income line, we continued to leverage our strong capital position to provide significant returns to shareholders and have repurchased 56 million shares over the past 12 months, which has reduced our average share count by 5%. As a result, EPS was down 11% versus the prior year despite the 14% drop in net income and a $0.02 EPS impact related to our preferred dividend payment. As we have said previously, we expect that our quarterly earnings performance will be more uneven during this transitional period, and certainly, you saw that in our results this quarter. Our focus continues to be on the earnings outlook for each year and the long term as opposed to the performance in any given quarter.
Turning to our billings performance by region on Slide 4. On an FX-adjusted basis, billings growth was 5% during the quarter versus 6% in Q2, driven by a sequential decline in U.S. volume growth. I'll provide more context on the U.S. results in a few minutes, so let me begin with a review of the international billings trends.
While we continue to face an evolving regulatory landscape going forward, we have seen very solid performance trends across our international regions over the last several quarters. JAPA remained our fastest growth region, with volumes up 14% on an FX-adjusted basis. The strong performance was again powered by Japan and China. While performance in China remains robust, year-over-year growth was lower than in Q2, which drove a deceleration in regional volume growth and also in the GNS segment as you will see on the next slide. As a reminder, while China does impact our billings growth rates, it has a very small impact on our revenue and earnings due to the low margin that all networks earn on spending within China today.
Moving to the EMEA region. Volume growth remained consistent at 9% on an FX-adjusted basis, including double-digit growth in the U.K. The year-over-year decline in LACC volumes is being driven by Canada, which is being impacted by the end of our relationship with Costco in Canada. This will continue to impact our volume growth until Q1 2016, although it will begin to lessen next quarter as Costco began accepting other network products in its Canadian warehouses during Q4 2014. Outside of Canada, LACC regional growth remains in the double digits, including strong performance in Mexico and Argentina during Q3.
Overall, international performance, excluding Canada, continued to be strong, with volumes up 11% on an FX-adjusted basis versus the prior year during Q3. We are pleased with our progress outside the U.S., which reflects strong performance in the consumer and network businesses, where we've seen encouraging returns on our recent growth initiatives. As the largest global issuer, we constantly balance global strategies and local execution, seeking to leverage our best practices, capabilities and learnings in all the markets in which we compete.
Looking at the results by segment now on Slide 5. We saw slower growth in GCS, where billings were up 1% on an FX-adjusted basis, and in our USCS segment, where volume growth slowed to 5% versus 6% last quarter.
As I mentioned in my initial comments, billings growth, particularly in the U.S., continues to be impacted by a number of headwinds during 2015. 
To provide a bit of color on this, on average, we are seeing lower average transaction sizes in the U.S. as opposed to cardmembers using their American Express cards less frequently. In total, U.S. transactions increased 7% versus the prior year, but the average transaction size was down 3%. We are clearly seeing this impact on gas spending, where for the industry, average gas prices are down 25% versus the prior year. Lower average transaction sizes are also a driver within airline spending, which constitutes 7% of our total volumes in the U.S. and is down 3% year-over-year. And this decrease is consistent with the recent trends in average ticket prices and revenue performance across the U.S. airline industry. The slower airline spend had a larger relative impact within GCS, where airlines make up approximately 25% total spend.
Also in GCS, we saw a slowdown in growth across middle-market customers in the U.S. Despite this near-term performance, we do see opportunities to accelerate growth in this segment as we continue to focus and leverage our efforts to bring together some of the unique products and services we can offer to middle-market customers.
And last, moving back to the USCS segment, consistent with the prior quarter, we saw volumes on the Costco co-brand products soften, although the loan portfolio from Costco remained approximately 20% of worldwide loans as of the end of Q3.
More broadly on Costco, we have not seen a significant earnings impact from Costco in the U.S. as lower volume growth to date has been offset by reduced marketing expenses associated with the co-brand portfolio.
One other Costco point. We do realize that all of you remain extremely interested in the status of our Costco co-brand portfolio sale discussions with Citi. The reality is, this is a very complex transaction, and I don't think it would be appropriate to comment on the specifics during the discussions. We will provide more detail on the outcome and its implications for our 2016 EPS outlook as soon as the discussions are complete.
Moving on now to loan growth on Slide 6. You can see that worldwide loans increased by 4% versus last year. In the U.S., which constitutes the majority of our loans, growth was steady at 7% during Q3 and continues to outpace the industry. International loan balances remain down year-over-year due to FX and the end of our Costco relationship in Canada. Excluding the negative impact of FX in Canadian loan balances, however, international loan growth improved to 9% during Q3. So we are pleased with the underlying trends of loan growth. We continue to believe that there are opportunities to increase our share of lending from both existing and new customers globally without significantly changing the overall risk profile of the company.
Unlike other U.S. companies with a significant global footprint, our reported results are being significantly impacted by changes in foreign exchange rates. Over the past year, the dollar has strengthened significantly year-over-year against the currencies that we are most exposed to outside the U.S. as you can see at the bottom of Slide 7. The dollar's strength will have an impact on our performance for the balance of the year and could impact 2016 as well.
Looking at the comparison of our reported and FX-adjusted revenue growth rates. You can see the difference between our reported revenue growth and our FX-adjusted revenue growth remained relatively consistent as FX dragged our reported revenue growth by approximately 400 basis points in both Q2 and Q3.
When rates move this dramatically, there is also a bottom line impact. And as I mentioned earlier, we estimate that the strengthening of the dollar reduced our EPS by approximately 4% to 5% during the quarter.
Over the longer term, we continue to believe that being a global company that generates revenue in a diverse set of markets around the world is the strength of our business model.
So let's move now to our revenue performance on Slide 8, where you see that our reported revenues were down 1% versus the prior year but increased 3% on an FX-adjusted basis. As I just discussed, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar had a significant impact on a number of revenue lines, including discount revenue, net card fees and other commissions, which all increased year-over-year after adjusting for FX. Other revenue also grew versus Q3 '14 after adjusting for FX and the gains from the sales of ICBC and Concur shares in the prior year.
FX-adjusted revenue growth of 3% did slow sequentially versus the prior quarter. This was in part due to the modest slowing in billed business growth that I discussed. I'd also remind you that our second quarter results included a benefit in discount revenue related to certain merchant rebate accruals, which resulted in a year-over-year increase in the discount rate during Q2.
The 2 basis-point year-over-year decline in the discount rate this quarter was in part driven by the growth of the OptBlue program as well as the continued downward pressure that we traditionally have from changes in mix and competition. These impacts were partially offset by the decline in Costco Canada merchant volume, where we earned a much lower-than-average discount rate.
We continue to make steady progress with the OptBlue program. With the recent addition of Chase Paymentech, all of the top 10 U.S. merchant acquirers have now signed up to join the OptBlue program. We are signing a significant number of new merchants through the program and are focused on driving greater awareness and cardmember spending at these new Amex-accepting locations over time.
Continuing with merchant-related items in the U.S. It's now been approximately 3 months since the DOJ's remedy took effect. While the remedy has not yet had an impact on our business, it is still too early to tell what the longer-term impact in the marketplace will be.
Before moving on from Slide 8, I would say we are pleased with the strong growth of 8% in net interest income, driven by our continued progress in growing the loan portfolio and lower funding costs.
Turning to credit performance on Slide 9. We are pleased that our lending credit metrics remain at low levels, with our write-off rate declining slightly versus last quarter and our delinquency rates remaining flat.
Moving to Slide 10. Our credit performance during the quarter combined with higher loan balances to drive an 8% year-over-year increase in provision, which included a $53 million reserve build. All credit metrics had been steadily improving since the downturn. They have generally stabilized at their current levels at the course -- over the course of the past year. Therefore, reserve releases from improved credit performance are no longer offsetting the additional reserves needed for higher loan balances. This performance is in line with our expectations that would -- provision would increase year-over-year and in part reflects the steady growth we are seeing in the loan portfolio.
Going forward, we do continue to anticipate that write-off rates will gradually increase from today's low levels, in part due to the seasoning of our newer loan vintages. This is consistent with our comments from Investor Day about expecting to see some steady upward tick in write-off rates and a modest build in reserves over the outlook period.
Moving to expense performance on Slide 11. Our total expenses increased by 3% during the current quarter. Performance differed significantly across P&L lines, and all expenses benefited from the year-over-year change in FX rates. On an FX-adjusted basis, total expenses increased by 7% during the quarter. I'll walk you through the details of marketing and promotion and operating expenses in a few minutes, but let me first touch on a few other items on this slide.
Rewards expense increased 4% versus the prior year, a bit above the growth in proprietary billings, which excludes GNS. Performance this quarter includes a portion of the discrete impact from our renewed co-brand relationships. Our renewed co-brand relationships continued to have a more significant impact on the cost of cardmember services, which was up 31% versus the prior year.
As I mentioned earlier, we estimate that all of the changes in our co-brand relationships reduced EPS by approximately 5% this quarter. This estimate includes the impact of our renewed co-brand relationships with Delta, Starwood, Cathay Pacific, British Airways and Iberia as well as the net impact on our Canadian business from the end of our Costco relationship. The co-brand impact is primarily concentrated in cost of cardmember services and rewards expenses, although there is an impact on revenue growth as well.
Let's now turn to marketing and promotion on Slide 12. Marketing and promotion expenses were $847 million in the quarter and were up significantly from Q2 due to the higher spending on growth initiatives we did this quarter. On a year-over-year basis, marketing and promotion was 8% higher than the prior year, but was up 14% after adjusting for FX. The increase in M&P this quarter is consistent with our expectations as we have been clear since the Costco decision earlier this year that we intend for the spending on growth initiatives during full year 2015 to be at or slightly higher than the elevated levels of full year 2014. We have also highlighted that the increase would be more concentrated in the third and fourth quarters.
To provide some additional perspective about our growth initiative spending, we included the breakdown on Slide 13 that we had previously shared in mid-September. We continue to feel that this slide is a helpful way to think about what we broadly consider to be our spending on growth initiatives within the company.
As you can see, while a large portion of this spending occurs within marketing and promotion, a significant amount also occurs within operating expenses. And some of the impact also shows up as contra-revenue. I'd like to make a few comments related specifically to the increased spending during the third quarter. 
A large portion of the increase in marketing and promotion during Q3 was focused on our efforts to attract new cardmembers across our consumer, small business and corporate franchises around the globe. For example, in our U.S. consumer business, we ramped up acquisition efforts for our cash rebate products as well as our Gold charge card and Starwood Preferred Guest Credit Card, both of which were recently refreshed with several new cardmember benefits. We also increased our spending on longer-term technology initiatives, including efforts to enhance the digital capabilities that we provide to middle-market corporations and small businesses.
The higher spending during Q3 also helped drive progress across a number of business initiatives, including adding Sam's to our merchant acceptance network, rolling out Apple Pay to our Corporate Card and U.K. cardmembers as well as the continued expansion of the Plenti loyalty coalition program.
So as I just mentioned, the efforts to attract new cardmembers are one of the key focus areas for our incremental growth initiative spending. In this context, we are pleased to see that these efforts drove a significant increase in new cards acquired across our U.S. consumer, small business and corporate issuing businesses during the current quarter as you can see on Slide 14. Now obviously, it will take time for the benefits from these new acquisitions to impact our results, which is why our focus has consistently been on our performance over the multiyear outlook period.
Moving to operating expenses on Slide 15. Operating expenses were down 1% year-over-year and increased 3% on an FX-adjusted basis. As I mentioned, operating expense performance this quarter reflected an increased level of spending on growth initiatives, including a number of technology initiatives. As a portion of the spending on these technology initiatives hits the professional services and occupancy and equipment lines, I'll provide a bit more detail on just what is included in these expense categories. 
Starting with professional services, I would point out that the majority of expenses in this line are related to the technology costs that we pay third parties. This P&L line also includes the fees we pay third parties for credit and collection activities as well as some of the incentives we pay merchant acquirers.
Similarly, moving to occupancy and equipment, over 75% of the costs on this line on a year-to-date basis are related to data processing, including the license fees we pay technology providers and depreciation costs associated with our technology hardware and software. The remainder consists primarily of depreciation expense on office equipment and buildings and the rent we pay for office space around the world.
Similar to our performance across other operating expense lines, we have gained efficiency in our professional services and occupancy and equipment expenses over time as we have rationalized our technology infrastructure and location footprint around the world. We believe there is a sustained opportunity to deliver operating leverage going forward as technology continues to become cheaper and more powerful each year and our customers and merchants increasingly demonstrate a preference to engage with us through more digital channels.
Now moving on, let me touch specifically on the 21% increase in occupancy and equipment expense this quarter. The increase was driven by a $91 million impairment charge related to previously capitalized software development costs primarily within Enterprise Growth, including the decision not to continue with certain investments within the group. We continuously evaluate our investments across the company to ensure that we are deploying the right level of resources against our most attractive opportunities. In this context, we decided to pull back on certain initiatives in Enterprise Growth during the current quarter, including the decision to not proceed with the launch of our Serve product in Mexico. These decisions are aligned with some recent organizational changes with Enterprise Growth, including consolidating the Serve platform and related capabilities under Steve Squeri.
More broadly, we continually look at ways to make our overall organization more effective, streamlining the processes that cut across multiple parts of the company and focusing the organization on our most attractive growth opportunities in both the consumer and business-to-business space.
As we set priorities for 2016 and beyond, we will focus on those opportunities that can produce the best returns and we will be ensuring that we have the proper operating structure to deliver results in the most efficient and effective way.
To conclude now on operating expenses and moving to Slide 16, despite the greater spending on technology initiatives in the quarter, adjusted operating expenses are down 3% on a year-to-date basis and up 1% on an FX-adjusted basis, both well below our 3% target for 2015.
Now shifting to our capital performance on Slide 17. During the quarter, we returned well over 100% of the capital we generated to shareholders while maintaining our strong capital ratios. Our Q3 performance again demonstrates our confidence in the company's ability to generate capital while maintaining its financial strength and also demonstrates our ongoing commitment to using that capital strength to create value for our shareholders.
So let me now conclude by stepping away from some of the complexity I just took you through and going back to the key themes in our results. Overall, our Q3 performance reflected the headwinds and challenges that we've been managing throughout 2015. As expected, earnings were down year-over-year due to the ramp-up in spending on growth initiatives and the discrete impacts from changes in our co-brand relationships and a stronger U.S. dollar. In addition, billings and revenue growth continue to be impacted by the challenging economic, competitive and regulatory environment. Against this backdrop, we continued to move ahead with initiatives to build our business for the years ahead. We're investing substantially more in marketing incentives and technology to attract new cardmembers and additional spending to our network. We're expanding card acceptance at an accelerated pace among small merchants and added Sam's Club, the eighth largest retailer in the U.S., to our network earlier this month.
We're broadening our relationship with cardmembers to accommodate more of their borrowing needs, and our loan portfolio continued steady growth this quarter. The flexibility to invest in these and other growth initiatives comes in part from our ongoing progress in containing operating expenses throughout the company. We also continue to benefit from a strong balance sheet that allows us to return a substantial portion of our earnings to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. We remain committed to these actions and believe that these are the right things to do to achieve our multiyear outlook and position the company for the long term.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Toby for some details on our Q&A session."

Certainly, in the U.S. consumer business in particular, we have been seeing very nice growth in our Cashback products. And as you know, the accounting for our Cashback products does push -- it does make the Cashback a contra-revenue. So when you look at the discount rate that we report, what we try to do is reflect the actual economics that we're getting at the point-of-sale at the merchants, and so we try to -- we take that out of that calculation. When you do the straight calculation off the income statement of just discount revenue over billed business, you are capturing the higher growth rates of the Cashback products. All that said, I would say that in the grand scheme of the company overall, the Cashback products still are a relatively modest part of the overall portfolio, which is why we don't specifically call out the impact it has on the revenue growth rates. In terms of Loyalty Partner, what I would say is to remind everyone we have a business that is more mature in a variety of other countries around the globe like Germany, Poland, India. It's a little bit newer in Mexico and in Italy. And we're really pleased with the way the business has developed in all of those countries as it has gotten to profitability. When you go to the U.S., we're really pleased and excited about the launch of Plenti earlier this year. It's very, very early days in the U.S. and so we're very encouraged by the growth that we've seen and the number of members that Plenti has been able to attract. I think you've heard several of the other partners in Plenti talk about their view of the progress and it's all very positive. What I would say on the U.S. is it's still early days and we will need to see how it progresses over the next year or 2 before it begins to have a more material impact on the company's financial results."

I may parse it into pieces, talking a little bit about GNS, a little bit about the U.S. and share and then maybe a little bit about corporate. So I'll give you each of those briefly. If you look at GNS, just to remind everyone, our GNS business generates about 85% or so of its billings outside the U.S. and about 15% come in the U.S. And so you really have a broad range of market conditions. You have markets like the U.S., Australia, the U.K., where we run a network business side-by-side with our proprietary business. And then you have a lot of markets around the globe, China being a good example, where through a partner, in effect, the GNS business is how we operate American Express through a franchise model. So across that many different markets, I think it's a little challenging to generalize about share, but I would make the general point that we're really pleased with the growth rates we're seeing in GNS everywhere in the world. And share is something that we probably think about differently in each market depending on whether it's a pure GNS market or a combined proprietary and GNS market, but I would say we feel very good about our share trends on a combined basis outside the U.S. And when you take out the one challenge we have in Canada, I think we -- when you look at our overall international growth rates, it will match up very well in the most recent quarter with the broader set of competitors that we see there. But if you turn to the U.S., you talked about U.S. share, and we probably have a lot -- a little bit of share in the U.S. in recent quarters, but I'd make a broader point that over the last 5 years, we've actually gained quite a bit of share in the U.S. and we think about our prospects over the longer term. We also are focused at the end of the day in our share of industry profits and industry revenues. And we actually think we've done pretty well, including in recent quarters, on that front. We're very thoughtful about what opportunities are going to produce the best returns for our shareholders and sometimes that does not always lead you to the same answer as what might produce a largest billings share. For the last part of your question, to go to corporate in particular in the U.S., as I said in my remarks, the slowdown in airline spend, as an old airline CFO, is really remarkable when you look at both the large profits the airlines are generating right now, given the drop in fuel prices, but also the pretty tough revenue environment they're in, with industry revenues and industry unit revenues in the U.S. down. That's just reflected in our numbers, where we don't think we're losing share when we look at numbers of transactions, but the average transaction size is just trending right along with the airline industry spend. That does particularly impact our corporate business, since airlines are about 25% of that business. And we have seen a little bit of slowdown in the middle-market part of our corporate business, as I mentioned in my remarks. But -- and I would tell you, over the medium to long term, we continue to see this area of the middle-market section of business in the U.S. as a real growth opportunity for us, that's why we made some of the organizational changes we made earlier this year putting together our Corporate Card business and our open franchise under the leadership of Steve Squeri because -- that's why I talked a little bit about some of the technology initiative spending we're doing to strengthen and refine some of our products targeted at that segment. So we haven't lost any of our enthusiasm for the growth opportunities in that segment in the medium to long term, but you have seen a number of factors that slowed this down this quarter."

What I would point out is we see growth opportunities across lots of the pieces of our portfolio. And the reason you've heard us talk about, since earlier this year, being at an elevated level of growth-oriented spending in 2015 is because we want to do exactly what you just suggested, which is as we think about the termination of the Costco U.S. contract sometime in 2016, we think we have a lot of growth opportunities. We think in a significant fixed cost business, it makes a lot of sense to seize as many of the growth opportunities as we can now to position ourselves for that Costco change in 2016. When you think about what we're acquiring, we feel really good about the average quality of the accounts we're acquiring. And in terms of cost of acquiring those accounts, when we look at historical trends, we also feel really good that we are spending more absolute dollars. That's what the elevated level of growth spending is all about, and it's being reflected in a much higher level of new cards acquired, and the average cost is pretty similar to what we've historically experienced. So I suppose the other part of your question is why don't you do even more? Well, we're always balancing our financial, managerial and marketing resources and trying to make trade-offs that we think are optimal for our shareholders. So we are -- we believe we're going as aggressively as we can and should be, given the range of opportunities. I would just say we're encouraged by the progress we saw this last quarter."

I think, as we look at 2015 on the earnings side, the reality is it will come in very much in the range that we originally envisioned. If you go back to February when we first provided an outlook, and I suppose it goes a little bit to how you want to define modestly down. The reason we gave a range, if you go back to the beginning of 2015, is we wanted to make sure in the current environment, we're giving ourselves the flexibility to do the right things for the company for the long term. If you think about the question that Bob just asked, we are pleased by what we saw in the outcome or some of the fruits of the higher levels of spending we did in Q3. And that does suggest to us that we should continue to pursue many of those growth opportunities and stay at a pretty elevated level of spending to do it. And that does drive us probably more towards the modestly down part of our original guidance than the flat part of our guidance. I don't want to downplay the fact that as you've seen in the last couple of years, it's also a tough economic environment. If you go back to January and February as we were putting our plans into place and you look at all the economic forecasts -- and we just base our own plans on the consensus economic forecast. We don't try to say we can forecast better than anybody else. The actuals have all come in below what the consensus was earlier this year. And well, we're used to that. Part of the flexibility in our business model is we've got a lot of levers to pull to make sure we can react to that, but that has been a challenging thing for us. Gas prices staying down has been challenging. Foreign exchange getting a little worse. When we first provided an outlook for 2015, the U.S. dollar on a weighted average basis versus the range of currencies that matter to us was probably down around 10%. It's gone down close to another 10% since then. So all those things are factors. What we're trying to focus on are the core underlying things that will really determine the run rate of the company as we get past a range of the challenges facing us in the near term here, and we feel pretty good about those trends."

I want to make sure I get them all. No, all really good questions. So how do we define growth? I guess, what I would tell you is that our view of sort of absolute levels of what we believe we can achieve in 2016 has not changed at all since February. So nothing that we have seen that I just talked about in response to Bill's question are things that we don't think are manageable within all of the levers we have to pull, thinking about 2016. Second, when you think about Costco, I'd remind you that when we first, back on February 12, provided our 3-year financial outlook, we said we're confident that we can achieve the 2016 outlook we then provided, which was a return to positive growth, sort of regardless of what happened with the Costco portfolio. So we still don't know what the outcome is going to be around the portfolio. When we do, we will talk about it publicly quickly. And when we do, that will allow us, Sanjay, to be more precise because there's a lot of -- there's quite a range of outcomes around the portfolio, and until we know those, it's tough to give you a number. But what I want to come back to is what we're -- point I'm trying to make is that the underlying performance [indiscernible] back to a positive earnings performance in 2015. Sorry, we just lost our lights here. If you think about what the drivers are next year, well, just think about our financial framework. So the co-brand headwinds that we've had all of 2015, 5% was the headwind this quarter, drop away as you get into 2016. FX, well, particularly this quarter, is a big headwind. Now I suppose the dollar could move another 10% or 20% over the course of the next 4 quarters. And if it does, that will be a headwind for us. But if it doesn't, you should have an easier compare next year from an FX perspective. You brought up costs. You are correct that, in fact, when you look at some of the actions that are behind the restructuring charge we took at the end of 2014, many of those savings won't really get to full year run rate until you get to 2016. I'd also remind you that we've said all along that we will be mindful, as we think about volume trends in Costco going away, about what further steps we can take to make other improvements in our cost structure. So all of those things, Sanjay, to conclude, combine to say my view of what this company can generate in 2016 is really the same today as it was in February when we first provided the guidance. And my view of 2015 is we really have come in within the envelope that we set for ourselves, leaving ourselves enough flexibility to make the right decisions to run the company for the long term."

We are continually looking at all of the choices we have about where we invest our management and financial resources in order to produce the best outcome for our shareholders. And we continually learn from things we try. We continually need to react to the evolving competitive and regulatory environment in which we operate. And so one of the things that we've done over the last quarter is made some different decisions about product strategies and resource allocation around a number of the businesses that are part of Enterprise Growth. As you do that from a pure accounting perspective, the reality in a company like ours. where you're developing a lot of software and where you capitalize a fair amount of that software. is you sometimes end up with things on the balance sheet that relate to products that you're deemphasizing or not going to continue with. One of the examples I did call out in my remarks is we had planned to launch the Serve products in Mexico. That may still be a good idea at some point, but we decided looking around at all of our other opportunities that's not something we want to further invest in right now, and that does drive pulling some assets off the balance sheet. So all of that leads you to: this is certainly not a recurring event. This is a onetime sort of charge that is reflective of decisions that were made this quarter. I would just make the observation that I tried to be pretty clear in my remarks that in the current challenging, competitive regulatory and economic environment, you will see us continually making changes to the organization and to where we choose to put resources. And that may, from time to time, drive other kinds of onetime charges or contingencies. That won't stop us from doing things that we think are in the best interests of long-term value creation for our shareholders."

Look, it's a challenging competitive environment and we would not dispute that in any way. And I think I started my earlier comments by saying it's a pretty challenging environment. All that said, our goal at American Express is to take the many fairly unique strengths that we have and find ways to really create great offerings for our card members and our merchants in ways that are not necessarily easily replicable. The strength of our brand is something I think nobody else can really match. The breadth of our product line, which allows us to offer very targeted value propositions, because everybody who is listening to this call will have a different range of things that they value most, and we think the breadth of our product line really allows us to hone in on the many different demographic groups and targets that we have who we think we can provide value for. Our reputation for service, our global reach, the size and scale of our proprietary rewards program, Membership Rewards, some of the data and analytics we get from the closed loop and the way that allows us to be very targeted in our marketing and very targeted in how we work with our merchants and how we put together offers, those are all the kinds of things that we try very hard to leverage. So that as we think about what is undoubtedly a very competitive environment, we're not just out there saying, boy, can we offer 10 basis points more on a cash back card than everybody else because that's going to be the whole determinant. You've heard me say on these calls before, there will always be some portion of card members who actually do want to go to a website, pop the math in and say what card is going to produce the best math for me. And we're going to have a tougher time using our -- some of our differentiated strengths for that segment. In our experience, that is still a minority of customers, and we think the breadth of our product line and the many strengths we have allow us to compete in ways that produce better outcomes for our shareholders."

We based it on the view that we have many growth opportunities, and that's what we're pursuing. We're really pleased that if you just look at the new cards acquired numbers this quarter comes from every part of our company. Now certainly, one of the avenues for growth is there's some portion of Costco card members who have strong ties to American Express, and we'd love to work at capturing the spend and lend to those people. Subject to, as I've also said many times, the normal provisions you would expect in most of these kinds of contracts that put a lot of limitations around how you specifically market to the Costco card member. So we are very diligent about making sure we adhere to the spirit and letter of that contract. So our marketing efforts are really about how do we just, in general, market to all the many groups across the U.S. and across the globe that we think are attractive candidates to be card members of American Express. And certainly, as we do that, some portion of the Costco card members are liable to see those efforts and likely to be interested in pursuing a relationship with American Express in another way."

As a really general matter though, look, as I said in my remarks, while we're really pleased that we acquired 2.3 million new card members this quarter, there is a process of getting them to understand the product they have, beginning to build spend, beginning to build a little bit of loyalty to American Express. For those who are going to engage in lend -- or borrowing behavior, that balance then has to build. As a general matter, I really think of getting to the point where you're having meaningful bottom line contribution from new cards or acquirers being something that happens in the second and third year. You'll see other metrics show up much more quickly. But at the end of the day, we're very focused on what it takes to get people to profitability."

I'd make a couple of points. Our transaction growth has been, to make a general statement, fairly consistent over the last couple of years at around that 7% level. What is quite striking in recent quarters is the way the average transaction size is really -- the trend line has really changed. Certainly, some of the things we do about our steady efforts to drive more every day spend, you would expect over a long period of time at a gradual rate to have an impact here. But what you really see is quite different and is a little bit more tied in timing to gas prices going down to some of the challenges the airlines have had on the revenue side. And in fact, we see the average transaction size coming down across other categories like retail as well. So I have to tell you at this point, we're still spending a lot of time thinking, ourselves, about just what it all means. I think, there's probably a little bit of influence from some of the things we're doing internally, but I think there's a lot of influence from a variety of external factors and just what's going on in the overall very low inflation to, in so many categories, frankly, negative inflation in an economy that we're now doing business in."

So if you look overall at American Express, net interest income is, depending on how you want to measure it, 15% to 20% of our P&L. That's unlike any of our competitors where the numbers are 50% to 90%. We have a very spend-centric collection of businesses. When the Costco loan portfolio goes away in 2016, that's 20% of the loan portfolio that drives that net interest income. So we have, in our view, a long ways to go over the next few years just to stay in place in terms of the current contribution that lend makes to the overall economics of the company. And that's why we do in the U.S. consumer business, as well as some of our other businesses, see a little bit of opportunity to continue on the path we've been on for a few years, which is when you look at our own customers, we under index on our share, getting our share of their borrowing behavior versus the share of their spend behavior we get. That to us is just an opportunity too obvious for us not to continually work at and seize. And that's really what has allowed us for many quarters now to steadily grow our loan balances above where the industry was going in, in the U.S. while you hear us over and over again say: but we're comfortable that we're doing that without materially changing the risk profile of the company. So that's really all you see going on here. And as I said, I think we will be quite some time once the Costco loan portfolio goes away before we even get back to where we are today.

Despite that, we're actually pretty pleased with our performance in Europe this year. And I would point out to you that we have long had, in Europe -- in most countries, it varies by country, but in most countries, a significant premium to MasterCard and Visa. So that's not a new phenomenon. What the interchange regulation will do is put downward pressure on us, not to go to the point where the interchange is capped, but put pressure on us to move it down probably to keep the differential more similar. So I think we'll have to see how this goes. I will tell you that sitting here today, we're pretty pleased by this year's results. And you already see changes in the competitive environment as a number of issuers have announced pullbacks on the products or rewards they're able to offer. And like all of these things, our challenge and opportunity is to try to find ways to mitigate the obvious downside, which is it will put some downward pressure on our discount rates in Europe. But try to offset that with saying but what opportunities does it create to perhaps do some things that others can't. And at the end of the day, I think what the European regulations are really seeking is a competitive, a more competitive European environment. Our market shares in most of those countries are quite small, so we'd love to be more competitive and find ways to grow over time, but we'll have to see.

Overall, our third quarter performance was in line with our 2015 financial outlook and reflected the headwinds that we've been managing throughout 2015 including a challenging economic, competitive and regulatory environment.
Consistent with the expectations that we discussed publicly in mid-September, reported Q3 EPS of $1.24 was down 11% versus the prior year. And on an FX-adjusted basis, we did see a modest slowing sequentially in the billings growth rate from 6% to 5% and saw adjusted revenue growth slow from 5% in Q2 to 3% in Q3.
As in the first 2 quarters of 2015, our third quarter results continued to reflect the discrete impacts from various changes to certain of our co-brand partnerships and a significantly stronger U.S. dollar versus last year, both of which I'll quantify later in my remarks.
The decline in earnings versus the prior year was also in part driven by increased spending on growth initiatives. I'd remind you that as we considered earlier this year the implications of the pending termination in 2016 of our relationship with Costco in the U.S., we made the decision to increase spending in 2015 across a range of business opportunities to best position the company for long-term growth. While our reported results reflect these discrete impacts, overall performance continued to reflect healthy loan growth, strong cardmember and merchant acquisitions, write-off rates at historically low levels, disciplined operating expense control and the benefits of our strong capital position. Through all of this, we continued to drive an ROE above our on-average and over-time target of 25%, demonstrating the continued strength of our business model.
As we turn to the slides, we are once again beginning our presentation with a financial outlook framework that we first shared at Investor Day in March as we believe it remains a useful framework for discussing the drivers of our current performance.
I'll provide more details on the specific drivers as we review our reported results, but overall, we believe we are doing the right things to achieve our multiyear outlook and position the company for the long term.
Thinking ahead to Q4, we expect the results to reflect some of the same headwinds as the current quarter, including incremental spending on growth initiatives as well as the discrete impacts from changes in our co-brand relationships and a stronger U.S. dollar. I'd also remind you that in Q4 '14, we had a net benefit related to the sale of our investment in Concur. Throughout this year, we have said that our full year 2015 outlook was for EPS to be flat to modestly down versus the prior year. To be more specific, as we sit here today with 1 quarter left in the year, we estimate that full year 2015 EPS will be between $5.20 and $5.35. We believe our outlook to return to positive earnings per share growth in 2016 and within our target range of 12% to 15% in 2017 remains appropriate. As you recall, our outlook for 2015 to 2017 does not contemplate the impact of any restructuring charges or other contingencies.
Now to turn to a review of our financial results on Slide 3. Billings were flat versus the prior year on a reported basis. Adjusted for FX, billings growth was 5% during Q3, reflecting slower volume growth across our U.S. consumer and corporate portfolios. I'll provide more details on our billed business performance shortly. 
Reported revenues were down 1%, but were up 3% after adjusting for FX. This is slower than the adjusted Q2 revenue growth rate, in part due to the modestly slower billings growth and the merchant rebate accrual benefit that impacted discount revenue last quarter.
Net income was down 14% year-over-year, primarily reflecting an increase in spending on growth initiatives and the discrete impacts from changes to our co-brand relationships and the stronger U.S. dollar. We estimate that the changes in our co-brand relationships reduced EPS by approximately 5% during the quarter and that the negative impact from FX further reduced EPS by another approximately 4% to 5%. 
Below the net income line, we continued to leverage our strong capital position to provide significant returns to shareholders and have repurchased 56 million shares over the past 12 months, which has reduced our average share count by 5%. As a result, EPS was down 11% versus the prior year despite the 14% drop in net income and a $0.02 EPS impact related to our preferred dividend payment. As we have said previously, we expect that our quarterly earnings performance will be more uneven during this transitional period, and certainly, you saw that in our results this quarter. Our focus continues to be on the earnings outlook for each year and the long term as opposed to the performance in any given quarter.
Turning to our billings performance by region on Slide 4. On an FX-adjusted basis, billings growth was 5% during the quarter versus 6% in Q2, driven by a sequential decline in U.S. volume growth. I'll provide more context on the U.S. results in a few minutes, so let me begin with a review of the international billings trends.
While we continue to face an evolving regulatory landscape going forward, we have seen very solid performance trends across our international regions over the last several quarters. JAPA remained our fastest growth region, with volumes up 14% on an FX-adjusted basis. The strong performance was again powered by Japan and China. While performance in China remains robust, year-over-year growth was lower than in Q2, which drove a deceleration in regional volume growth and also in the GNS segment as you will see on the next slide. As a reminder, while China does impact our billings growth rates, it has a very small impact on our revenue and earnings due to the low margin that all networks earn on spending within China today.
Moving to the EMEA region. Volume growth remained consistent at 9% on an FX-adjusted basis, including double-digit growth in the U.K. The year-over-year decline in LACC volumes is being driven by Canada, which is being impacted by the end of our relationship with Costco in Canada. This will continue to impact our volume growth until Q1 2016, although it will begin to lessen next quarter as Costco began accepting other network products in its Canadian warehouses during Q4 2014. Outside of Canada, LACC regional growth remains in the double digits, including strong performance in Mexico and Argentina during Q3.
Overall, international performance, excluding Canada, continued to be strong, with volumes up 11% on an FX-adjusted basis versus the prior year during Q3. We are pleased with our progress outside the U.S., which reflects strong performance in the consumer and network businesses, where we've seen encouraging returns on our recent growth initiatives. As the largest global issuer, we constantly balance global strategies and local execution, seeking to leverage our best practices, capabilities and learnings in all the markets in which we compete.
Looking at the results by segment now on Slide 5. We saw slower growth in GCS, where billings were up 1% on an FX-adjusted basis, and in our USCS segment, where volume growth slowed to 5% versus 6% last quarter.
As I mentioned in my initial comments, billings growth, particularly in the U.S., continues to be impacted by a number of headwinds during 2015. 
To provide a bit of color on this, on average, we are seeing lower average transaction sizes in the U.S. as opposed to cardmembers using their American Express cards less frequently. In total, U.S. transactions increased 7% versus the prior year, but the average transaction size was down 3%. We are clearly seeing this impact on gas spending, where for the industry, average gas prices are down 25% versus the prior year. Lower average transaction sizes are also a driver within airline spending, which constitutes 7% of our total volumes in the U.S. and is down 3% year-over-year. And this decrease is consistent with the recent trends in average ticket prices and revenue performance across the U.S. airline industry. The slower airline spend had a larger relative impact within GCS, where airlines make up approximately 25% total spend.
Also in GCS, we saw a slowdown in growth across middle-market customers in the U.S. Despite this near-term performance, we do see opportunities to accelerate growth in this segment as we continue to focus and leverage our efforts to bring together some of the unique products and services we can offer to middle-market customers.
And last, moving back to the USCS segment, consistent with the prior quarter, we saw volumes on the Costco co-brand products soften, although the loan portfolio from Costco remained approximately 20% of worldwide loans as of the end of Q3.
More broadly on Costco, we have not seen a significant earnings impact from Costco in the U.S. as lower volume growth to date has been offset by reduced marketing expenses associated with the co-brand portfolio.
One other Costco point. We do realize that all of you remain extremely interested in the status of our Costco co-brand portfolio sale discussions with Citi. The reality is, this is a very complex transaction, and I don't think it would be appropriate to comment on the specifics during the discussions. We will provide more detail on the outcome and its implications for our 2016 EPS outlook as soon as the discussions are complete.
Moving on now to loan growth on Slide 6. You can see that worldwide loans increased by 4% versus last year. In the U.S., which constitutes the majority of our loans, growth was steady at 7% during Q3 and continues to outpace the industry. International loan balances remain down year-over-year due to FX and the end of our Costco relationship in Canada. Excluding the negative impact of FX in Canadian loan balances, however, international loan growth improved to 9% during Q3. So we are pleased with the underlying trends of loan growth. We continue to believe that there are opportunities to increase our share of lending from both existing and new customers globally without significantly changing the overall risk profile of the company.
Unlike other U.S. companies with a significant global footprint, our reported results are being significantly impacted by changes in foreign exchange rates. Over the past year, the dollar has strengthened significantly year-over-year against the currencies that we are most exposed to outside the U.S. as you can see at the bottom of Slide 7. The dollar's strength will have an impact on our performance for the balance of the year and could impact 2016 as well.
Looking at the comparison of our reported and FX-adjusted revenue growth rates. You can see the difference between our reported revenue growth and our FX-adjusted revenue growth remained relatively consistent as FX dragged our reported revenue growth by approximately 400 basis points in both Q2 and Q3.
When rates move this dramatically, there is also a bottom line impact. And as I mentioned earlier, we estimate that the strengthening of the dollar reduced our EPS by approximately 4% to 5% during the quarter.
Over the longer term, we continue to believe that being a global company that generates revenue in a diverse set of markets around the world is the strength of our business model.
So let's move now to our revenue performance on Slide 8, where you see that our reported revenues were down 1% versus the prior year but increased 3% on an FX-adjusted basis. As I just discussed, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar had a significant impact on a number of revenue lines, including discount revenue, net card fees and other commissions, which all increased year-over-year after adjusting for FX. Other revenue also grew versus Q3 '14 after adjusting for FX and the gains from the sales of ICBC and Concur shares in the prior year.
FX-adjusted revenue growth of 3% did slow sequentially versus the prior quarter. This was in part due to the modest slowing in billed business growth that I discussed. I'd also remind you that our second quarter results included a benefit in discount revenue related to certain merchant rebate accruals, which resulted in a year-over-year increase in the discount rate during Q2.
The 2 basis-point year-over-year decline in the discount rate this quarter was in part driven by the growth of the OptBlue program as well as the continued downward pressure that we traditionally have from changes in mix and competition. These impacts were partially offset by the decline in Costco Canada merchant volume, where we earned a much lower-than-average discount rate.
We continue to make steady progress with the OptBlue program. With the recent addition of Chase Paymentech, all of the top 10 U.S. merchant acquirers have now signed up to join the OptBlue program. We are signing a significant number of new merchants through the program and are focused on driving greater awareness and cardmember spending at these new Amex-accepting locations over time.
Continuing with merchant-related items in the U.S. It's now been approximately 3 months since the DOJ's remedy took effect. While the remedy has not yet had an impact on our business, it is still too early to tell what the longer-term impact in the marketplace will be.
Before moving on from Slide 8, I would say we are pleased with the strong growth of 8% in net interest income, driven by our continued progress in growing the loan portfolio and lower funding costs.
Turning to credit performance on Slide 9. We are pleased that our lending credit metrics remain at low levels, with our write-off rate declining slightly versus last quarter and our delinquency rates remaining flat.
Moving to Slide 10. Our credit performance during the quarter combined with higher loan balances to drive an 8% year-over-year increase in provision, which included a $53 million reserve build. All credit metrics had been steadily improving since the downturn. They have generally stabilized at their current levels at the course -- over the course of the past year. Therefore, reserve releases from improved credit performance are no longer offsetting the additional reserves needed for higher loan balances. This performance is in line with our expectations that would -- provision would increase year-over-year and in part reflects the steady growth we are seeing in the loan portfolio.
Going forward, we do continue to anticipate that write-off rates will gradually increase from today's low levels, in part due to the seasoning of our newer loan vintages. This is consistent with our comments from Investor Day about expecting to see some steady upward tick in write-off rates and a modest build in reserves over the outlook period.
Moving to expense performance on Slide 11. Our total expenses increased by 3% during the current quarter. Performance differed significantly across P&L lines, and all expenses benefited from the year-over-year change in FX rates. On an FX-adjusted basis, total expenses increased by 7% during the quarter. I'll walk you through the details of marketing and promotion and operating expenses in a few minutes, but let me first touch on a few other items on this slide.
Rewards expense increased 4% versus the prior year, a bit above the growth in proprietary billings, which excludes GNS. Performance this quarter includes a portion of the discrete impact from our renewed co-brand relationships. Our renewed co-brand relationships continued to have a more significant impact on the cost of cardmember services, which was up 31% versus the prior year.
As I mentioned earlier, we estimate that all of the changes in our co-brand relationships reduced EPS by approximately 5% this quarter. This estimate includes the impact of our renewed co-brand relationships with Delta, Starwood, Cathay Pacific, British Airways and Iberia as well as the net impact on our Canadian business from the end of our Costco relationship. The co-brand impact is primarily concentrated in cost of cardmember services and rewards expenses, although there is an impact on revenue growth as well.
Let's now turn to marketing and promotion on Slide 12. Marketing and promotion expenses were $847 million in the quarter and were up significantly from Q2 due to the higher spending on growth initiatives we did this quarter. On a year-over-year basis, marketing and promotion was 8% higher than the prior year, but was up 14% after adjusting for FX. The increase in M&P this quarter is consistent with our expectations as we have been clear since the Costco decision earlier this year that we intend for the spending on growth initiatives during full year 2015 to be at or slightly higher than the elevated levels of full year 2014. We have also highlighted that the increase would be more concentrated in the third and fourth quarters.
To provide some additional perspective about our growth initiative spending, we included the breakdown on Slide 13 that we had previously shared in mid-September. We continue to feel that this slide is a helpful way to think about what we broadly consider to be our spending on growth initiatives within the company.
As you can see, while a large portion of this spending occurs within marketing and promotion, a significant amount also occurs within operating expenses. And some of the impact also shows up as contra-revenue. I'd like to make a few comments related specifically to the increased spending during the third quarter. 
A large portion of the increase in marketing and promotion during Q3 was focused on our efforts to attract new cardmembers across our consumer, small business and corporate franchises around the globe. For example, in our U.S. consumer business, we ramped up acquisition efforts for our cash rebate products as well as our Gold charge card and Starwood Preferred Guest Credit Card, both of which were recently refreshed with several new cardmember benefits. We also increased our spending on longer-term technology initiatives, including efforts to enhance the digital capabilities that we provide to middle-market corporations and small businesses.
The higher spending during Q3 also helped drive progress across a number of business initiatives, including adding Sam's to our merchant acceptance network, rolling out Apple Pay to our Corporate Card and U.K. cardmembers as well as the continued expansion of the Plenti loyalty coalition program.
So as I just mentioned, the efforts to attract new cardmembers are one of the key focus areas for our incremental growth initiative spending. In this context, we are pleased to see that these efforts drove a significant increase in new cards acquired across our U.S. consumer, small business and corporate issuing businesses during the current quarter as you can see on Slide 14. Now obviously, it will take time for the benefits from these new acquisitions to impact our results, which is why our focus has consistently been on our performance over the multiyear outlook period.
Moving to operating expenses on Slide 15. Operating expenses were down 1% year-over-year and increased 3% on an FX-adjusted basis. As I mentioned, operating expense performance this quarter reflected an increased level of spending on growth initiatives, including a number of technology initiatives. As a portion of the spending on these technology initiatives hits the professional services and occupancy and equipment lines, I'll provide a bit more detail on just what is included in these expense categories. 
Starting with professional services, I would point out that the majority of expenses in this line are related to the technology costs that we pay third parties. This P&L line also includes the fees we pay third parties for credit and collection activities as well as some of the incentives we pay merchant acquirers.
Similarly, moving to occupancy and equipment, over 75% of the costs on this line on a year-to-date basis are related to data processing, including the license fees we pay technology providers and depreciation costs associated with our technology hardware and software. The remainder consists primarily of depreciation expense on office equipment and buildings and the rent we pay for office space around the world.
Similar to our performance across other operating expense lines, we have gained efficiency in our professional services and occupancy and equipment expenses over time as we have rationalized our technology infrastructure and location footprint around the world. We believe there is a sustained opportunity to deliver operating leverage going forward as technology continues to become cheaper and more powerful each year and our customers and merchants increasingly demonstrate a preference to engage with us through more digital channels.
Now moving on, let me touch specifically on the 21% increase in occupancy and equipment expense this quarter. The increase was driven by a $91 million impairment charge related to previously capitalized software development costs primarily within Enterprise Growth, including the decision not to continue with certain investments within the group. We continuously evaluate our investments across the company to ensure that we are deploying the right level of resources against our most attractive opportunities. In this context, we decided to pull back on certain initiatives in Enterprise Growth during the current quarter, including the decision to not proceed with the launch of our Serve product in Mexico. These decisions are aligned with some recent organizational changes with Enterprise Growth, including consolidating the Serve platform and related capabilities under Steve Squeri.
More broadly, we continually look at ways to make our overall organization more effective, streamlining the processes that cut across multiple parts of the company and focusing the organization on our most attractive growth opportunities in both the consumer and business-to-business space.
As we set priorities for 2016 and beyond, we will focus on those opportunities that can produce the best returns and we will be ensuring that we have the proper operating structure to deliver results in the most efficient and effective way.
To conclude now on operating expenses and moving to Slide 16, despite the greater spending on technology initiatives in the quarter, adjusted operating expenses are down 3% on a year-to-date basis and up 1% on an FX-adjusted basis, both well below our 3% target for 2015.
Now shifting to our capital performance on Slide 17. During the quarter, we returned well over 100% of the capital we generated to shareholders while maintaining our strong capital ratios. Our Q3 performance again demonstrates our confidence in the company's ability to generate capital while maintaining its financial strength and also demonstrates our ongoing commitment to using that capital strength to create value for our shareholders.
So let me now conclude by stepping away from some of the complexity I just took you through and going back to the key themes in our results. Overall, our Q3 performance reflected the headwinds and challenges that we've been managing throughout 2015. As expected, earnings were down year-over-year due to the ramp-up in spending on growth initiatives and the discrete impacts from changes in our co-brand relationships and a stronger U.S. dollar. In addition, billings and revenue growth continue to be impacted by the challenging economic, competitive and regulatory environment. Against this backdrop, we continued to move ahead with initiatives to build our business for the years ahead. We're investing substantially more in marketing incentives and technology to attract new cardmembers and additional spending to our network. We're expanding card acceptance at an accelerated pace among small merchants and added Sam's Club, the eighth largest retailer in the U.S., to our network earlier this month.
We're broadening our relationship with cardmembers to accommodate more of their borrowing needs, and our loan portfolio continued steady growth this quarter. The flexibility to invest in these and other growth initiatives comes in part from our ongoing progress in containing operating expenses throughout the company. We also continue to benefit from a strong balance sheet that allows us to return a substantial portion of our earnings to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. We remain committed to these actions and believe that these are the right things to do to achieve our multiyear outlook and position the company for the long term.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Toby for some details on our Q&A session."

Certainly, in the U.S. consumer business in particular, we have been seeing very nice growth in our Cashback products. And as you know, the accounting for our Cashback products does push -- it does make the Cashback a contra-revenue. So when you look at the discount rate that we report, what we try to do is reflect the actual economics that we're getting at the point-of-sale at the merchants, and so we try to -- we take that out of that calculation. When you do the straight calculation off the income statement of just discount revenue over billed business, you are capturing the higher growth rates of the Cashback products. All that said, I would say that in the grand scheme of the company overall, the Cashback products still are a relatively modest part of the overall portfolio, which is why we don't specifically call out the impact it has on the revenue growth rates. In terms of Loyalty Partner, what I would say is to remind everyone we have a business that is more mature in a variety of other countries around the globe like Germany, Poland, India. It's a little bit newer in Mexico and in Italy. And we're really pleased with the way the business has developed in all of those countries as it has gotten to profitability. When you go to the U.S., we're really pleased and excited about the launch of Plenti earlier this year. It's very, very early days in the U.S. and so we're very encouraged by the growth that we've seen and the number of members that Plenti has been able to attract. I think you've heard several of the other partners in Plenti talk about their view of the progress and it's all very positive. What I would say on the U.S. is it's still early days and we will need to see how it progresses over the next year or 2 before it begins to have a more material impact on the company's financial results."

I may parse it into pieces, talking a little bit about GNS, a little bit about the U.S. and share and then maybe a little bit about corporate. So I'll give you each of those briefly. If you look at GNS, just to remind everyone, our GNS business generates about 85% or so of its billings outside the U.S. and about 15% come in the U.S. And so you really have a broad range of market conditions. You have markets like the U.S., Australia, the U.K., where we run a network business side-by-side with our proprietary business. And then you have a lot of markets around the globe, China being a good example, where through a partner, in effect, the GNS business is how we operate American Express through a franchise model. So across that many different markets, I think it's a little challenging to generalize about share, but I would make the general point that we're really pleased with the growth rates we're seeing in GNS everywhere in the world. And share is something that we probably think about differently in each market depending on whether it's a pure GNS market or a combined proprietary and GNS market, but I would say we feel very good about our share trends on a combined basis outside the U.S. And when you take out the one challenge we have in Canada, I think we -- when you look at our overall international growth rates, it will match up very well in the most recent quarter with the broader set of competitors that we see there. But if you turn to the U.S., you talked about U.S. share, and we probably have a lot -- a little bit of share in the U.S. in recent quarters, but I'd make a broader point that over the last 5 years, we've actually gained quite a bit of share in the U.S. and we think about our prospects over the longer term. We also are focused at the end of the day in our share of industry profits and industry revenues. And we actually think we've done pretty well, including in recent quarters, on that front. We're very thoughtful about what opportunities are going to produce the best returns for our shareholders and sometimes that does not always lead you to the same answer as what might produce a largest billings share. For the last part of your question, to go to corporate in particular in the U.S., as I said in my remarks, the slowdown in airline spend, as an old airline CFO, is really remarkable when you look at both the large profits the airlines are generating right now, given the drop in fuel prices, but also the pretty tough revenue environment they're in, with industry revenues and industry unit revenues in the U.S. down. That's just reflected in our numbers, where we don't think we're losing share when we look at numbers of transactions, but the average transaction size is just trending right along with the airline industry spend. That does particularly impact our corporate business, since airlines are about 25% of that business. And we have seen a little bit of slowdown in the middle-market part of our corporate business, as I mentioned in my remarks. But -- and I would tell you, over the medium to long term, we continue to see this area of the middle-market section of business in the U.S. as a real growth opportunity for us, that's why we made some of the organizational changes we made earlier this year putting together our Corporate Card business and our open franchise under the leadership of Steve Squeri because -- that's why I talked a little bit about some of the technology initiative spending we're doing to strengthen and refine some of our products targeted at that segment. So we haven't lost any of our enthusiasm for the growth opportunities in that segment in the medium to long term, but you have seen a number of factors that slowed this down this quarter."

What I would point out is we see growth opportunities across lots of the pieces of our portfolio. And the reason you've heard us talk about, since earlier this year, being at an elevated level of growth-oriented spending in 2015 is because we want to do exactly what you just suggested, which is as we think about the termination of the Costco U.S. contract sometime in 2016, we think we have a lot of growth opportunities. We think in a significant fixed cost business, it makes a lot of sense to seize as many of the growth opportunities as we can now to position ourselves for that Costco change in 2016. When you think about what we're acquiring, we feel really good about the average quality of the accounts we're acquiring. And in terms of cost of acquiring those accounts, when we look at historical trends, we also feel really good that we are spending more absolute dollars. That's what the elevated level of growth spending is all about, and it's being reflected in a much higher level of new cards acquired, and the average cost is pretty similar to what we've historically experienced. So I suppose the other part of your question is why don't you do even more? Well, we're always balancing our financial, managerial and marketing resources and trying to make trade-offs that we think are optimal for our shareholders. So we are -- we believe we're going as aggressively as we can and should be, given the range of opportunities. I would just say we're encouraged by the progress we saw this last quarter."

If you think about the question that Bob just asked, we are pleased by what we saw in the outcome or some of the fruits of the higher levels of spending we did in Q3. And that does suggest to us that we should continue to pursue many of those growth opportunities and stay at a pretty elevated level of spending to do it. And that does drive us probably more towards the modestly down part of our original guidance than the flat part of our guidance. I don't want to downplay the fact that as you've seen in the last couple of years, it's also a tough economic environment. If you go back to January and February as we were putting our plans into place and you look at all the economic forecasts -- and we just base our own plans on the consensus economic forecast. We don't try to say we can forecast better than anybody else. The actuals have all come in below what the consensus was earlier this year. And well, we're used to that. Part of the flexibility in our business model is we've got a lot of levers to pull to make sure we can react to that, but that has been a challenging thing for us. Gas prices staying down has been challenging. Foreign exchange getting a little worse. When we first provided an outlook for 2015, the U.S. dollar on a weighted average basis versus the range of currencies that matter to us was probably down around 10%. It's gone down close to another 10% since then. So all those things are factors. What we're trying to focus on are the core underlying things that will really determine the run rate of the company as we get past a range of the challenges facing us in the near term here, and we feel pretty good about those trends."

So we still don't know what the outcome is going to be around the portfolio. When we do, we will talk about it publicly quickly. And when we do, that will allow us, Sanjay, to be more precise because there's a lot of -- there's quite a range of outcomes around the portfolio, and until we know those, it's tough to give you a number. But what I want to come back to is what we're -- point I'm trying to make is that the underlying performance [indiscernible] back to a positive earnings performance in 2015. Sorry, we just lost our lights here. If you think about what the drivers are next year, well, just think about our financial framework. So the co-brand headwinds that we've had all of 2015, 5% was the headwind this quarter, drop away as you get into 2016. FX, well, particularly this quarter, is a big headwind. Now I suppose the dollar could move another 10% or 20% over the course of the next 4 quarters. And if it does, that will be a headwind for us. But if it doesn't, you should have an easier compare next year from an FX perspective. You brought up costs. You are correct that, in fact, when you look at some of the actions that are behind the restructuring charge we took at the end of 2014, many of those savings won't really get to full year run rate until you get to 2016. I'd also remind you that we've said all along that we will be mindful, as we think about volume trends in Costco going away, about what further steps we can take to make other improvements in our cost structure. So all of those things, Sanjay, to conclude, combine to say my view of what this company can generate in 2016 is really the same today as it was in February when we first provided the guidance. And my view of 2015 is we really have come in within the envelope that we set for ourselves, leaving ourselves enough flexibility to make the right decisions to run the company for the long term."

We are continually looking at all of the choices we have about where we invest our management and financial resources in order to produce the best outcome for our shareholders. And we continually learn from things we try. We continually need to react to the evolving competitive and regulatory environment in which we operate. And so one of the things that we've done over the last quarter is made some different decisions about product strategies and resource allocation around a number of the businesses that are part of Enterprise Growth. As you do that from a pure accounting perspective, the reality in a company like ours. where you're developing a lot of software and where you capitalize a fair amount of that software. is you sometimes end up with things on the balance sheet that relate to products that you're deemphasizing or not going to continue with. One of the examples I did call out in my remarks is we had planned to launch the Serve products in Mexico. That may still be a good idea at some point, but we decided looking around at all of our other opportunities that's not something we want to further invest in right now, and that does drive pulling some assets off the balance sheet. So all of that leads you to: this is certainly not a recurring event. This is a onetime sort of charge that is reflective of decisions that were made this quarter. I would just make the observation that I tried to be pretty clear in my remarks that in the current challenging, competitive regulatory and economic environment, you will see us continually making changes to the organization and to where we choose to put resources. And that may, from time to time, drive other kinds of onetime charges or contingencies. That won't stop us from doing things that we think are in the best interests of long-term value creation for our shareholders."

Look, it's a challenging competitive environment and we would not dispute that in any way. And I think I started my earlier comments by saying it's a pretty challenging environment. All that said, our goal at American Express is to take the many fairly unique strengths that we have and find ways to really create great offerings for our card members and our merchants in ways that are not necessarily easily replicable. The strength of our brand is something I think nobody else can really match. The breadth of our product line, which allows us to offer very targeted value propositions, because everybody who is listening to this call will have a different range of things that they value most, and we think the breadth of our product line really allows us to hone in on the many different demographic groups and targets that we have who we think we can provide value for. Our reputation for service, our global reach, the size and scale of our proprietary rewards program, Membership Rewards, some of the data and analytics we get from the closed loop and the way that allows us to be very targeted in our marketing and very targeted in how we work with our merchants and how we put together offers, those are all the kinds of things that we try very hard to leverage. So that as we think about what is undoubtedly a very competitive environment, we're not just out there saying, boy, can we offer 10 basis points more on a cash back card than everybody else because that's going to be the whole determinant. You've heard me say on these calls before, there will always be some portion of card members who actually do want to go to a website, pop the math in and say what card is going to produce the best math for me. And we're going to have a tougher time using our -- some of our differentiated strengths for that segment. In our experience, that is still a minority of customers, and we think the breadth of our product line and the many strengths we have allow us to compete in ways that produce better outcomes for our shareholders."

We based it on the view that we have many growth opportunities, and that's what we're pursuing. We're really pleased that if you just look at the new cards acquired numbers this quarter comes from every part of our company. Now certainly, one of the avenues for growth is there's some portion of Costco card members who have strong ties to American Express, and we'd love to work at capturing the spend and lend to those people. Subject to, as I've also said many times, the normal provisions you would expect in most of these kinds of contracts that put a lot of limitations around how you specifically market to the Costco card member. So we are very diligent about making sure we adhere to the spirit and letter of that contract. So our marketing efforts are really about how do we just, in general, market to all the many groups across the U.S. and across the globe that we think are attractive candidates to be card members of American Express. And certainly, as we do that, some portion of the Costco card members are liable to see those efforts and likely to be interested in pursuing a relationship with American Express in another way."

For those who are going to engage in lend -- or borrowing behavior, that balance then has to build. As a general matter, I really think of getting to the point where you're having meaningful bottom line contribution from new cards or acquirers being something that happens in the second and third year. You'll see other metrics show up much more quickly. But at the end of the day, we're very focused on what it takes to get people to profitability."

I'd make a couple of points. Our transaction growth has been, to make a general statement, fairly consistent over the last couple of years at around that 7% level. What is quite striking in recent quarters is the way the average transaction size is really -- the trend line has really changed. Certainly, some of the things we do about our steady efforts to drive more every day spend, you would expect over a long period of time at a gradual rate to have an impact here. But what you really see is quite different and is a little bit more tied in timing to gas prices going down to some of the challenges the airlines have had on the revenue side. And in fact, we see the average transaction size coming down across other categories like retail as well. So I have to tell you at this point, we're still spending a lot of time thinking, ourselves, about just what it all means. I think, there's probably a little bit of influence from some of the things we're doing internally, but I think there's a lot of influence from a variety of external factors and just what's going on in the overall very low inflation to, in so many categories, frankly, negative inflation in an economy that we're now doing business in."

So if you look overall at American Express, net interest income is, depending on how you want to measure it, 15% to 20% of our P&L. That's unlike any of our competitors where the numbers are 50% to 90%. We have a very spend-centric collection of businesses. When the Costco loan portfolio goes away in 2016, that's 20% of the loan portfolio that drives that net interest income. So we have, in our view, a long ways to go over the next few years just to stay in place in terms of the current contribution that lend makes to the overall economics of the company. And that's why we do in the U.S. consumer business, as well as some of our other businesses, see a little bit of opportunity to continue on the path we've been on for a few years, which is when you look at our own customers, we under index on our share, getting our share of their borrowing behavior versus the share of their spend behavior we get. That to us is just an opportunity too obvious for us not to continually work at and seize. And that's really what has allowed us for many quarters now to steadily grow our loan balances above where the industry was going in, in the U.S. while you hear us over and over again say: but we're comfortable that we're doing that without materially changing the risk profile of the company. So that's really all you see going on here. And as I said, I think we will be quite some time once the Costco loan portfolio goes away before we even get back to where we are today. But the exciting thing to us is we see a long ramp that should allow us to continue to grow loans in the U.S. a little bit faster than the industry while not changing the risk profile of the company."

We said for a while that when you look at the EU regulation, which to remind everyone, is really targeted at Visa and MasterCard and will cap interchange rates. That will put some downward pressure on our discount rates. And frankly, you see that downward pressure even this year. Despite that, we're actually pretty pleased with our performance in Europe this year. And I would point out to you that we have long had, in Europe -- in most countries, it varies by country, but in most countries, a significant premium to MasterCard and Visa. So that's not a new phenomenon. What the interchange regulation will do is put downward pressure on us, not to go to the point where the interchange is capped, but put pressure on us to move it down probably to keep the differential more similar. So I think we'll have to see how this goes. I will tell you that sitting here today, we're pretty pleased by this year's results. And you already see changes in the competitive environment as a number of issuers have announced pullbacks on the products or rewards they're able to offer. And like all of these things, our challenge and opportunity is to try to find ways to mitigate the obvious downside, which is it will put some downward pressure on our discount rates in Europe. But try to offset that with saying but what opportunities does it create to perhaps do some things that others can't. And at the end of the day, I think what the European regulations are really seeking is a competitive, a more competitive European environment. Our market shares in most of those countries are quite small, so we'd love to be more competitive and find ways to grow over time, but we'll have to see.
