We had another strong year of operations in 2014, which we're very pleased with given the challenging weather conditions at the start of the year. 
At the utilities, each op co achieved top decile performance for safety and top quartile performance for outage frequency and duration. The nuclear fleet ended the year at 94.2% capacity factor, which this marks our 15th year in a row being over 92%.  Gas and Hydro power dispatch match was at 97% and our renewable energy capture was at 95%. 
On the financial side, we delivered $2.39 a share, in line with our recent year -- full year guidance. Exelon Generation delivered a strong year for performance in what was a volatile year.  And our generation to load matching strategy group strong results during an unexpected mild summer. The utilities performed well in light of severe storms and continuing challenging interest rate environment. 
2014 was an active year for us and in addition to selling several assets, we continue to process a recycling capital and strengthening our balance sheet. I'll highlight some of our major investments for the year. 
We grew across the enterprise from the utility growth perspective, we announced the PHI merger and continued on with our infrastructure upgrade planned spending $3.1 billion of utility investment. 
On the margin side, we announced a state-of-the-art CCGT new build in ERCOT, and we added 250 in megawatts in nuclear wind and solar capacity during the year. 
At Constellation on the retail side, we completed the acquisition of Integrys Retail and ProLiance. 
We also made investments in adjacent markets and emerging technology to continue to prepare for an evolving marketplace. Bloom Energy and microgrid investments are good examples of that. 
We also had a number of major regulatory developments in 2014 that affect both the Utilities and the Generating business. 
On the Generating side, we've seen progress in Illinois nuclear discussions with 4 reports released last month, which highlights the reliability, the economic and the environmental benefits of the nuclear plants to the state. 
PJM capacity performance proposal has been submitted to FERC. We strongly support the steps being taken to ensure reliability in the region.  We expect continuing discussion on the EPA's Clean Power Plan over the next several months. 
On the utility front, we had 2 positive outcomes for ComeEd and BGE rate cases.  ComEd received 95% or more from -- are asked on the last 3 consecutive rate cases and BGE achieved its first settlement since 1999, and these outcomes highlight our continued commitment to the customers we serve. Bill is going to go into greater detail on the advocacy issues towards the end of the call. 
These policy initiatives on the horizon present a potential material upside to earnings as a value of our fleet is more appropriately recognized by the market. However, I do want to underscore that the management team is focused on EPS growth and our capital deployment efforts. We invest in prudent growth of the utilities where we can add value for our customers and within our merchant business, we looked for opportunities to earn robust financial returns. Our recent announcement -- announced [indiscernible] in New England is a great example of that. 
Our continued investments in both the Utilities and the Generation business demonstrates our commitment to long-term growth initiatives across the enterprise that will bring value to our customers and drive future earnings. 
Now let me turn it over to Jack to discuss our financial expectations for 2015."
296181,282851003,762585,"Exelon Corporation, Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 13, 2015",2015-02-13,"Earnings Calls","Exelon Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. We provided information on our fourth quarter financial results in the appendix of today's materials on Slide 17 and 18.  I'll spend my time this morning on 2015 earnings guidance and our O&M forecast. Turni",910,"Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. We provided information on our fourth quarter financial results in the appendix of today's materials on Slide 17 and 18.  I'll spend my time this morning on 2015 earnings guidance and our O&M forecast. 
Turning to Slide 3. We expect to deliver adjusted operating earnings in the $2.25 to $2.55 range, which is the same as our 2014 guidance, and earnings of $0.60 to $0.70 per share for the first quarter. Our guidance does not include the earnings from the Pepco Holdings acquisition but does reflect all asset divestitures to-date. 
As you know, we sold several assets last year, the proceeds of which are being used to partially finance the PHI acquisition and to recycle capital on the merchant side of our business. The loss contributions from these divestitures result in an earnings impact of $0.12 per share relative to last year. 
In future years, there's minimal earnings impact. In particular as the capacity revenue from Keystone and Conemaugh runs off. 
The modest loss earnings from the divested plants will be meaningfully offset by the accretion from our Pepco merger and earnings from other growth projects. 
For 2015, the earnings impact from these divestitures of $0.12, combined with an additional refueling outages at nuclear of $0.02 and increased pension and OPEB cost at ExGen of $0.02 are modestly offset by higher capacity prices of $0.07. The full year benefit of the elimination of the DoE fee at Exelon nuclear of $0.04 and by higher earnings at ComEd of $0.03. 
As you know, at EEI, we gave earnings projections for Exelon's 3 utilities through 2017. Since that time, we have adjusted the midpoint of that guidance down by a total of $0.05 per share due to the impacts of treasury yields at ComEd and bonus depreciation's impact on EPS. We still expect a healthy 5% to 6% CAGR on utility earnings for 2014 to 2017, and the cash benefits from bonus depreciation will help accelerate and fund utility investments. 
For reference and deeper analysis, more detail on the year-over-year drivers by operating company can be found in the appendix on Slides 19 through 22. 
As Chris mentioned, our capital investment plan is significant and positions us to grow earnings over time. Over the next 5 years, we're investing $16 billion in capital at our existing utilities and plan for more than $6 billion of investments at the Pepco utilities. We believe these investments are prudent and will improve reliability and our customers experience. 
As you know, the Pepco transaction is expected to add $0.15 to $0.20 per share of earnings on a steady state basis in 2017 and beyond. In addition to growing earnings, the Pepco acquisition shifts our earnings mix to a substantially more regulated waiting with 61% to 67% of earnings coming from the regulated side in the 2016 through 2017 period. 
On the ExGen front, our focus is deploying capital for growth that achieves attractive financial returns and generates both earnings and cash flow. 
The divestments stand energy value chain and include conventional generation like our Texas CCGTs and the new build peaker in New England that clear the most recent capacity auction and investments in our distributed energy platform. 
Above and beyond our existing plan, we see additional opportunities and have the free cash flows to deploy capital to earn attractive incremental returns on both the regulated and merchant sides of our business. 
Starting in 2016, we expect to have up to $1 billion in incremental annual capacity we can deploy to invest in our utilities, merchant growth and other opportunities. 
At the utilities, we are evaluating the potential to increase our investments in utility infrastructure, including great resiliency and security, strong harmony and new smart grid-enabled technologies. 
Of course, our capital investment in utility has to be prudent and help meet the evolving expectations of our customers. These investments will benefit customers by improving reliability and system performance and allow them to better understand and manage their energy usage and costs. 
At ExGen, capital deployment across the business will be driven by the ability to earn robust financial returns. 
Slide 4 shows our 2015 O&M forecast relative to 2014. We project O&M for 2015 to be $7.225 billion, an increase of $275 million over 2014. The increase at ComEd and BGE is due to inflation and increased budgeting for start-up costs, which results in incremental year-over-year O&M growth. ExGen's increase is related to a combination of factors: The inclusion of 3 months of CCE and O&M relative to 2014 and additional planned nuclear outage compared to 2014, increased pension costs and projects at escalation and generation, including Integrys and growth in our distributed energy business. 
Overall, we expect a basically flat O&M CAGR over the 2015 to 2017 period. We remain disciplined even as we sit to grow our business. 
Since our presentation at EEI, we have increased our CapEx projections for 2015 across the company by approximately $325 million. The increase is primarily at ExGen and reflects investments to build contracted generation, including an 80 megawatts wind facility in Texas and up to 50 megawatts biomass plant in Georgia, which we announced yesterday. 
Additionally, we have increased 2015 budgeted CapEx for our Texas CCGTs, advancing the timing of the capital spend. The total cost of the project has not changed. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Joe Nigro for a discussion of markets and our hedged disclosures."

The Constellation business continues to perform at high level. We finished 2014 strong and are seeing solid results so far in 2015 as a result of our generation to load matching strategy and our ability to use multiple channels to market. 
My comments today will address market events during the fourth quarter and what they mean for our commercial business going forward including our hedging strategy, the New England ISO capacity market results and our updated hedged disclosures. 
During the fourth quarter, we experienced the decline in prices across the energy complex as oil and natural gas both realized deep losses in the spot market. Power prices fall gas lower in the second half of the quarter as expectations of extreme weather subsided. The primary driver weighing on prices was the contraction of winter premiums as the markets focus moved away from last year's polar vortex and onto higher natural gas productions in storage estimates. 
NiHub and West Hub around-the-clock prices were down $1.50 to $3 for calendar years 2016 and '17 from the end of the third quarter to the end of the fourth quarter. 
In response, we have positioned the portfolio to better align with our fundamental view that we expect to see seasonal our price upside, primarily at NiHub and begin to build a long position into the forward years. This is similar to having positioned the portfolio in the last few years when our fundamental view showed power market upside. 
When the market is volatile, our generation to load strategy allows us to optimize the portfolio to lock in additional value. 
During the year, we aggressively pursued load following sales when we observed appropriate risk premiums in increasing margins. 
We are very highly hedged in 2015 and not impacted from the large downturn in near-term power prices. In fact, we were very aggressive in heading our PJM East and New England portfolios early in the fourth quarter when higher risk premiums were priced into the markets. 
The remaining length in 2015 is mostly in our Midwest position and focus in the months and time markets where we believe the forward market is still undervalued. 
As I mentioned, we began to build the low position in the forward years because we've seen upside in our view versus market. 
During the fourth quarter, we've dropped further behind our ratable plant and added approximately 5% to our hedged percentages for 2016 and '17 versus a normal quarter of 8% sales. The majority of our behind rate commission remains in the Midwest, where we continue to see upside in power prices driven by coal retirements. 
Not only did we achieved our deviation ratable during the quarter, but also adjusted our seasonal hedging strategies, holding length and undervalued month. We will continue to hold the loan position based on our market view. 
Last year at this time, we talked about hedging with natural gases to take advantage of our bullish view on rates. Those views have materialized over the past 12 months, and we have shifted our hedging strategy out of these cross commodity hedges in order to lock in the higher market rates. In January of last year, natural gas sales represented over 10% of our hedges.  Currently, they are less than 2% in any given year. 
Going forward, our hedging strategies and positions would continue to reflect where we see upside versus current market prices, both from our view of the heat rate expansion and natural gas price increases. 
We've got a lot of questions recently an oil markets, and I'd like to spend a minute on what the sharp decline in pricing means for our business. We are not materially impacted by oil pricing mostly due to the fact that our gross margin is primarily driven by a large baseline position. However, we do experienced some minor impacts, including the potential for lower peak power pricing during heavy load conditions, the potential for lower load growth in ERCOT and lower pricing in our upstream business. 
The current pressure on oil prices is more pronounced in the near-term delivery periods as longer-term prices in the $65 to $70 per barrel range still reflect global demand growth. 
Before I turn to our gross margin update, I want to provide an update on the recent capacity auction in New England. On February 4, New England released the results of its 9 forward capacity auction for the planning year 2018, '19. 
The current price indicate that the new pay-for-performance capacity concept works and will attract development of new resources needed in the region. This includes our recently announced 195 megawatts of dual fuel peaking facility at our existing West site, which we expect to have online by the summer of 2018. 
Turning to Slide 6, I'll review our updated hedged disclosure and the changes since the end of the third quarter. 
In 2015, total gross margin is unchanged. The impact of the divestiture of Keystone and Conemaugh was offset by the acquisition of Integrys and the expectation of favorable portfolio performance. 
We executed on $100 million of power new business and $50 million of nonpower new business during the quarter. 
Based on 2015 performance to date and expectations for the full year, we have increased our power new business targets by an additional $50 million. 
For 2016, '17, total gross margin decreased by $200 million and $250 million, respectively, largely driven by the impact of lower market prices on our open position. 
The divestiture of Keystone and Conemaugh was offset by the addition of Integrys in these years.  We also executed on $50 million of both power and nonpower new business in 2016. 
Overall, the commercial business is performing extremely well across all of our business lines. We will continue to implement hedging strategies that reflect our fundamental view of increases in both power and natural gas markets and optimize our portfolio. 
Now I'll turn it over to Bill."

As Chris referenced in his opening statements, there are a number of developments playing out in the policy front that affect our customers and our businesses. These issues are not necessarily earnings impactful in 2015, but they may have a material impact on the company beyond this year, and so we're going to spend a few minutes this morning sharing with you our perspectives on the issues. 
I'll start with 3 issues affecting the Generation business in policy space. First on the capacity market reform front that Chris referenced.  We've been involved in PJM stakeholder process to develop a proposal that will harden the power supply system to help it withstand extreme weather events and ensure reliability for customers. We believe the proposal that now sits before FERC is constructive and if approved, will address the gas and system reliability. 
The proposal has many similarities to the pay-for-performance market design, which FERC approved in New England a couple of years ago. It's a ""no"" excuses approach that provides a fair compensation to reliable assets that do perform and penalizes suppliers that do not. 
We think this is a win-win for our customers and for our Generation business. We have invested billions of dollars in our fleet over the year to make it the most reliable set generating assets in the country, and we think that the fleet will fare well in a pay-for-performance system. 
All total, we view developments on the capacity reform front as decidedly positive, and we're expecting a ruling from FERC by April 1. 
Second, let me talk briefly about the discussions that are ongoing in Illinois. As Chris referenced and as you all have seen by now, the State of Illinois report a potential nuclear power plant closings was issued earlier this year in response to the House Resolution 1146. 
As stated in that report, the right energy policy for Illinois should guarantee reliability and improve the environment for creating and retaining jobs, growing the local economy and minimizing cost. It is difficult to envision such a policy without nuclear as a critical part of the energy mix. 
The report offers an independent assessment of the substantial economic environmental and reliability benefits that Illinois' 6 nuclear plants bring to the state and lays out 5 options to address the current situation. Establishment of a cat and trade program in position of a carbon tax; adoption of a low carbon portfolio standard; adoption of a sustainable planning standard or reliance on market and external initiatives to make the corrections. 
We're supportive of any of the options that reward all carbon free resources equally, but doing nothing is simply is not a viable economic option that we are to maintain the operations of those plants that are at risk. 
As we've stated repeatedly, we do not seek a bailout. This is about addressing market flaws to properly value resources that are great importance to the State of Illinois. The state has an opportunity to implement data change and we will who work with policymakers and stakeholders during the coming months to come to an appropriate conclusion soon. 
Third, on the Generation front, a brief discussion of the environmental policy. As you know, the EPA's Clean Power draft is issued last year. While it is well attention, it fell short in our view of addressing the importance of nuclear to achieving our national environmental goals. We continue to work on improving the plan. 
Notwithstanding the shortcomings of the initial proposal, however, we view the environmental discussion is progressing in the right direction. 
Furthermore, the EPA debate and the states' road map to implementing the plan are in inextricably length to the discussion around the clear energy in Illinois that I just referenced. As any solution must contemplate the state's ability to comply and to do so cost-effectively without the clean attributes of nuclear, that will be impossible. 
The final ruling on the EPA's plan has been pushed back to later this summer. Like many, we want clarity on the issue, however, we would rather the time be taken for the agency to get it right and design a rational emissions reduction policy for the country than to rush it through. We are confident that the EPA will issue a final rule that appropriately values our assets. 
The question that arises from all of these pieces is how do they fit together and will the resolution of these 3 policy issues translate to market base compensation sufficient to maintain the economic viability of our challenged assets. That is what we'll play out over the next few months or longer. 
In the aggregate and individually, we view this potential policy changes as a positive driver for the Exelon fleet. If the PJM reforms are adopted, this should benefit all of our PJM nuclear assets. However, we have been clear that there is no silver bullet. Each plant has to stand on its own economic merits, and it is unlikely that the PJM reforms in isolation will ensure the survival of each plant. 
One clear example of this is Quentin, which is not in PJM and therefore, will not be properly valued as a result of the PJM capacity market reforms. 
These plants need to be fairly recognize for both their unparalleled reliability effort and their 0 carbon activists. Short of that recognition is insufficient and that is why we have been working diligently and simultaneously on all the fronts I have referenced. 
The fact is, there is no other technology that produces reliable, 0 carbon electricity. All of the alternatives are intermittent and far more expensive than keeping these plants in operation. Our customers will pay more if these assets are retired prematurely and need to be replaced. 
We think policymakers get this and also understand what it means to lose these plants in terms of jobs and cost. We are optimistic that they will take the steps needed to ensure fair treatment of the units because it is clearly in the customers and the state's interest to keep these plants open. 
Finally, on the regulatory front, let me turn to a non-Generation matter, which is of course the Pepco transaction, which we announced last year. 
Getting the merger with Pepco across the finish line is, of course, a very high priority for the company and things are progressing according to plan. We continue to anticipate a closing sometime in the second or third quarter of this year. 
We are pleased to have received approval from New Jersey earlier this week. And as you know, we have already received approvals from FERC and the State of Virginia. 
In Delaware, as noted in the letter to the Commission that you have seen, we are close to a settlement and if the settlement is reached, there may be adjustments in the schedule. We are continuing the process to review the remaining jurisdictions of Maryland and Washington, D.C. 
We believe the merger is in the public interest, and we expect that the combined company will bring significant value to customers given our top-tier operational performance and the merger commitments we have made. We look forward to completing the regulatory process and closing the transaction on schedule. 
Thank you. And now we will open up the floor for questions."

Specifically, at ExGen as we get out into '17, is that growth rate sort of pro rate across all the businesses as ExGen's O&M roughly static? Because I know you're adding assets to the mix in '17, and I'm wondering whether there's significant increase in O&M associated with that or whether the totality of the O&M is still on the growing conclusive of those new asset additions?"

We're looking for intimate opportunities in that space. We're offsetting that in part with activities that we're pursuing broadly across the company to drive lower operating cost, both within the embedded businesses, so Constellation, the Power Generation business, the Nuclear business, as well as our Business Services Corporation. So on a kind of blended basis, we see relatively flat O&M further out the curve obviously, wage inflation is a component of that, interest rates have been a meaningful factor that in driving pension costs and the growth in the liability side of the higher. So as CPI oscillates as interest rates move, that will continue to be candidly something a little bit outside our control but obvious is something we try to focus on other things to offset."

As an example in 2014, the average 30-year was 3.34%. The interest rate for 30 years today is 2.63%. So just with even within an average basis the full year, the continued decline of interest rates and our sensitivity to that through the formula rates at ComEd has been significant. For sensitivity, say, 25 basis points upper down in interest rates is $9 million improvement or detriment to our expected revenues at ComEd. Obviously, the same element is impacting us from a pension liability side, marry that with the change in the mortality tables and longer expected lives of our pension and OPEB participants and that is a headwind. And that's a headwind that we pass through, through the formula rate within ComEd, but we have to go through rate cases at PECO, and we have to go through the rate cases at BGE to sort of recapture that. And then I guess, the final element that changed I think is given our load sensitivity at PECO and given some of our market term load sensitivity at BGE and ComEd, thus, as we've continued to experience 0 and some negative load growth, that's been a headwind as well. That said, we continue to see meaningful opportunities to deploy capital on that space. We see an opportunity to drive our customers reliability and experience. And importantly, we see opportunities to earn a fair rate of return in those businesses.

And that would be true, for example, both that West and the NiHub. You can see in the quarter that we sold less than our ratable plan, approximately 5% of our portfolio, total portfolio whereas in an average quarter, we would sell about 8% and we rotated out a lot of the gas shortage that we have because of the big heat rate we have. So as we move forward as we build a position that falls behind ratable, it's going to be done more on -- I'll call it a flat price basis where we're just going to take the power that we would have normally sold and just hold it in our portfolio and will tailor that 2 locations in time buckets.

The utility business, as we talked about, we can operate utilities well, we can drive efficiencies and we can improve the customer experience while we're getting returns. We're in a unique situation with ComEd on the formula rate that's in historically low interest rates. We're not running from the investment of the utility business. We think interest rates will normalize, and it will be at the right place for the returns. So we'll continue to make prudent investments and operate the utilities well there. On the merchant side, it's all about the value proposition and looking at the specific investments. If a nuclear plant came available, and we could folded into the portfolio and see our active returns, we would surely have the scale and the scope to put one end. We don't see any out there right now, but the new build is not an option so that's the only way we will get is an acquisition. As we've said before, we do think Texas is one of the more interesting markets to invest in right now, and that's why we're proceeding with organic growth down there. We do look out assets that come up from time to time. And you've heard top market most of them overvalued from our perspective and a long-term fundamentals. That's why building these new technology units makes more sense to us. So we'll continue to look for opportunities on both sides of the business and use the balance sheet prudently to make the investments. But one thing that in the last couple of years as we did our asset valuations on an annual basis, recycling capital has become a focus, and we'll continue to watch that if we see assets that others have more value on, and we can deploy that capital into other arenas, we will not be shy of any divestiture. And that's what we did this year with the vesting assets and having the opportunity to use that capital into what we think is something that will be strategically valuable for us with Pepco and also having creating the balance sheet space to make the investments in new units. So we're still very confident in the model and confident in the investment thesis. And low interest rates are hard on pensions and their hard on the formula rate, but in the long run, we see those coming back, and we still think it's a good investment pieces."

We had another strong year of operations in 2014, which we're very pleased with given the challenging weather conditions at the start of the year. 
At the utilities, each OpCo achieved top decile performance for safety and top quartile performance for outage frequency and duration. The nuclear fleet ended the year at 94.2% capacity factor which -- this marks our 15th year in a row being over 92%. Gas and hydro power dispatch match was at 97% and our renewable energy capture was at 95%. 
On the financial side, we delivered $2.39 a share, in line with our recent year -- full year guidance. Exelon Generation delivered a strong year for performance in what was a volatile year. And our generation to load matching strategy drove strong results during an unexpected mild summer. The utilities performed well in light of severe storms and continuing challenging interest rate environment. 
2014 was an active year for us, and in addition to selling several assets, we continue the process of recycling capital and strengthening our balance sheet. I'll highlight some of our major investments for the year. 
We grew across the enterprise. From the utility growth perspective, we announced the PHI merger and continued on with our infrastructure upgrade plan, spending $3.1 billion of utility investments. 
On the merchant side, we announced a state-of-the-art CCGT new build in ERCOT, and we added 215 megawatts in nuclear, wind and solar capacity during the year. 
At Constellation, on the retail side, we completed the acquisition of Integrys retail and ProLiance. 
We also made investments in adjacent markets and emerging technology to continue to prepare for an evolving marketplace. Bloom Energy and our microgrid investments are good examples of that. 
We also had a number of major regulatory developments in 2014 that affect both the utilities and the generating business. 
On the generating side, we've seen progress in Illinois nuclear discussions with 4 reports released last month which highlight the reliability, the economic and the environmental benefits of the nuclear plants to the state. 
PJM Capacity Performance Proposal has been submitted to FERC. We strongly support the steps being taken to ensure reliability in the region. We expect continuing discussion on the EPA's Clean Power Plan over the next several months. 
On the utility front, we had 2 positive outcomes for ComEd and BGE rate cases. ComEd received 95% or more from -- are asked on the last 3 consecutive rate cases and BGE achieved its first settlement since 1999. These outcomes highlight our continued commitment to the customers we serve. Bill is going to go into greater detail on the advocacy issues towards the end of the call. 
These policy initiatives on the horizon present a potential material upside to earnings as value of our fleet is more appropriately recognized by the market. However, I do want to underscore that the management team is focused on EPS growth and our capital deployment efforts. We invest in prudent growth of the utilities where we can add value for our customers; and within our merchant business, we look for opportunities to earn robust financial returns. Our recent announcement -- announced peaker in New England is a great example of that. 
Our continued investments in both the utilities and the generation business demonstrate our commitment to long-term growth initiatives across the enterprise that will bring value to our customers and drive future earnings. 
Now let me turn it over to Jack to discuss our financial expectations for 2015."
296181,282851003,762888,"Exelon Corporation, Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 13, 2015",2015-02-13,"Earnings Calls","Exelon Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. We provided information on our fourth quarter financial results in the appendix of today's materials on Slide 17 and 18. I'll spend my time this morning on 2015 earnings guidance and our O&M forecasts. Turni",909,"Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. We provided information on our fourth quarter financial results in the appendix of today's materials on Slide 17 and 18. I'll spend my time this morning on 2015 earnings guidance and our O&M forecasts. 
Turning to Slide 3. We expect to deliver adjusted operating earnings in the $2.25 to $2.55 range, which is the same as our 2014 guidance; and earnings of $0.60 to $0.70 per share for the first quarter. Our guidance does not include the earnings from the Pepco Holdings acquisition, but does reflect all asset divestitures to-date. 
As you know, we sold several assets last year, the proceeds of which are being used to partially finance the PHI acquisition and to recycle capital on the merchant side of our business. The lost contributions from these divestitures result in an earnings impact of $0.12 per share relative to last year. 
In future years, there's minimal earnings impact, in particular, as the capacity revenue from Keystone and Conemaugh runs off. 
The modest lost earnings from the divested plants will be meaningfully offset by the accretion from our Pepco merger and earnings from other growth projects. 
For 2015, the earnings impact from these divestitures of $0.12, combined with an additional refueling outage at nuclear of $0.02 and increased pension and OPEB costs at ExGen of $0.02 are modestly offset by higher capacity prices of $0.07. The full year benefit of the elimination of the DOE fee at Exelon nuclear of $0.04 and by higher earnings at ComEd of $0.03. 
As you know, at EEI, we gave earnings projections for Exelon's 3 utilities through 2017. Since that time, we have adjusted the midpoint of that guidance down by a total of $0.05 per share due to the impacts of treasury yields at ComEd and bonus depreciation's impact on EPS. We still expect a healthy 5% to 6% CAGR on utility earnings from 2014 to 2017, and the cash benefits from bonus depreciation will help accelerate and fund utility investments. 
For reference and deeper analysis, more detail on the year-over-year drivers by operating company can be found in the Appendix on Slides 19 through 22. 
As Chris mentioned, our capital investment plan is significant and positions us to grow earnings over time. Over the next 5 years, we're investing $16 billion in capital at our existing utilities and plan for more than $6 billion of investments at the Pepco utilities. We believe these investments are prudent and will improve reliability and our customers' experience. 
As you know, the Pepco transaction is expected to add $0.15 to $0.20 per share of earnings on a steady-state basis in 2017 and beyond. In addition to growing earnings, the Pepco acquisition shifts our earnings mix to a substantially more regulated weighting, with 61% to 67% of earnings coming from the regulated side in the 2016 through 2017 period. 
On the ExGen front, our focus is deploying capital for growth that achieves attractive financial returns and generates both earnings and cash flow. 
These investments span the energy value chain and include conventional generation like our Texas CCGTs and a new build peaker in New England that cleared the most recent capacity auction and investments in our distributed energy platform. 
Above and beyond our existing plan, we see additional opportunities and have the free cash flows to deploy capital to earn attractive incremental returns on both the regulated and merchant sides of our business. 
Starting in 2016, we expect to have up to $1 billion in incremental annual capacity we can deploy to invest in our utilities, merchant growth and other opportunities. 
At the utilities, we are evaluating the potential to increase our investments in utility infrastructure, including greater resiliency and security, strong harmony and new smart grid-enabled technologies. 
Of course, our capital investment in utilities has to be prudent and help meet the evolving expectations of our customers. These investments will benefit customers by improving reliability and system performance and allow them to better understand and manage their energy usage and costs. 
At ExGen, capital deployment across the business will be driven by the ability to earn robust financial returns. 
Slide 4 shows our 2015 O&M forecast relative to 2014. We project O&M for 2015 to be $7.225 billion, an increase of $275 million over 2014. The increase at ComEd and BGE is due to inflation and increased budgeting for startup costs, which results in incremental year-over-year O&M growth. ExGen's increase is related to a combination of factors: the inclusion of 3 months of CENG O&M relative to 2014 and additional planned nuclear outage compared to 2014; increased pension costs and projects at Constellation and generation, including Integrys; and growth in our distributed energy business. 
Overall, we expect a basically flat O&M CAGR over the 2015 to 2017 period. We remain disciplined on cost even as we seek to grow our business. 
Since our presentation at EEI, we have increased our CapEx projections for 2015 across the company by approximately $325 million. The increase is primarily at ExGen and reflects investments to build contracted generation, including an 80-megawatt wind facility in Texas and up to 50-megawatt biomass plant in Georgia, which we announced yesterday. 
Additionally, we have increased 2015 budgeted CapEx for our Texas CCGTs, advancing the timing of the capital spend. The total cost of the project has not changed. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Joe Nigro for a discussion of markets and our hedge disclosures."

The Constellation business continues to perform at high levels. We finished 2014 strong and are seeing solid results so far in 2015 as a result of our generation to load matching strategy and our ability to use multiple channels to market. 
My comments today will address market events during the fourth quarter and what they mean for our commercial business going forward, including our hedging strategy, the New England ISO capacity market results and our updated hedge disclosures. 
During the fourth quarter, we experienced the decline in prices across the energy complex, as oil and natural gas both realized steep losses in the spot market. Power prices followed gas lower in the second half of the quarter as expectations of extreme weather subsided. The primary driver weighing on prices was the contraction of winter premiums as the markets focus moved away from last year's polar vortex and on to higher natural gas production's storage estimates. 
NiHub and West Hub around-the-clock prices were down $1.50 to $3 for calendar years 2016 and '17 from the end of the third quarter to the end of the fourth quarter. In response, we have positioned the portfolio to better align with our fundamental view that we expect to see seasonal power price upside, primarily at NiHub, and begin to build a long position into the forward years. This is similar to how we positioned the portfolio in the last few years when our fundamental view showed power market upside. When the market is volatile, our generation to load strategy allows us to optimize the portfolio to lock in additional value. 
During the year, we aggressively pursued load-following sales when we observed appropriate risk premiums and increasing margins. We are very highly hedged in 2015 and not impacted from the large downturn in near-term power prices. In fact, we were very aggressive in hedging our PJM East and New England portfolios early in the fourth quarter when higher risk premiums were priced into the markets. 
The remaining length in 2015 is mostly in our Midwest position and focus in the months and time buckets where we believe the forward market is still undervalued. As I mentioned, we began to build a long position in the forward years because we see upside in our view versus market. 
During the fourth quarter, we dropped further behind our ratable plant and added approximately 5% to our hedge percentages for 2016 and '17 versus a normal quarter of an 8% sales. The majority of our behind ratable position remains in the Midwest where we continue to see upside in power prices driven by coal retirements. 
Not only did we adjust our deviation to ratable during the quarter, but also adjusted our seasonal hedging strategies, holding length in undervalued months. We will continue to hold the long position based on our market views. 
Last year at this time, we talked about hedging the natural gas to take advantage of our bullish view on heat rates. Those views have materialized over the past 12 months, and we have shifted our hedging strategy out of these cross-commodity hedges in order to lock in the higher market-implied heat rates. 
In January of last year, natural gas sales represented over 10% of our hedges. Currently, they are less than 2% in any given year. 
Going forward, our hedging strategies and positions will continue to reflect where we see upside versus current market prices, both from our view of heat rate expansion and natural gas price increases. 
We've got a lot of questions recently on oil markets, and I'd like to spend a minute on what the sharp decline in pricing means for our business. We are not materially impacted by oil pricing, mostly due to the fact that our gross margin is primarily driven by a large-base swing [ph] position. However, we do experience some minor impacts, including the potential for lower peak power pricing during heavy load conditions, the potential for lower load growth in ERCOT and lower pricing in our upstream business. The current pressure on oil prices is more pronounced in the near-term delivery periods as longer-term prices in the $65 to $70 per barrel range still reflect global demand growth. 
Before I turn to our gross margin update, I want to provide an update on the recent capacity auction in New England. On February 4, ISO New England released the results of its Ninth Forward Capacity Auction for the planning year 2018, '19. The current price indicate that the new pay-for-performance capacity construct works and will attract development of new resources needed in the region. This includes our recently announced 195 megawatts of dual-fuel peaking facility at our existing West Medway site, which we expect to have online by the summer of 2018. 
Turning to Slide 6. I'll review our updated hedge disclosure and the changes since the end of the third quarter. 
In 2015, total gross margin is unchanged. The impact of the divestiture of Keystone and Conemaugh was offset by the acquisition of Integrys and the expectation of favorable portfolio performance. 
We executed on $100 million of power new business and $50 million of non-power new business during the quarter. Based on 2015 performance to-date and expectations for the full year, we have increased our power new business target by an additional $50 million. 
For 2016, '17, total gross margin decreased by $200 million and $250 million, respectively, largely driven by the impact of lower market prices on our open position. The divestiture of Keystone and Conemaugh was offset by the addition of Integrys in these years. We also executed on $50 million of both power and non-power new business in 2016. 
Overall, the commercial business is performing extremely well across all of our business lines. We will continue to implement hedging strategies that reflect our fundamental view of increases in both power and natural gas markets and optimize our portfolio. 
Now I'll turn it over to Bill."

As Chris referenced in his opening statements, there are a number of developments playing out on the policy front that affect our customers and our businesses. These issues are not necessarily earnings impactful in 2015, but they may have a material impact on the company beyond this year. And so we're going to spend a few minutes this morning sharing with you our perspectives on the issues. 
I'll start with 3 issues affecting the generation business in policy space, first on the capacity market reform front that Chris referenced. We've been involved in PJM stakeholder process to develop a proposal that will harden the power supply system to help it withstand extreme weather events and ensure reliability for customers. We believe the proposal that now sits before FERC is constructive, and if approved, will address the gas and system reliability. 
The proposal has many similarities to the pay-for-performance market design, which FERC approved in New England a couple of years ago. It's a no-excuses approach that provides fair compensation to reliable assets that do perform and penalizes suppliers that do not. We think this is a win-win for our customers and for our generation business. We have invested billions of dollars in our fleet over the years to make it the most reliable set of generating assets in the country, and we think that the fleet will fare well in a pay-for-performance system. All told, we view developments on the capacity reform front as decidedly positive, and we're expecting a ruling from FERC by April 1. 
Second, let me talk briefly about the discussions that are ongoing in Illinois. As Chris referenced, and as you all have seen by now, the State of Illinois report on potential nuclear power plant closings was issued earlier this year in response to the House Resolution 1146. 
As stated in that report, the right energy policy for Illinois should guarantee reliability and improve the environment while creating and retaining jobs, growing the local economy and minimizing costs. It is difficult to envision such a policy without nuclear as a critical part of the energy mix. 
The report offers an independent assessment of the substantial economic, environmental and reliability benefits that Illinois' 6 nuclear plants bring to the state and lays out 5 options to address the current situation: establishment of a cap-and-trade program in position of a carbon tax; adoption of a low carbon portfolio standard; adoption of a sustainable power planning standard; or reliance on market and external initiatives to make the corrections. 
We are supportive of any of the options that reward all carbon-free resources equally, but doing nothing simply is not a viable economic option if we are to maintain the operations of those plants that are at risk. 
As we've stated repeatedly, we do not seek a bailout. This is about addressing market flaws to properly value resources that are great importance to the State of Illinois. The state has an opportunity to implement needed change and we will work with policymakers and stakeholders during the coming months to come to an appropriate conclusion soon. 
Third, on the generation front, a brief discussion of the environmental policy. As you know, the EPA's clean power draft was issued last year. While it is well-intentioned, it fell short, in our view, of addressing the importance of nuclear to achieving our national environmental goals. We continue to work on improving the plan. 
Notwithstanding the shortcomings of the initial proposal, however, we view the environmental discussion as progressing in the right direction. 
Furthermore, the EPA debate and the state's road maps to implementing the plan are inextricably linked to the discussion around nuclear energy in Illinois that I just referenced. As any solution must contemplate the state's ability to comply and to do so cost-effectively without the clean attributes of nuclear, that will be impossible. 
The final ruling on the EPA's plan has been pushed back to later this summer. Like many, we want clarity on the issue, however, we would rather the time be taken for the agency to get this right and design a rational emissions reduction policy for the country than to rush it through. We are confident that the EPA will issue a final rule that appropriately values our assets. 
The question that arises from all of these pieces is how do they fit together and will the resolution of these 3 policy issues translate to market-based compensation sufficient to maintain the economic viability of our challenged assets. That is what we'll play out over the next few months or longer. 
In the aggregate, and individually, we view these potential policy changes as a positive driver for the Exelon fleet. If the PJM reforms are adopted, this should benefit all of our PJM nuclear assets. However, we have been clear that there is no silver bullet. Each plant has to stand on its own economic merits, and it is unlikely that the PJM reforms in isolation will ensure the survival of each plant. 
One clear example of this is Clinton which is not in PJM and therefore will not be properly valued as a result of the PJM capacity market reforms. These plants need to be fairly recognized for both their unparalleled reliability and for their 0 carbon attributes. Anything short of that recognition is insufficient, and that is why we have been working diligently and simultaneously on all the fronts I have referenced. 
The fact is, there is no other technology that produces reliable, 0 carbon electricity. All of the alternatives are intermittent and far more expensive than keeping these plants in operation. Our customers will pay more if these assets are retired prematurely and need to be replaced. 
We think policymakers get this and also understand what it means to lose these plants in terms of jobs and costs. We are optimistic that they will take the steps needed to ensure fair treatment of the units because it is clearly in the customers' and the state's interest to keep these plants open. 
Finally, on the regulatory front, let me turn to a non-generation matter, which is, of course, the Pepco transaction which we announced last year. 
Getting the merger with Pepco across the finish line is, of course, a very high priority for the company and things are progressing according to plan. We continue to anticipate a closing some time in the second or third quarter of this year. We are pleased to have received approval from New Jersey earlier this week. And as you know, we have already received approvals from FERC and the State of Virginia. 
In Delaware, as noted in the letter to the Commission that you have seen, we are close to a settlement. And if a settlement is reached, there may be an adjustment in the schedule. We are continuing the process to review -- of reviewing the remaining jurisdictions of Maryland and Washington, D.C. 
We believe the merger is in the public interest, and we expect that the combined company will bring significant value to customers given our top-tier operational performance and the merger commitments we have made. We look forward to completing the regulatory process and closing the transaction on schedule. 
Thank you. And now we will open up the floor for questions."

We're offsetting that in part with activities that we're pursuing broadly across the company to drive lower operating costs, both within the embedded businesses, so Constellation, the power generation business, the nuclear business, as well as our business services corporation. So on a kind of blended basis, we see relatively flat O&M further out the curve. Obviously, wage inflation is a component of that, interest rates have been a meaningful factor of that in driving pension costs and the growth in the liability side of that, higher.

As an example in 2014, the average 30-year was 3.34%. The interest rate for 30 years today is 2.63%. So just with -- even within on an average basis for full year, the continued decline of interest rates and our sensitivity to that through the formula rates at ComEd has been significant. For sensitivity, say, 25 basis points up or down in interest rates is $9 million improvement or detriment to our expected revenues at ComEd. Obviously, the same element is impacting us from a pension liability side, marry that with a change in the mortality tables and longer expected lives of our pension and OPEB participants, and that is a headwind. And that's a headwind that we pass through, through the formula rate within ComEd, but we have to go through rate cases at PECO, and we have to go through the rate cases at BGE to sort of recapture that. So -- and then, I guess, the final element that changed I think is, given our load sensitivity at PECO and given some of our longer-term load sensitivity at BGE and ComEd, as we've continued to experience 0, in some instances negative load growth, that's been a headwind as well. That said, we continue to see meaningful opportunities to deploy capital in that space. We see an opportunity to drive our customers' reliability and experience.

And that would be true, for example, both at West Hub and NiHub. You can see in the quarter that we sold less than our ratable plan, approximately 5% of our portfolio -- total portfolio, whereas in an average quarter, we would sell about 8%. And we rotated out a lot of the gas shortage that we had because of the big heat rate move we had. So as we move forward as we build a position that falls behind ratable, it's going to be done more on, I'll call it, a flat price basis where we're just going to take the power that we would have normally sold and just hold it in our portfolio and will tailor that to locations in time buckets.

And as you think about that decision point, you've obviously made a couple decisions over the past years, Pepco, namely. How are you thinking about positioning the company towards the merchant side of the business, specifically, as you think about: a, potentially expanding nuclear; and then, b, specifically expanding into Texas. Are either of those avenues palatable or desirable under a merchant expansion? And then, more broadly, is the merchant expansion desirable at this point in time?"

We can improve the customer experience and while we're getting returns. We're in a unique situation with ComEd on the formula rate at some historically low interest rates. We're not running from the investment utility business. We think interest rates will normalize, and it will be at the right place for the returns. So we'll continue to make prudent investments and operate the utilities well there. On the merchant side, it's all about the value proposition and looking at the specific investments. If a nuclear plant came available and we could fold it into the portfolio and see our actual [ph] returns, we would surely have the scale and the scope to put one in. We don't see any out there right now. But new build is not an option, so that's the only way we will get is acquisition. As we've said before, we do think Texas is one of the more interesting markets to invest in right now, and that's why we're proceeding with organic growth down there. We do look at assets that come up from time to time. In the ERCOT market, most of have been overvalued from our perspective in the long-term fundamentals. That's why building these new technology units makes more sense to us. So we'll continue to look for opportunities on both sides of the business and use the balance sheet prudently to make the investments. But one thing that -- in the last couple of years, as we did our asset valuations on an annual basis, recycling capital has become a focus, and we'll continue to watch that if we see assets that others have more value on, and we can deploy that capital into other arenas, we will not be shy of any divestiture. And that's what we did this year with divesting assets and having the opportunity to use that capital to -- into what we think is something that would be strategically valuable for us with Pepco and also having -- creating the balance sheet space to make the investments in new units. So we're still very confident in the model and confident in the investment thesis. And if low interest rates are hard on pensions and they're hard on the formula rate, but in the long run, we see those coming back, and we still think it's a good investment thesis."

We had another strong year of operations in 2014, which we're very pleased with given the challenging weather conditions at the start of the year. 
At the utilities, each OpCo achieved top decile performance for safety and top quartile performance for outage frequency and duration. The nuclear fleet ended the year at 94.2% capacity factor which, this marks our 15th year in a row being over 92%. Gas and hydro power dispatch match was at 97% and our renewable energy capture was at 95%. 
On the financial side, we delivered $2.39 a share, in line with our recent year -- full year guidance. Exelon Generation delivered a strong year for performance in what was a volatile year. And our generation to load matching strategy drove strong results during an unexpected mild summer. The utilities performed well in light of severe storms and continuing challenging interest rate environment. 
2014 was an active year for us, and in addition to selling several assets, we continue the process of recycling capital and strengthening our balance sheet. I'll highlight some of our major investments for the year. 
We grew across the enterprise. From the utility growth perspective, we announced the PHI merger and continued on with our infrastructure upgrade plan, spending $3.1 billion of utility investments. 
On the merchant side, we announced a state-of-the-art CCGT new build in ERCOT, and we added 215 megawatts in nuclear, wind and solar capacity during the year. 
At Constellation, on the retail side, we completed the acquisition of Integrys retail and ProLiance. 
We also made investments in adjacent markets and emerging technology to continue to prepare for an evolving marketplace. Bloom Energy and our microgrid investments are good examples of that. 
We also had a number of major regulatory developments in 2014 that affect both the utilities and the generating business. 
On the generating side, we've seen progress in Illinois nuclear discussions with 4 reports released last month which highlight the reliability, the economic and the environmental benefits of the nuclear plants to the state. 
PJM Capacity Performance Proposal has been submitted to FERC. We strongly support the steps being taken to ensure reliability in the region. We expect continuing discussion on the EPA's Clean Power Plan over the next several months. 
On the utility front, we had 2 positive outcomes for ComEd and BGE rate cases. ComEd received 95% or more from our ask on the last 3 consecutive rate cases and BGE achieved its first settlement since 1999. These outcomes highlight our continued commitment to the customers we serve. Bill is going to go into greater detail on the advocacy issues towards the end of the call. 
These policy initiatives on the horizon present a potential material upside to earnings as value of our fleet is more appropriately recognized by the market. However, I do want to underscore that the management team is focused on EPS growth and our capital deployment efforts. We invest in prudent growth of the utilities where we can add value for our customers; and within our merchant business, we look for opportunities to earn robust financial returns. Our recent announcement -- announced peaker in New England is a great example of that. 
Our continued investments in both the utilities and the generation business demonstrate our commitment to long-term growth initiatives across the enterprise that will bring value to our customers and drive future earnings. 
Now let me turn it over to Jack to discuss our financial expectations for 2015."
296181,282851003,763010,"Exelon Corporation, Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 13, 2015",2015-02-13,"Earnings Calls","Exelon Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. We provided information on our fourth quarter financial results in the appendix of today's materials on Slide 17 and 18. I'll spend my time this morning on 2015 earnings guidance and our O&M forecasts. Turni",910,"Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. We provided information on our fourth quarter financial results in the appendix of today's materials on Slide 17 and 18. I'll spend my time this morning on 2015 earnings guidance and our O&M forecasts. 
Turning to Slide 3. We expect to deliver adjusted operating earnings in the $2.25 to $2.55 range, which is the same as our 2014 guidance; and earnings of $0.60 to $0.70 per share for the first quarter. Our guidance does not include the earnings from the Pepco Holdings acquisition, but does reflect all asset divestitures to-date. 
As you know, we sold several assets last year, the proceeds of which are being used to partially finance the PHI acquisition and to recycle capital on the merchant side of our business. The lost contributions from these divestitures result in an earnings impact of $0.12 per share relative to last year. 
In future years, there's minimal earnings impact, in particular, as the capacity revenue from Keystone and Conemaugh runs off. 
The modest lost earnings from the divested plants will be meaningfully offset by the accretion from our Pepco merger and earnings from other growth projects. 
For 2015, the earnings impact from these divestitures of $0.12, combined with an additional refueling outage at nuclear of $0.02 and increased pension and OPEB costs at ExGen of $0.02 are modestly offset by higher capacity prices of $0.07. The full year benefit of the elimination of the DOE fee at Exelon nuclear of $0.04 and by higher earnings at ComEd of $0.03. 
As you know, at EEI, we gave earnings projections for Exelon's 3 utilities through 2017. Since that time, we have adjusted the midpoint of that guidance down by a total of $0.05 per share due to the impacts of treasury yields at ComEd and bonus depreciation's impact on EPS. We still expect a healthy 5% to 6% CAGR on utility earnings from 2014 to 2017, and the cash benefits from bonus depreciation will help accelerate and fund utility investments. 
For reference and deeper analysis, more detail on the year-over-year drivers by operating company can be found in the Appendix on Slides 19 through 22. 
As Chris mentioned, our capital investment plan is significant and positions us to grow earnings over time. Over the next 5 years, we're investing $16 billion in capital at our existing utilities and plan for more than $6 billion of investments at the Pepco utilities. We believe these investments are prudent and will improve reliability and our customers' experience. 
As you know, the Pepco transaction is expected to add $0.15 to $0.20 per share of earnings on a steady-state basis in 2017 and beyond. In addition to growing earnings, the Pepco acquisition shifts our earnings mix to a substantially more regulated weighting, with 61% to 67% of earnings coming from the regulated side in the 2016 through 2017 period. 
On the ExGen front, our focus is deploying capital for growth that achieves attractive financial returns and generates both earnings and cash flow. 
These investments span the energy value chain and include conventional generation like our Texas CCGTs and a new build peaker in New England that cleared the most recent capacity auction and investments in our distributed energy platform. 
Above and beyond our existing plan, we see additional opportunities and have the free cash flows to deploy capital to earn attractive incremental returns on both the regulated and merchant sides of our business. 
Starting in 2016, we expect to have up to $1 billion in incremental annual capacity we can deploy to invest in our utilities, merchant growth and other opportunities. 
At the utilities, we are evaluating the potential to increase our investments in utility infrastructure, including greater resiliency and security, storm harmony [ph] and new smart grid-enabled technologies. 
Of course, our capital investment in utilities has to be prudent and help meet the evolving expectations of our customers. These investments will benefit customers by improving reliability and system performance and allow them to better understand and manage their energy usage and costs. 
At ExGen, capital deployment across the business will be driven by the ability to earn robust financial returns. 
Slide 4 shows our 2015 O&M forecast relative to 2014. We project O&M for 2015 to be $7.225 billion, an increase of $275 million over 2014. The increase at ComEd and BGE is due to inflation and increased budgeting for storm costs, which results in incremental year-over-year O&M growth. ExGen's increase is related to a combination of factors: the inclusion of 3 months of CENG O&M relative to 2014 and additional planned nuclear outage compared to 2014; increased pension costs and projects at Constellation and generation, including Integrys; and growth in our distributed energy business. 
Overall, we expect a basically flat O&M CAGR over the 2015 to 2017 period. We remain disciplined on cost even as we seek to grow our business. 
Since our presentation at EEI, we have increased our CapEx projections for 2015 across the company by approximately $325 million. The increase is primarily at ExGen and reflects investments to build contracted generation, including an 80-megawatt wind facility in Texas and up to 50-megawatt biomass plant in Georgia, which we announced yesterday. 
Additionally, we have increased 2015 budgeted CapEx for our Texas CCGTs, advancing the timing of the capital spend. The total cost of the project has not changed. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Joe Nigro for a discussion of markets and our hedge disclosures."

The Constellation business continues to perform at high levels. We finished 2014 strong and are seeing solid results so far in 2015 as a result of our generation to load matching strategy and our ability to use multiple channels to market. 
My comments today will address market events during the fourth quarter and what they mean for our commercial business going forward, including our hedging strategy, the New England ISO capacity market results and our updated hedge disclosures. 
During the fourth quarter, we experienced the decline in prices across the energy complex, as oil and natural gas both realized steep losses in the spot market. Power prices followed gas lower in the second half of the quarter as expectations of extreme weather subsided. The primary driver weighing on prices was the contraction of winter premiums as the market's focus moved away from last year's polar vortex and on to higher natural gas production's storage estimates. 
NiHub and West Hub around-the-clock prices were down $1.50 to $3 for calendar years 2016 and '17 from the end of the third quarter to the end of the fourth quarter. In response, we have positioned the portfolio to better align with our fundamental view that we expect to see seasonal power price upside, primarily at NiHub, and begin to build a long position into the forward years. This is similar to how we positioned the portfolio in the last few years when our fundamental view showed power market upside. When the market is volatile, our generation to load strategy allows us to optimize the portfolio to lock in additional value. 
During the year, we aggressively pursued load-following sales when we observed appropriate risk premiums and increasing margins. We are very highly hedged in 2015 and not impacted from the large downturn in near-term power prices. In fact, we were very aggressive in hedging our PJM East and New England portfolios early in the fourth quarter when higher risk premiums were priced into the markets. 
The remaining length in 2015 is mostly in our Midwest position and focused in the months and time buckets where we believe the forward market is still undervalued. As I mentioned, we began to build a long position in the forward years because we see upside in our view versus market. 
During the fourth quarter, we dropped further behind our ratable plan and added approximately 5% to our hedge percentages for 2016 and '17 versus a normal quarter of an 8% sales. The majority of our behind ratable position remains in the Midwest where we continue to see upside in power prices driven by coal retirements. 
Not only did we adjust our deviation to ratable during the quarter, but also adjusted our seasonal hedging strategies, holding length in undervalued months. We will continue to hold the long position based on our market views. 
Last year at this time, we talked about hedging the natural gas to take advantage of our bullish view on heat rates. Those views have materialized over the past 12 months, and we have shifted our hedging strategy out of these cross-commodity hedges in order to lock in the higher market-implied heat rates. 
In January of last year, natural gas sales represented over 10% of our hedges. Currently, they are less than 2% in any given year. 
Going forward, our hedging strategies and positions will continue to reflect where we see upside versus current market prices, both from our view of heat rate expansion and natural gas price increases. 
We've got a lot of questions recently on oil markets, and I'd like to spend a minute on what the sharp decline in pricing means for our business. We are not materially impacted by oil pricing, mostly due to the fact that our gross margin is primarily driven by a large-base swing [ph] position. However, we do experience some minor impacts, including the potential for lower peak power pricing during heavy load conditions, the potential for lower load growth in ERCOT and lower pricing in our upstream business. The current pressure on oil prices is more pronounced in the near-term delivery periods as longer-term prices in the $65 to $70 per barrel range still reflect global demand growth. 
Before I turn to our gross margin update, I want to provide an update on the recent capacity auction in New England. On February 4, ISO New England released the results of its Ninth Forward Capacity Auction for the planning year 2018, '19. The current price indicate that the new pay-for-performance capacity construct works and will attract development of new resources needed in the region. This includes our recently announced 195 megawatts of dual-fuel peaking facility at our existing West Medway site, which we expect to have online by the summer of 2018. 
Turning to Slide 6. I'll review our updated hedge disclosure and the changes since the end of the third quarter. 
In 2015, total gross margin is unchanged. The impact of the divestiture of Keystone and Conemaugh was offset by the acquisition of Integrys and the expectation of favorable portfolio performance. 
We executed on $100 million of power new business and $50 million of non-power new business during the quarter. Based on 2015 performance to-date and expectations for the full year, we have increased our power new business target by an additional $50 million. 
For 2016, '17, total gross margin decreased by $200 million and $250 million, respectively, largely driven by the impact of lower market prices on our open position. The divestiture of Keystone and Conemaugh was offset by the addition of Integrys in these years. We also executed on $50 million of both power and non-power new business in 2016. 
Overall, the commercial business is performing extremely well across all of our business lines. We will continue to implement hedging strategies that reflect our fundamental view of increases in both power and natural gas markets and optimize our portfolio. 
Now I'll turn it over to Bill."

As Chris referenced in his opening statements, there are a number of developments playing out on the policy front that affect our customers and our businesses. These issues are not necessarily earnings impactful in 2015, but they may have a material impact on the company beyond this year. And so we're going to spend a few minutes this morning sharing with you our perspectives on the issues. 
I'll start with 3 issues affecting the generation business in policy space, first on the capacity market reform front that Chris referenced. We've been involved in PJM stakeholder process to develop a proposal that will harden the power supply system to help it withstand extreme weather events and ensure reliability for customers. We believe the proposal that now sits before FERC is constructive, and if approved, will address the gaps in system reliability. 
The proposal has many similarities to the pay-for-performance market design, which FERC approved in New England a couple of years ago. It's a no-excuses approach that provides fair compensation to reliable assets that do perform and penalizes suppliers that do not. We think this is a win-win for our customers and for our generation business. We have invested billions of dollars in our fleet over the years to make it the most reliable set of generating assets in the country, and we think that the fleet will fare well in a pay-for-performance system. All told, we view developments on the capacity reform front as decidedly positive, and we're expecting a ruling from FERC by April 1. 
Second, let me talk briefly about the discussions that are ongoing in Illinois. As Chris referenced, and as you all have seen by now, the State of Illinois report on potential nuclear power plant closings was issued earlier this year in response to the House Resolution 1146. 
As stated in that report, the right energy policy for Illinois should guarantee reliability and improve the environment while creating and retaining jobs, growing the local economy and minimizing cost. It is difficult to envision such a policy without nuclear as a critical part of the energy mix. 
The report offers an independent assessment of the substantial economic, environmental and reliability benefits that Illinois' 6 nuclear plants bring to the state and lays out 5 options to address the current situation: establishment of a cap-and-trade program in position of a carbon tax; adoption of a low carbon portfolio standard; adoption of a sustainable power planning standard; or reliance on market and external initiatives to make the corrections. 
We are supportive of any of the options that reward all carbon-free resources equally, but doing nothing simply is not a viable economic option if we are to maintain the operations of those plants that are at risk. 
As we've stated repeatedly, we do not seek a bailout. This is about addressing market flaws to properly value resources that are great importance to the State of Illinois. The state has an opportunity to implement needed change and we will work with policymakers and stakeholders during the coming months to come to an appropriate conclusion soon. 
Third, on the generation front, a brief discussion of the environmental policy. As you know, the EPA's clean power draft was issued last year. While it is well-intentioned, it fell short, in our view, of addressing the importance of nuclear to achieving our national environmental goals. We continue to work on improving the plan. 
Notwithstanding the shortcomings of the initial proposal, however, we view the environmental discussion as progressing in the right direction. 
Furthermore, the EPA debate and the state's road maps to implementing the plan are inextricably linked to the discussion around nuclear energy in Illinois that I just referenced, as any solution must contemplate the state's ability to comply and to do so cost-effectively without the clean attributes of nuclear, that will be impossible. 
The final ruling on the EPA's plan has been pushed back to later this summer. Like many, we want clarity on the issue, however, we would rather the time be taken for the agency to get this right and design a rational emissions reduction policy for the country than to rush it through. We are confident that the EPA will issue a final rule that appropriately values our assets. 
The question that arises from all of these pieces is how do they fit together and will the resolution of these 3 policy issues translate to market-based compensation sufficient to maintain the economic viability of our challenged assets. That is what will play out over the next few months or longer. 
In the aggregate, and individually, we view these potential policy changes as a positive driver for the Exelon fleet. If the PJM reforms are adopted, this should benefit all of our PJM nuclear assets. However, we have been clear that there is no silver bullet. Each plant has to stand on its own economic merits, and it is unlikely that the PJM reforms in isolation will ensure the survival of each plant. 
One clear example of this is Clinton which is not in PJM and therefore will not be properly valued as a result of the PJM capacity market reforms. These plants need to be fairly recognized for both their unparalleled reliability and for their 0 carbon attributes. Anything short of that recognition is insufficient, and that is why we have been working diligently and simultaneously on all the fronts I have referenced. 
The fact is, there is no other technology that produces reliable, 0 carbon electricity. All of the alternatives are intermittent and far more expensive than keeping these plants in operation. Our customers will pay more if these assets are retired prematurely and need to be replaced. 
We think policymakers get this and also understand what it means to lose these plants in terms of jobs and costs. We are optimistic that they will take the steps needed to ensure fair treatment of the units because it is clearly in the customers' and the state's interest to keep these plants open. 
Finally, on the regulatory front, let me turn to a non-generation matter, which is, of course, the Pepco transaction which we announced last year. 
Getting the merger with Pepco across the finish line is, of course, a very high priority for the company and things are progressing according to plan. We continue to anticipate a closing some time in the second or third quarter of this year. We are pleased to have received approval from New Jersey earlier this week. And as you know, we have already received approvals from FERC and the State of Virginia. 
In Delaware, as noted in the letter to the Commission that you have seen, we are close to a settlement. And if a settlement is reached, there may be an adjustment in the schedule. We are continuing the process to review -- of reviewing the remaining jurisdictions of Maryland and Washington, D.C. 
We believe the merger is in the public interest, and we expect that the combined company will bring significant value to customers, given our top-tier operational performance and the merger commitments we have made. We look forward to completing the regulatory process and closing the transaction on schedule. 
Thank you. And now we will open up the floor for questions."

We're offsetting that in part with activities that we're pursuing broadly across the company to drive lower operating costs, both within the embedded businesses, so Constellation, the power generation business, the nuclear business, as well as our business services corporation. So on a kind of blended basis, we see relatively flat O&M further out the curve. Obviously, wage inflation is a component of that, interest rates have been a meaningful factor of that in driving pension costs and the growth in the liability side of that, higher. So as CPI oscillates, as interest rates move, that'll continue to be, candidly, something and a little bit outside our control, but obviously something we're trying to focus on other things to offset."

So just with -- even within on an average basis for full year, the continued decline of interest rates and our sensitivity to that through the formula rates at ComEd has been significant. For sensitivity, say, 25 basis points up or down in interest rates is $9 million improvement or detriment to our expected revenues at ComEd. Obviously, the same element is impacting us from a pension liability side. Marry that with a change in the mortality tables and longer expected lives of our pension and OPEB participants, and that is a headwind. And that's a headwind that we pass through, through the formula rate within ComEd, but we have to go through rate cases at PECO, and we have to go through the rate cases at BGE to sort of recapture that. So -- and then, I guess, the final element that changed I think is, given our load sensitivity at PECO and given some of our longer-term load sensitivity at BGE and ComEd, as we've continued to experience 0, in some instances negative load growth, that's been a headwind as well.

I think you're correct when you think about the expansion opportunity of heat rates, I think that's primarily in NiHub. I think from our perspective, as well, we actually see upside to the natural gas market, especially -- maybe to a lesser extent in '16 and more so as you move out into '17 and '18 on the back of demand pickup and where prices are today. And that would be true, for example, both at West Hub and NiHub. You can see in the quarter that we sold less than our ratable plan, approximately 5% of our portfolio -- total portfolio, whereas in an average quarter, we would sell about 8%. And we rotated out a lot of the gas shortage that we had because of the big heat rate move we had. So as we move forward as we build a position that falls behind ratable, it's going to be done more on, I'll call it, a flat price basis where we're just going to take the power that we would have normally sold and just hold it in our portfolio and we'll tailor that to locations in time buckets. NiHub will be a big piece of that, but we'll be looking at other areas as well, depending on what we see in the gas market."

We can improve the customer experience and while we're getting returns. We're in a unique situation with ComEd on the formula rate at some historically low interest rates. We're not running from the investment in the utility business. We think interest rates will normalize, and it will be at the right place for the returns. So we'll continue to make prudent investments and operate the utilities well there. On the merchant side, it's all about the value proposition and looking at the specific investments. If a nuclear plant came available and we could fold it into the portfolio and see our actual [ph] returns, we would surely have the scale and the scope to put one in. We don't see any out there right now. But new build is not an option, so that's the only way we will get is acquisition. As we've said before, we do think Texas is one of the more interesting markets to invest in right now, and that's why we're proceeding with organic growth down there. We do look at assets that come up from time to time. In the ERCOT market, most of have been overvalued from our perspective in the long-term fundamentals. That's why building these new technology units makes more sense to us. So we'll continue to look for opportunities on both sides of the business and use the balance sheet prudently to make the investments. But one thing that we -- in the last couple of years, as we did our asset valuations on an annual basis, recycling capital has become a focus, and we'll continue to watch that if we see assets that others have more value on, and we can deploy that capital into other arenas, we will not be shy of any divestiture. And that's what we did this year with divesting assets and having the opportunity to use that capital to -- into what we think is something that would be strategically valuable for us with Pepco and also having -- creating the balance sheet space to make the investments in new units. So we're still very confident in the model and confident in the investment thesis. And if low interest rates are hard on pensions and they're hard on the formula rate, but in the long run, we see those coming back, and we still think it's a good investment thesis."

We had another strong year of operations in 2014, which we're very pleased with given the challenging weather conditions at the start of the year. 
At the utilities, each OpCo achieved top decile performance for safety and top quartile performance for outage frequency and duration. The nuclear fleet ended the year at 94.2% capacity factor which, this marks our 15th year in a row being over 92%. Gas and hydro power dispatch match was at 97% and our renewable energy capture was at 95%. 
On the financial side, we delivered $2.39 a share, in line with our recent year -- full year guidance. Exelon Generation delivered a strong year for performance in what was a volatile year. And our generation to load matching strategy drove strong results during an unexpected mild summer. The utilities performed well in light of severe storms and continuing challenging interest rate environment. 
2014 was an active year for us, and in addition to selling several assets, we continue the process of recycling capital and strengthening our balance sheet. I'll highlight some of our major investments for the year. 
We grew across the enterprise. From the utility growth perspective, we announced the PHI merger and continued on with our infrastructure upgrade plan, spending $3.1 billion of utility investments. 
On the merchant side, we announced a state-of-the-art CCGT new build in ERCOT, and we added 215 megawatts in nuclear, wind and solar capacity during the year. 
At Constellation, on the retail side, we completed the acquisition of Integrys retail and ProLiance. 
We also made investments in adjacent markets and emerging technology to continue to prepare for an evolving marketplace. Bloom Energy and our microgrid investments are good examples of that. 
We also had a number of major regulatory developments in 2014 that affect both the utilities and the generating business. 
On the generating side, we've seen progress in Illinois nuclear discussions with 4 reports released last month which highlight the reliability, the economic and the environmental benefits of the nuclear plants to the state. 
PJM Capacity Performance Proposal has been submitted to FERC. We strongly support the steps being taken to ensure reliability in the region. We expect continuing discussion on the EPA's Clean Power Plan over the next several months. 
On the utility front, we had 2 positive outcomes for ComEd and BGE rate cases. ComEd received 95% or more from our ask on the last 3 consecutive rate cases and BGE achieved its first settlement since 1999. These outcomes highlight our continued commitment to the customers we serve. Bill is going to go into greater detail on the advocacy issues towards the end of the call. 
These policy initiatives on the horizon present a potential material upside to earnings as value of our fleet is more appropriately recognized by the market. However, I do want to underscore that the management team is focused on EPS growth and our capital deployment efforts. We invest in prudent growth of the utilities where we can add value for our customers; and within our merchant business, we look for opportunities to earn robust financial returns. Our recent announcement -- announced peaker in New England is a great example of that. 
Our continued investments in both the utilities and the generation business demonstrate our commitment to long-term growth initiatives across the enterprise that will bring value to our customers and drive future earnings. 
Now let me turn it over to Jack to discuss our financial expectations for 2015."
296181,282851003,778994,"Exelon Corporation, Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 13, 2015",2015-02-13,"Earnings Calls","Exelon Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. We provided information on our fourth quarter financial results in the appendix of today's materials on Slide 17 and 18. I'll spend my time this morning on 2015 earnings guidance and our O&M forecasts. Turni",910,"Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. We provided information on our fourth quarter financial results in the appendix of today's materials on Slide 17 and 18. I'll spend my time this morning on 2015 earnings guidance and our O&M forecasts. 
Turning to Slide 3. We expect to deliver adjusted operating earnings in the $2.25 to $2.55 range, which is the same as our 2014 guidance; and earnings of $0.60 to $0.70 per share for the first quarter. Our guidance does not include the earnings from the Pepco Holdings acquisition, but does reflect all asset divestitures to-date. 
As you know, we sold several assets last year, the proceeds of which are being used to partially finance the PHI acquisition and to recycle capital on the merchant side of our business. The lost contributions from these divestitures result in an earnings impact of $0.12 per share relative to last year. 
In future years, there's minimal earnings impact, in particular, as the capacity revenue from Keystone and Conemaugh runs off. 
The modest lost earnings from the divested plants will be meaningfully offset by the accretion from our Pepco merger and earnings from other growth projects. 
For 2015, the earnings impact from these divestitures of $0.12, combined with an additional refueling outage at nuclear of $0.02 and increased pension and OPEB costs at ExGen of $0.02 are modestly offset by higher capacity prices of $0.07. The full year benefit of the elimination of the DOE fee at Exelon nuclear of $0.04 and by higher earnings at ComEd of $0.03. 
As you know, at EEI, we gave earnings projections for Exelon's 3 utilities through 2017. Since that time, we have adjusted the midpoint of that guidance down by a total of $0.05 per share due to the impacts of treasury yields at ComEd and bonus depreciation's impact on EPS. We still expect a healthy 5% to 6% CAGR on utility earnings from 2014 to 2017, and the cash benefits from bonus depreciation will help accelerate and fund utility investments. 
For reference and deeper analysis, more detail on the year-over-year drivers by operating company can be found in the Appendix on Slides 19 through 22. 
As Chris mentioned, our capital investment plan is significant and positions us to grow earnings over time. Over the next 5 years, we're investing $16 billion in capital at our existing utilities and plan for more than $6 billion of investments at the Pepco utilities. We believe these investments are prudent and will improve reliability and our customers' experience. 
As you know, the Pepco transaction is expected to add $0.15 to $0.20 per share of earnings on a steady-state basis in 2017 and beyond. In addition to growing earnings, the Pepco acquisition shifts our earnings mix to a substantially more regulated weighting, with 61% to 67% of earnings coming from the regulated side in the 2016 through 2017 period. 
On the ExGen front, our focus is deploying capital for growth that achieves attractive financial returns and generates both earnings and cash flow. 
These investments span the energy value chain and include conventional generation like our Texas CCGTs and a new build peaker in New England that cleared the most recent capacity auction and investments in our distributed energy platform. 
Above and beyond our existing plan, we see additional opportunities and have the free cash flows to deploy capital to earn attractive incremental returns on both the regulated and merchant sides of our business. 
Starting in 2016, we expect to have up to $1 billion in incremental annual capacity we can deploy to invest in our utilities, merchant growth and other opportunities. 
At the utilities, we are evaluating the potential to increase our investments in utility infrastructure, including grid resiliency and security, storm hardening and new smart grid-enabled technologies. 
Of course, our capital investment in utilities has to be prudent and help meet the evolving expectations of our customers. These investments will benefit customers by improving reliability and system performance and allow them to better understand and manage their energy usage and costs. 
At ExGen, capital deployment across the business will be driven by the ability to earn robust financial returns. 
Slide 4 shows our 2015 O&M forecast relative to 2014. We project O&M for 2015 to be $7.225 billion, an increase of $275 million over 2014. The increase at ComEd and BGE is due to inflation and increased budgeting for storm costs, which results in incremental year-over-year O&M growth. ExGen's increase is related to a combination of factors: the inclusion of 3 months of CENG O&M relative to 2014 and additional planned nuclear outage compared to 2014; increased pension costs and projects at Constellation and generation, including Integrys; and growth in our distributed energy business. 
Overall, we expect a basically flat O&M CAGR over the 2015 to 2017 period. We remain disciplined on cost even as we seek to grow our business. 
Since our presentation at EEI, we have increased our CapEx projections for 2015 across the company by approximately $325 million. The increase is primarily at ExGen and reflects investments to build contracted generation, including an 80-megawatt wind facility in Texas and an up to 50-megawatt biomass plant in Georgia, which we announced yesterday. 
Additionally, we have increased 2015 budgeted CapEx for our Texas CCGTs, advancing the timing of the capital spend. The total cost of the project has not changed. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Joe Nigro for a discussion of markets and our hedge disclosures."

The Constellation business continues to perform at high levels. We finished 2014 strong and are seeing solid results so far in 2015 as a result of our generation to load matching strategy and our ability to use multiple channels to market. 
My comments today will address market events during the fourth quarter and what they mean for our commercial business going forward, including our hedging strategy, the New England ISO capacity market results and our updated hedge disclosures. 
During the fourth quarter, we experienced the decline in prices across the energy complex, as oil and natural gas both realized steep losses in the spot market. Power prices followed gas lower in the second half of the quarter as expectations of extreme weather subsided. The primary driver weighing on prices was the contraction of winter premiums as the market's focus moved away from last year's polar vortex and on to higher natural gas production and storage estimates. 
NiHub and West Hub around-the-clock prices were down $1.50 to $3 for calendar years 2016 and '17 from the end of the third quarter to the end of the fourth quarter. In response, we have positioned the portfolio to better align with our fundamental view that we expect to see seasonal power price upside, primarily at NiHub, and begin to build a long position into the forward years. This is similar to how we positioned the portfolio in the last few years when our fundamental view showed power market upside. When the market is volatile, our generation to load strategy allows us to optimize the portfolio to lock in additional value. 
During the year, we aggressively pursued load-following sales when we observed appropriate risk premiums and increasing margins. We are very highly hedged in 2015 and not impacted from the large downturn in near-term power prices. In fact, we were very aggressive in hedging our PJM East and New England portfolios early in the fourth quarter when higher risk premiums were priced into the markets. 
The remaining length in 2015 is mostly in our Midwest position and focused in the months and time buckets where we believe the forward market is still undervalued. As I mentioned, we began to build a long position in the forward years because we see upside in our view versus market. 
During the fourth quarter, we dropped further behind our ratable plan and added approximately 5% to our hedge percentages for 2016 and '17 versus a normal quarter of an 8% sales. The majority of our behind ratable position remains in the Midwest where we continue to see upside in power prices driven by coal retirements. 
Not only did we adjust our deviation to ratable during the quarter, but also adjusted our seasonal hedging strategies, holding length in undervalued months. We will continue to hold the long position based on our market views. 
Last year at this time, we talked about hedging the natural gas to take advantage of our bullish view on heat rates. Those views have materialized over the past 12 months, and we have shifted our hedging strategy out of these cross-commodity hedges in order to lock in the higher market-implied heat rates. 
In January of last year, natural gas sales represented over 10% of our hedges. Currently, they are less than 2% in any given year. 
Going forward, our hedging strategies and positions will continue to reflect where we see upside versus current market prices, both from our view of heat rate expansion and natural gas price increases. 
We've got a lot of questions recently on oil markets, and I'd like to spend a minute on what the sharp decline in pricing means for our business. We are not materially impacted by oil pricing, mostly due to the fact that our gross margin is primarily driven by a large baseload position. However, we do experience some minor impacts, including the potential for lower peak power pricing during heavy load conditions, the potential for lower load growth in ERCOT and lower pricing in our upstream business. The current pressure on oil prices is more pronounced in the near-term delivery periods as longer-term prices in the $65 to $70 per barrel range still reflect global demand growth. 
Before I turn to our gross margin update, I want to provide an update on the recent capacity auction in New England. On February 4, ISO New England released the results of its Ninth Forward Capacity Auction for the planning year 2018, '19. The clearing price indicate that the new pay-for-performance capacity construct works and will attract development of new resources needed in the region. This includes our recently announced 195 megawatts of dual-fuel peaking facility at our existing West Medway site, which we expect to have online by the summer of 2018. 
Turning to Slide 6. I'll review our updated hedge disclosure and the changes since the end of the third quarter. 
In 2015, total gross margin is unchanged. The impact of the divestiture of Keystone and Conemaugh was offset by the acquisition of Integrys and the expectation of favorable portfolio performance. 
We executed on $100 million of power new business and $50 million of non-power new business during the quarter. Based on 2015 performance to-date and expectations for the full year, we have increased our power new business target by an additional $50 million. 
For 2016, '17, total gross margin decreased by $200 million and $250 million, respectively, largely driven by the impact of lower market prices on our open position. The divestiture of Keystone and Conemaugh was offset by the addition of Integrys in these years. We also executed on $50 million of both power and non-power new business in 2016. 
Overall, the commercial business is performing extremely well across all of our business lines. We will continue to implement hedging strategies that reflect our fundamental view of increases in both power and natural gas markets and optimize our portfolio. 
Now I'll turn it over to Bill."

As Chris referenced in his opening statements, there are a number of developments playing out on the policy front that affect our customers and our businesses. These issues are not necessarily earnings impactful in 2015, but they may have a material impact on the company beyond this year. And so we're going to spend a few minutes this morning sharing with you our perspectives on the issues. 
I'll start with 3 issues affecting the generation business in policy space, first on the capacity market reform front that Chris referenced. We've been involved in PJM stakeholder process to develop a proposal that will harden the power supply system to help it withstand extreme weather events and ensure reliability for customers. We believe the proposal that now sits before FERC is constructive, and if approved, will address the gaps in system reliability. 
The proposal has many similarities to the pay-for-performance market design, which FERC approved in New England a couple of years ago. It's a no-excuses approach that provides fair compensation to reliable assets that do perform and penalizes suppliers that do not. We think this is a win-win for our customers and for our generation business. We have invested billions of dollars in our fleet over the years to make it the most reliable set of generating assets in the country, and we think that the fleet will fare well in a pay-for-performance system. All told, we view developments on the capacity reform front as decidedly positive, and we're expecting a ruling from FERC by April 1. 
Second, let me talk briefly about the discussions that are ongoing in Illinois. As Chris referenced, and as you all have seen by now, the State of Illinois report on potential nuclear power plant closings was issued earlier this year in response to the House Resolution 1146. 
As stated in that report, the right energy policy for Illinois should guarantee reliability and improve the environment while creating and retaining jobs, growing the local economy and minimizing cost. It is difficult to envision such a policy without nuclear as a critical part of the energy mix. 
The report offers an independent assessment of the substantial economic, environmental and reliability benefits that Illinois' 6 nuclear plants bring to the state and lays out 5 options to address the current situation: establishment of a cap-and-trade program; imposition of a carbon tax; adoption of a low carbon portfolio standard; adoption of a sustainable power planning standard; or reliance on market and external initiatives to make the corrections. 
We are supportive of any of the options that reward all carbon-free resources equally, but doing nothing simply is not a viable economic option if we are to maintain the operations of those plants that are at risk. 
As we've stated repeatedly, we do not seek a bailout. This is about addressing market flaws to properly value resources that are great importance to the State of Illinois. The state has an opportunity to implement needed change and we will work with policymakers and stakeholders during the coming months to come to an appropriate conclusion soon. 
Third, on the generation front, a brief discussion of the environmental policy. As you know, the EPA's clean power draft was issued last year. While it is well-intentioned, it fell short, in our view, of addressing the importance of nuclear to achieving our national environmental goals. We continue to work on improving the plan. 
Notwithstanding the shortcomings of the initial proposal, however, we view the environmental discussion as progressing in the right direction. 
Furthermore, the EPA debate and the state's road maps to implementing the plan are inextricably linked to the discussion around nuclear energy in Illinois that I just referenced, as any solution must contemplate the state's ability to comply and to do so cost-effectively without the clean attributes of nuclear, that will be impossible. 
The final ruling on the EPA's plan has been pushed back to later this summer. Like many, we want clarity on the issue, however, we would rather the time be taken for the agency to get this right and design a rational emissions reduction policy for the country than to rush it through. We are confident that the EPA will issue a final rule that appropriately values our assets. 
The question that arises from all of these pieces is how do they fit together and will the resolution of these 3 policy issues translate to market-based compensation sufficient to maintain the economic viability of our challenged assets. That is what will play out over the next few months or longer. 
In the aggregate, and individually, we view these potential policy changes as a positive driver for the Exelon fleet. If the PJM reforms are adopted, this should benefit all of our PJM nuclear assets. However, we have been clear that there is no silver bullet. Each plant has to stand on its own economic merits, and it is unlikely that the PJM reforms in isolation will ensure the survival of each plant. 
One clear example of this is Clinton which is not in PJM and therefore will not be properly valued as a result of the PJM capacity market reforms. These plants need to be fairly recognized for both their unparalleled reliability and for their 0 carbon attributes. Anything short of that recognition is insufficient, and that is why we have been working diligently and simultaneously on all the fronts I have referenced. 
The fact is, there is no other technology that produces reliable, 0 carbon electricity. All of the alternatives are intermittent and far more expensive than keeping these plants in operation. Our customers will pay more if these assets are retired prematurely and need to be replaced. 
We think policymakers get this and also understand what it means to lose these plants in terms of jobs and costs. We are optimistic that they will take the steps needed to ensure fair treatment of the units because it is clearly in the customers' and the state's interest to keep these plants open. 
Finally, on the regulatory front, let me turn to a non-generation matter, which is, of course, the Pepco transaction which we announced last year. 
Getting the merger with Pepco across the finish line is, of course, a very high priority for the company and things are progressing according to plan. We continue to anticipate a closing some time in the second or third quarter of this year. We are pleased to have received approval from New Jersey earlier this week. And as you know, we have already received approvals from FERC and the State of Virginia. 
In Delaware, as noted in the letter to the Commission that you have seen, we are close to a settlement. And if a settlement is reached, there may be an adjustment in the schedule. We are continuing the process to review -- of reviewing the remaining jurisdictions of Maryland and Washington, D.C. 
We believe the merger is in the public interest, and we expect that the combined company will bring significant value to customers, given our top-tier operational performance and the merger commitments we have made. We look forward to completing the regulatory process and closing the transaction on schedule. 
Thank you. And now we will open up the floor for questions."

So as CPI oscillates, as interest rates move, that'll continue to be, candidly, something a little bit outside our control, but obviously something we're trying to focus on other things to offset."

As an example in 2014, the average 30-year was 3.34%. The interest rate for 30 years today is 2.63%. So just with -- even within on an average basis for full year, the continued decline of interest rates and our sensitivity to that through the formula rates at ComEd has been significant. For sensitivity, say, 25 basis points up or down in interest rates is $9 million improvement or detriment to our expected revenues at ComEd. Obviously, the same element is impacting us from a pension liability side. Marry that with a change in the mortality tables and longer expected lives of our pension and OPEB participants, and that is a headwind. And that's a headwind that we pass through, through the formula rate within ComEd, but we have to go through rate cases at PECO, and we have to go through the rate cases at BGE to sort of recapture that. So -- and then, I guess, the final element that changed I think is, given our load sensitivity at PECO and given some of our longer-term load sensitivity at BGE and ComEd, as we've continued to experience 0, in some instances negative load growth, that's been a headwind as well. That said, we continue to see meaningful opportunities to deploy capital in that space. We see an opportunity to drive our customers' reliability and experience. And importantly, we see opportunities to earn a fair rate of return in those businesses. And as we're delivering an evolving array of services to our customer, even perhaps improve upon what we are allowed to earn."

We didn't make a bet on massive load growth in Texas, we are very conservative on our assumptions. And the last thing I'll say, Dan, is we have a significant load business in Texas as well.

I think from our perspective, as well, we actually see upside to the natural gas market, especially -- maybe to a lesser extent in '16 and more so as you move out into '17 and '18 on the back of demand pickup from where prices are today. And that would be true, for example, both at West Hub and NiHub. You can see in the quarter that we sold less than our ratable plan, approximately 5% of our portfolio -- total portfolio, whereas in an average quarter, we would sell about 8%. And we rotated out a lot of the gas shortage that we had because of the big heat rate move we had. So as we move forward as we build a position that falls behind ratable, it's going to be done more on, I'll call it, a flat price basis where we're just going to take the power that we would have normally sold and just hold it in our portfolio and we'll tailor that to locations and time buckets. NiHub will be a big piece of that, but we'll be looking at other areas as well, depending on what we see in the gas market."

We can improve the customer experience and while we're getting returns. We're in a unique situation with ComEd on the formula rate at some historically low interest rates. We're not running from the investment in the utility business. We think interest rates will normalize, and it will be at the right place for the returns. So we'll continue to make prudent investments and operate the utilities well there. On the merchant side, it's all about the value proposition in looking at the specific investments. If a nuclear plant came available and we could fold it into the portfolio and see our adequate returns, we would surely have the scale and the scope to put one in. We don't see any out there right now. But new build is not an option, so that's the only way we will get it as an acquisition. As we've said before, we do think Texas is one of the more interesting markets to invest in right now, and that's why we're proceeding with organic growth down there. We do look at assets that come up from time to time. In the ERCOT market, most of have been overvalued from our perspective in the long-term fundamentals. That's why building these new technology units makes more sense to us. So we'll continue to look for opportunities on both sides of the business and use the balance sheet prudently to make the investments. But one thing that we -- in the last couple of years, as we did our asset valuations on an annual basis, recycling capital has become a focus, and we'll continue to watch that if we see assets that others have more value on, and we can deploy that capital into other arenas, we will not be shy of any divestiture. And that's what we did this year with divesting assets and having the opportunity to use that capital to -- into what we think is something that would be strategically valuable for us with Pepco and also having -- creating the balance sheet space to make the investments in new units. So we're still very confident in the model and confident in the investment thesis. And if low interest rates are hard on pensions and they're hard on the formula rate, but in the long run, we see those coming back, and we still think it's a good investment thesis."

Before I go into the prepared remarks, I want to first start by addressing the situation in Baltimore. 
As a company with a significant presence in Baltimore, we're monitoring the unrest with great concern. As you know, Maryland's governor, Larry Hogan, has declared a state of an emergency and Mayor Stephanie Rawlings Blake has declared a few wide curfew into next week. We join the rest of the business community in recognizing the issues that Baltimore is dealing with and needs to address, so this great city can heal itself and get back on to economic growth for all. 
Moving on to the quarter, I'm very pleased with our financial performance. We delivered earnings of $0.71 per share, surpassing our guidance range of $0.60 to $0.70, and Jack is going to describe our performance in greater detail. 
I would like to focus my remarks on our priorities in how we're strategically pursuing value for customers and shareholders. We continue to operate in a challenging market environment, particularly on the generation side of our business. But our gentle loan match strategy continues to create value, as seen in the first quarter hedge disclosure. 
Our advocacy efforts are focused on creating our channels to capture value for our communities and customers we serve in for our shareholders. I'll touch on those directly. 
In our regulated business, we are redefining the role of the utility of the future in part by making needed infrastructure investments to marginalize the grid. Over the next 5 years, our LRP has $16 billion of capital that will create approximately 6% CAGR with another potential $7 billion at PHI. 
Installing smart meter technology to enable customers to make informed choices about their energy consumption and promoting energy efficiency investments and innovation in resilient technologies at our utilities is a way that is progressive and equitable across all customer types.  You can see this reflected in the energy plan for Illinois' future build that we recently proposed through ComEd in Illinois. 
With these efforts, we are being improvements to the lives of the customers in a way that creates value for the company. 
Our Merchant business face challenges primarily due to policies and market design shortcomings that have failed to fairly value the benefits of nuclear. 
As a result, we focused our advocacy efforts on ensuring reliable environmental and economic benefits of nuclear power are not taken for granted and as these plants are operated on a level playing field. 
In Illinois, we are working with state legislatures and the Low Carbon Portfolio Standard that values each of these benefits. The bill unanimously was approved by the Center of Energy panel and the Public Utilities Committee and will now go to the Senate floor. We hope the same will happen in the house and that the bill will be approved within this legislative session. 
From a reliability perspective, we are pleased that FERC has created a waiver to allow the PJM to delay the capacity auction in order to further review PJM's CP proposal. 
It is clear from the transaction that FERC appreciates that the old drills are not sufficient to ensure reliability and the changes must be made. We look forward to a positive outcome. 
We continue to work through the process of finalizing the contract with RGNE for our [indiscernible] facility. 
As these events play out, we continue to do our best operating the plans and utilities at high levels of proficiency, hedging our generation output through strong portfolio management while we expand our footprint and our profits in retail power and gas operations. 
As you can see, we are doing things in both sides of our business, we're tapping into multiple channels to create upside and drive value for our customers and for our investors. This leads me to our proposed merger with PHI. 
As you know, we've obtained regulatory approval from FERC Virginia and New Jersey. We've reached a global settlement in Delaware that is pending a commission approval. That leaves Maryland and the District of Columbia. 
In Maryland, we've reached a partial settlement with several critical parties that has been presented -- we represented that settlement to the Maryland Public Service Commission and expect a decision from them on May 15. 
In the District, we completed our evidentiary hearings, and we're now filing briefs and the Commission will commence its deliberations. 
We have said from the beginning that this merger and the commitments we have made clearly demonstrate this merger in the public interest and should be approved by the regulatory commissions. 
While there is no guarantee that the Public Service Commission will approve the proposal and there's no guarantee they will not impose conditions that would frustrate the transaction, we believe that the settlement and commitments that we have made in the preceding are more than meet the statutory requirements for the merger approval and we look forward to orders approving the merger. We expect the merger to close late in the second quarter or in the third. 
In summary, we're creating value today, while actively pursuing public policy changes that recognize the benefits provided by our clean, reliable assets, and we're working on all those fronts. 
I'll now turn it over to Jack, who will cover the financial performance for the quarter."
296181,290568559,797175,"Exelon Corporation, Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2015",2015-04-29,"Earnings Calls","Exelon Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. We have a strong first quarter to start the year. My remarks will cover our financial results for the quarter, second quarter guidance range and update our hedge disclosures and cash outlook. I'll start on S",947,"Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. We have a strong first quarter to start the year. My remarks will cover our financial results for the quarter, second quarter guidance range and update our hedge disclosures and cash outlook. 
I'll start on Slide 4. Starting with our first quarter results on Slide 4. Exelon exceeded our guidance range and delivered earnings of $0.71 per share. 
At Exelon Generation, once again, we realized the benefits of our generation to load matching strategy. 
Quarter-after-quarter, this strategy is paying dividends in a broad array of market conditions. 
During the first quarter, despite experiencing lower power prices during the same period of 2014, we benefited from a lower cost to serve customers. 
We're realizing strong margins in our load business from contracts we executed last year after the polar vortex. 
In addition, our gas business performed above our expectations during the quarter due to favorable weather. 
While our nuclear plants performed better than they did at this time, last year, we did have some nuclear outages that negatively impacted our orderly earnings by approximately $0.04 relative to plan. 
That being said, we continue to push our plans to perform at our standard highest levels of performance. 
Our portfolio of management team performs strongly and was able to more than offset these losses. On balance, generation earned $0.35 per share during the quarter. 
Exelon's utilities delivered combined earnings of $0.39 per share, an $0.08 increase over the first quarter of last year. 
Although we did not see a repeat of the polar vortex of 2014 with sustained extreme cold and windshields, we fixed the very cold winter with heating degree days 14% to 19% above normal in ComEd's and PECO's service territories. 
In fact, it was colder in Philadelphia this winter than in the previous winter. 
Cold weather, a lack of severe storms and increased distribution rates at bfe drove utility results this quarter. More detail on quarter-over-quarter drivers of the utilities can be found in the appendix on Slide 16. 
For the second quarter, we are providing guidance of $0.45 per share to $0.55 per share. This compares with our realized earnings of $0.51 per share in the second quarter of 2014. We are reaffirming our full year guidance of $2.25 to $2.55 per share. 
Since our last call, both PECO and ComEd have filed rate cases this year. On March 27, PECO filed an electric distribution rate case with the Pennsylvania public utility commission, requesting a $190 million revenue increase and a 10.95% return on equity. This is PECO's first rate case filing since 2010 and the first time filing based on a fully projected future test year. 
In addition, if the PAPUC approves the new system 2020 plan, an additional $275 million will be spent during the next 5 years to install advanced equipment and reinforce the local electric system, making it more weather resistant unless vulnerable to storm damage. 
We expect the PAPUC to rule by the end of the year on the rate case at system 2020 plan with new rates going into effect in January 2016. 
On April 15, ComEd filed the general formula rate filing with the Illinois Commerce Commission. ComEd requested a revenue decrease of $50 million. This reduction is a result of a continued focus on cost management and operational efficiencies that are being realized from a stronger more reliable fewer outages. 
EIMA and the Smart Grid investments are working. 
Since 2012, there have been more than 3.3 million avoided customer interruptions, including 1.2 million in 2014 due largely to increased investments in distribution automation or digital smart switches that automatically route power around problem areas.  Outage avoidance has saved customers an estimated $175 million. More detail on each of these rate cases can be found in the appendix on Slides 20 through 22. 
I will now turn to our first quarter gross margin update on Slide 5. During the quarter, we saw a drop in natural gas prices while power prices were steady and heat rates expanded further. The market is finally incorporating the change in the generation stock due to cold retirements, as evidenced by the heat rates seen today. Approximately 10 gigawatts of coal plants at PJM have and will retire this year with the majority of the retirements occurring in April and May. 
We hedged closed to a ratable amount during the quarter in both the mid-Atlantic and Midwest regions. At the end of the quarter for 2016 and 2017, we remain considerably behind ratable in the Midwest where we continue to see upside. 
Total gross margin is unchanged or relatively unchanged across 2015 through 2017 from our fourth quarter disclosures. 
As I mentioned, Constellation had a good quarter and executed $200 million in power new business and $100 million in nonpower new business. 
In addition, we raised our power new business target by $100 million because we have line of sight for continued success in the balance of the year. 
This increase was offset by our nuclear outages resulting in a net $50 million improvement in 2015 total gross margin. 
Slide 6 provides an update on our cash flow expectations for this year. Projected cash from operations of $6.7 billion.  I'd like to point out that we've increased our CapEx projections at ComEd by $200 million. And finalizing the investment plan for 2015, ComEd identified incremental opportunity to invest in infrastructure, including grid resiliency and security, storm partnering and Smart Grid.  These investments will continue to improve the reliability of ComEd system. 
As a reminder, the appendix include several schedules that will help you in your modeling efforts. Thank you. 
And will now open the line for questions."

And so the governor has not taken that position. The governor has stayed neutral since he said he's come into this late in the process.

As you can see based off on our capital spend, our highest priority is in the regulated investments. We're making, as I said, $16 billion of investment over the next 5 years with another potential $7 billion with Pepco with PHI coming in. So that is we see as a good selling investment needed for the infrastructure for the customers and benefits to shareholders. The CCGTs in Texas are still a very good investment, very positive MPV. It continues to match our generation to load strategy as we continue to grow that load book in Texas in ERCOT. We said at the beginning, we're getting these at a very good terms. They're under $700 at kW on our brownfield site where we'll have expense advantages of combining them with our existing facilities. And the nature of those plants, the efficiency and the flexibility of them, they'll dispatch well on that ERCOT market. So that's still a positive investment. Innova is a good strong option. We're the 5th largest in the handling merchant gas. We have core competencies around our gas portfolio and continuing to grow off the gas business is a logical move, we believe. But the nature of that project is contracted, it will be a contracted, long-term type arrangement that the risks it significantly if we are successful in obtaining contracts and permits, then we would make the investment to continue to develop our gas business. So that's the strategy around utility, the strategy around competitive electric and gas continue to be the primary. The story in the U.K. is not an equity store at all, Exelon nuclear partners have been invited into the bidding process to be the operator on a couple projects potentially in the U.K. We have a very small office that we rent month-to-month that those folks are working out of. Part of the process of doing that is understanding more in the U.K. market so there's been some due diligence around that, but we have no plans right now on becoming an equity owner in the U.K. at this point, but those are clarification to be made."

And you're right, you noticed that the our expected generation in New England in all years has increased appreciably, and as such the generation percentage hedged has declined with that increased output of generation. Very simply, we have disclosed in Q4 '13 that we had worked with a fuel supplier to restructure a contract that we have. And if you remember back then, our generation dropped by about 15% net quarter-over-quarter at that time. That contract restructuring has been terminated, and it will be effective at the end of June this year and the contract itself will revert back to its original term and condition. It has 2 impacts: One, you're seeing the generation impact and the hedge percentage impact and the notification of the termination by the end of the first quarter this year. So really, you're seeing it flow through on an immediate basis. The gross margin impact was very minimal across the horizon and as such, just mechanically when you look at the hedge disclosure, the dollars of the termination of the contract restructuring, as well as the increased value, the generation outlook and the margin is all flowing through gross margin line, and it's very minimal.

So we've got the benefit of what we call it lower load serving cost in the first quarter and they've come down on a mark-to-market basis for the balance of the year. But our expectation is given that market volatility, we expect to see that would pass through to continuing to see appropriate risk premiums in our load serving business and appropriate margins."

I think the first one is as it relates to the turn over in the dispatch stack, I think it's clear that we're going to see retirements of generation assets. In our fundamental modeling, we have an ad add back of an appreciable number of gas-fired generators in PJM with most of them I'd say on the Eastern side of PJM because that's where the economics are more favorable toward territory like [indiscernible], for example. You're talking about a long-term investment asset with a build of a combined cycle plant, and you're looking at a market that spark spreads that make shorter data time horizon. In PJM, like some of the other markets, the capacity price comes into play as well and it's part of the equation. But, clearly, we don't see new build economics  work on the Western side of PJM. On the Eastern side of PJM, it's a much more marginal exercise. I think where spark spreads are, with capacity prices that you used last year as a benchmark, for example, I think you can say that's a marginal calculation. There was some talk if you go back a year ago that people are going to be able to lock in gas contracts for 20 years well under Henry Hub, at M3 gas or that land of gas. I would tell you I don't think that's going to be the case so there's an element of making sure that you understand what the dynamics or the cost of production are as well. But I think net-net, fundamentally, what we see is a turnover of stack, our fundamental forecast reflects that. So we have an appreciable add back of combined cycle plant and when we take that all into account, as I said, previously, we still see upside to the heat rate at NiHub, and we're generally in line with where the market heat rate is at West hub."

Before I go into the prepared remarks, I want to first start by addressing the situation in Baltimore. 
As a company with a significant presence in Baltimore, we're monitoring the unrest with great concern. As you know, Maryland's governor, Larry Hogan, has declared a state of an emergency and Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake has declared a city-wide curfew into next week. We join the rest of the business community in recognizing the issues that Baltimore is dealing with and needs to address, so this great city can -- this great city can heal itself and get back on to economic growth for all. Moving on to the quarter, I'm very pleased with our financial performance. We delivered earnings of $0.71 per share, surpassing our guidance range of $0.60 to $0.70, and Jack is going to describe our performance in greater detail. 
I would like to focus my remarks on our priorities in how we are strategically pursuing value for customers and shareholders. We continue to operate in a challenging market environment, particularly on the generation side of our business. But our gentle load match strategy continues to create value, as seen in the first quarter hedge disclosure. 
Our advocacy efforts are focused on creating our channels to capture value for our communities and customers we serve and for our shareholders. I'll touch on those directly. 
In our regulated business, we are redefining the role of the utility of the future in part by making needed infrastructure investments to marginalize the grid. Over the next 5 years, our LRP has $16 billion of capital that will create approximately 6% CAGR with another potential $7 billion at PHI. 
Installing smart meter technology to enable customers to make informed choices about their energy consumption and promoting energy efficiency investments and innovation in resilient technologies at our utilities is a way that is progressive and equitable across all customer types. You can see this reflected in the energy plan for Illinois' future bill that we recently proposed through ComEd in Illinois. 
With these efforts, we are bringing improvements to the lives of the customers in a way that creates value for the company. 
Our Merchant business face challenges, primarily due to policies and market design shortcomings that have failed to fairly value the benefits of nuclear. 
As a result, we focused our advocacy efforts on ensuring reliable environmental and economic benefits of nuclear power are not taken for granted and that these plants are operated on a level playing field. 
In Illinois, we are working with state legislatures and the Low Carbon Portfolio Standard that values each of these benefits. The bill unanimously was approved by the Center of Energy panel and the Public Utilities Committee and will now go to the Senate floor. We hope the same will happen in the house and that the bill will be approved within this legislative session. 
From a reliability perspective, we are pleased that FERC has graded the waiver to allow PJM to delay the capacity auction in order to further review PJM's CP proposal. 
It is clear from this transaction that FERC appreciates that the old drills are not sufficient to ensure reliability and the changes must be made. We look forward to a positive outcome. 
We continue to work through the process of finalizing a contract with RG&E for our Ginna facility. 
As these events play out, we continue to do our best, operating the plans and utilities at high levels of proficiency, hedging our generation output through strong portfolio management while we expand our footprint and our profits in retail power and gas operations. 
As you can see, we are doing things in both sides of our business. We're tapping into multiple channels to create upside and drive value for our customers and for our investors. This leads me to our proposed merger with PHI. 
As you know, we've obtained regulatory approval from FERC Virginia and New Jersey. We've reached a global settlement in Delaware that is pending a commission approval. That leaves Maryland and the District of Columbia. 
In Maryland, we've reached a partial settlement with several critical parties that has been presented to -- we presented that settlement to the Maryland Public Service Commission and expect a decision from them on May 15. 
In the District, we've completed our evidentiary hearings, and we're now filing briefs and the Commission will commence its deliberations. 
We have said from the beginning that this merger and the commitments we have made clearly demonstrate this merger is in the public interest and should be approved by the regulatory commissions. 
While there is no guarantee that the Public Service Commission will approve the proposal and there is no guarantee they will not impose conditions that would frustrate the transaction, we believe that the settlement and commitments that we have made in the proceeding more than meet the statutory requirements for the merger approval, and we look forward to orders approving the merger. We expect the merger to close late in the second quarter or in the third. 
In summary, we're creating value today while actively pursuing public policy changes that recognize the benefits provided by our clean, reliable assets, and we're working on all those fronts. 
I'll now turn it over to Jack, who will cover the financial performance for the quarter."

My remarks will cover our financial results for the quarter, second quarter guidance range and update our hedge disclosures and cash outlook. 
I'll start on Slide 4. Starting with our first quarter results on Slide 4. Exelon exceeded our guidance range and delivered earnings of $0.71 per share. 
At Exelon Generation, once again, we realized the benefits of our generation to load matching strategy. 
Quarter-after-quarter, this strategy is paying dividends in a broad array of market conditions. 
During the first quarter, despite experiencing lower power prices during the same period of 2014, we benefited from a lower cost to serve customers. 
We are realizing strong margins in our load business from contracts we executed last year after the polar vortex. 
In addition, our gas business performed above our expectations during the quarter due to favorable weather. 
While our nuclear plants performed better than they did at this time last year, we did have some nuclear outages that negatively impacted our quarterly earnings by approximately $0.04 relative to plan. 
That being said, we continue to push our plans to perform at our standard highest levels of performance. 
Our portfolio management team performed strongly and was able to more than offset these losses. On balance, generation earned $0.35 per share during the quarter. 
Exelon's utilities delivered combined earnings of $0.39 per share, an $0.08 increase over the first quarter of last year. 
Although we did not see a repeat of the polar vortex of 2014 with sustained extreme cold and wind chills, we faced a very cold winter with heating degree days 14% to 19% above normal in ComEd's and PECO's service territories. 
In fact, it was colder in Philadelphia this winter than the previous winter. 
Cold weather, a lack of severe storms and increased distribution rates at BGE drove utility results this quarter. More detail on quarter-over-quarter drivers of the utilities can be found in the appendix on Slide 16. 
For the second quarter, we are providing guidance of $0.45 per share to $0.55 per share. This compares with our realized earnings of $0.51 per share in the second quarter of 2014. We are reaffirming our full year guidance of $2.25 to $2.55 per share. 
Since our last call, both PECO and ComEd have filed rate cases this year. On March 27, PECO filed an electric distribution rate case with the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission, requesting a $190 million revenue increase and a 10.95% return on equity. This is PECO's first rate case filing since 2010 and the first time filing based on a fully projected future test year. 
In addition, if the PAPUC approves the new system 2020 plan, an additional $275 million will be spent during the next 5 years to install advanced equipment and reinforce the local electric system, making it more weather resistant and less vulnerable to storm damage. 
We expect the PAPUC to rule by the end of the year on the rate case and system 2020 plan with new rates going into effect in January of 2016. 
On April 15, ComEd filed the general formula rate filing with the Illinois Commerce Commission. ComEd requested a revenue decrease of $50 million. This reduction is a result of a continued focus on cost management and operational efficiencies that are being realized from a stronger, more reliable grid with fewer outages. 
EIMA and the Smart Grid investments are working. 
Since 2012, there have been more than 3.3 million avoided customer interruptions, including 1.2 million in 2014 due largely to increased investments in distribution automation or digital smart switches that automatically route power around problem areas.  Outage avoidance has saved customers an estimated $175 million. More detail on each of these rate cases can be found in the appendix on Slides 20 through 22. 
I will now turn to our first quarter gross margin update on Slide 5. During the quarter, we saw a drop in natural gas prices while power prices were steady and heat rates expanded further. The market is finally incorporating the change in the generation stack due to coal retirements, as evidenced by the heat rates seen today. Approximately 10 gigawatts of coal plants that PJM have or will retire this year with the majority of retirements occurring in April and May. 
We hedged close to a ratable amount during the quarter in both the mid-Atlantic and Midwest regions. At the end of the quarter for 2016 and 2017, we remain considerably behind ratable in the Midwest where we continue to see upside. 
Total gross margin is unchanged or relatively unchanged across 2015 through 2017 from our fourth quarter disclosures. 
As I mentioned, Constellation had a good quarter and executed $200 million in power new business and $100 million in non-power new business. 
In addition, we raised our power new business target by $100 million because we have line of sight for continued success in the balance of the year. 
This increase was offset by our nuclear outages resulting in a net $50 million improvement in 2015 total gross margins. 
Slide 6 provides an update on our cash flow expectations for this year. Projected cash from operations is $6.7 billion.  I'd like to point out that we've increased our CapEx projections at ComEd by $200 million. And finalizing the investment plan for 2015, ComEd identified incremental opportunity to invest in infrastructure including grid resiliency and security, storm hardening and Smart Grids.  These investments will continue to improve the reliability of ComEd's system. 
As a reminder, the appendix include several schedules that will help you in your modeling efforts. Thank you. 
And we'll now open the line for questions."

Now the benefits that we show by bringing PHI into the Exelon utilities with best practice, sharing, being able to leverage procurement and the commitments that we made, we think, meet the test to the best -- for the benefit of the consumer. And so the governor has not taken that position. The governor stayed neutral since he said he's come into this late in the process, so there was rumors that he was against it. That was clarified with the letter that he sent to the commission saying he has faith in the commission that they'll do the right thing and he's neither for or against, he's neutral on it, and that's the support that we've gotten from Montgomery County and Prince George's County is significant.

So that is we see is a good solid investment needed for the infrastructure for the customers and benefits the shareholders. The CCGTs in Texas are still a very good investment, very positive NPV. It continues to match our generation to load strategy as we continue to grow that load book in Texas in ERCOT. We said at the beginning, we're getting these at a very good term. They're under $700 a kW on our brownfield site where we'll have expense advantages of combining them with our existing facilities. And the nature of those plants, the efficiency and the flexibility of them, they'll dispatch well in that ERCOT market. So that's still a positive investment. Enova is a good, strong option. We're the 5th largest in handling merchant gas. We have core competencies around our gas portfolio and continuing to grow up the gas business is a logical move, we believe. But the nature of that project is contracted, it would be a contracted, long-term type arrangement that derisks it significantly. If we are successful in obtaining contracts and permits, then we would make the investment to continue to develop out our gas business. So that's the strategy around the utility, the strategy around competitive electric and gas, continue to be the primary. The story in the U.K. is not an equity story at all. Exelon nuclear partners has been invited into the bidding process to be the operator on a couple projects potentially in the U.K. We have a very small office that we rent month-to-month that those folks are working out of. Part of the process of doing that is understanding more, the U.K. market. So there's been some due diligence around that but we have no plans right now on becoming an equity owner in the U.K. at this point, but those are -- there was a clarification needed to be made."

And you're right, you noticed that our expected generation in New England in all years has increased appreciably. And as such, that generation percentage hedge has declined with that increased output of generation. Very simply, we had disclosed in Q4 '13 that we had worked with a fuel supplier to restructure a contract that we have. And if you remember back then, our generation had dropped by about 50% net quarter-over-quarter at that time. That contract restructuring has been terminated and it will be effective at the end of June this year. And the contract itself will revert back to its original terms and conditions. It has 2 impacts: one, you're seeing the generation impact and the hedge percentage impact and the notification of that termination was at the end of the first quarter this year. So really, you're seeing it flow through on an immediate basis. The gross margin impact was very minimal across the horizon and as such, just mechanically when you look at the hedge disclosure, the dollars of the termination of the contract restructuring as well as the increased value, the generation outlook and the margin associated with that is all flowing through open gross margin line, and it's very minimal.

I think it's clear that we're going to see retirements of generation assets. In our fundamental modeling, we have an add back of an appreciable number of gas-fired generators in PJM with most of them I'll say on the Eastern side of PJM because that's where the economics are more favorable than toward a territory like NiHub, for example. You're talking about a long-term investment asset with the build of a combined cycle plant, and you're looking at a market with spark spreads that have a much shorter dated time horizon. In PJM, unlike some of the other markets, the capacity price comes into play as well and is part of the equation. Clearly, we don't see new build economics work on the Western side of PJM. On the Eastern side of PJM, it's a much more marginal exercise. I think where spark spreads are and with capacity prices that you used last year as a benchmark, for example, I think you can say that's a marginal calculation. There was some talk if you go back a year ago that people are going to be able to lock in gas contracts for 20 years and well under Henry Hub, at M3 gas or that mid-Atlantic type gas. I will tell you, I haven't seen than and I don't think that's going to be the case, so there's an element of making sure that you understand what the dynamics or the cost of production are as well. But I think net-net, fundamentally, what we see is a turnover stack, our fundamental forecast reflects that. So we have an appreciable add back of combined cycle plants and when we take that all into account, as I said previously, we still see upside to the heat rate at NiHub, and we're generally in line with where the market heat rate is at West hub."

Before I go into the prepared remarks, I want to first start by addressing the situation in Baltimore. 
As a company with a significant presence in Baltimore, we're monitoring the unrest with great concern. As you know, Maryland's governor, Larry Hogan, has declared a state of an emergency and Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake has declared a city-wide curfew through into next week. We join the rest of the business community in recognizing the issues that Baltimore is dealing with and needs to address, so this great city can heal itself and get back on to economic growth for all. Moving on to the quarter, I'm very pleased with our financial performance. We delivered earnings of $0.71 per share, surpassing our guidance range of $0.60 to $0.70, and Jack is going to describe our performance in greater detail. 
I would like to focus my remarks on our priorities in how we are strategically pursuing value for customers and shareholders. We continue to operate in a challenging market environment, particularly on the generation side of our business. But our gen-to-load match strategy continues to create value, as seen in the first quarter hedge disclosure. 
Our advocacy efforts are focused on creating our channels to capture value for our communities and customers we serve and for our shareholders. I'll touch on those directly. 
In our regulated business, we are redefining the role of the utility of the future in part by making needed infrastructure investments to modernize the grid. Over the next 5 years, our LRP has $16 billion of capital that will create approximately a 6% CAGR with another potential $7 billion at PHI. 
Installing smart meter technology to enable customers to make informed choices about their energy consumption and promoting energy efficiency investments and innovation in resilient technologies at our utilities is a way that is progressive and equitable across all customer types. You can see this reflected in the energy plan for Illinois' future bill that we recently proposed through ComEd in Illinois. 
With these efforts, we are bringing improvements to the lives of the customers in a way that creates value for the company. 
Our merchant business faced challenges, primarily due to policies and market design shortcomings that have failed to fairly value the benefits of nuclear. 
As a result, we focused our advocacy efforts on ensuring reliable environmental and economic benefits of nuclear power are not taken for granted and that these plants are operated on a level playing field. 
In Illinois, we are working with state legislatures on the Low Carbon Portfolio Standard that values each of these benefits. The bill unanimously was approved by the Senate Energy panel and the Public Utilities Committee and will now go to the Senate floor. We hope the same will happen in the House and that the bill will be approved within this legislative session. 
From a reliability perspective, we are pleased that FERC has graded the waiver to allow PJM to delay the capacity auction in order to further review PJM's CP proposal. 
It is clear from this action that FERC appreciates that the old rules are not sufficient to ensure reliability and that changes must be made. We look forward to a positive outcome. 
We continue to work through the process of finalizing a contract with RG&E for our Ginna facility. 
As these events play out, we continue to do our best, operating the plants and utilities at high levels of proficiency, hedging our generation output through strong portfolio management while we expand our footprint and our profits in retail power and gas operations. 
As you can see, we are doing things on both sides of our business. We're tapping into multiple channels to create upside and drive value for our customers and for our investors. This leads me to our proposed merger with PHI. 
As you know, we've obtained regulatory approval from FERC, Virginia and New Jersey. We've reached a global settlement in Delaware that is pending a commission approval. That leaves Maryland and the District of Columbia. 
In Maryland, we've reached a partial settlement with several critical parties that has been presented to -- we presented that settlement to the Maryland Public Service Commission and expect a decision from them on May 15. 
In the District, we've completed our evidentiary hearings, and we're now filing briefs and the Commission will commence its deliberations. 
We have said from the beginning that this merger and the commitments we have made clearly demonstrate this merger is in the public interest and should be approved by the regulatory commissions. 
While there is no guarantee that the Public Service Commission will approve the proposal and there is no guarantee they will not impose conditions that would frustrate the transaction, we believe that the settlement and commitments that we have made in the proceeding are more than meet the statutory requirements for the merger approval, and we look forward to orders approving the merger. We expect the merger to close late in the second quarter or in the third. 
In summary, we're creating value today while actively pursuing public policy changes that recognize the benefits provided by our clean, reliable assets, and we're working on all those fronts. 
I'll now turn it over to Jack, who will cover the financial performance for the quarter."
296181,290568559,798008,"Exelon Corporation, Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2015",2015-04-29,"Earnings Calls","Exelon Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. We had a strong first quarter to start the year. My remarks will cover our financial results for the quarter, second quarter guidance range and update our hedge disclosures and cash outlook. I'll start on Sl",950,"Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. We had a strong first quarter to start the year. My remarks will cover our financial results for the quarter, second quarter guidance range and update our hedge disclosures and cash outlook. 
I'll start on Slide 4. Starting with our first quarter results on Slide 4. Exelon exceeded our guidance range and delivered earnings of $0.71 per share. 
At Exelon Generation, once again, we realized the benefits of our generation to load matching strategy. 
Quarter-after-quarter, this strategy has paid dividends in a broad array of market conditions. 
During the first quarter, despite experiencing lower power prices during the same period of 2014, we benefited from a lower cost to serve customers. 
We are realizing strong margins in our load business from contracts we executed last year after the polar vortex. 
In addition, our gas business performed above our expectations during the quarter due to favorable weather. 
While our nuclear plants performed better than they did at this time last year, we did have some nuclear outages that negatively impacted our quarterly earnings by approximately $0.04 relative to plan. 
That being said, we continue to push our plants to perform at our standard highest levels of performance. 
Our portfolio management team performed strongly and was able to more than offset these losses. On balance, generation earned $0.35 per share during the quarter. 
Exelon's utilities delivered combined earnings of $0.39 per share, an $0.08 increase over the first quarter of last year. 
Although we did not see a repeat of the polar vortex of 2014 with sustained extreme cold and wind chills, we faced a very cold winter with heating degree days 14% to 19% above normal in ComEd's and PECO's service territories. 
In fact, it was colder in Philadelphia this winter than the previous winter. 
Cold weather, a lack of severe storms and increased distribution rates at BGE drove utility results this quarter. More detail on quarter-over-quarter drivers of the utilities can be found in the appendix on Slide 16. 
For the second quarter, we are providing guidance of $0.45 per share to $0.55 per share. This compares with our realized earnings of $0.51 per share in the second quarter of 2014. We are reaffirming our full year guidance of $2.25 to $2.55 per share. 
Since our last call, both PECO and ComEd have filed rate cases this year. On March 27, PECO filed an electric distribution rate case with the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission, requesting a $190 million revenue increase and a 10.95% return on equity. This is PECO's first rate case filing since 2010 and the first time filing based on a fully projected future test year. 
In addition, if the PAPUC approves the new system 2020 plan, an additional $275 million will be spent during the next 5 years to install advanced equipment and reinforce the local electric system, making it more weather resistant and less vulnerable to storm damage. 
We expect the PAPUC to rule by the end of the year on the rate case and system 2020 plan, with new rates going into effect in January of 2016. 
On April 15, ComEd filed its annual formula rate filing with the Illinois Commerce Commission. ComEd requested a revenue decrease of $50 million. This reduction is a result of a continued focus on cost management and operational efficiencies that are being realized from a stronger, more reliable grid with fewer outages. 
EIMA and the Smart Grid investments are working. 
Since 2012, there have been more than 3.3 million avoided customer interruptions, including 1.2 million in 2014 due largely to increased investments in distribution automation or digital smart switches that automatically route power around problem areas.  Outage avoidance has saved customers an estimated $175 million. More detail on each of these rate cases can be found in the appendix on Slides 20 through 22. 
I will now turn to our first quarter gross margin update on Slide 5. During the quarter, we saw a drop in natural gas prices while power prices were steady and heat rates expanded further. The market is finally incorporating the change in the generation stack due to coal retirements, as evidenced by the heat rates seen today. Approximately 10 gigawatts of coal plants at PJM have or will retire this year with the majority of retirements occurring in April and May. 
We hedged close to a ratable amount during the quarter in both the mid-Atlantic and Midwest regions. At the end of the quarter for 2016 and 2017, we remain considerably behind ratable in the Midwest where we continue to see upside. 
Total gross margin is unchanged or relatively unchanged across 2015 through 2017 from our fourth quarter disclosures. 
As I mentioned, Constellation had a good quarter and executed $200 million in power new business and $100 million in non-power new business. 
In addition, we raised our power new business target by $100 million because we have line of sight for continued success in the balance of the year. 
This increase was offset by our nuclear outages, resulting in a net $50 million improvement in 2015 total gross margin. 
Slide 6 provides an update on our cash flow expectations for this year. Projected cash from operations is $6.7 billion. I'd like to point out that we've increased our CapEx projections at ComEd by $200 million. In finalizing the investment plan for 2015, ComEd identified incremental opportunity to invest in infrastructure including grid resiliency and security, storm hardening and Smart Grids.  These investments will continue to improve the reliability of ComEd's system. 
As a reminder, the appendix includes several schedules that will help you in your modeling efforts. Thank you. 
And we'll now open the line for questions."

And so the Governor has not taken that position. The Governor has stayed neutral since, as he said, he's come into this late in the process, so there was rumors that he was against it.

You can see, based off of our capital spend, our highest priority is in the regulated investments. We're making, as I said, $16 billion of investment over the next 5 years with another potential $7 billion with Pepco being -- PHI coming in. So that is -- we see is a good solid investment needed for the infrastructure for the customers and benefits the shareholders. The CCGTs in Texas are still a very good investment, very positive NPV. It continues to match our generation-to-load strategy as we continue to grow that load book in Texas in ERCOT. We said at the beginning, we're getting these at very good terms. They're under $700 a kW on our brownfield site where we'll have expense advantages of combining them with our existing facilities. And the nature of those plants, the efficiency and the flexibility of them, they'll dispatch well in that ERCOT market. So that's still a positive investment. Annova is a good, strong option. We're the 5th largest in handling merchant gas. We have core competencies around our gas portfolio and continuing to grow out the gas business is a logical move, we believe. But the nature of that project is contracted. It would be a contracted, long-term type arrangement that derisks it significantly. If we are successful in obtaining contracts and permits, then we would make the investment to continue to develop out our gas business. So that's the strategy around the utilities, the strategy around competitive electric and gas, continue to be the primary. The story in the U.K. is not an equity story at all. Exelon nuclear partners has been invited into the bidding process to be the operator on a couple projects potentially in the U.K. We have a very small office that we rent month-to-month that those folks are working out of. Part of the process of doing that is understanding more, the U.K. market. So there's been some due diligence around that, but we have no plans right now on becoming an equity owner in the U.K. at this point, that those are -- there was a clarification that needed to be made."

And if you remember back then, our generation had dropped by about 50% net quarter-over-quarter at that time. That contract restructuring has been terminated and it will be effective at the end of June this year. And the contract itself will revert back to its original terms and conditions. It has 2 impacts: one, you're seeing the generation impact and the hedge percentage impact, and the notification of that termination was at the end of the first quarter this year. So really, you're seeing it flow through on an immediate basis. The gross margin impact was very minimal across the horizon and as such, just mechanically when you look at the hedge disclosure, the dollars of the termination of the contract restructuring as well as the increased value of the generation output and the margin associated with that is all flowing through the open gross margin line, and it's very minimal.

Certainly, we do watch and we do evaluate and consider the potential impact of value that a yieldco could have on our assets from the perspective of yieldcos as potential buyers of those assets or through the potential to create our own yieldco. And we continue to evaluate that within our project financing efforts. We have retained that option to be able to do that. I think one of the key elements, though, to a successful strategy around the yieldcos is having a significant and visible pipeline of assets that you could drop down.

We have some elements like our Annova LNG facility that if we decide to pursue that and we had a long-term offtake agreement that would provide attractive revenues that could fit in that type of structure.

So there's 2 components to our view and as such, we're behind our ratable plan in '16 and '17 from a hedging perspective to the tune of approximately 10%. And it's important to note that there's some seasonality associated with that, and our hedging profile within the given year reflects that, meaning we see time buckets that are more valuable relative to the market than others. On the West upside, we see that heat rates and power prices are generally in line with our fundamental forecast, and we don't see quite as much opportunity. But again, there's seasonality associated with that and our hedging profile takes that into account."

I think in addition to that, I think what you're going to see going forward is the increased volatility, and both upside volatility and downside volatility. And I think that has an impact on load volume contracts because you need to make sure that they're priced accordingly. So we've got the benefit of, I would call it, lower load serving costs in the first quarter, and they've come down on a mark-to-market basis for the balance of the year. But our expectation is, given that market volatility we expect to see, that, that would pass through to continuing to see appropriate risk premiums in our load serving business and appropriate margins."

I think it's clear that we're going to see retirements of Generation assets. In our fundamental modeling, we have an add back of an appreciable number of gas-fired generators in PJM with most of them, I'll say, on the Eastern side of PJM because that's where the economics are more favorable than toward a territory like NiHub, for example. You're talking about a long-term investment asset with the build of a combined cycle plant, and you're looking at a market with spark spreads that's a much shorter, dated time horizon. In PJM, unlike some of the other markets, the capacity price comes into play as well and is part of the equation. Clearly, we don't see newbuild economics work on the Western side of PJM. On the Eastern side of PJM, it's a much more marginal exercise. I think where spark spreads are and where capacity prices, if you used last year as a benchmark, for example, I think you can say that's a marginal calculation. There was some talk, if you go back a year ago, that people are going to be able to lock in gas contracts for 20 years and well under Henry Hub, at M3 gas or that Mid-Atlantic type gas. I would tell you, I haven't seen than and I don't think that's going to be the case. So there's an element of making sure that you understand what the dynamics or the cost of production are as well. But I think net-net, fundamentally, what we see is a turnover of the stack. Our fundamental forecast reflects that. So we have an appreciable add back of combined cycle plants, and when we take that all into account, as I said previously, we still see upside to the heat rate at NiHub, and we're generally in line with where the market heat rate is at West Hub."

We're pleased to report another strong quarter with our earnings coming in at $0.59 per share, surpassing our guidance of $0.45 to $0.55 per share. You'll hear more from Jack in a minute on the specifics and Joe Nigro also provide some color around the performance. 
We've seen a number of positive developments that affect various business this quarter. The 2 primary catalysts for us this year are the PHI acquisition and the capacity market auctions. We received the approval from the merger since our last call in Maryland in May. And leaving D.C -- Washington, D.C. as our only outstanding jurisdiction to close the merger, which we expect to hear from soon, and we're looking forward to a positive outcome there. Upon closing the merger, our focus will shift to the integration of PHI utilities into the Exelon utilities to align our operations to better serve the PHI customers base. 
Another major catalyst is the capacity performance revisions that have been made. While we continue to believe that FERC came to the right conclusion putting reliability at the center of its planning process to ensure that customers in the region are well served. We always -- we're aware that DR and energy efficiency were in the '18, '19 [ph] auction, that the most recent change that allows DR and energy efficiency to provide -- to participate in a transition auctions, we believe, to be nonmaterial to the outcome. 
We are disappointed in the delay, but we think that we'll be on the right track and to recognize the value of our highly reliable fleet going forward. 
And we remain confident that capacity construct is the best way to protect the grid as we await further clarification on the timing of these transition auctions. I think we're getting that in the last days. So by the September time frame, we should have clear -- clarity on the value proposition, along with the reliability measures being enacted. 
In Illinois, the legislative session ended without a resolution on the market redesign for the low carbon standard, the low carbon portfolio standard. We were disappointed that we were not able to get this outcome before the session ended but understand where the state is focused right now on its budget priorities. The nuclear plants provide a significant value to the state and its economy and it's mostly important to its consumers.
Looking ahead, we have certain regulatory and operational triggers in September that require us to make some tough choices on the specific assets this fall, particularly in light of the continued pressure on the power markets. So. we're continuing on with our disciplined plan on evaluating the assets and they're likelihood to stay within the stack and we'll bring that to closure with our decision in September. 
Despite these market challenges, we continue to find ways to create value in our Constellation business, which Joe is going to talk about shortly. Part of our resilience to the power market weakness is driven by our ability to capitalize on generation to load strategy. In this quarter, we showed the benefit from the lower cost to serve load. And increasing our Utility business has been able to reduce the overall volatility at the enterprise level and deliver growth. 
You can expect that even more to be true over time, not only is it shifting our business mix with the acquisition of PHI, but it also, with our infrastructure improvement investments, we're investing $16 billion in our existing utilities over the next 5 years, which provides respectable growth rates and roughly another $7 billion with the addition of PHI.
I want to remind everybody that we can perform well even with the rising interest rate environment, which is typically a headwind in our industry. This is because our EPS is positively correlated to interest rates due to both ComEd's formula rate and ROE being tied to the 30-year treasury rate as well as the discount of our pension -- discounting the rates of our pension liability. Overall, we are positive the company is able to provide more stable and durable earnings streams for our shareholders with our operational expertise in driving performance across the enterprise.
With that, I'll turn it over to Joe who will discuss the markets, followed by Jack on the financial performance."

The Constellation business is continuing to perform well in 2015 as a result of our generation to load matching strategy. My comments today will address market events during the second quarter and and what they mean for our commercial business going forward, including our hedging strategy and our updated disclosures.
Starting with Slide 4. The spot held market in the second quarter has been defined by mild weather and lower gas prices, which drove the price of power considerably lower than in 2014 across all of PJM. The impact of low spot market condition has carried through to the forward market with prices down approximately $0.45 per megawatt hour in 2016 and $1 per megawatt hour in 2017 as well as the PGM West Hub and NiHub since the end of the first quarter. 
The lack of liquidity in the forward markets has exacerbated the drops in power prices and heat rates with the forward markets exhibiting volatile price moves on very little trading volume for calendar 2017 and beyond, especially at NiHub. 
During the quarter, our hedging activities for 2016 to 2018 were executed to our retail and wholesale load businesses rather than on the over-the-counter market. Our fundamental view of power prices has not changed but given the drop in market prices, there is a greater gap between the market and our fundamental the aged to current a natural gas prices expected retirements, new generation resources and load assumptions.   
Moving to Slide 5, I'll discuss the forward market and impact on our hedging profile. During the second quarter, we maintained our behind ratable strategy and increased our cross commodity hedge position to increase exposure to power price upside. We had successfully used this behind ratable hedging strategy in the past when our view showed upside in the market. We are 4% to 5% behind ratable in 2016, and '17 and 7% to 8% behind ratable if you remove our cross commodity hedges at NiHub. We are confident in our ability to adjust our hedging strategy to capitalize on our fundamental view.
Turning to Slide 6, I will review our updated hedge disclosure and some key changes since the end of the first quarter. In 2015, we have a net $50 million increase to total gross margin since the end of the first quarter, driven primarily by strong performance and execution. We executed on $200 million of power new business and $50 million of nonpower new business during train the quarter. Based on 2015 performance to-date and expectations for the full year, we have increased our power new business target by $50 million.
Our generation to load strategy was successful last year during the extreme forward vortex conditions and in serving us as well under weaker load and price conditions. It is further augmented by strong performance from our portfolio optimization activity and our Integrys acquisition. 
For 2016, we saw prices decreased across most regions, decreasing around $0.45 per megawatt hour in both the mid-Atlantic and the Midwest. This resulted in a decrease in our open gross margin of approximately $200 million, which is offset by our hedging activities.
During the quarter, we executed $100 million of power new business and $50 million of nonpower new business, and our raising our power new business target by $50 million additional due to commercial opportunities for a gross margin increase of $50 million in 2016.
For 2017, prices decreased by approximately $1 per megawatt hour in both the mid-Atlantic and Midwest. These resulted in a decrease of $300 million in our open gross margin. Despite the drop in prices, our total gross margin is only down $50 million due to our hedge position and an increase in our power new business target of $100 million because we have line of sight into additional commercial opportunities.
Since the beginning of the year, prices have fallen due to mild weather, lower gas prices, lower load demand in the Midwest and the lack of liquidity in the market. Prices have fallen more than 2017 and beyond than in 2016. Although this weakness and spot market impacted forward markets, we are fundamental be of the view of the gas and power markets and are positioning our portfolio to take advantage of this.
Now I'll turn it over to Jack to review the full financial information for the quarter."

Our remarks we will cover our financial results for the quarter, third quarter range constraints and our cash outlook.
Starting with our second quarter results on Slide 7, Exelon exceeded our guidance range and delivered earnings of $0.59 per share. This compares to $0.51 per share for the second quarter of 2014. Exelon's utilities delivered combined earnings of $0.25 per share, and were flat to the second quarter of last year. During the quarter, we saw favorable weather at PECO and unfavorable weather at ComEd. 
Cooling degree days were up nearly 37% from the prior year and 47.4% above normal in the South Eastern Pennsylvania and down 34% from the prior year and 21.6% below normal in northern Illinois. Distribution revenues at ComEd and BGE were higher quarter-over-quarter. In addition, BGE had a decrease in uncollectible accounts expense compared to the second quarter of 2014.
Exelon Generation had another strong quarter, delivering earnings of $0.36 per share, $0.09 higher than the same period last year. As Joe mentioned, our generation to load matching strategy continues to prove effective. We benefited from a lower cost to serve, both our retail and also customers and has strong performance from our portfolio management team. In addition, compared to the second quarter of 2014, we had fewer average days at our nuclear plants, which had a positive contribution from the Integrys acquisition, higher realized nuclear decommissioning trust fund gains and received additional benefits quarter-over-quarter from the cancellation of the DOE's spend nuclear feet. These positive factors were partially offset by higher tax and interest expense. More detail on the quarter-over-quarter drivers for each operating company can be found on Slides 18 and 19 in the appendix.
For the third quarter, we are providing guidance of $0.65 to $0.75 per share. Accounting for the effect of the increased share accounts, and then associated with the Pepco Holdings transaction and assuming the transaction closes in the third quarter, we are narrowing our full year guidance from $2.25 to $2.55 per share to $2.35 to $2.55 per share. Our guidance does not assume that bonus depreciation is extended.
Slide 8 provides an update on our cash flow expectations for this year. We've simplified the format of our slide to provide a clearer view of our cash flow at each operating company, including explicitly showing free cash flow. We project cash flow from operations of $6.6 billion. We project free cash flow of $900 million in generation in 2015. 80% of our total gross capital expenditures are being invested in our utilities over the next 3 years, which will provide stable earnings growth. 
In June, we completed the debt portion of our financing for the PECO transaction by issuing $4.2 billion in senior notes with the majority of these proceeds being used to fund this transaction. Strong market demand allowed us to upsize the offering, enabling us to pull forward some future planned corporate debt issuances. We expect with an average maturity of approximately 14 years and an average weighted average coupon of 3.79%.
Earlier this month, we completed the settlement of the equity forward transaction. The combination of these financings allows us to close the merger quickly upon receiving approval from the D.C. Public Service Commission. Our balance sheet remains strong and gives us the ability to invest and grow our business. As a reminder, the appendix includes several schedules that will help you in your modeling efforts.

It's more specifically related to proprietary structured commercial opportunities that we have really solid line of sight into on our wholesale side of the business, quite frankly. To your point though, I think it's important to note we have raised our target to $50 million each quarter for 2015 for a total of $100 million so far year-to-date and a lot of that has been driven by really 3 things. One is the monetization of loads that result in higher prices last year. So we have seen increased value from that load serving business. Some of our optimization activities, and then we went in, as you saw from our disclosures last quarter, we went in a short bias with the backstop of our own generation and given the results of market prices that in '15 to date, that performed well. We would only look to raise those targets, the power to go target to our nonpowered go targets if we have good line of sight into specific opportunities and in this case, we do."

The reason we don't think it's a material impact in the transition auction is really related to how the auctions itself cleared on the base residual and the separation in price in '16, '17 on one side, and then the amount of DR that cleared in '17, '18 auction. And when we put that all into our model, it's very similar to what we read quite friendly from a lot of what's been written by the equity community that it's going to be a limited impact."

We're pleased to report another strong quarter with our earnings coming in at $0.59 per share, surpassing our guidance of $0.45 to $0.55 per share. You'll hear more from Jack in a minute on the specifics and Joe Nigro also provide some color around the performance. 
We've seen a number of positive developments that affect various business this quarter. The 2 primary catalysts for us this year are the PHI acquisition and the capacity market auctions. We received the approval from the merger since our last call in Maryland in May. And leaving D.C., Washington, D.C. as our only outstanding jurisdiction to close the merger, which we expect to hear from soon, and we're looking forward to a positive outcome there. Upon closing the merger, our focus will shift to the integration of PHI utilities into the Exelon utilities to align our operations to better serve the PHI customers base. 
Another major catalyst is the capacity performance revisions that have been made. While we continue to believe that FERC came to the right conclusion putting reliability at the center of its planning process to ensure that customers in the region are well served, we always -- we're aware that DR and energy efficiency were in the '18, '19 auction, that the most recent change that allows DR and energy efficiency to provide -- to participate in a transition auctions, we believe, to be nonmaterial to the outcome. 
We are disappointed in the delay but we think that we'll be on the right track in to recognize the value of our highly reliable fleet going forward. 
And we remain confident that the capacity construct is the best way to protect the grid as we await further clarification on the timing of these transition auctions. I think we're getting that in the last days. So by the September time frame, we should have clear -- clarity on the value proposition, along with the reliability measures being enacted. 
In Illinois, the legislative session ended without a resolution on the market redesign for the low carbon standard, the low carbon portfolio standard. We were disappointed that we were not able to get this outcome before the session ended but understand where the state is focused right now on its budget priorities. The nuclear plants provide a significant value to the state and its economy and it's mostly important to its consumers.
Looking ahead, we have certain regulatory and operational triggers in September that require us to make some tough choices on the specific assets this fall, particularly in light of the continued pressure on the power markets. So we are continuing on with our disciplined plan on evaluating the assets and their likelihood to stay within the stack and we'll bring that to closure with our decision in September. 
Despite these market challenges, we continue to find ways to create value in our Constellation business, which Joe is going to talk about shortly. Part of our resilience to the power market weakness is driven by our ability to capitalize on our generation to load strategy. In this quarter, we showed the benefit from the lower cost to serve load, and increasing our utility business has been able to reduce the overall volatility at the enterprise level and deliver growth. 
You can expect that even more to be true over time, not only is it shifting our business mix with the acquisition of PHI, but it also, with our infrastructure improvement investments, we're investing $16 billion in our existing utilities over the next 5 years, which provides respectable growth rates and roughly another $7 billion with the addition of PHI.
I want to remind everybody that we can perform well even with the rising interest rate environment, which is typically a headwind in our industry. This is because our EPS is positively correlated to interest rates due to both ComEd's formula rate and ROE being tied to the 30-year treasury rate as well as the discount of our pension -- discounting the rates of our pension liability. Overall, we are positive the company is able to provide more stable and durable earnings streams for our shareholders with our operational expertise in driving performance across the enterprise.
With that, I'll turn it over to Joe, who will discuss the markets, followed by Jack on the financial performance."

The Constellation business is continuing to perform well in 2015 as a result of our generation to load matching strategy. My comments today will address market events during the second quarter and what they mean for our commercial business going forward, including our hedging strategy and our updated disclosures.
Starting with Slide 4. The spot power market in the second quarter has been defined by mild weather and lower natural gas prices, which drove the price of power considerably lower than in 2014 across all of PJM. The impact of low spot market condition has carried through to the forward markets with prices down approximately $0.45 per megawatt hour in 2016 and $1 per megawatt hour in 2017 as well as the PJM West Hub and NiHub since the end of the first quarter. 
The lack of liquidity in the forward markets has exacerbated the drops in power prices and heat rates with the forward markets exhibiting volatile price moves on very little trading volume for calendar 2017 and beyond, especially at NiHub. 
During the quarter, our hedging activities for 2016 to 2018 were executed to our retail and wholesale load businesses rather than on the over-the-counter market. Our fundamental view of power prices has not changed but given the drop in market prices, there is a greater gap between the market and our fundamental view due to current natural gas prices, expected retirements, new generation resources and load assumptions.   
Moving to Slide 5. I'll discuss the forward market and its impact on our hedging profile. During the second quarter, we maintained our behind ratable strategy and increased our cross commodity hedge position to increase exposure to power price upside. We had successfully used this behind ratable hedging strategy in the past when our view showed upside in the market. We are 4% to 5% behind ratable in 2016, and '17 and 7% to 8% behind ratable if you remove our cross commodity hedges at NiHub. We are confident in our ability to adjust our hedging strategies to capitalize on our fundamental view.
Turning to Slide 6, I will review our updated hedge disclosure and some key changes since the end of the first quarter. In 2015, we have a net $50 million increase to total gross margin since the end of the first quarter, driven primarily by strong performance and execution. We executed on $200 million of power new business and $50 million of non-power new business during the quarter. Based on 2015 performance to-date and expectations for the full year, we have increased our power new business target by $50 million.
Our generation to load strategy was successful last year during the extreme polar vortex conditions and it's serving us well this year under weaker load and price conditions. It is further augmented by strong performance from our portfolio optimization activity and our Integrys acquisition. 
For 2016, we saw prices decreased across most regions, decreasing around $0.45 per megawatt hour in both the Mid-Atlantic and the Midwest. This resulted in a decrease in our open gross margin of approximately $200 million, which was offset by our hedging activities.
During the quarter, we executed $100 million of power new business and $50 million of non-power new business, and are raising our power new business target by $50 million additional due to commercial opportunities for a gross margin increase of $50 million in 2016.
For 2017, prices decreased by approximately $1 per megawatt hour in both the Mid-Atlantic and Midwest. These resulted in a decrease of $300 million in our open gross margin. Despite the drop in prices, our total gross margin is only down $50 million due to our hedge position and an increase in our power new business target of $100 million because we have line of sight into additional commercial opportunities.
Since the beginning of the year, prices have fallen due to mild weather, lower gas prices, lower load demand in the Midwest and the lack of liquidity in the markets. Prices have fallen more in 2017 and beyond than in 2016. Although this weakness in the spot market has impacted forward markets, we are confident in our fundamental view of the gas and power markets and are positioning our portfolio to take advantage of this.
Now I'll turn it over to Jack to review the full financial information for the quarter."

We had another strong quarter. My remarks will cover our financial results for the quarter, third quarter guidance range and our cash outlook.
Starting with our second quarter results on Slide 7, Exelon exceeded our guidance range and delivered earnings of $0.59 per share. This compares to $0.51 per share for the second quarter of 2014. Exelon's utilities delivered combined earnings of $0.25 per share, and were flat to the second quarter of last year. During the quarter, we saw favorable weather at PECO and an unfavorable weather at ComEd. 
Cooling degree days were up nearly 37% from the prior year and 47.4% above normal in South Eastern Pennsylvania and down 34% from the prior year and 21.6% below normal in northern Illinois. Distribution revenues at ComEd and BGE were higher quarter-over-quarter. In addition, BGE had a decrease in uncollectible accounts expense compared to the second quarter of 2014.
Exelon Generation had another strong quarter, delivering earnings of $0.36 per share, $0.09 higher than the same period last year. As Joe mentioned, our generation to load matching strategy continues to prove effective. We benefited from a lower cost to serve both our retail and wholesales customers and has strong performance from our portfolio management team. In addition, compared to the second quarter of 2014, we had fewer outage days at our nuclear plants, which had a positive contribution from the Integrys acquisition, higher realized nuclear decommissioning trust fund gains and received additional benefits quarter-over-quarter from the cancellation of the DOE's spent nuclear fee. These positive factors were partially offset by higher tax and interest expense. More detail on the quarter-over-quarter drivers for each operating company can be found on Slides 18 and 19 in the appendix.
For the third quarter, we are providing guidance of $0.65 to $0.75 per share. Accounting for the impact of the increased share counts and the debt associated with Pepco Holdings transaction and assuming the transaction closes in the third quarter, we are narrowing our full year guidance from $2.25 to $2.55 per share to $2.35 to $2.55 per share. Our guidance does not assume that bonus depreciation is extended.
Slide 8 provides an update on our cash flow expectations for this year. We've simplified the format of our slide to provide a clearer view of our cash flow at each operating company, including explicitly showing free cash flow. We project cash flow from operations of $6.6 billion. We project free cash flow of $900 million in generation in 2015. 80% of our total growth capital expenditures are being invested in our utilities over the next 3 years, which will provide stable earnings growth. 
In June, we completed the debt portion of our financing for the Pepco transaction by issuing $4.2 billion in senior notes with the majority of these proceeds being used to fund the transaction. Strong market demand allowed us to upsize the offering, enabling us to pull forward some future planned corporate debt issuances. We issued across the tenet [ph] spectrum with an average maturity of approximately 14 years and an average weighted average coupon of 3.79%.
Earlier this month, we completed the settlement of the equity forward transaction. The combination of these financings allows us to close the merger quickly upon receiving approval from the D.C. Public Service Commission. Our balance sheet remains strong and gives us the ability to invest and grow our business. As a reminder, the appendix includes several schedules that will help you in your modeling efforts.

First, when you talk about the commercial opportunities in the context of your comfort level raising your guidance for power new business to go, are we talking about sort of the inherent counter cyclicality of the margins in that business in the low wholesale environment, i.e., are we moving closer off the $2 floor in margins and closer to the $4, sort of, peak of the cycle margins that you see in that business historically? Or is it simply new customers, more volumes than you had projected in either the gas or the electric business?"

In this specific -- specifically, for 2016 where we're raising our power new business to grow by $50 million and 2017 by $100 million, it's really -- it's not related to those load margins. It's more specifically related to proprietary structured commercial opportunities that we have really solid line of sight into on our wholesale side of the business, quite frankly. To your point though, I think it's important to note we have raised our target $50 million each quarter for 2015 for a total of $100 million so far year-to-date and a lot of that has been driven by really 3 things. One is the monetization of loads that result in higher prices last year. So we have seen increased value from that load serving business, some of our optimization activities, and then we went in, as you saw from our disclosures last quarter, we went in with a short bias with the backstop of our own generation and given the results of market prices that in '15 to date, that performed well. We would only look to raise those targets, the power to go target to our non-power to go targets if we have good line of sight into specific opportunities and in this case, we do."

As you're aware, DR was already included in '18, '19 and beyond.

It is rarely granted. You have to show a likelihood of success on the merits. And the motion does not, on the merits of the underlying merger, raise any issues whatsoever. The only issue it raises is the suspicious [ph] purported conflict claim, which we think is very, very weak. So we don't think they attempted to meet that. They would also have to show irreparable harm, which they spent a paragraph trying to satisfy that. It's really not very persuasive in our view. They would have to show that it stays in the public interest. And of course, not only has the Maryland commission, but the New Jersey commission, the FERC, the Delaware commission have all found that this merger isn't a public interest and they have also have to show that the hardships favor them and then our pleading we lay out why disrupting the hardship potentially disrupting a $7 billion merger outweighs any hardships that would occur from the grant of the stay. So we think it's an extraordinary remedy. We don't think that they've come close to meeting those standards in any respect and the law is also very clear that in Maryland, it's not a balancing. They have to satisfy each and every one of those elements. And in this case, in our view, they haven't satisfied any of them. So that leaves us in a position where upon D.C. approval and assuming that the court agrees with the pleading we filed yesterday and doesn't grant a stay that promptly upon the D.C. commission joining the other commissions and timing that this isn't a public interest and assuming that any conditions that it imposes are not unduly burdensome, that we would close promptly."

We're pleased to report another strong quarter with our earnings coming in at $0.59 per share, surpassing our guidance of $0.45 to $0.55 per share. You'll hear more from Jack in a minute on the specifics and Joe Nigro also provide some color around the performance. 
We've seen a number of positive developments that affect various business this quarter. The 2 primary catalysts for us this year are the PHI acquisition and the capacity market auctions. We received the approval for the merger since our last call in Maryland in May. And leaving D.C., Washington, D.C. as our only outstanding jurisdiction to close the merger, which we expect to hear from soon, and we're looking forward to a positive outcome there. Upon closing the merger, our focus will shift to the integration of PHI utilities into the Exelon utilities to align our operations to better serve the PHI customers base. 
Another major catalyst is the capacity performance revisions that have been made. While we continue to believe that FERC came to the right conclusion putting reliability at the center of its planning process to ensure that customers in the region are well served, we always -- we're aware that DR and energy efficiency were in the '18, '19 auction, that the most recent change that allows DR and energy efficiency to provide -- to participate in a transition auctions, we believe, to be nonmaterial to the outcome. 
We are disappointed in the delay but we think that we'll be on the right track in to recognize the value of our highly reliable fleet going forward. 
And we remain confident that the capacity construct is the best way to protect the grid as we await further clarification on the timing of these transition auctions. I think we're getting that in the last days. So by the September time frame, we should have clear -- clarity on the value proposition, along with the reliability measures being enacted. 
In Illinois, the legislative session ended without a resolution on the market redesign for the low carbon standard, the low carbon portfolio standard. We were disappointed that we were not able to get this outcome before the session ended but understand where the state is focused right now on its budget priorities. The nuclear plants provide a significant value to the state and its economy and it's mostly important to its consumers.
Looking ahead, we have certain regulatory and operational triggers in September that require us to make some tough choices on the specific assets this fall, particularly in light of the continued pressure on the power markets. So we are continuing on with our disciplined plan on evaluating the assets and their likelihood to stay within the stack and we'll bring that to closure with our decision in September. 
Despite these market challenges, we continue to find ways to create value in our Constellation business, which Joe is going to talk about shortly. Part of our resilience to the power market weakness is driven by our ability to capitalize on our generation to load strategy. In this quarter, we showed the benefit from the lower cost to serve load, and increasing our utility business has been able to reduce the overall volatility at the enterprise level and deliver growth. 
You can expect that even more to be true over time, not only is it shifting our business mix with the acquisition of PHI, but it also, with our infrastructure improvement investments, we're investing $16 billion in our existing utilities over the next 5 years, which provides respectable growth rates and roughly another $7 billion with the addition of PHI.
I want to remind everybody that we can perform well even with the rising interest rate environment, which is typically a headwind in our industry. This is because our EPS is positively correlated to interest rates due to both ComEd's formula rate and ROE being tied to the 30-year treasury rate as well as the discount of our pension -- discounting the rates of our pension liability. Overall, we are positive the company is able to provide more stable and durable earnings streams for our shareholders with our operational expertise in driving performance across the enterprise.
With that, I'll turn it over to Joe, who will discuss the markets, followed by Jack on the financial performance."

The Constellation business is continuing to perform well in 2015 as a result of our generation to load matching strategy. My comments today will address market events during the second quarter and what they mean for our commercial business going forward, including our hedging strategy and our updated disclosures.
Starting with Slide 4. The spot power market in the second quarter has been defined by mild weather and lower natural gas prices, which drove the price of power considerably lower than in 2014 across all of PJM. The impact of low spot market condition has carried through to the forward markets with prices down approximately $0.45 per megawatt hour in 2016 and $1 per megawatt hour in 2017 at both PJM West Hub and NiHub since the end of the first quarter. 
The lack of liquidity in the forward markets has exacerbated the drops in power prices and heat rates with the forward markets exhibiting volatile price moves on very little trading volume for calendar 2017 and beyond, especially at NiHub. 
During the quarter, our hedging activities for 2016 to 2018 were executed through our retail and wholesale load businesses rather than on the over-the-counter market. Our fundamental view of power prices has not changed but given the drop in market prices, there is a greater gap between the market and our fundamental view due to current natural gas prices, expected retirements, new generation resources and load assumptions.   
Moving to Slide 5. I'll discuss the forward market and its impact on our hedging profile. During the second quarter, we maintained our behind ratable strategy and increased our cross commodity hedge position to increase exposure to power price upside. We had successfully used this behind ratable hedging strategy in the past when our view showed upside in the market. We are 4% to 5% behind ratable in 2016, and '17 and 7% to 8% behind ratable if you remove our cross commodity hedges at NiHub. We are confident in our ability to adjust our hedging strategies to capitalize on our fundamental view.
Turning to Slide 6, I will review our updated hedge disclosure and some key changes since the end of the first quarter. In 2015, we have a net $50 million increase to total gross margin since the end of the first quarter, driven primarily by strong performance and execution. We executed on $200 million of power new business and $50 million of non-power new business during the quarter. Based on 2015 performance to-date and expectations for the full year, we have increased our power new business target by $50 million.
Our generation to load strategy was successful last year during the extreme polar vortex conditions and it's serving us well this year under weaker load and price conditions. It is further augmented by strong performance from our portfolio optimization activity and our Integrys acquisition. 
For 2016, we saw prices decrease across most regions, decreasing around $0.45 per megawatt hour in both the Mid-Atlantic and the Midwest. This resulted in a decrease in our open gross margin of approximately $200 million, which was offset by our hedging activities.
During the quarter, we executed $100 million of power new business and $50 million of non-power new business, and are raising our power new business target by $50 million additional due to commercial opportunities for a gross margin increase of $50 million in 2016.
For 2017, prices decreased by approximately $1 per megawatt hour in both the Mid-Atlantic and Midwest. This resulted in a decrease of $300 million in our open gross margin. Despite the drop in prices, our total gross margin is only down $50 million due to our hedge position and an increase in our power new business target of $100 million because we have line of sight into additional commercial opportunities.
Since the beginning of the year, prices have fallen due to mild weather, lower gas prices, lower load demand in the Midwest and the lack of liquidity in the markets. Prices have fallen more in 2017 and beyond than in 2016. Although this weakness in the spot market has impacted forward markets, we are confident in our fundamental view of the gas and power markets and are positioning our portfolio to take advantage of this.
Now I'll turn it over to Jack to review the full financial information for the quarter."

We had another strong quarter. My remarks will cover our financial results for the quarter, third quarter guidance range and our cash outlook.
Starting with our second quarter results on Slide 7, Exelon exceeded our guidance range and delivered earnings of $0.59 per share. This compares to $0.51 per share for the second quarter of 2014. Exelon's utilities delivered combined earnings of $0.25 per share, and were flat to the second quarter of last year. During the quarter, we saw favorable weather at PECO and an unfavorable weather at ComEd. 
Cooling degree days were up nearly 37% from the prior year and 47.4% above normal in Southeastern Pennsylvania and down 34% from the prior year and 21.6% below normal in Northern Illinois. Distribution revenues at ComEd and BGE were higher quarter-over-quarter. In addition, BGE had a decrease in uncollectible accounts expense compared to the second quarter of 2014.
Exelon Generation had another strong quarter, delivering earnings of $0.36 per share, $0.09 higher than the same period last year. As Joe mentioned, our generation to load matching strategy continues to prove effective. We benefited from a lower cost to serve both our retail and wholesale customers and had strong performance from our portfolio management team. In addition, compared to the second quarter of 2014, we had fewer outage days at our nuclear plants, which had a positive contribution from the Integrys acquisition, higher realized nuclear decommissioning trust fund gains and received additional benefits quarter-over-quarter from the cancellation of the DOE's spent nuclear fee. These positive factors were partially offset by higher tax and interest expense. More detail on the quarter-over-quarter drivers for each operating company can be found on Slides 18 and 19 in the appendix.
For the third quarter, we are providing guidance of $0.65 to $0.75 per share. Accounting for the impact of the increased share counts and the debt associated with Pepco Holdings transaction and assuming the transaction closes in the third quarter, we are narrowing our full year guidance from $2.25 to $2.55 per share to $2.35 to $2.55 per share. Our guidance does not assume that bonus depreciation is extended.
Slide 8 provides an update on our cash flow expectations for this year. We've simplified the format of our slide to provide a clearer view of our cash flow at each operating company, including explicitly showing free cash flow. We project cash flow from operations of $6.6 billion. We project free cash flow of $900 million in generation in 2015. 80% of our total growth capital expenditures are being invested in our utilities over the next 3 years, which will provide stable earnings growth. 
In June, we completed the debt portion of our financing for the Pepco transaction by issuing $4.2 billion in senior notes with the majority of these proceeds being used to fund the transaction. Strong market demand allowed us to upsize the offering, enabling us to pull forward some future planned corporate debt issuances. We issued across the tenor [ph] spectrum with an average maturity of approximately 14 years and an average weighted average coupon of 3.79%.
Earlier this month, we completed the settlement of the equity forward transaction. The combination of these financings allows us to close the merger quickly upon receiving approval from the D.C. Public Service Commission. Our balance sheet remains strong and gives us the ability to invest and grow our business. As a reminder, the appendix includes several schedules that will help you in your modeling efforts.
Thank you, and we'll now open the line for questions."

First, when you talk about the commercial opportunities in the context of your comfort level raising your guidance for power new business to go, are we talking about sort of the inherent counter cyclicality of the margins in that business in the low wholesale environment, i.e., are we moving closer off the $2 floor in margins and closer to the $4, sort of, peak of the cycle margins that you see in that business historically? Or is it simply new customers, more volumes than you had projected in either the gas or the electric business?"

In this specific -- specifically, for 2016 where we're raising our power new business to grow by $50 million and 2017 by $100 million, it's really -- it's not related to those load margins. It's more specifically related to proprietary structured commercial opportunities that we have really solid line of sight into on our wholesale side of the business, quite frankly. To your point though, I think it's important to note we have raised our target $50 million each quarter for 2015 for a total of $100 million so far year-to-date and a lot of that has been driven by really 3 things. One is the monetization of loads that we sold at higher prices last year. So we have seen increased value from that load serving business, some of our optimization activities, and then we went in, as you saw from our disclosures last quarter, we went in with a short bias with the backstop of our own generation and given the results of market prices that in '15 to date, that performed well. We would only look to raise those targets, the power to go targets or non-power to go targets if we have good line of sight into specific opportunities and in this case, we do."

As you're aware, DR was already included in '18, '19 and beyond.

It is rarely granted. You have to show a likelihood of success on the merits. And the motion does not, on the merits of the underlying merger, raise any issues whatsoever. The only issue it raises is this thesis purported conflict claim, which we think is very, very weak. So we don't think they attempted to meet that. They would also have to show irreparable harm, which they spent a paragraph trying to satisfy that. It's really not very persuasive in our view. They would have to show that a stay is in the public interest. And of course, not only has the Maryland commission, but the New Jersey commission, the FERC, the Delaware commission have all found that this merger is in the public interest and they have also have to show that the hardships favor them and then our pleading we lay out why disrupting the hardship potentially disrupting a $7 billion merger outweighs any hardships that would occur from the grant of the stay. So we think it's an extraordinary remedy. We don't think that they've come close to meeting those standards in any respect. And the law is also very clear that in Maryland, it's not a balancing. They have to satisfy each and every one of those elements. And in this case, in our view, they haven't satisfied any of them. So that leaves us in a position where upon D.C. approval and assuming that the court agrees with the pleading we filed yesterday and doesn't grant a stay that promptly upon the D.C. commission joining the other commissions and finding that this is in the public interest and assuming that any conditions that it imposes are not unduly burdensome, that we would close promptly."

We're pleased to deliver another very strong quarter in what's been a very good year for us this far. 
First, I'll highlight our financial and operational performance, and then I'll switch over to our key strategic objectives. 
On the financial front, we're reporting operating earnings of $0.83 per share, over 6% EPS growth versus the same period last year and above our guidance range. 
Despite the delays in closing PHI, which I'll address further, we're still on track to deliver our best year of earnings since 2012. 
We're raising our guidance range to $2.40 to $2.60, and Jack will provide more details on the financial performance during his remarks. 
It's been a phenomenal year across our companies. At the utilities, we're set to invest $3.7 billion this year in needed infrastructure enhancements and grid reliability and resiliency modifications. Part of more than the $16 billion investments is planned over the next 5 years. This includes our smart meter installation program, which we now have completed nearly 5.5 million gas and electric installations across our operating companies. 
Our utilities will exceed $1 billion in net income in 2015, driven by industry-leading operational performance with each utility achieving first quartile safety, first and second quartile CAIDI results and ranking in first quartile in customer satisfaction. 
We reached settlement -- has reached settlement at PECO in its recent rate case filing, which follows the BGE recent unanimous rate case settlement in Maryland. This highlights how strong operational performance supports recovery and constructor regulatory environments. 
On the Generation side of the business, we have another solid quarter of operations performance. Nuclear capacity factor was 95.5, power dispatch match was 99%, renewable energy capture was 94.8%. 
We also had great execution at Constellation this quarter, showing the value of our generation to load max strategy and our ability to optimize our portfolio even during adverse market conditions in a way that contributes meaningfully to our earnings. 
The breadth of the Constellation platform gives us multiple channels to market. We are the #1 retail electric provider and well ahead of our nearest competitor. We serve nearly 200 terawatt hours of wholesale and retail load, and we're also a top 10 market of gas in the U.S., delivering 4 to 6 bcf of gas daily. 
On both sides of the company, we continue to run the business at high-level performance and the results are evident in this year's earnings. 
Now I want to discuss 3 key initiatives we have been working on this year: Capacity performance, low carbon portfolio standard and the effect of holdings merger. 
Starting with capacity performance, PJM's capacity performance design was implemented -- implementation this year's auctions with constructive results. We are pleased with the outcome and the capacity auctions. The new penalty structure will hold generators accountable for the liability for the benefit of customers. 
For the '18/'19 auction, we cleared a significant number of megawatts at higher-priced zones and these prices exceeded our own internal expectations. The transition auctions better reflect the value of the reliability of our nuclear units that they provide to the grid. 
Our next major initiative was getting a low-power portfolio standard past. We came into the year advocating for better market design in Illinois, one that will level the playing field for nuclear energy as a key resource in the state. We work hard to introduce the carbon standard earlier this year. However, the political situation the state has made the budget the sole focus, leaving little opportunity for progress on energy legislation. 
We are disappointed that we have not made the progress on this front. However, the overall outlook for the nuclear fleet has improved as a result of policy and market factors, namely, the constructive results of the capacity auction; the positive results from Illinois power agencies capacity procurement for 2016; the long-term impact of the Environmental Protection Agency's new carbon reduction rules. 
As a result, we have decided, as announced, to differ another year's decision about the future Quad Cities fired in Clinton. 
Having said that, the low-power -- the low carbon portfolio standard remains a good policy for Illinois and a priority for Illinois. 
And the last key initiative was the Pepco acquisition. Let me take time to share our perspective on where we're at with the deal. 
We are very excited we reached a settlement with the Government of the District of Columbia, the Office of People's Counsel, the Office of the Attorney General and others in D.C. A settlement includes commitments to provide substantially enhanced benefits to the consumer and businesses in the district. It includes no credits, low income assistance and fewer and shorter outages. A cleaner, greener D.C., an investment in local jobs in the local economy. 
The settlement package was specifically shaped to address the concerns articulated by the D.C. Public Service Commission in its August quarter. 
As you've seen, we have improved the reliability of the customer satisfaction at BGE and see the benefits of those performance improvements reflected in regulatory outcomes. We look forward to the opportunity to do the same with the Pepco family of utilities. 
The deal remains an important strategic element to the future of Exelon, allowing us to shift our business mix to a more regulated and durable earnings stream. 
We realize the deal has taken longer than expected, and we know that is required patience for many parts, especially our investors as we work to complete it. 
We received an order from the D.C. Public Service Commission 2 days ago that moves us in the right direction. The Commission granted our request to reopen the records and consider the settlements in existing docket. A schedule that was set -- that is in line with our proposed time line. And the Commission is committed to consider the settlement in a fashion that is open, transparent and fair. We appreciate the Commission's commitment to ruling on the merger in a timely manner and we ask for your support as we get this across the finish line. 
It has been a busy, busy year. We have accomplished a lot and there's a lot left to be done. 
In particular, we are embarking on a large-scale cost management initiative, we'll provide more details at the EEI financial conference. We're pleased with the performance we've delivered for our shareholders this year despite a significant market and regulatory headwinds as we always, we're working hard to serve our customers and the communities where we serve better. 
I'll now turn the call over to Joe, will discuss the markets."

The Constellation business had another strong quarter outperforming our targets. 
Our portfolio management team performed very well and as Chris mentioned, our retail and wholesale business is having a very strong year. 
In addition, our core strategy of matching our generation fleet with our load business continues to provide significant value for our shareholders. It has been paying off across the volatility and price spectrum. We have captured higher prices for our Generation during a period of extreme weather, while managing our load obligations, and we've captured higher margins during low volatility periods like this summer as we realized lower cost-to-serve our customers. 
It also provides us with an important channel to market for our hedging activities, which is important in times of low liquidity and in places where there is not an active market. Our past results and our current hedge disclosures show that our business can drive in either market environment, can provide a great deal of value to the enterprise. 
My comments today will focus on power and gas markets during the quarter and our fundamental view. The recent PJM capacity performance auction and our hedge disclosures in hedging activity. 
Turning to the power markets on Slide 4. NiHub remains undervalued even independent of gas prices. PJM West prices more fairly valued when accounting for the new generation underdeveloped -- under development and expected in the East. 
Our fundamental view of our power remains unchanged. In addition, we especially see upside in the non-winter months and during off-peak hours. 
The difference between our fundamental view and the near-term forward market pricing at NiHub is primarily driven by changes in the dispatched stock. 
Additionally, fuel and coal market during contango while power is back abated, which is unusual. We think this is all contributing to lower prices in our view to support. 
During the summer, the impact of the change of staff will mass across the powerful because we didn't see the peak loads that we expected and deliver natural gas prices were extremely low. 
While we saw quite key rates continue to deliver high, the absolute price was driven lower by the fuel prices. 
If we extended this picture on the slide further out in the curve, you will see an even greater disconnect between forward curve and our fundamental view, driven mostly by a lack of liquidity. This lack of liquidity at NiHub is in most years, and we are seeing that in West Hub in 2019 and beyond, I particular. 
Because of this lack of liquidity, our hedging activities mostly continue to be done through our load business and not in the over-the-counter markets. 
We continue to align our hedging strategy with our views of the market, and in 2017, remain behind ratable with 6% to 9% of power exposure. 
We have even further behind -- we are even further behind ratable in the Midwest with power exposure at 17% to 20%. 
This strategy exposes us to the significant upside we still see in that market, while partially protecting us for any further degradation in natural gas prices through our cross commodity hedges. 
Before turning to the hedge disclosure itself, I'd like to touch on the recent PJM capacity auctions. Chris covered the results of the auction minutes ago, so little focus on the key takeaways from the auction. The biggest impact was bidding behavior. 
In the '18/'19 base residual auction and the transition auction, we saw market participants bidding in a more disciplined manner and recognizing the risk of penalties for nonperformance. 
In addition, about half of the newbuilds cleared versus what we saw in the '17, '18 auction. 
And finally, the vast majority of demand response cleared the base product, which may have read through value at PJM transitions to 100% capacity for performance products in 2 years. 
As I mentioned earlier, our load business remains solid. Our originations have been strong and our generation to load matching strategy worked well throughout the year 's. You can see the impact of this strategy throughout the gross margin disclosures. 
In 2015, we have a net $200 million increase in total gross margin since the end of the second quarter. We started the third quarter with $100 million power new business target remaining for the year. We have strong performance during the quarter, executing $200 million in power new business with the majority realized in the quarter. 
As a result of this performance, we raised our power new business target by $150 million, resulting in only $50 million of power new business to go through the fourth quarter. 
Our performance was driven by our generation to load match strategy, including a lower cost to serve on load across the portfolio and our position management activities of short bias to the backstop of our generation. 
As an example, Texas experienced quite a bit of heat in early August, and we saw the reserve margins in their cot come in as much as 10% lower than projected on those days. Stock prices increased, and we benefited in captured value from this move. 
As a result, we're also seeing upward movement in near cup pricing in the forward curve. 
In 2016, the impact of capacity performance auction increased total gross margin by $150 million. This was partially offset by market price declines net of hedges of $50 million. 
During the quarter, we executed on $150 million of new business and are raising our 2016 power new business target by $200 million to $500 million total remaining. This compares to a $400 million new business target build for 2015 at the same point last year. 
We are confident we can make this new target next year given our performance this year and the addition of the Integrys acquisition. 
In 2017, our total gross margin increased by $200 million to $7.8 billion. 
Capacity performance results added $300 million to total gross margin, which was partially offset by $100 million decrease due to the impact of lower prices on our open generation net of hedges. 
During the quarter, we executed $100 million of power new business. 
We are confident that we have the right hedges in strategies to capture the upside we see coming in the market and we have proven that our generations to load matching strategy brings value in both the low and high volatility environment. 
I'll now turn it over to Jack to discuss the financial results for the quarter."

As Chris and Joe stated, we had another strong quarter financially and operationally. My remarks will focus on our financial results for the quarter, our full year guidance range and provide an update on our cash outlook for 2015. 
Starting with our third quarter results on Slide 6, Exelon delivered earnings of $0.83 per share, exceeding our guidance range by $0.08.  This compares to $0.78 per share for the third quarter of 2014. 
Exelon's utilities delivered combined earnings of $0.33 per share, outperforming the third quarter of last year by $0.04. 
During the quarter, we saw favorable weather at both PECO and ComEd. Cooling degree days were up 30% from the prior year and 28% above normal in Southeastern Pennsylvania and up 18% from the prior year and 3% above normal in Northern Illinois. 
Distribution revenues at both ComEd and BGE were higher quarter-over-quarter, reflecting the impacts of increased capital investment and higher rates respectively. 
On September 10, PECO reached a settlement on its rate case filing. The agreed-upon revenue requirement increase of $127 million represent 67% of the original proposal. 
The Pennsylvania PUC's decision is expected in December of this year with rates going into effect on January 1, 2016. 
The Pennsylvania PUC recently approved the new system 2020 plan, which will lead to an additional $275 million being invested during the next 5 years to install advanced equipment and reinforce the local electric system, making it more weather resistant and less vulnerable to storm damage. 
An order on ComEd's annual formula rate filing is expected to be issued by the ICC in early to mid-December. As a reminder, ComEd requested a revenue decrease of $55 million in its current filing. 
This reduction reflects the continued focus on cost management and operational efficiencies that are being realized from a stronger, more reliable rate with fewer outages. More detail on each of these rate cases can be found in the appendix on Slide 19 through 21. 
Turning to Exelon Generation, it had another strong quarter, delivering earnings of $0.55 per share, $0.05 higher than the same period last year. 
As Joel mentioned, our generation to load matching strategy continues to provide value for our business and our shareholders. We benefited from a lower cost to serve, both our retail and wholesale customers and had another strong quarter performance from our portfolio management team. 
In addition, compared to the third quarter of 2014, we had a positive contribution from the Integrys acquisition. These positive factors were partially offset by realized nuclear decommissioning trust fund losses in 2015 as compared to gains in 2014 and the impacts of divestitures of certain generating assets in 2014. 
Last week, we filed a settlement agreement with the New York PSC and FERC in regards to our denied facility. The new agreement shortens the RSSA period by 18 months, includes more market-based revenue and requires that any extension must be justified by a study. The settlement is still subject to approval by both the FERC and the New York PSC. 
While we're pleased with the negotiated RSSA will allow [indiscernible] to continue powering the grid and the local economy into 2017, it's only a temporary solution to a long-term problem. 
Single unit nuclear facilities like [indiscernible] face significant economic challenges brought on by poor market conditions and a lack of energy policies that properly value the clean and reliable energy that nuclear provides. 
More detail on the quarter-over-quarter drivers for each operating company to be found on Slide 17 and 18 on the appendix. 
As Chris mentioned, we are raising our full year guidance range for earnings to $2.40 to $2.60 per share. 
At the beginning of the year, we provided the standalone guidance range of $2.25 to $2.55 per share. We narrowed the range in our second quarter earnings call to $2.35 to $2.55. This guidance range included the impact of the debt and share dilution from the PHI merger and assume that the merger will close during the third quarter. 
Since the merger did not close, we have $0.13 of earnings drag from the interest expense and shared dilution. Without this drag, we would have expected full year earnings to exceed the top end of our new guidance range of $2.40 to $2.60 per share due to strong performance of both the utilities and Constellation this year. 
Consistent with our past practice, our guidance range does not include the impact of an extension of bonus depreciation, which we would expect to be around an $0.08 decrease per share. 
Nonetheless, we are comfortable that we will still be in the guidance range even if bonus depreciation were to be extended. 
Turning back to Pepco for a minute. We will meet our original deal case accretion of $0.15 to $0.20. However, it will be pushed back until 2019. 
In addition, we expect the impacts of the merger to be neutral in 2017 and $0.07 to $0.12 accretive in 2018.  These changes are primarily due to the delay in closing, the merger, the consequent updates to PHI's business plan as a result of this delay and due to the meaningful improvement in Exelon's business plan. The deal remains critically important to our long-term strategy. 
Slide 7 provides an update on our cash flow expectations for this year. We project cash from operations of $6.8 billion across our businesses and free cash flow of $925 million at generation in 2015. 
As you can see, our projected earnings cash balance is roughly $9.6 billion for the year. Most of this is related to the fact that we were able to fund necessary to close the Pepco merger, which, as you know, has been delayed.  $2.75 billion of the debt was subject to redemption if the merger does not close by December 31. 
Yesterday, we announced that exchange offering to amend the mandatory redemption date in those notes. This action will minimize our refinancing risk and allow our bondholders to stand best in the bond as year-end approaches. 
In closing, I want to reiterate that our company can perform well in a rising interest-rate environment, which is typically a headwind for our industry. This is because earnings are positively correlated to interest rates due to both ComEd's ROE being directly tied to the 30-year treasury rate as well as the discounting of our pension liabilities. 
As a general rule, every 25 basis point increase in interest rates equates to roughly $0.02 of consolidated earnings uplift related to ComEd in the pension. 
Thank you. And we'll now open the line for questions."

The second thing is we serve a lot of wholesale as well, which has a different margin structure associated with them. But the money that we made in the third quarter, which is really driven by 3 key things: The first thing is if you go back and look our hedge exposure again in the second quarter, we were effectively 100% hedged across our book for the year. And so we set up with the short bias recognize that the backstop generation starts loading market. The second thing is we costed our loads when we sold them, the risk premiums were much higher than what was realized in the stock market primarily driven by the low, low gas prices during the third quarter. And then the last thing is, we took an opportunity when the prices dropped in ERCOT through the summer to materially positioning longer as we walked into August, and then we saw some volatility and we capitalized them as well. So it's really those 3 components that drove the values."

We have still need the low-power portfolio standard to cement a long-term viability of these assets. But quad is just marginal flat on free cash flow, it's just slightly dilutive on earnings. And if we can move the CP along, it will greatly improve that. Byron is in a little bit later shape based off from CPN and we'll continue to watch that closely. On Clinton, we were prepared with no action taken on the capacity market to go forward with the retirement. We have seen a commitment and action at MISO to evaluate Zone 4 as it's only competitive, real competitive market to evaluate the redesign of the capacity construct that would adequately compensate the generators for the investments they're making.

At the utilities, we're set to invest $3.7 billion this year in needed infrastructure enhancements and grid reliability and resiliency modifications, part of more than the $16 billion investment that's planned over the next 5 years. This includes our smart meter installation program, which we now have completed nearly 5.5 million gas and electric installations across our operating companies. 
Our utilities will exceed $1 billion in net income in 2015, driven by industry-leading operational performance with each utility achieving first quartile safety, first and second quartile CAIDI results and ranking in first quartile in customer satisfaction. 
We reached settlement -- reached a settlement at PECO in its recent rate case filing, which follows the BGE recent unanimous rate case settlement in Maryland. This highlights how strong operational performance supports recovery in constructor regulatory environments. 
On the Generation side of the business, we have another solid quarter of operations performance. Nuclear capacity factor was 95.5%, power dispatch match was 99%, renewable energy capture was 94.8%. 
We also had great execution at Constellation this quarter, showing the value of our generation to load maxing strategy and our ability to optimize our portfolio even during adverse market conditions in a way that contributes meaningfully to our earnings. 
The breadth of the Constellation platform gives us multiple channels to market. We are the #1 retail electric provider and well ahead of our nearest competitor. We serve nearly 200 terawatt hours of wholesale and retail load, and we're also a top 10 marketer of gas in the U.S., delivering 4 to 6 bcf of gas daily. 
On both sides of the company, we continue to run the business at high levels of performance and the results are evident in this year's earnings. 
Now I want to discuss 3 key initiatives we have been working on this year: capacity performance, low carbon portfolio standard, and the Pepco Holdings merger. 
Starting with capacity performance. PJM's capacity performance design was implemented -- went into implementation in this year's auctions with constructive results. We are pleased with the outcome of the capacity auctions. The new penalty structure will hold generators accountable for liability to the benefit of customers. 
For the '18, '19 auction, we cleared a significant number of megawatts at higher-priced zones and these prices exceeded our own internal expectations. The transition auctions better reflect the value of the reliability of our nuclear units that they provide to the grid. 
Our next major initiative was getting a low-power portfolio standard passed. We came into the year advocating for better market design in Illinois, one that would level the playing field for nuclear energy as a key resource in the state. We worked hard to introduce the carbon standard earlier this year. However, the political situation the state has made the budget the sole focus, leaving little opportunity for progress on energy legislation. 
We are disappointed that we have not made the progress on this front. However, the overall outlook for the nuclear fleet has improved as a result of policy and market factors, namely, the constructive results of the capacity auction; the positive results from Illinois power agencies capacity procurement for 2016; the long-term impact of the Environmental Protection Agency's new carbon reduction rules. 
As a result, we have decided, as announced, to defer another year's decision about the future Quad Cities Byron and Clinton. 
Having said that, the low power -- the low carbon portfolio standard remains a good policy for Illinois and a priority for Illinois. 
Our last key initiative was the Pepco acquisition. Let me take time to share our perspective on where we're at with the deal. 
We are very excited we reached a settlement with the Government of the District of Columbia, the Office of People's Counsel, the Office of the Attorney General and others in D.C. The settlement includes commitments to provide substantially enhanced benefits to the consumer and businesses in the district. It includes low credits, low income assistance and fewer and shorter outages. A cleaner, greener D.C., an investment in local jobs in the local economy. 
The settlement package was specifically shaped to address the concerns articulated by the D.C. Public Service Commission in its August quarter. 
As you've seen, we have improved the reliability and the customer satisfaction at BGE and see the benefits of those performance improvements reflected in regulatory outcomes. We look forward to the opportunity to do the same with the Pepco family of utilities. 
The deal remains an important strategic element to the future of Exelon, allowing us to shift our business mix to a more regulated and durable earnings stream. 
We realize the deal has taken longer than expected, and we know that has required patience for many parties, especially our investors as we work to complete it. 
We received an order from the D.C. Public Service Commission 2 days ago that moves us in the right direction. The commission granted our request to reopen the record and consider the settlement in existing docket. A schedule that was set -- that is in line with our proposed time line. And the commission is committed to consider the settlement in a fashion that is open, transparent and fair. We appreciate the commission's commitment to ruling on the merger in a timely manner and we ask for your support as we get this across the finish line. 
It has been a busy, busy year. We've accomplished a lot and there's a lot left to be done. 
In particular, we're embarking on a large-scale cost management initiative. We'll provide more details at the EEI financial conference. We are pleased with the performance we've delivered for the shareholders this year despite the significant market and regulatory headwinds. As we always, we're working hard to serve our customers and the communities that we -- where we serve better. 
I'll now turn the call over to Joe, who will discuss the markets."

The Constellation business had another strong quarter outperforming our targets.

The Constellation business had another strong quarter outperforming our targets. 
Our portfolio management team performed very well and as Chris mentioned, our retail and wholesale business is having a very strong year. 
In addition, our core strategy of matching our generation fleet with our load business continues to provide significant value for our shareholders. It has been paying off across the volatility and price spectrum. We have captured higher prices for our Generation during periods of extreme weather while managing our load obligations, and we've captured higher margins during low volatility periods like this summer as we've realized lower cost to serve our customers. 
It also provides us with an important channel to market for our hedging activity, which is important in times of low liquidity and in places where there is not an active market. Our past results and our current hedge disclosures show that our business can thrive in either market environment, can provide a great deal of value to the enterprise. 
My comments today will focus on power and gas markets during the quarter and our fundamental view, the recent PJM capacity performance auction and our hedge disclosures in hedging activity. 
Turning to the power markets on Slide 4. NiHub remains undervalued even independent of gas prices. PJM West price is more fairly valued when accounting for the new generation underdeveloped -- under development and expected in the east. 
Our fundamental view of power prices remains unchanged. In addition, we especially see upside in the nonwinter months and during off-peak hours. 
The difference between our fundamental view and the near-term forward market pricing at NiHub is primarily driven by changes in the dispatch stack. 
Additionally, fuel and coal market are in contango while power is backward-dated, which is unusual. We think this is all contributing to lower prices in our views we support. 
During the summer, the impact of the change in the stack were masked across the power pool because we didn't see the peak loads that we expected and delivered natural gas prices were extremely low. 
While we saw applied heat rates continue to deliver high, the absolute price was driven lower by the fuel prices. 
If we extended this picture on the slide further out on the curve, you would see an even greater disconnect between the forward curve and our fundamental view, driven mostly by a lack of liquidity. This lack of liquidity at NiHub is in most years, and we are seeing it in West Hub in 2019 and beyond, in particular. 
Because of this lack of liquidity, our hedging activities mostly continue to be done through our load business and not in the over-the-counter markets. 
We continue to align our hedging strategy with our views of the market, and in 2017, remain behind ratable with 6% to 9% of power exposure. 
We have even further behind -- we are even further behind ratable in the Midwest with power exposure at 17% to 20%. 
This strategy exposes us to the significant upside we still see in that market, while partially protecting us from any further degradation of natural gas prices through our cross commodity hedges. 
Before turning to the hedge disclosure itself, I'd like to touch on the recent PJM capacity auctions. Chris covered the results of the auction a few minutes ago, so I'll focus on the key takeaways from the auction. The biggest impact was bidding behavior. 
In the '18, '19 base residual auction and the transition auction, we saw market participants bidding in a more disciplined manner and recognizing the risks of penalties for nonperformance. 
In addition, about half the newbuilds cleared versus what we saw in the '17, '18 auction. 
And finally, the vast majority of demand response cleared as the base product, which may have readthrough value as PJM transitions to 100% capacity for performance product in 2 years. 
As I mentioned earlier, our load business remains solid. Our originations have been strong and our generation to load matching strategy has worked well throughout the year. You can see the impact of this strategy throughout the gross margin disclosures. 
In 2015, we have a net $200 million increase in total gross margin since the end of the second quarter. We started the third quarter with $100 million power new business target remaining for the year. We had strong performance during the quarter, executing $200 million in power new business with the majority realized in the quarter. 
As a result of this performance, we raised our power new business target by $150 million, resulting in only $50 million of power new business to go through the fourth quarter. 
Our performance was driven by our generation to load matching strategy, including a lower cost to serve on load across the portfolio and our position management activity of short bias to the backstop of our generation. 
As an example, Texas experienced quite a bit of heat in early August, and we saw the reserve margins in ERCOT come in as much as 10% lower than projected on those days. Spot prices increased, and we benefited and captured value from this move. 
As a result, we are also seeing upward movement in ERCOT pricing in the forward curve. 
In 2016, the impact of capacity performance auctions increased total gross margin by $150 million. This was partially offset by market price declines net of hedges of $50 million. 
During the quarter, we executed on $150 million of new business and are raising our 2016 power new business target by $200 million to $500 million total remaining. This compares to a $400 million new business target to go for 2015 at the same point last year. 
We are confident we can make this new target next year given our performance this year and the addition of the Integrys acquisition. 
In 2017, our total gross margin increased by $200 million to $7.8 billion. 
Capacity performance results added $300 million to total gross margin, which was partially offset by $100 million decrease due to the impact of lower prices on our open generation net of hedges. 
During the quarter, we executed $100 million of power new business. 
We are confident that we have the right hedging strategy to capture the upside we see coming in the market and we have proven that our generation to load matching strategy brings value in both the low and high volatility environment. 
I'll now turn it over to Jack to discuss the financial results for the quarter."

As Chris and Joe stated, we had another strong quarter financially and operationally. My remarks will focus on our financial results for the quarter, our full year guidance range and provide an update on our cash outlook for 2015. 
Starting with our third quarter results on Slide 6, Exelon delivered earnings of $0.83 per share, exceeding our guidance range by $0.08. This compares to $0.78 per share for the third quarter of 2014. 
Exelon's utilities delivered combined earnings of $0.33 per share, outperforming the third quarter of last year by $0.04. 
During the quarter, we saw favorable weather at both PECO and ComEd. Cooling degree days were up 30% from the prior year and 28% above normal in Southeastern Pennsylvania and up 18% from the prior year and 3% above normal in Northern Illinois. 
Distribution revenues at both ComEd and BGE were higher quarter-over-quarter, reflecting the impacts of increased capital investment and higher rates, respectively. 
On September 10, PECO reached a settlement on its rate case filing. The agreed-upon revenue requirement increase of $127 million represent 67% of the original proposal. 
The Pennsylvania PUC's decision is expected in December of this year with rates going into effect on January 1, 2016. 
The Pennsylvania PUC recently approved the new system 2020 plan, which will lead to an additional $275 million being invested during the next 5 years to install advanced equipment and reinforce the local electric system, making it more weather resistant and less vulnerable to storm damage. 
An order on ComEd's annual formula rate filing is expected to be issued by the ICC in early to mid-December. As a reminder, ComEd requested a revenue decrease of $55 million in its current filing. 
This reduction reflects the continued focus on cost management and operational efficiencies that are being realized from a stronger, more reliable grid with fewer outages. More detail on each of these rate cases can be found in the appendix on Slides 19 through 21. 
Turning to Exelon Generation. It had another strong quarter, delivering earnings of $0.55 per share, $0.05 higher than the same period last year. 
As Joe mentioned, our generation to load matching strategy continues to provide value for our business and our shareholders. We benefited from a lower cost to serve, both our retail and wholesale customers and had another strong quarter of performance from our portfolio management team. 
In addition, compared to the third quarter of 2014, we had a positive contribution from the Integrys acquisition. These positive factors were partially offset by realized nuclear decommissioning trust fund losses in 2015 as compared to gains in 2014 and the impacts of divestitures of certain generating assets in 2014. 
Last week, we filed a settlement agreement with the New York PSC and FERC in regards to our Ginna facility. The new agreement shortens the RSSA period by 18 months, includes more market-based revenue and requires that any extension must be justified by a study. The settlement is still subject to approval by both the FERC and the New York PSC. 
While we're pleased with the negotiated RSSA will allow Ginna to continue powering the grid and the local economy until 2017, it's only a temporary solution to a long-term problem. 
Single unit nuclear facilities like Ginna face significant economic challenges brought on by poor market conditions and a lack of energy policies that properly value the clean and reliable energy that nuclear provides. 
More detail on the quarter-over-quarter drivers for each operating company can be found on Slide 17 and 18 in the appendix. 
As Chris mentioned, we are raising our full year guidance range for earnings to $2.40 to $2.60 per share. 
At the beginning of the year, we provided a standalone guidance range of $2.25 to $2.55 per share. We narrowed the range in our second quarter earnings call to $2.35 to $2.55. This guidance range included the impacts of the debt and share dilution from the PHI merger and assume that the merger would close during the third quarter. 
Since the merger did not close, we have $0.13 of earnings drag from the interest expense and share dilution. Without this drag, we would have expected full year earnings to exceed the top end of our new guidance range of $2.40 to $2.60 per share due to strong performance of both the utilities and Constellation this year. 
Consistent with our past practice, our guidance range does not include the impact of an extension of bonus depreciation, which we would expect to be around an $0.08 decrease per share. 
Nonetheless, we are comfortable that we will still be in the guidance range even if bonus depreciation were to be extended. 
Turning back to Pepco for a minute. We will meet our original deal case accretion of $0.15 to $0.20. However, it will be pushed back until 2019. 
In addition, we expect the impacts of the merger to be neutral in 2017 and $0.07 to $0.12 accretive in 2018. These changes are primarily due to the delay in closing the merger, the consequent updates to PHI's business plan as a result of this delay and due to the meaningful improvement in Exelon's business plan. The deal remains critically important to our long-term strategy. 
Slide 7 provides an update on our cash flow expectations for this year. We project cash from operations of $6.8 billion across our businesses and free cash flow of $925 million at generation in 2015. 
As you can see, our projected ending cash balance is roughly $9.6 billion for the year. Most of this is related to the fact that we raised the funds necessary to close the Pepco merger, which, as you know, has been delayed. $2.75 billion of the debt was subject to redemption if the merger does not close by December 31. 
Yesterday, we announced the debt exchange offering to amend the mandatory redemption date in those notes. This action will minimize our refinancing risk and allow our bondholders to stand best in the bond as year end approaches. 
In closing, I want to reiterate that our company can perform well in a rising interest rate environment, which is typically a headwind for our industry. This is because earnings are positively correlated to interest rates due to both ComEd's ROE being directly tied to the 30-year treasury rate as well as the discounting of our pension liabilities. 
As a general rule, every 25 basis point increase in interest rates equates to roughly $0.02 of consolidated earnings uplift related to ComEd in the pension. 
Thank you. And we'll now open the line for questions."

As for the margin, I think, about it more on a total portfolio basis because there's retail margins are one component of it. The second thing is we serve a lot of wholesale polar load as well, which have a different margin structure associated with them. But the money that we made in the third quarter was really driven by 3 key things. The first thing is if you go back and look at our hedge disclosure again in the second quarter, we were effectively 100% hedged across our book for the year. And so we set up with a short bias recognizing we had the backstop of our own generation to serve load if the market got volatile. The second thing is we costed our loads. When we sold them, the risk premiums were much higher than what was realized in the spot market primarily driven by the low, low gas prices during the third quarter. And then the last thing is, we took an opportunity when the prices dropped in ERCOT through the summer to materially get our positioning longer as we walked into August, and then we saw some volatility and we capitalized on that as well. So it was really those 3 components that drove the value."

And if we can move the CP along, it will greatly improve that. Byron is in a little bit better shape based off of CP, and we'll continue to watch that closely. On Clinton, we were prepared with no action taken on the capacity market to go forward with the retirement. We have seen a commitment and action at MISO to evaluate Zone 4 as it's only competitive -- real competitive market to evaluate a redesign of a capacity construct that would adequately compensate the generators for the investments they're making. We've also seen positive signals from the State of Illinois by evaluating -- starting workshops to evaluate the problem statement and workshops to look at potential fixes on Zone 4 in Southern Illinois. So now that we've seen some potential for improvement, we're willing to go another year. That unit -- Clinton is one of our newest units in the fleet.

So we -- that's part of it, the coal retirement is a part of it. We have seen heat wave expansion even at these low gas prices, we think some of that is being masked quite frankly, by the fuel being so low. But when you put all of that together and then the complete lack of liquidity, that's where we're coming up with the driver of higher prices in the future."

We're pleased to deliver another very strong quarter in what's been a very good year for us thus far. 
First, I'll highlight our financial and operational performance, and then I'll switch over to our key strategic objectives. 
On the financial front, we're reporting operating earnings of $0.83 per share, over 6% EPS growth versus the same period last year and above our guidance range. 
Despite the delays in closing PHI, which I'll address further, we're still on track to deliver our best year of earnings since 2012. 
We are raising our guidance range to $2.40 to $2.60, and Jack will provide more details on the financial performance during his remarks. 
It's been a phenomenal year across our companies. At the utilities, we're set to invest $3.7 billion this year in needed infrastructure enhancements and grid reliability and resiliency modifications, part of more than the $16 billion investment that's planned over the next 5 years. This includes our smart meter installation program, which we now have completed nearly 5.5 million gas and electric installations across our operating companies. 
Our utilities will exceed $1 billion in net income in 2015, driven by industry-leading operational performance with each utility achieving first quartile SAIFI, first and second quartile CAIDI results and ranking in first quartile in customer satisfaction. 
We reached settlement -- reached a settlement at PECO in its recent rate case filing, which follows the BGE recent unanimous rate case settlement in Maryland. This highlights how strong operational performance supports recovery in constructor regulatory environments. 
On the Generation side of the business, we had another solid quarter of operations performance. Nuclear capacity factor was 95.5%, power dispatch match was 99%, renewable energy capture was 94.8%. 
We also had great execution at Constellation this quarter, showing the value of our generation to load-maxing strategy and our ability to optimize our portfolio even during adverse market conditions in a way that contributes meaningfully to our earnings. 
The breadth of the Constellation platform gives us multiple channels to market. We are the #1 retail electric provider and well ahead of our nearest competitor. We serve nearly 200 terawatt hours of wholesale and retail load, and we're also a top 10 marketer of gas in the U.S., delivering 4 to 6 bcf of gas daily. 
On both sides of the company, we continue to run the business at high levels of performance, and the results are evident in this year's earnings. 
Now I want to discuss 3 key initiatives we have been working on this year: capacity performance, low carbon portfolio standard, and the Pepco Holdings merger. 
Starting with capacity performance. PJM's capacity performance design was implemented -- went into implementation in this year's auctions, with constructive results. We are pleased with the outcome of the capacity auctions. The new penalty structure will hold generators accountable for liability to the benefit of customers. 
For the '18, '19 auction, we cleared a significant number of megawatts at higher-priced zones, and these prices exceeded our own internal expectations. The transition auctions better reflect the value of the reliability of our nuclear units that they provide to the grid. 
Our next major initiative was getting a low-power portfolio standard passed. We came into the year advocating for better market design in Illinois, one that would level the playing field for nuclear energy as a key resource in the state. We worked hard to introduce the carbon standard earlier this year. However, the political situation in the state has made the budget the sole focus, leaving little opportunity for progress on energy legislation. 
We are disappointed that we have not made the progress on this front. However, the overall outlook for the nuclear fleet has improved as a result of policy and market factors, namely, the constructive results of the capacity auction; the positive results from Illinois power agencies capacity procurement for 2016; the long-term impact of the Environmental Protection Agency's new carbon reduction rules. 
As a result, we have decided, as announced, to defer another year's decision about the future Quad Cities, Byron and Clinton. 
Having said that, the low power -- the low carbon portfolio standard remains a good policy for Illinois and a priority for Illinois. 
Our last key initiative was the Pepco acquisition. Let me take time to share our perspective on where we're at with the deal. 
We are very excited we reached a settlement with the Government of the District of Columbia, the Office of People's Counsel, the Office of the Attorney General and others in D.C. The settlement includes commitments to provide substantially enhanced benefits to the consumer and businesses in the district. It includes bill credits, low-income assistance and fewer and shorter outages. A cleaner, greener D.C., and investment in local jobs and the local economy. 
The settlement package was specifically shaped to address the concerns articulated by the D.C. Public Service Commission in its August quarter. 
As you've seen, we have improved the reliability and the customer satisfaction at BGE and see the benefits of those performance improvements reflected in regulatory outcomes. We look forward to the opportunity to do the same with the Pepco family of utilities. 
The deal remains an important strategic element to the future of Exelon, allowing us to shift our business mix to a more regulated and durable earnings stream. 
We realize the deal has taken longer than expected, and we know that has required patience for many parties, especially our investors, as we work to complete it. 
We received an order from the D.C. Public Service Commission 2 days ago that moves us in the right direction. The commission granted our request to reopen the record and consider the settlement in the existing docket. A schedule that was set, that is in line with our proposed time line. And the commission is committed to consider the settlement in a fashion that is open, transparent and fair. We appreciate the commission's commitment to ruling on the merger in a timely manner, and we ask for your support as we get this across the finish line. 
It has been a busy, busy year. We've accomplished a lot and there's a lot left to be done. 
In particular, we're embarking on a large-scale cost management initiative. We'll provide more details at the EEI financial conference. We are pleased with the performance we've delivered for the shareholders this year despite the significant market and regulatory headwinds. As we always, we're working hard to serve our customers and the communities that we serve better. 
I'll now turn the call over to Joe, who will discuss the markets."

The Constellation business had another strong quarter, outperforming our targets. 
Our portfolio management team performed very well, and as Chris mentioned, our retail and wholesale business is having a very strong year. 
In addition, our core strategy of matching our generation fleet with our load business continues to provide significant value for our shareholders. It has been paying off across the volatility and price spectrum. We have captured higher prices for our generation during periods of extreme weather while managing our load obligations, and we've captured higher margins during low-volatility periods like this summer, as we've realized lower cost to serve our customers. 
It also provides us with an important channel to market for our hedging activity, which is important in times of low liquidity and in places where there is not an active market. Our past results and our current hedge disclosures show that our business can thrive in either market environment and provide a great deal of value to the enterprise. 
My comments today will focus on power and gas markets during the quarter and our fundamental view, the recent PJM capacity performance auction and our hedge disclosures and hedging activity. 
Turning to the power markets on Slide 4. NiHub remains undervalued even independent of gas prices. PJM West price is more fairly valued when accounting for the new generation underdeveloped -- under development and expected in the east. 
Our fundamental view of power prices remains unchanged. In addition, we especially see upside in the nonwinter months and during off-peak hours. 
The difference between our fundamental view and the near-term forward market pricing at NiHub is primarily driven by changes in the dispatch stack. 
Additionally, fuel and coal markets are in contango while power is backward-dated, which is unusual. We think this is also contributing to lower prices than our views would support. 
During the summer, the impact of the change in the stack were masked across the power pool because we didn't see the peak loads that were expected and delivered natural gas prices were extremely low. 
While we saw applied heat rates continue to deliver high, the absolute price was driven lower by the fuel prices. 
If we extended this picture on the slide further out on the curve, you would see an even greater disconnect between the forward curve and our fundamental view, driven mostly by a lack of liquidity. This lack of liquidity at NiHub is in most years, and we are seeing it in West Hub in 2019 and beyond, in particular. 
Because of this lack of liquidity, our hedging activities mostly continue to be done through our load business and not in the over-the-counter markets. 
We continue to align our hedging strategy with our views of the market, and in 2017, remain behind ratable with 6% to 9% of power exposure. 
We have even further behind -- we are even further behind ratable in the Midwest with power exposure at 17% to 20%. 
This strategy exposes us to the significant upside we still see in that market, while partially protecting us from any further degradation in natural gas prices through our cross-commodity hedges. 
Before turning to the hedge disclosure itself, I'd like to touch on the recent PJM capacity auctions. Chris covered the results of the auction a few minutes ago, so I'll focus on the key takeaways from the auction. The biggest impact was bidding behavior. 
In the '18, '19 base residual auction and the transition auction, we saw market participants bidding in a more disciplined manner and recognizing the risks of penalties for nonperformance. 
In addition, about half the newbuilds cleared versus what we saw in the '17, '18 auction. 
And finally, the vast majority of demand response cleared as the base product, which may have readthrough value as PJM transitions to 100% capacity for performance product in 2 years. 
As I mentioned earlier, our load business remains solid. Our originations have been strong and our generation-to-load matching strategy has worked well throughout the year. You can see the impact of this strategy throughout the gross margin disclosures. 
In 2015, we had a net $200 million increase in total gross margin since the end of the second quarter. We started the third quarter with $100 million power new business target remaining for the year. We had strong performance during the quarter, executing $200 million in power new business, with the majority realized in the quarter. 
As a result of this performance, we raised our power new business target by $150 million, resulting in only $50 million of power new business to go for the fourth quarter. 
Our performance was driven by our generation-to-load matching strategy, including a lower cost to serve on load across the portfolio and our position management activity of short bias as a backstop of our generation. 
As an example, Texas experienced quite a bit of heat in early August, and we saw the reserve margins in ERCOT come in as much as 10% lower than projected on those days. Spot prices increased, and we benefited and captured value from this move. 
As a result, we are also seeing upward movement in ERCOT pricing in the forward curve. 
In 2016, the impact of capacity performance auctions increased total gross margin by $150 million. This was partially offset by market price declines net of hedges of $50 million. 
During the quarter, we executed on $150 million of new business and are raising our 2016 power new business target by $200 million to $500 million total remaining. This compares to a $400 million new business target to go for 2015 at the same point last year. 
We are confident we can make this new target next year, given our performance this year and the addition of the Integrys acquisition. 
In 2017, our total gross margin increased by $200 million to $7.8 billion. 
Capacity performance results added $300 million to total gross margin, which was partially offset by $100 million decrease due to the impact of lower prices on our open generation, net of hedges. 
During the quarter, we executed $100 million of power new business. 
We are confident that we have the right hedging strategy to capture the upside we see coming in the market, and we have proven that our generation-to-load matching strategy brings value in both the low- and high-volatility environments. 
I'll now turn it over to Jack to discuss the financial results for the quarter."

As Chris and Joe stated, we had another strong quarter financially and operationally. My remarks will focus on our financial results for the quarter, our full year guidance range and provide an update on our cash outlook for 2015. 
Starting with our third quarter results on Slide 6, Exelon delivered earnings of $0.83 per share, exceeding our guidance range by $0.08. This compares to $0.78 per share for the third quarter of 2014. 
Exelon's utilities delivered combined earnings of $0.33 per share, outperforming the third quarter of last year by $0.04. 
During the quarter, we saw favorable weather at both PECO and ComEd. Cooling degree days were up 30% from the prior year and 28% above normal in Southeastern Pennsylvania, and up 18% from the prior year and 3% above normal in Northern Illinois. 
Distribution revenues at both ComEd and BGE were higher quarter-over-quarter, reflecting the impacts of increased capital investment and higher rates, respectively. 
On September 10, PECO reached a settlement on its rate case filing. The agreed-upon revenue requirement increase of $127 million represent 67% of the original proposal. 
The Pennsylvania PUC's decision is expected in December of this year, with rates going into effect on January 1, 2016. 
The Pennsylvania PUC recently approved the new system 2020 plan, which will lead to an additional $275 million being invested during the next 5 years to install advanced equipment and reinforce the local electric system, making it more weather resistant and less vulnerable to storm damage. 
An order on ComEd's annual formula rate filing is expected to be issued by the ICC in early to mid-December. As a reminder, ComEd requested a revenue decrease of $55 million in its current filing. 
This reduction reflects the continued focus on cost management and operational efficiencies that are being realized from a stronger, more reliable grid with fewer outages. More detail on each of these rate cases can be found in the appendix on Slides 19 through 21. 
Turning to Exelon Generation. It had another strong quarter, delivering earnings of $0.55 per share, $0.05 higher than the same period last year. 
As Joe mentioned, our generation-to-load matching strategy continues to provide value for our business and our shareholders. We benefited from a lower cost to serve both our retail and wholesale customers, and had another strong quarter of performance from our portfolio management team. 
In addition, compared to the third quarter of 2014, we had a positive contribution from the Integrys acquisition. These positive factors were partially offset by realized nuclear decommissioning trust fund losses in 2015 as compared to gains in 2014 and the impacts of divestitures of certain generating assets in 2014. 
Last week, we filed a settlement agreement with the New York PSC and FERC in regards to our Ginna facility. The new agreement shortens the RSSA period by 18 months, includes more market-based revenue and requires that any extension must be justified by a study. The settlement is still subject to approval by both the FERC and the New York PSC. 
While we're pleased that the negotiated RSSA will allow Ginna to continue powering the grid and the local economy until 2017, it's only a temporary solution to a long-term problem. 
Single-unit nuclear facilities like Ginna face significant economic challenges brought on by poor market conditions and a lack of energy policies that properly value the clean and reliable energy that nuclear provides. 
More detail on the quarter-over-quarter drivers for each operating company can be found on Slides 17 and 18 in the appendix. 
As Chris mentioned, we are raising our full year guidance range for earnings to $2.40 to $2.60 per share. 
At the beginning of the year, we provided a standalone guidance range of $2.25 to $2.55 per share. We narrowed the range in our second quarter earnings call to $2.35 to $2.55. This guidance range included the impacts of the debt and share dilution from the PHI merger and assumed that the merger would close during the third quarter. 
Since the merger did not close, we have $0.13 of earnings drag from the interest expense and share dilution. Without this drag, we would have expected full year earnings to exceed the top end of our new guidance range of $2.40 to $2.60 per share due to strong performance at both the utilities and Constellation this year. 
Consistent with our past practice, our guidance range does not include the impact of an extension of bonus depreciation, which we would expect to be around an $0.08 decrease per share. 
Nonetheless, we are comfortable that we will still be in the guidance range even if bonus depreciation were to be extended. 
Turning back to Pepco for a minute. We will meet our original deal case accretion of $0.15 to $0.20. However, it will be pushed back until 2019. 
In addition, we expect the impacts of the merger to be neutral in 2017 and $0.07 to $0.12 accretive in 2018. These changes are primarily due to the delay in closing the merger, the consequent updates to PHI's business plan as a result of this delay and due to the meaningful improvement in Exelon's business plan. The deal remains critically important to our long-term strategy. 
Slide 7 provides an update on our cash flow expectations for this year. We project cash from operations of $6.8 billion across our businesses and free cash flow of $925 million at Generation in 2015. 
As you can see, our projected ending cash balance is roughly $9.6 billion for the year. Most of this is related to the fact that we raised the funds necessary to close the Pepco merger, which, as you know, has been delayed. $2.75 billion of the debt was subject to redemption if the merger does not close by December 31. 
Yesterday, we announced the debt exchange offering to amend the mandatory redemption date in those notes. This action will minimize our refinancing risk and allow our bondholders to stay invested in the bonds as year-end approaches. 
In closing, I want to reiterate that our company can perform well in a rising interest rate environment, which is typically a headwind for our industry. This is because earnings are positively correlated to interest rates due to both ComEd's ROE being directly tied to the 30-year treasury rate as well as the discounting of our pension liabilities. 
As a general rule, every 25 basis point increase in interest rates equates to roughly $0.02 of consolidated earnings uplift related to ComEd and the pension. 
Thank you. And we'll now open the line for questions."

The first thing is if you go back and look at our hedge disclosure at the end of the second quarter, we were effectively 100% hedged across our book for the year. And so we set up with a short bias, recognizing we had the backstop of our own generation to serve load if the market got volatile. The second thing is we costed our loads. When we sold them, the risk premiums were much higher than what was realized in the spot market, primarily driven by the low, low gas prices during the third quarter. And then the last thing is, we took an opportunity when the prices dropped in ERCOT through the summer to materially get our positioning longer as we walked into August, and then we saw some volatility and we capitalized on that as well. So it was really those 3 components that drove the value."

We have -- still need the low-power portfolio standard to cement the long-term viability of these assets. But Quad is just marginal flat on free cash flow, it's just slightly dilutive on earnings. And if we can move the CP along, it will greatly improve that. Byron is in a little bit better shape based off of CP, and we'll continue to watch that closely. On Clinton, we were prepared, with no action taken on the capacity market, to go forward with the retirement. We have seen a commitment and action at MISO to evaluate Zone 4 as its only competitive -- real competitive market to evaluate a redesign of a capacity construct that would adequately compensate the generators for the investments they're making. We've also seen positive signals from the State of Illinois by evaluating -- starting workshops to evaluate the problem statement and workshops to look at potential fixes on Zone 4 in Southern Illinois. So now that we've seen some potential for improvement, we're willing to go another year. That unit -- Clinton is one of our newest units in the fleet. It's got over 30 years of potential run left. With support coming from MISO and understanding the problem statement at FERC and the state now considering what should be done in the southern part to ensure reliability, we saw that as enough promise to extend it one more year to see what we can do in 2016."

We think that when you have -- with normal weather in 2016, we think NiHub is somewhat fairly valued. But as you move out on the curve, it gets materially undervalued, and that's driven mostly by the lack of liquidity. If you look at it, you have gas prices that are in the contango market and M3 is relevant because it's been across the power pool, a lot of hours [ph] are setting price using M3 gas. So if you look at like 2016 to '18, you got $0.25 of value on the curve just as -- I'm sorry, $0.40 of value associated with Henry Hub prices and another $0.20 to $0.25 with M3. There's $0.65 of value in the gas curve, and yet the power prices at NiHub today are $0.25 backwarding. In addition, coal is in contango as well. So we -- that's part of it, the coal retirements are part of it. We have seen heat rate expansion even at these low gas prices. We think some of that is being masked, quite frankly, by the fuel being so low. But when you put all of that together and then the complete lack of liquidity, that's where we're coming up with the driver of higher prices in the future."

We're pleased to deliver another very strong quarter in what's been a very good year for us thus far. 
First, I'll highlight our financial and operational performance, and then I'll switch over to our key strategic objectives. 
On the financial front, we're reporting operating earnings of $0.83 per share, over 6% EPS growth versus the same period last year and above our guidance range. 
Despite the delays in closing PHI, which I'll address further, we're still on track to deliver our best year of earnings since 2012. 
We are raising our guidance range to $2.40 to $2.60, and Jack will provide more details on the financial performance during his remarks. 
It's been a phenomenal year across our companies. At the utilities, we're set to invest $3.7 billion this year in needed infrastructure enhancements and grid reliability and resiliency modifications, part of more than the $16 billion investment that's planned over the next 5 years. This includes our smart meter installation program, which we now have completed nearly 5.5 million gas and electric installations across our operating companies. 
Our utilities will exceed $1 billion in net income in 2015, driven by industry-leading operational performance with each utility achieving first quartile SAIFI, first and second quartile CAIDI results and ranking in first quartile in customer satisfaction. 
We reached settlement -- reached a settlement at PECO in its recent rate case filing, which follows the BGE recent unanimous rate case settlement in Maryland. This highlights how strong operational performance supports recovery in constructor regulatory environments. 
On the Generation side of the business, we had another solid quarter of operations performance. Nuclear capacity factor was 95.5%, power dispatch match was 99%, renewable energy capture was 94.8%. 
We also had great execution at Constellation this quarter, showing the value of our generation to load maxing strategy and our ability to optimize our portfolio even during adverse market conditions in a way that contributes meaningfully to our earnings. 
The breadth of the Constellation platform gives us multiple channels to market. We are the #1 retail electric provider and well ahead of our nearest competitor. We serve nearly 200 terawatt hours of wholesale and retail load, and we're also a top 10 marketer of gas in the U.S., delivering 4 to 6 bcf of gas daily. 
On both sides of the company, we continue to run the business at high levels of performance, and the results are evident in this year's earnings. 
Now I want to discuss 3 key initiatives we have been working on this year: capacity performance, low carbon portfolio standard, and the Pepco Holdings merger. 
Starting with capacity performance. PJM's capacity performance design was implemented -- went into implementation in this year's auctions, with constructive results. We are pleased with the outcome of the capacity auctions. The new penalty structure will hold generators accountable for liability to the benefit of customers. 
For the '18, '19 auction, we cleared a significant number of megawatts at higher-priced zones, and these prices exceeded our own internal expectations. The transition auctions better reflect the value of the reliability of our nuclear units that they provide to the grid. 
Our next major initiative was getting a low power portfolio standard passed. We came into the year advocating for better market design in Illinois, one that would level the playing field for nuclear energy as a key resource in the state. We worked hard to introduce the carbon standard earlier this year. However, the political situation in the state has made the budget the sole focus, leaving little opportunity for progress on energy legislation. 
We are disappointed that we have not made the progress on this front. However, the overall outlook for the nuclear fleet has improved as a result of policy and market factors, namely, the constructive results of the capacity auction; the positive results from Illinois power agencies capacity procurement for 2016; the long-term impact of the Environmental Protection Agency's new carbon reduction rules. 
As a result, we have decided, as announced, to defer another year's decision about the future Quad Cities, Byron and Clinton. 
Having said that, the low power -- the low carbon portfolio standard remains a good policy for Illinois and a priority for Illinois. 
Our last key initiative was the Pepco acquisition. Let me take time to share our perspective on where we're at with the deal. 
We are very excited we reached a settlement with the Government of the District of Columbia, the Office of People's Counsel, the Office of the Attorney General and others in D.C. The settlement includes commitments to provide substantially enhanced benefits to the consumer and businesses in the district. It includes bill credits, low income assistance and fewer and shorter outages. A cleaner, greener D.C., and investment in local jobs and the local economy. 
The settlement package was specifically shaped to address the concerns articulated by the D.C. Public Service Commission in its August quarter. 
As you've seen, we have improved the reliability and the customer satisfaction at BGE and see the benefits of those performance improvements reflected in regulatory outcomes. We look forward to the opportunity to do the same with the Pepco family of utilities. 
The deal remains an important strategic element to the future of Exelon, allowing us to shift our business mix to a more regulated and durable earnings stream. 
We realize the deal has taken longer than expected, and we know that has required patience for many parties, especially our investors, as we work to complete it. 
We received an order from the D.C. Public Service Commission 2 days ago that moves us in the right direction. The commission granted our request to reopen the record and consider the settlement in the existing docket. A schedule that was set, that is in line with our proposed time line. And the commission is committed to consider the settlement in a fashion that is open, transparent and fair. We appreciate the commission's commitment to ruling on the merger in a timely manner, and we ask for your support as we get this across the finish line. 
It has been a busy, busy year. We've accomplished a lot and there's a lot left to be done. 
In particular, we're embarking on a large-scale cost management initiative. We'll provide more details at the EEI financial conference. We are pleased with the performance we've delivered for the shareholders this year despite the significant market and regulatory headwinds. As we always, we're working hard to serve our customers and the communities that we serve better. 
I'll now turn the call over to Joe, who will discuss the markets."

The Constellation business had another strong quarter, outperforming our targets. 
Our portfolio management team performed very well, and as Chris mentioned, our retail and wholesale business is having a very strong year. 
In addition, our core strategy of matching our generation fleet with our load business continues to provide significant value for our shareholders. It has been paying off across the volatility and price spectrum. We have captured higher prices for our generation during periods of extreme weather while managing our load obligations, and we've captured higher margins during low volatility periods like this summer, as we've realized lower cost to serve our customers. 
It also provides us with an important channel to market for our hedging activity, which is important in times of low liquidity and in places where there is not an active market. Our past results and our current hedge disclosures show that our business can thrive in either market environment and provide a great deal of value to the enterprise. 
My comments today will focus on power and gas markets during the quarter and our fundamental view, the recent PJM capacity performance auction and our hedge disclosures and hedging activity. 
Turning to the power markets on Slide 4. NiHub remains undervalued even independent of gas prices. PJM West price is more fairly valued when accounting for the new generation underdeveloped -- under development and expected in the east. 
Our fundamental view of power prices remains unchanged. In addition, we especially see upside in the nonwinter months and during off-peak hours. 
The difference between our fundamental view and the near-term forward market pricing at NiHub is primarily driven by changes in the dispatch stack. 
Additionally, fuel and coal markets are in contango while power is backward-dated, which is unusual. We think this is also contributing to lower prices than our views would support. 
During the summer, the impact of the change in the stack were masked across the power pool because we didn't see the peak loads that were expected and delivered natural gas prices were extremely low. 
While we saw applied heat rates continue to deliver high, the absolute price was driven lower by the fuel prices. 
If we extended this picture on the slide further out on the curve, you would see an even greater disconnect between the forward curve and our fundamental view, driven mostly by a lack of liquidity. This lack of liquidity at NiHub is in most years, and we are seeing it in West Hub in 2019 and beyond, in particular. 
Because of this lack of liquidity, our hedging activities mostly continue to be done through our load business and not in the over-the-counter markets. 
We continue to align our hedging strategy with our views of the market, and in 2017, remain behind ratable with 6% to 9% of power exposure. 
We have even further behind -- we are even further behind ratable in the Midwest with power exposure at 17% to 20%. 
This strategy exposes us to the significant upside we still see in that market, while partially protecting us from any further degradation in natural gas prices through our cross commodity hedges. 
Before turning to the hedge disclosure itself, I'd like to touch on the recent PJM capacity auctions. Chris covered the results of the auction a few minutes ago, so I'll focus on the key takeaways from the auction. The biggest impact was bidding behavior. 
In the '18, '19 base residual auction and the transition auction, we saw market participants bidding in a more disciplined manner and recognizing the risks of penalties for nonperformance. 
In addition, about half the newbuilds cleared versus what we saw in the '17, '18 auction. 
And finally, the vast majority of demand response cleared as the base product, which may have read-through value as PJM transitions to 100% capacity for performance product in 2 years. 
As I mentioned earlier, our load business remains solid. Our originations have been strong and our generation to load matching strategy has worked well throughout the year. You can see the impact of this strategy throughout the gross margin disclosures. 
In 2015, we had a net $200 million increase in total gross margin since the end of the second quarter. We started the third quarter with $100 million power new business target remaining for the year. We had strong performance during the quarter, executing $200 million in power new business, with the majority realized in the quarter. 
As a result of this performance, we raised our power new business target by $150 million, resulting in only $50 million of power new business to go for the fourth quarter. 
Our performance was driven by our generation to load matching strategy, including a lower cost to serve on load across the portfolio and our position management activity of short bias as a backstop of our generation. 
As an example, Texas experienced quite a bit of heat in early August, and we saw the reserve margins in ERCOT come in as much as 10% lower than projected on those days. Spot prices increased, and we benefited and captured value from this move. 
As a result, we are also seeing upward movement in ERCOT pricing in the forward curve. 
In 2016, the impact of capacity performance auctions increased total gross margin by $150 million. This was partially offset by market price declines net of hedges of $50 million. 
During the quarter, we executed on $150 million of new business and are raising our 2016 power new business target by $200 million to $500 million total remaining. This compares to a $400 million new business target to go for 2015 at the same point last year. 
We are confident we can make this new target next year, given our performance this year and the addition of the Integrys acquisition. 
In 2017, our total gross margin increased by $200 million to $7.8 billion. 
Capacity performance results added $300 million to total gross margin, which was partially offset by $100 million decrease due to the impact of lower prices on our open generation, net of hedges. 
During the quarter, we executed $100 million of power new business. 
We are confident that we have the right hedging strategy to capture the upside we see coming in the market, and we have proven that our generation to load matching strategy brings value in both the low and high volatility environments. 
I'll now turn it over to Jack to discuss the financial results for the quarter."

As Chris and Joe stated, we had another strong quarter financially and operationally. My remarks will focus on our financial results for the quarter, our full year guidance range and provide an update on our cash outlook for 2015. 
Starting with our third quarter results on Slide 6, Exelon delivered earnings of $0.83 per share, exceeding our guidance range by $0.08. This compares to $0.78 per share for the third quarter of 2014. 
Exelon's utilities delivered combined earnings of $0.33 per share, outperforming the third quarter of last year by $0.04. 
During the quarter, we saw favorable weather at both PECO and ComEd. Cooling degree days were up 30% from the prior year and 28% above normal in Southeastern Pennsylvania, and up 18% from the prior year and 3% above normal in Northern Illinois. 
Distribution revenues at both ComEd and BGE were higher quarter-over-quarter, reflecting the impacts of increased capital investment and higher rates, respectively. 
On September 10, PECO reached a settlement on its rate case filing. The agreed-upon revenue requirement increase of $127 million represent 67% of the original proposal. 
The Pennsylvania PUC's decision is expected in December of this year, with rates going into effect on January 1, 2016. 
The Pennsylvania PUC recently approved the new system 2020 plan, which will lead to an additional $275 million being invested during the next 5 years to install advanced equipment and reinforce the local electric system, making it more weather resistant and less vulnerable to storm damage. 
An order on ComEd's annual formula rate filing is expected to be issued by the ICC in early to mid-December. As a reminder, ComEd requested a revenue decrease of $55 million in its current filing. 
This reduction reflects the continued focus on cost management and operational efficiencies that are being realized from a stronger, more reliable grid with fewer outages. More detail on each of these rate cases can be found in the appendix on Slides 19 through 21. 
Turning to Exelon Generation. It had another strong quarter, delivering earnings of $0.55 per share, $0.05 higher than the same period last year. 
As Joe mentioned, our generation to load matching strategy continues to provide value for our business and our shareholders. We benefited from a lower cost to serve both our retail and wholesale customers, and had another strong quarter of performance from our portfolio management team. 
In addition, compared to the third quarter of 2014, we had a positive contribution from the Integrys acquisition. These positive factors were partially offset by realized nuclear decommissioning trust fund losses in 2015 as compared to gains in 2014 and the impacts of divestitures of certain generating assets in 2014. 
Last week, we filed a settlement agreement with the New York PSC and FERC in regards to our Ginna facility. The new agreement shortens the RSSA period by 18 months, includes more market-based revenue and requires that any extension must be justified by a study. The settlement is still subject to approval by both the FERC and the New York PSC. 
While we're pleased that the negotiated RSSA will allow Ginna to continue powering the grid and the local economy until 2017, it's only a temporary solution to a long-term problem. 
Single unit nuclear facilities like Ginna face significant economic challenges brought on by poor market conditions and a lack of energy policies that properly value the clean and reliable energy that nuclear provides. 
More detail on the quarter-over-quarter drivers for each operating company can be found on Slides 17 and 18 in the appendix. 
As Chris mentioned, we are raising our full year guidance range for earnings to $2.40 to $2.60 per share. 
At the beginning of the year, we provided a standalone guidance range of $2.25 to $2.55 per share. We narrowed the range in our second quarter earnings call to $2.35 to $2.55. This guidance range included the impacts of the debt and share dilution from the PHI merger and assumed that the merger would close during the third quarter. 
Since the merger did not close, we have $0.13 of earnings drag from the interest expense and share dilution. Without this drag, we would have expected full year earnings to exceed the top end of our new guidance range of $2.40 to $2.60 per share due to strong performance at both the utilities and Constellation this year. 
Consistent with our past practice, our guidance range does not include the impact of an extension of bonus depreciation, which we would expect to be around an $0.08 decrease per share. 
Nonetheless, we are comfortable that we will still be in the guidance range even if bonus depreciation were to be extended. 
Turning back to Pepco for a minute. We will meet our original deal case accretion of $0.15 to $0.20. However, it will be pushed back until 2019. 
In addition, we expect the impacts of the merger to be neutral in 2017 and $0.07 to $0.12 accretive in 2018. These changes are primarily due to the delay in closing the merger, the consequent updates to PHI's business plan as a result of this delay and due to the meaningful improvement in Exelon's business plan. The deal remains critically important to our long-term strategy. 
Slide 7 provides an update on our cash flow expectations for this year. We project cash from operations of $6.8 billion across our businesses and free cash flow of $925 million at Generation in 2015. 
As you can see, our projected ending cash balance is roughly $9.6 billion for the year. Most of this is related to the fact that we raised the funds necessary to close the Pepco merger, which, as you know, has been delayed. $2.75 billion of the debt was subject to redemption if the merger does not close by December 31. 
Yesterday, we announced the debt exchange offering to amend the mandatory redemption date in those notes. This action will minimize our refinancing risk and allow our bondholders to stay invested in the bonds as year-end approaches. 
In closing, I want to reiterate that our company can perform well in a rising interest rate environment, which is typically a headwind for our industry. This is because earnings are positively correlated to interest rates due to both ComEd's ROE being directly tied to the 30-year treasury rate as well as the discounting of our pension liabilities. 
As a general rule, every 25 basis point increase in interest rates equates to roughly $0.02 of consolidated earnings uplift related to ComEd and the pension. 
Thank you. And we'll now open the line for questions."

As for the margin, I think about it more on a total portfolio basis because there's -- retail margins are one component of it. The second thing is we serve a lot of wholesale polar load as well, which have a different margin structure associated with them. But the money that we made in the third quarter was really driven by 3 key things. The first thing is if you go back and look at our hedge disclosure at the end of the second quarter, we were effectively 100% hedged across our book for the year. And so we set up with a short bias, recognizing we had the backstop of our own generation to serve load if the market got volatile. The second thing is we costed our loads. When we sold them, the risk premiums were much higher than what was realized in the spot market, primarily driven by the low, low gas prices during the third quarter. And then the last thing is, we took an opportunity when the prices dropped in ERCOT through the summer to materially get our positioning longer as we walked into August, and then we saw some volatility and we capitalized on that as well. So it was really those 3 components that drove the value."

And if we can move the CP along, it will greatly improve that. Byron is in a little bit better shape based off of CP, and we'll continue to watch that closely. On Clinton, we were prepared, with no action taken on the capacity market, to go forward with the retirement. We have seen a commitment and action at MISO to evaluate Zone 4 as its only competitive -- real competitive market to evaluate a redesign of a capacity construct that would adequately compensate the generators for the investments they're making. We've also seen positive signals from the State of Illinois by evaluating -- starting workshops to evaluate the problem statement and workshops to look at potential fixes on Zone 4 in Southern Illinois.

We think that when you have -- with normal weather in 2016, we think NiHub is somewhat fairly valued. But as you move out on the curve, it gets materially undervalued, and that's driven mostly by the lack of liquidity. If you look at it, you have gas prices that are in the contango market and M3 is relevant because it's been across the power pool, a lot of hours [ph] are setting price using M3 gas. So if you look at like 2016 to '18, you got $0.25 of value on the curve just as -- I'm sorry, $0.40 of value associated with Henry Hub prices and another $0.20 to $0.25 with M3. There's $0.65 of value in the gas curve, and yet the power prices at NiHub today are $0.25 backwarding. In addition, coal is in contango as well. So we -- that's part of it, the coal retirements are part of it. We have seen heat rate expansion even at these low gas prices. We think some of that is being masked, quite frankly, by the fuel being so low. But when you put all of that together and then the complete lack of liquidity, that's where we're coming up with the driver of higher prices in the future."
