Let me start by noting that we have completed the transition of our Chief Financial Officer position effective January 1, 2015. As announced last April, Kirk Walters has transitioned out of the role for family reasons, and he has been succeeded by David Rosato. I appreciate how effectively Kirk and David have worked together to complete the transition seamlessly. Kirk remains an executive officer heading up Corporate Development of Strategic Planning and continues to be a member of the management committee. He also remains as a member of the Board of Directors of the company and the bank. I would like to take this opportunity to thank Kirk for all of his outstanding  steady contributions in his previous role and look forward to continuing to leverage his broad industry experience and deep operational expertise in his new role. Thank you, Kirk. 
As has been our custom, in addition to reviewing our fourth quarter and full year results, I will outline on our goals for 2015. Our performance for 2014 once again demonstrated the benefits of our deep customer relationships, product breath and product initiatives. We continue to build the business for the long term and made significant investments in talent, products and services. This included adding a better and wealth management team based in Hartford, Connecticut and a considerable number of the experienced bankers in Massachusetts. We also continued to evaluate the best ways to serve our customers and grow our businesses as evidenced by the announcement of the Merchant Services joint venture in July. 
Slide 2 provides an overview of our 2014 results. We are pleased to report full year operating earnings of $245 million, a 2% increase from 2013. On a per share basis, operating earnings were $0.82, a 6% increase from the prior year and marks the fifth consecutive year of growth in operating earnings per share. We are building on the momentum generated in recent years through our focus on growing loans and deposits, which in turn creates new opportunities and deepens existing relationships. Compare to 2013, loans and deposits increased 9% and 16%, respectively. Organic deposits had very solid growth of $1.1 billion or 5%. As we further state the relationship in the New York and Massachusetts market, our deposit base will continue to see growth. 
Net interest income increased 3% from the prior year despite a net interest margin declining 22 basis points. This decline was primarily due to the impact of strong loan originations at rates lower than our existing portfolio. Noninterest income excluding the $20.6 million gain on the Merchant Services joint venture in the second quarter of this year declined $12 million or 3% just in lower gains on residential mortgage sales. We were especially pleased that expense levels remained flat compared to the prior year considering the continued impact of the strategic investments and increasing regulatory compliance cost. This focus on effective expense management improved our operating leverage during the year as evidenced by an improvement in the efficiency ratio to 62.1% from 62.3%. Asset quality continued to be exceptional. Net charge-offs in 2014 of only 12 basis points is the lowest level in over 5 years. This is a reflection of dedication to strong underwriting standards, the economic strength of the region we operate in and the long-term relationships we have with our customers. 
On Slide 3, we have provided a snapshot of last year's goals compared to actual results. In general, we were in line with most of our expectations. Net interest income was below goal primarily as a result of loan growth in the net interest margin coming in near the lower end of the targeted range. Noninterest income, excluding the $20.6 million gain on the Merchant Services joint venture, was also below the targeted range primarily attributable to lower gains on residential mortgage sales and insurance revenues. 
On Slide 4, we provide more detail behind the increase in net interest income from 2013. Strong originated loan growth drove net interest income higher by $65 million. This increase was partially offset by the runoff in the acquired loan portfolio resulting in declines in accretion of $46 million. As we have mentioned before, growth in net interest income from the originated portfolio outpacing loss accretion on the acquired portfolio is a positive sign looking ahead. The acquired loan portfolio ended the year at $1.1 billion, down nearly $500 million from 2013 and represents less than 5% of total loan portfolio. 
On Slide 5, you can see our annual net interest margin results, which declined 22 basis points to 3.09%. The margin was impacted by declining benchmark interest rates and tightening credit spreads over the course of the year. New loan volume and mix negatively impacted the margin by year 21 basis points as new business yields remained lower than the total loan portfolio yield. 
On Slide 6, we provide additional detail behind the change in noninterest income from 2013. As I mentioned before, excluding the 2014 gain on the Merchant Services joint venture, noninterest income declined 3% from the prior period. The decline was driven by lower gains on the sales of residential mortgage loans and acquired loans. Partially offsetting these declines were an increase in operating leases as well as strong results by our wealth management business, driven by a 12% increase in investment management revenues. 
On Slide 7, we provided additional color around the expenses. As I mentioned earlier, we were especially pleased with the results were flat compared to the prior year. 
Moving on to Slide 8. Our primary goals are listed for 2015. As I referenced earlier, we remain committed to investing strategically in the franchise. The breath of products and services we provide and the exceptional talent we have attracted will enable us to build new customer relationships and deepen existing ones. These ongoing investments in the combination with our large and attractive markets as well as an unwavering commitment to relationship-based banking have driven and will continue to drive growth. 
With that background in mind, let me outline our goals. First is to grow loans at a high single to go low double-digit rate. Second is to grow deposits in the mid- to high single digits. Next is to grow net interest income in the low to mid-single digits. Embedded in this goal is an expectation for a net interest margin in the range of 2.85% to 2.95%. Another goal is to grow noninterest income in the low single digits after adjusting for the 2014 gain on the Merchant Services joint venture. We will continue to tightly control costs by keeping our operating expenses essentially flat within the range of $835 million to $845 million. Our final goal is to maintain excellent credit quality and strong capital levels. These goals reflect an assumption that interest rates remain at or near current levels. We look forward to executing the opportunities that we have created to achieve these goals. With that, I will pass it to David to discuss the quarter in more detail."

With respect to our fourth quarter performance, please turn to Slide 9 for an overview. Operating earnings were $65.1 million or $0.22 per share compared to $63 million or $0.21 per share in the third quarter. I will discuss the other results shown on this overview in greater detail on subsequence slides. 
Moving to Slide 10. We provide detail behind the link to quarter change in net interest income. The overall results between the 2 quarters were generally consistent. Strong originated loan growth resulted in a $2.2 million increase in net interest income from the third quarter, while a decline in accretion from runoff in the acquired portfolio as well as increased deposit volume lowered net interest income by $1.9 million and $1.5 million, respectively. As Jack mentioned earlier, growth in net interest income from the originated portfolio outpacing loss accretion on the acquired portfolio, is a positive sign looking to the quarters ahead. 
On Slide 11, you can see a breakdown of the elements contributing to our quarterly net interest margin results, which declined 5 basis points to 3%. The primary driver of this decline was new loan volume, which negatively impacted the margin by 5 basis points as new business yields remained lower than the total loan portfolio yield. 
Slide 12 provides a breakdown of the increase in loans. The loan portfolio grew $638 million or 10% annualized. This marks our 17th consecutive quarter of loan growth and is a testament to our relationship managers and customers. These results were achieved through leveraging in our expanded footprint as well as progress in our heritage markets. Originated loan growth for the quarter totaled $767 million. As in prior quarters, growth was well-balanced from a product and geographic perspective. Commercial real estate contributed $174 million of the total originated loan growth while C&I contributed $380 million. Within C&I, we saw a particular strength in our asset-based lending and equipment finance businesses. The commercial portfolio remains broadly diversified with respect to loan type, geography and industry. Residential mortgages in the consumer portfolio contributed $203 million and $10 million of originated loan growth, respectively. The growth in residential mortgages is driven in part by strong originations and lower prepayments. We experienced acquired loan runoff of $129 million this quarter compared to $98 million in the third quarter and $137 million in the fourth quarter of 2013. The increase in runoff from the third quarter was primarily driven by the payoffs of 2 large loans. 
Slide 13 shows a breakdown of the elements contributing to the increase in deposits from the third quarter. Organic deposits increased $472 million or 8% on an annualized basis as retail and commercial deposits grew $304 million and $168 million, respectively. Total deposits increased $877 million, supported by brokered deposit growth of $405 million. As we previous -- as we have discussed previously, we are underway commercial deposits and continue to make changes to further emphasize deposit gathering. We firmly believe that deposits are an important part of customer relationships, and our ongoing focus remains on growing organic deposits. 
On Slide 14, we take a closer look at noninterest income. Noninterest income grew 3% in the third quarter, driven by net security gains of $2.5 million, of which $2.3 million was from the call of a single acquired a security as well as increased customer interest rate swap income of $1.4 million. Partially offsetting these increases was $2.2 million in lower insurance revenues from a seasonally strong third quarter. 
On Slide 15, we illustrate the key components of changes of noninterest expense during the quarter. Similar to the full year results discussed earlier, expenses remained flat. As we have mentioned before, we continue to tightly control expenses, while investing in revenue-producing initiatives and covering the higher cost of regulatory compliance. As a reminder, payroll taxes, 401(k) matches and winter-related operational expenses are highest in the first quarter of the year. Accordingly, based on historical experience, expenses are expected to be approximately $5 million higher next quarter. 
The next slide details our efficiency ratio over in the last 5 quarters. The efficiency ratio improved for the third consecutive quarter as we remain very focused on improving operating leverage. Slide 17 and 18 are a reminder of our excellent credit quality. Once again, we did see an improvement in nonperforming assets this quarter. Originated nonperforming assets as a percentage of originated loan and REO at 88 basis points remains well below our peer group and top 50 banks and is down from 108 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2013. 
Looking at Slide 18, net charge-offs remained low at 13 basis points, consistent with last quarter and improved from 18 basis points 1 year ago. These levels reflect the minimal loss content in our nonperforming assets. Slide 19 highlights our ability to grow both sides of the balance sheet. We continue to make progress on loan and deposit growth on a per share basis, while maintaining excellent credit quality. Over the past year, loans per share and deposits per share have grown at compound annual rate of 10% and 17%, respectively. As shown on Slide 20, operating return on average assets increased for the third consecutive quarter to 75 basis points. Our return on average assets continues to be impacted by the ultra-low interest environment and some initiatives, which are still ramping up to more normal levels of productivity. Progress will be driven by continued loan and deposit growth, fee income growth and an ongoing disciplined approach to expenses. 
Slide 21 illustrates the continued improvement in our return on average tangible equity over recent quarters. We expect to see continued progress over time on this metric as we improve profitability. On Slide 22, capital levels at the holding company and the bank remain strong, especially in light of our low-risk business model with a tangible common equity ratio at 7.5%, Tier 1 common at 9.8% and total risk base capital at 12.2%. 
Slide 23 illustrates our interest rate risk profile for both parallel rate changes and yield curve twist. As you can see, we remain asset-sensitive, though slightly less so than last quarter. Year-over-year, we are slightly more asset-sensitive. We remain well positioned for an eventual rise in short-term rates. Now I'll pass it back to Jack to wrap up."

There's plenty of the heavy lifting going forward to do exactly the same type of things. We are still -- we still have plans to reduce and close some branches. Were still consolidating some real estate where we can. We are still working contracts very hard. So I think as David said, this is something that's in motion.

So that as we went into our planning cycle this year and we work with Jeff -- and then managers in the commercial banking area, we went segment by segment, and we look at our pipelines and we looked at where the teams are in terms of momentum and built our plans around that. So as very detailed as you can imagine. It was very specific to the different geographies. The 1 big challenge that strikes me that I would mention is commercial real estate. We're seeing growth next year. But it's been a big struggle this year. And except for New York where we've continued to make very nice progress, that's been a tough 1.

What we acquired in New York is coming -- continues to come along nicely. And so our comfort with our in-store results and our confidence as thinking about moving forward comes from a lot from our experience and our success to date. In building relationships, first thing that comes to my mind is we look at the activity of our customers that use the in stores and how they interact with the company on all fronts. And they are identified as in-store because of -- because that's where they primarily due their business, but they often transact with us in other branches as well including traditional. In addition to that, we origin 8 out of the in-store platforms, a lot of residential and home equity loans this year, '14, particularly home loans. So we set up the in-store branches with 2 private offices, so that customers, if they do engage with us and are interested in that type of transaction, we can bring them back, give them, close the door, give them privacy and pursue that and we do a lot of training of our staff to be able to take that application and work with that customer. And that's what builds the relationship, right? So we sell our full product set through our in-store branches. I think that differentiates us from many that be in that area. We service a small-business loans and small business customers in the branches. Many of our customers, we find like in the weekend hours. We just had our added retail banking on Lombardi today. We talked about the story about the very happy customer, who was someone else's customers was in our store and heard our folks promoting home equity over the loudspeaker and actually came in and deal a loan on with us on a Saturday. And incrementally, that's the kind of thing that is going to help us move someone else's customer in our shop. So we're very pleased with our in-store results and prospects for the future. We just opened up several new ones in New York under our contract with Stop & Shop as in Brooklyn and we're looking forward to that coming online."

Let me start by noting that we have completed the transition of our Chief Financial Officer position, effective January 1, 2015. As announced last April, Kirk Walters has transitioned out of the role for family reasons, and he has been succeeded by David Rosato. I appreciate how effectively Kirk and David have worked together to complete the transition seamlessly. Kirk remains an executive officer heading up Corporate Development and Strategic Planning, and continues to be a member of the Management Committee. He also remains as a member of the Board of Directors of the company and the bank.
I would like to take this opportunity to thank Kirk for all of his outstanding contributions in his previous role, and look forward to continuing to leverage his broad industry experience and deep operational expertise in his new role. Thank you, Kirk.
As has been our custom, in addition to reviewing the fourth quarter and full year results, I will outline our goals for 2015. Our performance for 2014 once again demonstrated the benefits of our deep customer relationships, product breadth and ongoing strategic initiatives. We continue to build the business for the long term, and made significant investments in talent, products and services. This included adding a veteran wealth management team based in Hartford, Connecticut and a considerable number of experienced commercial bankers in Massachusetts. We also continue to evaluate the best ways to serve our customers and grow our businesses, as evidenced by the announcement of the Merchant Services joint venture in July.
Slide 2 provides an overview of our 2014 results. We are pleased to report full year operating earnings of $245 million, a 2% increase from 2013. On a per share basis, operating earnings were $0.82, a 6% increase from the prior year, and marks the fifth consecutive year of growth in operating earnings per share. We are building on the momentum generated in recent years through our focus on growing loans and deposits, which in turn creates new opportunities and deepens existing relationships.
Compared to 2013, loans and deposits increased 9% and 16%, respectively. Organic deposits had very solid growth of $1.1 billion or 5%. As we further strengthen relationships in the New York and Massachusetts markets, our deposit base will continue to see growth.
Net interest income increased 3% from the prior year, despite the net interest margin declining 22 basis points. This decline was primarily due to the impact of strong loan originations at rates lower than our existing portfolio. Noninterest income, excluding the $20.6 million gain on the Merchant Services joint venture in the second quarter of this year, declined $12 million, or 3%, due to lower gains on residential mortgage sales.
We were especially pleased that expense levels remained flat compared to the prior year, considering the continued impact of strategic investments and increasing regulatory compliance costs. This focus on effective expense management improved our operating leverage during the year, as evidenced by an improvement in the efficiency ratio to 62.1% from 62.3%.
Asset quality continued to be exceptional. Net charge-offs in 2014 of only 12 basis points is the lowest level in over 5 years. This is a reflection of dedication to strong underwriting standards, the economic strength of the region we operate in and the long-term relationships we have with our customers.
On Slide 3, we have provided a snapshot of last year's goals compared to actual results. In general, we were in line with most of our expectations. Net interest income was below goal, primarily as a result of loan growth in the net interest margin coming in near the lower end of the targeted range. Noninterest income, excluding the $20.6 million gain on the Merchant Services joint venture, was also below the targeted range, primarily attributable to lower gains on residential mortgage sales and insurance revenues.
On Slide 4, we provided more detail behind the increase in net interest income from 2013. Strong originated loan growth drove net interest income higher by $65 million. This increase was partially offset by the runoff in the acquired loan portfolio resulting in declines in accretion of $46 million. As we have mentioned before, growth in net interest income from the originated portfolio outpacing loss accretion on the acquired portfolio is a positive sign looking ahead. The acquired loan portfolio ended the year at $1.1 billion, down nearly $500 million from 2013, and represents less than 5% of total loan portfolio.
On Slide 5, you can see our annual net interest margin results, which declined 22 basis points to 3.09%. The margin was impacted by declining benchmark interest rates and tightening credit spreads over the course of the year. New loan volume and mix negatively impacted the margin by 21 basis points as new business yields remained lower than the total loan portfolio yield.
On Slide 6, we provide additional detail behind the change in noninterest income from 2013. As I mentioned before, excluding the 2014 gain on the Merchant Services joint venture, noninterest income declined 3% from the prior period. The decline was driven by lower gains on the sales of residential mortgage loans and acquired loans. Partially offsetting these declines were an increase in operating leases as well as strong results by our wealth management business, driven by a 12% increase in investment management revenues.
On Slide 7, we provided additional color around expenses. As I mentioned earlier, we were especially pleased with results were flat compared to the prior year.
Moving on to Slide 8. Our primary goals are listed for 2015. As I referenced earlier, we remain committed to investing strategically in the franchise. The breadth of products and services we provide and the exceptional talent we have attracted will enable us to build new customer relationships and deepen existing ones. These ongoing investments, in combination with our large and attractive markets as well as an unwavering commitment to relationship-based banking, have driven and will continue to drive growth.
With that background in mind, let me outline our goals: first is to grow loans at a high single- to low double-digit rate; second is to grow deposits in the mid- to high single digits; next is to grow net interest income in the low to mid-single digits. Embedded in this goal is an expectation for a net interest margin in the range of 2.85% to 2.95%. Another goal is to grow noninterest income in the low single digits after adjusting for the 2014 gain on the Merchant Services joint venture. We will continue to tightly control costs by keeping our operating expenses essentially flat within the range of $835 million to $845 million. The final goal is to maintain excellent credit quality and strong capital levels.
These goals reflect an assumption that interest rates remain at or near current levels. We look forward to executing on the opportunities that we have created to achieve these goals.
With that, I will pass it to David to discuss the quarter in more detail."

With respect to our fourth quarter performance, please turn to Slide 9 for an overview. Operating earnings were $65.1 million, or $0.22 per share, compared to $63 million, or $0.21 per share, in the third quarter. I will discuss the other results shown on this overview in greater detail on subsequent slides.
Moving to Slide 10. We provide detail behind the linked-quarter change in net interest income. The overall results between the 2 quarters were generally consistent. Strong originated loan growth resulted in a $2.2 million increase in net interest income from the third quarter, while a decline in accretion from runoff in the acquired portfolio as well as increased deposit volume lowered net interest income by $1.9 million and $1.5 million, respectively. As Jack mentioned earlier, growth in net interest income from the originated portfolio outpacing loss accretion on the acquired portfolio is a positive sign looking to the quarters ahead.
On Slide 11, you can see a breakdown of the elements contributing to our quarterly net interest margin results, which declined 5 basis points to 3%. The primary driver of this decline was new loan volume, which negatively impacted the margin by 5 basis points as new business yields remained lower than the total loan portfolio yield.
Slide 12 provides a breakdown of the increase in loans. The loan portfolio grew $638 million or 10% annualized. This marks our 17th consecutive quarter of loan growth, and is a testament to our relationship managers and customers. These results were achieved through leveraging in our expanded footprint as well as progress in our heritage markets.
Originated loan growth for the quarter totaled $767 million. As in prior quarters, growth was well-balanced from a product and geographic perspective. Commercial real estate contributed $174 million of the total originated loan growth, while C&I contributed $380 million. Within C&I, we saw a particular strength in our asset-based lending and equipment finance businesses. The commercial portfolio remains broadly diversified with respect to loan type, geography and industry.
Residential mortgages in the consumer portfolio contributed $203 million and $10 million of originated loan growth, respectively. The growth in residential mortgages was driven in part by strong originations and lower prepayments.
We experienced acquired loan runoff of $129 million this quarter, compared to $98 million in the third quarter and $137 million in the fourth quarter of 2013. The increase in runoff from the third quarter was primarily driven by the payoffs of 2 large loans.
Slide 13 shows a breakdown of the elements contributing to the increase in deposits from the third quarter. Organic deposits increased $472 million or 8% on an annualized basis, as retail and commercial deposits grew $304 million and $168 million, respectively.
Total deposits increased $877 million, supported by brokered deposit growth of $405 million. As we previous -- as we have discussed previously, we are underweight commercial deposits and continue to make changes to further emphasize deposit gathering. We firmly believe that deposits are an important part of customer relationships, and our ongoing focus remains on growing organic deposits.
On Slide 14, we take a closer look at noninterest income. Noninterest income grew 3% in the third quarter, driven by net security gains of $2.5 million, of which $2.3 million was from the call of a single acquired security as well as increased customer interest rate swap income of $1.4 million. Partially offsetting these increases was $2.2 million in lower insurance revenues from a seasonally strong third quarter.
On Slide 15, we illustrate the key components of changes in noninterest expense during the quarter. Similar to the full year results discussed earlier, expenses remained flat. As we have mentioned before, we continue to tightly control expenses, while investing in revenue-producing initiatives and covering the higher costs of regulatory compliance. As a reminder, payroll taxes, 401(k) matches and winter-related operational expenses are highest in the first quarter of the year. Accordingly, based on historical experience, expenses are expected to be approximately $5 million higher next quarter.
The next slide details our efficiency ratio over the last 5 quarters. The efficiency ratio improved for the third consecutive quarter as we remain very focused on improving operating leverage. Slide 17 and 18 are a reminder of our excellent credit quality. Once again, we did see an improvement in nonperforming assets this quarter. Originated nonperforming assets as a percentage of originated loans and REO at 88 basis points remains well below our peer group and top 50 banks and is down from 108 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2013.
Looking at Slide 18, net charge-offs remained low at 13 basis points, consistent with last quarter and improved from 18 basis points 1 year ago. These levels reflect the minimal loss content in our nonperforming assets. Slide 19 highlights our ability to grow both sides of the balance sheet. We continue to make progress on loan and deposit growth on a per share basis, while maintaining excellent credit quality.
Over the past year, loans per share and deposits per share have grown at compound annual rates of 10% and 17%, respectively. As shown on Slide 20, operating return on average assets increased for the third consecutive quarter to 75 basis points. Our return on average assets continues to be impacted by the ultra-low interest rate environment and some initiatives, which are still ramping up to more normal levels of productivity. Progress will be driven by continued loan and deposit growth, fee income growth and an ongoing disciplined approach to expenses.
Slide 21 illustrates the continued improvement in our return on average tangible equity over recent quarters. We expect to see continued progress, over time, on this metric as we improve profitability.
On Slide 22, capital levels at the holding company and the bank remained strong, especially in light of our low-risk business model with a tangible common equity ratio at 7.5%, Tier 1 common at 9.8% and total risk-based capital at 12.2%.
Slide 23 illustrates our interest rate risk profile for both parallel rate changes and yield curve twists. As you can see, we remain asset-sensitive, though slightly less so than last quarter. Year-over-year, we are slightly more asset-sensitive. We remain well-positioned for an eventual rise in short-term rates.
Now I'll pass it back to Jack to wrap up."

We -- that committee is the control on expenses and has been very successful over the last couple of years. That's what I attribute our success on maintaining the expense base to date.

And it's just -- but I think of it, because there's been so much done today as increment -- continued incremental improvement in the way we think and act around expenses, not that I walked in the door as -- in this new position and think that there's large things that were missed that we could take out of the expense base."

So that, as we went into our planning cycle this year and we worked with Jeff Tengel and the managers in the commercial banking area, we went segment by segment and we looked at our pipelines and we looked at where the teams are in terms of momentum and built our plans around that. So it was very detailed as you can imagine, it was very specific to the different geographies. The one big challenge that strikes me that I would mention is commercial real estate. We're seeing growth next year. But it's been and it has been a big struggle this year. And except for New York, where we've continued to make very nice progress, that's been a tough one.

We are very happy with the continued development of our in-store branches. And kind of -- I'll go to kind of the question around relationship building. So there's a lot there, but -- so if you look at our results, over time, in Connecticut, we have the largest deposit -- on average, deposit -- excuse me, the largest average deposit per in-store branch in the nation in Connecticut. What we acquired in New York is coming -- continues to come along nicely. And so our comfort with our in-store results and our comfort in thinking about moving forward comes from -- a lot from our experience and our success to date. In building relationships, first thing that comes to my mind is we look at the activity of our customers that use the in-stores and how they interact with the company on all fronts. And they are identified as in-store because of -- because that's where they primarily do their business with us, but they often transact with us in other branches as well, including traditional. In addition to that, we originate out off of the in-store platforms a lot of residential and home equity loans this year, '14, particularly home loans. So we set up the in-store branches with 2 private offices, so that customers, if they do engage with us and are interested in that type of transaction, we can bring them back, get them in and close the door, give them privacy and pursue that. And we do a lot of training with our staff to be able to take that application and work with that customer. And that's what builds a relationship, right? So we sell our full product set through our in-store branches. I think that differentiates us from many that play in that area. We service small business loans and small business customers in the branches. Many of our customers we find like the weekend hours. We just had our Head of Retail Banking, Sara Longobardi, today who told a story about a very happy customer who was someone else's customer, was in our store and heard our folks promoting home equity over the loudspeaker and actually came in and did a loan with us on a Saturday. And incrementally, that's the kind of thing that is going to help us move someone else's customer into our shop. So we're very pleased with our in-store results and prospects for the future. We just opened up several new ones in New York under our contract with Stop & Shop as in Brooklyn, and we're looking forward to that coming online."

Let me start by noting that we have completed the transition of our Chief Financial Officer position, effective January 1, 2015. As announced last April, Kirk Walters has transitioned out of the role for family reasons and he has been succeeded by David Rosato. I appreciate how effectively Kirk and David have worked together to complete the transition seamlessly. Kirk remains an executive officer heading up Corporate Development and Strategic Planning and continues to be a member of the Management Committee. He also remains as a member of the Board of Directors of the company and the bank.
I would like to take this opportunity to thank Kirk for all of his outstanding contributions in his previous role, and look forward to continuing to leverage his broad industry experience and deep operational expertise in his new role. Thank you, Kirk.
As has been our custom, in addition to reviewing the fourth quarter and full year results, I will outline our goals for 2015. Our performance for 2014 once again demonstrated the benefits of our deep customer relationships, product breadth and ongoing strategic initiatives. We continue to build the business for the long term, and made significant investments in talent, products and services. This included adding a veteran wealth management team based in Hartford, Connecticut and a considerable number of experienced commercial bankers in Massachusetts. We also continue to evaluate the best ways to serve our customers and grow our businesses, as evidenced by the announcement of the Merchant Services joint venture in July.
Slide 2 provides an overview of our 2014 results. We are pleased to report full year operating earnings of $245 million, a 2% increase from 2013. On a per share basis, operating earnings were $0.82, a 6% increase from the prior year, and marks the fifth consecutive year of growth in operating earnings per share. We are building on the momentum generated in recent years through our focus on growing loans and deposits, which in turn creates new opportunities and deepens existing relationships.
Compared to 2013, loans and deposits increased 9% and 16%, respectively. Organic deposits had very solid growth of $1.1 billion or 5%. As we further strengthen relationships in the New York and Massachusetts markets, our deposit base will continue to see growth.
Net interest income increased 3% from the prior year, despite the net interest margin declining 22 basis points. This decline was primarily due to the impact of strong loan originations at rates lower than our existing portfolio. Noninterest income, excluding the $20.6 million gain on the Merchant Services joint venture in the second quarter of this year, declined $12 million, or 3%, due to lower gains on residential mortgage sales.
We were especially pleased that expense levels remained flat compared to the prior year, considering the continued impact of strategic investments and increasing regulatory compliance costs. This focus on effective expense management improved our operating leverage during the year, as evidenced by an improvement in the efficiency ratio to 62.1% from 62.3%.
Asset quality continued to be exceptional. Net charge-offs in 2014 of only 12 basis points is the lowest level in over 5 years. This is a reflection of dedication to strong underwriting standards, the economic strength of the region we operate in and the long-term relationships we have with our customers.
On Slide 3, we have provided a snapshot of last year's goals compared to actual results. In general, we were in line with most of our expectations. Net interest income was below goal, primarily as a result of loan growth and the net interest margin coming in near the lower end of the targeted range. Noninterest income, excluding the $20.6 million gain on the Merchant Services joint venture, was also below the targeted range, primarily attributable to lower gains on residential mortgage sales and insurance revenues.
On Slide 4, we provide more detail behind the increase in net interest income from 2013. Strong originated loan growth drove net interest income higher by $65 million. This increase was partially offset by the runoff in the acquired loan portfolio resulting in declines in accretion of $46 million. As we have mentioned before, growth in net interest income from the originated portfolio outpacing lost accretion on the acquired portfolio is a positive sign looking ahead. The acquired loan portfolio ended the year at $1.1 billion, down nearly $500 million from 2013, and represents less than 5% of total loan portfolio.
On Slide 5, you can see our annual net interest margin results, which declined 22 basis points to 3.09%. The margin was impacted by declining benchmark interest rates and tightening credit spreads over the course of the year. New loan volume and mix negatively impacted the margin by 21 basis points as new business yields remained lower than the total loan portfolio yield.
On Slide 6, we provide additional detail behind the change in noninterest income from 2013. As I mentioned before, excluding the 2014 gain on the Merchant Services joint venture, noninterest income declined 3% from the prior period. The decline was driven by lower gains on the sales of residential mortgage loans and acquired loans. Partially offsetting these declines were an increase in operating leases as well as strong results by our wealth management business, driven by a 12% increase in investment management revenues.
On Slide 7, we provide additional color around expenses. As I mentioned earlier, we were especially pleased with results were flat compared to the prior year.
Moving on to Slide 8. Our primary goals are listed for 2015. As I referenced earlier, we remain committed to investing strategically in the franchise. The breadth of products and services we provide and the exceptional talent we have attracted will enable us to build new customer relationships and deepen existing ones. These ongoing investments, in combination with our large and attractive markets as well as an unwavering commitment to relationship-based banking, have driven and will continue to drive growth.
With that background in mind, let me outline our goals: first is to grow loans at a high single- to low double-digit rate; second is to grow deposits in the mid- to high single digits; next is to grow net interest income in the low to mid-single digits. Embedded in this goal is an expectation for a net interest margin in the range of 2.85% to 2.95%. Another goal is to grow noninterest income in the low single digits after adjusting for the 2014 gain on the Merchant Services joint venture. We will continue to tightly control costs by keeping our operating expenses essentially flat within a range of $835 million to $845 million. The final goal is to maintain excellent credit quality and strong capital levels.
These goals reflect an assumption that interest rates remain at or near current levels. We look forward to executing on the opportunities that we have created to achieve these goals.
With that, I will pass it to David to discuss the quarter in more detail."

With respect to our fourth quarter performance, please turn to Slide 9 for an overview. Operating earnings were $65.1 million, or $0.22 per share, compared to $63 million, or $0.21 per share, in the third quarter. I will discuss the other results shown on this overview in greater detail on subsequent slides.
Moving to Slide 10. We provide detail behind the linked-quarter change in net interest income. The overall results between the 2 quarters were generally consistent. Strong originated loan growth resulted in a $2.2 million increase in net interest income from the third quarter, while a decline in accretion from runoff in the acquired portfolio as well as increased deposit volume, lowered net interest income by $1.9 million and $1.5 million, respectively. As Jack mentioned earlier, growth in net interest income from the originated portfolio outpacing lost accretion on the acquired portfolio is a positive sign looking to the quarters ahead.
On Slide 11, you can see a breakdown of the elements contributing to our quarterly net interest margin results, which declined 5 basis points to 3%. The primary driver of this decline was new loan volume, which negatively impacted the margin by 5 basis points as new business yields remained lower than the total loan portfolio yield.
Slide 12 provides a breakdown of the increase in loans. The loan portfolio grew $638 million or 10% annualized. This marks our 17th consecutive quarter of loan growth and is a testament to our relationship managers and customers. These results were achieved through leveraging our expanded footprint as well as progress in our heritage markets.
Originated loan growth for the quarter totaled $767 million. As in prior quarters, growth was well-balanced from a product and geographic perspective. Commercial real estate contributed $174 million of the total originated loan growth, while C&I contributed $380 million. Within C&I, we saw particular strength in our asset-based lending and equipment finance businesses. The commercial portfolio remains broadly diversified with respect to loan type, geography and industry.
Residential mortgages in the consumer portfolio contributed $203 million and $10 million of originated loan growth, respectively. The growth in residential mortgages was driven in part by strong originations and lower prepayments.
We experienced acquired loan runoff of $129 million this quarter, compared to $98 million in the third quarter and $137 million in the fourth quarter of 2013. The increase in runoff from the third quarter was primarily driven by the payoffs of 2 large loans.
Slide 13 shows a breakdown of the elements contributing to the increase in deposits from the third quarter. Organic deposits increased $472 million or 8% on an annualized basis, as retail and commercial deposits grew $304 million and $168 million, respectively.
Total deposits increased $877 million, supported by broker deposit growth of $405 million. As we previous -- as we have discussed previously, we are underweight commercial deposits and continue to make changes to further emphasize deposit gathering. We firmly believe that deposits are an important part of customer relationships, and our ongoing focus remains on growing organic deposits.
On Slide 14, we take a closer look at noninterest income. Noninterest income grew 3% in the third quarter, driven by net security gains of $2.5 million, of which $2.3 million was from the call of a single acquired security as well as increased customer interest rate swap income of $1.4 million. Partially offsetting these increases was $2.2 million in lower insurance revenues from a seasonally strong third quarter.
On Slide 15, we illustrate the key components of changes in noninterest expense during the quarter. Similar to the full year results discussed earlier, expenses remained flat. As we have mentioned before, we continue to tightly control expenses, while investing in revenue-producing initiatives and covering the higher costs of regulatory compliance. As a reminder, payroll taxes, 401(k) matches and winter-related operational expenses are highest in the first quarter of the year. Accordingly, based on historical experience, expenses are expected to be approximately $5 million higher next quarter.
The next slide details our efficiency ratio over the last 5 quarters. The efficiency ratio improved for the third consecutive quarter as we remain very focused on improving operating leverage. Slides 17 and 18 are a reminder of our excellent credit quality. Once again, we did see an improvement in nonperforming assets this quarter. Originated nonperforming assets as a percentage of originated loans and REO at 88 basis points remains well below our peer group and top 50 banks and is down from 108 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2013.
Looking at Slide 18, net charge-offs remained low at 13 basis points, consistent with last quarter and improved from 18 basis points 1 year ago. These levels reflect the minimal loss content in our nonperforming assets. Slide 19 highlights our ability to grow both sides of the balance sheet. We continue to make progress on loan and deposit growth on a per share basis, while maintaining excellent credit quality.
Over the past year, loans per share and deposits per share have grown at compound annual rates of 10% and 17%, respectively. As shown on Slide 20, operating return on average assets increased for the third consecutive quarter to 75 basis points. Our return on average assets continues to be impacted by the ultra-low interest rate environment and some initiatives, which are still ramping up to more normal levels of productivity. Progress will be driven by continued loan and deposit growth, fee income growth and an ongoing disciplined approach to expenses.
Slide 21 illustrates the continued improvement in our return on average tangible equity over recent quarters. We expect to see continued progress, over time, on this metric as we improve profitability.
On Slide 22, capital levels at the holding company and the bank remained strong, especially in light of our low-risk business model with a tangible common equity ratio at 7.5%, Tier 1 common at 9.8% and total risk-based capital at 12.2%.
Slide 23 illustrates our interest rate risk profile for both parallel rate changes and yield curve twists. As you can see, we remain asset-sensitive, though slightly less so than last quarter. Year-over-year, we are slightly more asset-sensitive. We remain well-positioned for an eventual rise in short-term rates.
Now I'll pass it back to Jack to wrap up."

We really -- our work -- the message that I think is most important is we're really working the levers that we can to bring our loan-to-deposit ratio down to 100% or even better below.

We -- that committee is the control on expenses and has been very successful over the last couple of years. That's what I attribute our success on maintaining the expense base to date.

We've trimmed a lot of areas. We've worked a lot of contract termed [ph]. We've consolidated a lot of real estate occupancy levels. And because we did all that lifting, we were able to take on teams to drive revenues and grow in markets and able to deal with the increased regulatory burden around the BSA and compliance, et cetera, and stress testing. So when you look at our flat earnings -- when we look at it, we feel very, very good about having achieved that, given all of the pressure to invest in those 2 areas. And when we think about our EMOC process and think about how we're moving forward and the way we've worked this year's budget, there's plenty of heavy lifting going forward to do exactly the same type of things.

So that, as we went into our planning cycle this year and we worked with Jeff Tengel and the managers in the commercial banking area, we went segment by segment and we looked at our pipelines and we looked at where the teams are in terms of momentum and built our plans around that. So it was very detailed as you can imagine, it was very specific to the different geographies. The one big challenge that strikes me that I would mention is commercial real estate. We're seeing growth next year. But it's been and it has been a big struggle this year. And except for New York, where we've continued to make very nice progress, that's been a tough one.

We are very happy with the continued development of our in-store branches. And kind of -- I'll go to the question around relationship building. So there's a lot there, but -- so if you look at our results, over time, in Connecticut, we have the largest deposit -- on average, deposit -- excuse me, the largest average deposit per in-store branch in the nation in Connecticut. What we acquired in New York is coming -- continues to come along nicely. And so our comfort with our in-store results and our comfort in thinking about moving forward comes from -- a lot from our experience and our success to date. In building relationships, first thing that comes to my mind is we look at the activity of our customers that use the in-stores and how they interact with the company on all fronts. And they are identified as in-store because of -- because that's where they primarily do their business with us, but they often transact with us in other branches as well, including traditional. In addition to that, we originate off of the in-store platforms a lot of residential and home equity loans. This year, '14, particularly home equity loans. So we set up the in-store branches with 2 private offices, so that customers, if they do engage with us and are interested in that type of transaction, we can bring them back, get them in and close the door, give them privacy and pursue that. And we do a lot of training with our staff to be able to take that application and work with that customer. And back to that's what builds a relationship, right? So we sell our full product set through our in-store branches. I think that differentiates us from many that play in that area. We service small business loans and small business customers in the branches. Many of our customers we find like the weekend hours. We just had our Head of Retail Banking, Sara Longobardi, today told a story about a very happy customer who was someone else's customer, was in our store and heard our folks promoting home equity over the loudspeaker and actually came in and did a loan with us on a Saturday. And incrementally, that's the kind of thing that is going to help us move someone else's customer into our shop. So we're very pleased with our in-store results and prospects for the future. We just opened up several new ones in New York under our contract with Stop & Shop as -- in Brooklyn, and we're looking forward to that coming online."

Good morning. We appreciate everybody joining us today. Our performance this quarter is an encouraging start to the year, especially given the persistent low interest rate environment as well as the severe winter weather across our mark",444,"Thank you, Andrew. Good morning. We appreciate everybody joining us today. Our performance this quarter is an encouraging start to the year, especially given the persistent low interest rate environment as well as the severe winter weather across our markets.
Results once again benefited from the investments we have made and continued to make in talent, products and services, within our large and attractive markets.
During the quarter, I spent a great deal of time visiting customers across our franchise and came away impressed with the opportunities we have to further deepen these relationships through cross-selling efforts. Our breath of products and services, superior customer service and local knowledge, uniquely positions us to not only meet the expanding needs of current customers, but also forge new relationships.
These visits reaffirm for me the value we provide to customers and the significant opportunities we have before us.
Turning to the overview of the quarter, on Slide 2, operating earnings increased 12% from a year ago to $63 million, making the highest level of operating earnings we have had in the first quarter of any year.
Revenues increased 1% from the fourth quarter, as noninterest income was higher and net interest income was flat. As a reminder, net interest income, along with net interest margin, were unfavorably impacted by 2 fewer calendar days in the first quarter.
In comparison to the prior year quarter, revenues increased 3%, driven by improvements in both net interest income and non-interest income.
As expected, operating expenses were modestly higher as compared to the fourth quarter, due to traditionally higher first quarter payroll-related and winter-related operational cost.
However, we were pleased operating expense levels remained flat compared to the prior year quarter, especially considering the continued impact of strategic investments and increasing regulatory compliance cost.
The efficiency ratio increased slightly to 61.9% in the first quarter from 61.3% last quarter, reflecting higher revenues and the seasonal uptick in operating expenses.
However, the ratio improved from 63.9% in the prior year quarter. While the first quarter is typically a seasonally lower period, we achieved solid annualized loan growth of 5%. This marks the 18th consecutive quarter of loan growth. We are pleased with the success of our deposit gathering initiatives, as evidenced by organic deposit growth of $1 billion in the quarter, which represents more than 17% growth on an annualized basis.
As we further develop our franchise-wide cross-sell and deposit gathering efforts, the deposit base will continue to see growth. Asset quality was once again exceptional as net charge-offs and nonperforming assets improved from already low levels.
With that, I'll pass it to David to discuss the quarter in more detail."
295774,290478674,789597,"People's United Financial Inc., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 16, 2015",2015-04-16,"Earnings Calls","People's United Financial, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Jack. On Slide 3, we provide detail behind the linked quarter change and net interest income.

On Slide 3, we provide detail behind the linked quarter change and net interest income. Higher average balances and strong originated loan growth increased to net -- increased net interest income by $3.4 million and $2.8 million, respectively. The largest offset to these increases was a $3.3 million reduction in net interest income due to 2 fewer calendar days in the first quarter.  Additionally, a decline in accretion from run-off in the acquired loan portfolio and increased deposit volume lowered net interest margin by $1.7 million and $1.1 million, respectively.
As mentioned on previous calls, growth in net interest income from the originated portfolio outpacing lost accretion on the acquired portfolio is a positive sign looking to the quarters ahead.
On Slide 4, net interest margin for the first quarter was 2.91%, a decline of 9 basis points from the fourth quarter. As we mentioned on our last earnings call, fewer calendar days impacted the margin by 5 basis points in the first quarter. 
Additionally, new loan volume negatively impacted the margin by 2 basis points as new business yields remained lower than the total loan portfolio yield.  We continue to expect the full year 2015 margin to be within the range of 2.85% to 2.95% as outlined in January.
Slide 5 provides a breakdown of the increase in loans. The loan portfolio grew $337 million, or 5% annualized. Originated loan growth for the quarter totaled $430 million. As in previous quarters, growth was well-balanced from a product and geographic perspective.
C&I contributed $240 million of the total originated loan growth, while commercial real estate contributed $118 million. Within C&I, we experienced particular strength in our mortgage warehouse lending business.
The commercial portfolio remains broadly diversified with respect to loan type, geography and industry. Residential mortgages contributed $129 million of originated loan growth in the first quarter. Approximately 90% of the residential mortgage originations helped our investments where high-grade adjustable rate mortgages.
In addition, the residential mortgage portfolio is strong -- the residential mortgage pipeline is strong and ended the quarter at the highest level in 2 years. We experienced acquired loan run-off of $93 million this quarter, compared to $129 million in the fourth quarter, and $114 million in prior -- in the prior year quarter. The balance of the acquired portfolio at quarter end was $958 million.
Slide 6 shows the growth in deposits by segment from the fourth quarter. Deposits increased over $1 billion, or 15.5% on an annualized basis, as commercial and retail deposits grew $635 million and $377 million, respectively. Broker deposits ended the quarter at $2.6 billion, unchanged from the end of the fourth quarter. As such, the deposit growth in the first quarter was organically driven.
We experienced strong growth across all geographies and all business lines. Just as a reminder, the first and fourth quarters are typically our strongest quarters for deposits. It is worth noting that our loan-to-deposit ratio was 99% at March 31 and our cost of deposits came down 1 basis point in the quarter.
Overall, we are very pleased with the progress we are making gathering deposits. We firmly believe that deposits are an integral part of customer relationships and we continue to focus on organic deposit growth.
On Slide 7, we take a closer look at noninterest income. Noninterest income grew 3% from the fourth quarter, and was primarily driven by strong commercial banking lending fees, higher customer interest rate swap income as well as gains on the sale of loans, which was primarily driven by the sale of 1 loan from the acquired portfolio. The increase in noninterest income was partially offset by the absence of security gains and lower bank service charges.
As you will recall in the fourth quarter, the net security gain resulted from the call of a single acquired security.
On Slide 8, we illustrate the key components of changes to non-interest expense during the quarter. Nonoperating expenses increased over $5 million, which is mainly attributable to branch closure costs. We closed 8 branches during the first quarter as we continue to optimize our branch delivery channel.
Since the beginning of 2011, we have closed 44 branches, which were mostly traditional branches. During the same period, we opened 24 branches, many of which are more cost-efficient in-store branches.
We expect to close approximately 10 more branches during the remainder of the year as well as to look for opportunities to reduce real estate cost further by consolidating other facilities. We are committed to branches, as they provide valuable support to revenue-generating activities across all of our business lines.
From an operating perspective, expenses increased $4.5 million from the fourth quarter. Compensation and benefits increased $6.6 million, primarily due to traditionally higher first quarter payroll related and benefit cost, while occupancy and equipment cost increased $2.4 million, of which approximately 1/2 was due to higher snow removal cost.
As we have mentioned before, we continued to tightly control expenses while investing in revenue-producing initiatives and covering the higher cost of regulatory compliance.
The next slide details our efficiency ratio over the last 5 quarters. While the ratio ticked up slightly in the first quarter, the results are still generally consistent with recent quarters, and improved from the first quarter of 2014.
An important area of focus for the organization is to continue to improve operating leverage through revenue growth and effective expense management.
Slides 10 and 11 are a reminder of our excellent credit quality. Once again, we did see an improvement in nonperforming assets this quarter. Originated nonperforming assets, as a percentage of originated loans and REO at 80 basis points, remains below our peer group and top 50 banks, and has improved from 100 basis points in the first quarter of 2014.
Looking at Slide 11, net charge-offs remained low at 11 basis points and improved from 13 basis points last quarter and 12 basis points 1 year ago. These levels reflect the minimal loss content in our nonperforming assets.
Slide 12 highlights our ability to grow both sides of the balance sheet. We continued to make progress on loan and deposit growth on a per share basis, while maintaining excellent asset quality. Over the past year, loans per share and deposits per share have grown at compound annual rates of 9% and 14%, respectively.
As shown on Slide 13, operating return on average assets decreased 4 basis points from last quarter, but improved 2 basis points from the first quarter of 2014. Our return on average assets continues to be impacted by the persistently low interest rate environment and the effective initiatives that have not yet attained expected levels of operating leverage. Progress will be driven by continued loan and deposit growth, fee income growth and an ongoing disciplined approach to expenses.
Slide 14 illustrates our return on average tangible equity. As profitability improves, we expect to see continued progress on this metric over time as we have seen in recent quarters.
Turning to Slide 15. We are comfortable with our capital structure and balance sheet strength. Capital levels at the holding company and the bank remained strong, especially in light of our low-risk business model. Effective this quarter, our capital ratios are calculated in accordance with Basal III capital rules. Additionally, our leverage ratio benefited due to our charter change as the denominator changed from period end total assets to quarterly average assets.
Slide 16 illustrates our interest rate profile for both parallel rate changes and yield curve twists. As you can see, we are a bit more asset sensitive as compared to last quarter, primarily due to a loan mix -- due to our loan mix trending towards floating rate loans as well as the strong deposit growth that we achieved in the quarter.
Now, I'd like to pass it back to Jack to wrap up."

So if you originated your deposit at branch A, but you're actually do business in branch A, B and C and what percentage of deposit base is going where. And so we plan out that the transitions and communicate with customers very well and we have experienced very little fallout so far. As we go on through the continued effort to optimize the branches, the question will become, at what distances branch to branch, does that stream the retention of that customer? So far, we're doing very, very well. And our assumptions is that -- and our experience have we have been retaining in the 80%, 90% range on those deposits."

Good morning. We appreciate everybody joining us today. Our performance this quarter is an encouraging start to the year, especially given the persistent low interest rate environment as well as the severe winter weather across our markets.
Results, once again, benefited from the investments we have made and continued to make in talent, products and services within our large and attractive markets.
During the quarter, I spent a great deal of time visiting customers across our franchise and came away impressed with the opportunities we have to further deepen these relationships through cross-selling efforts. Our breadth of products and services, superior customer service and local knowledge, uniquely position us to not only meet the expanding needs of current customers, but also forge new relationships. These visits reaffirm for me the value we provide to customers and the significant opportunities we have before us.
Turning to the overview of the quarter on Slide 2, operating earnings increased 12% from a year ago to $63 million, making the highest level of operating earnings we have had in the first quarter of any year.
Revenues increased 1% from the fourth quarter, as noninterest income was higher and net interest income was flat. As a reminder, net interest income, along with net interest margin, were unfavorably impacted by 2 fewer calendar days in the first quarter.
In comparison to the prior year quarter, revenues increased 3%, driven by improvements in both net interest income and noninterest income.
As expected, operating expenses were modestly higher as compared to the fourth quarter, due to traditionally higher first quarter payroll-related and winter-related operational cost.
However, we were pleased operating expense levels remained flat compared to the prior year quarter, especially considering the continued impact of strategic investments and increasing regulatory compliance cost.
The efficiency ratio increased slightly to 61.9% in the first quarter from 61.3% last quarter, reflecting higher revenues and the seasonal uptick in operating expenses. However, the ratio improved from 63.9% in the prior year quarter. While the first quarter is typically a seasonally lower period, we achieved solid annualized loan growth of 5%. This marks the 18th consecutive quarter of loan growth. We are pleased with the success of our deposit gathering initiatives as evidenced by organic deposit growth of $1 billion in the quarter, which represents more than 17% growth on an annualized basis.
As we further develop our franchise-wide, cross-sell and deposit-gathering efforts, the deposit base will continue to see growth. Asset quality was, once again, exceptional as net charge-offs and nonperforming assets improved from already low levels.
With that, I'll pass it to David to discuss the quarter in more detail."

On Slide 3, we provide detail behind the linked quarter change and net interest income.

On Slide 3, we provide detail behind the linked quarter change and net interest income. Higher average balances and strong originated loan growth increased to net -- increased net interest income by $3.4 million and $2.8 million, respectively. The largest offset to these increases was a $3.3 million reduction in net interest income due to 2 fewer calendar days in the first quarter.  Additionally, a decline in accretion from run-off in the acquired loan portfolio and increased deposit volume lowered net interest margin by $1.7 million and $1.1 million, respectively.
As mentioned on previous calls, growth in net interest income from the originated portfolio outpacing lost accretion on the acquired portfolio is a positive sign looking to the quarters ahead.
On Slide 4, net interest margin for the first quarter was 2.91%, a decline of 9 basis points from the fourth quarter. As we mentioned on our last earnings call, fewer calendar days impacted the margin by 5 basis points in the first quarter. Additionally, new loan volume negatively impacted the margin by 2 basis points as new business yields remained lower than the total loan portfolio yield.  We continue to expect the full year 2015 margin to be within the range of 2.85% to 2.95% as outlined in January.
Slide 5 provides a breakdown of the increase in loans. The loan portfolio grew $337 million or 5% annualized. Originated loan growth for the quarter totaled $430 million. As in previous quarters, growth was well balanced from a product and geographic perspective.
C&I contributed $240 million of the total originated loan growth, while commercial real estate contributed $118 million. Within C&I, we experienced particular strength in our mortgage warehouse lending business.
The commercial portfolio remains broadly diversified with respect to loan type, geography and industry. Residential mortgages contributed $129 million of originated loan growth in the first quarter. Approximately 90% of the residential mortgage originations helped our investment where high-grade adjustable rate mortgages.
In addition, the residential mortgage portfolio is strong -- the residential mortgage pipeline is strong and ended the quarter at the highest level in 2 years. We experienced acquired loan run-off of $93 million this quarter compared to $129 million in the fourth quarter and $114 million in prior -- in the prior year quarter. The balance of the acquired portfolio at quarter end was $958 million.
Slide 6 shows the growth in deposits by segment from the fourth quarter. Deposits increased over $1 billion or 15.5% on an annualized basis, as commercial and retail deposits grew $635 million and $377 million, respectively. Broker deposits ended the quarter at $2.6 billion, unchanged from the end of the fourth quarter. As such, the deposit growth in the first quarter was organically driven. We experienced strong growth across all geographies and all business lines. 
Just as a reminder, the first and fourth quarters are typically our strongest quarters for deposits. It is worth noting that our loan-to-deposit ratio was 99% at March 31 and our cost of deposits came down 1 basis point in the quarter.
Overall, we are very pleased with the progress we are making, gathering deposits. We firmly believe that deposits are an integral part of customer relationships, and we continue to focus on organic deposit growth.
On Slide 7, we take a closer look at noninterest income. Noninterest income grew 3% from the fourth quarter and was primarily driven by strong commercial banking lending fees, higher customer interest rate swap income as well as gains on the sale of loans, which was primarily driven by the sale of 1 loan from the acquired portfolio. The increase in noninterest income was partially offset by the absence of security gains and lower bank service charges. As you will recall in the fourth quarter, the net security gain resulted from the call of a single acquired security.
On Slide 8, we illustrate the key components of changes and noninterest expense during the quarter. Nonoperating expenses increased over $5 million, which is mainly attributable to branch closure costs. We closed 8 branches during the first quarter as we continue to optimize our branch delivery channel.
Since the beginning of 2011, we have closed 44 branches, which were mostly traditional branches. During the same period, we opened 24 branches, many of which are more cost-efficient in-store branches.
We expect to close approximately 10 more branches during the remainder of the year as well as to look for opportunities to reduce real estate cost further by consolidating other facilities. We are committed to branches as they provide valuable support to revenue-generating activities across all of our business lines.
From an operating perspective, expenses increased $4.5 million from the fourth quarter. Compensation and benefits increased $6.6 million, primarily due to traditionally higher first quarter payroll-related and benefit cost, while occupancy and equipment cost increased $2.4 million, of which approximately 1/2 was due to higher snow removal cost. As we have mentioned before, we continued to tightly control expenses, while investing in revenue-producing initiatives and covering the higher cost of regulatory compliance.
The next slide details our efficiency ratio over the last 5 quarters. While the ratio ticked up slightly in the first quarter, the results are still generally consistent with recent quarters and improved from the first quarter of 2014.
An important area of focus for the organization is to continue to improve operating leverage through revenue growth and effective expense management.
Slides 10 and 11 are a reminder of our excellent credit quality. Once again, we did see an improvement in nonperforming assets this quarter. Originated nonperforming assets, as a percentage of originated loans and REO at 80 basis points, remains below our peer group and top 50 banks and has improved from 100 basis points in the first quarter of 2014.
Looking at Slide 11, net charge-offs remained low at 11 basis points and improved from 13 basis points last quarter and 12 basis points 1 year ago. These levels reflect the minimal loss content in our nonperforming assets.
Slide 12 highlights our ability to grow both sides of the balance sheet. We continue to make progress on loan and deposit growth on a per share basis, while maintaining excellent asset quality. Over the past year, loans per share and deposits per share have grown at compound annual rates of 9% and 14%, respectively.
As shown on Slide 13, operating return on average assets decreased 4 basis points from last quarter, but improved 2 basis points from the first quarter of 2014. Our return on average assets continues to be impacted by the persistently low interest rate environment and the effective initiative that have not yet attained expected levels of operating leverage. Progress will be driven by continued loan and deposit growth, fee income growth and an ongoing disciplined approach to expenses.
Slide 14 illustrates our return on average tangible equity. As profitability improves, we expect to see continued progress on this metric over time as we have seen in recent quarters.
Turning to Slide 15. We are comfortable with our capital structure and balance sheet strength. Capital levels at the holding company and the bank remained strong, especially in light of our low-risk business model. Effective this quarter, our capital ratios are calculated in accordance with Basel III capital rep -- capital rules. Additionally, our leverage ratio benefited due to our charter change as the denominator changed from period end total assets to quarterly average assets.
Slide 16 illustrates our interest rate risk profile for both parallel rate changes and yield curve twist. As you can see, we are a bit more asset-sensitive as compared to last quarter, primarily due to a loan mix -- our loan -- due to our loan mix trending towards floating rate loans as well as the strong deposit growth that we achieved in the quarter.
Now I'd like to pass it back to Jack to wrap up."

During the quarter, we received our national banking association charter. We believe this charter is best aligned to our commercial banking model.
Additionally, we are pleased to announce the board voted to raise the dividend to an annual rate of $0.67 per share. This marks the 22nd consecutive year the dividend has been increased, which reflects our continued commitment to delivering value to our shareholders through the consistent return of capital.
While the first quarter was an encouraging start to the year, the focus will remain on our most important objective, which is improving profitability. We feel terrific about the progress made in recent years in growing the company and look to build upon this momentum to enhance returns, while continuing to successfully position the franchise for the long term.

Good morning. We appreciate everybody joining us today. Our performance this quarter is an encouraging start to the year, especially given the persistent low interest rate environment as well as the severe winter weather across our markets.
Results, once again, benefited from the investments we have made and continue to make in talent, products and services within our large and attractive markets.
During the quarter, I spent a great deal of time visiting customers across our franchise and came away impressed with the opportunities we have to further deepen these relationships through cross-selling efforts. Our breadth of products and services, superior customer service and the local knowledge uniquely position us to not only meet the expanding needs of current customers, but also forge new relationships. These visits reaffirm for me the value we provide to customers and the significant opportunities we have before us.
Turning to the overview of the quarter on Slide 2, operating earnings increased 12% from a year ago to $63 million, making the highest level of operating earnings we have had in the first quarter of any year.
Revenues increased 1% from the fourth quarter, as noninterest income was higher and net interest income was flat. As a reminder, net interest income, along with net interest margin, were unfavorably impacted by 2 fewer calendar days in the first quarter.
In comparison to the prior year quarter, revenues increased 3%, driven by improvements in both net interest income and noninterest income.
As expected, operating expenses were modestly higher as compared to the fourth quarter, due to traditionally higher first quarter payroll-related and winter-related operational costs.
However, we were pleased operating expense levels remained flat compared to the prior year quarter, especially considering the continued impact of strategic investments and increasing regulatory compliance costs.
The efficiency ratio increased slightly to 61.9% in the first quarter from 61.3% last quarter, reflecting higher revenues and the seasonal uptick in operating expenses. However, the ratio improved from 63.9% in the prior year quarter. While the first quarter is typically seasonally slower period, we achieved solid annualized loan growth of 5%. This marks the 18th consecutive quarter of loan growth. We are pleased with the success of our deposit gathering initiatives as evidenced by organic deposit growth of $1 billion in the quarter, which represents more than 17% growth on an annualized basis.
As we further develop our franchise-wide, cross-sell and deposit-gathering efforts, the deposit base will continue to see growth. Asset quality was, once again, exceptional as net charge-offs and nonperforming assets improved from already low levels.
With that, I'll pass it to David to discuss the quarter in more detail."
295774,290478674,789742,"People's United Financial Inc., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 16, 2015",2015-04-16,"Earnings Calls","People's United Financial, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Jack. On Slide 3, we provide detail behind the linked quarter change in net interest income. Higher average balances and strong originated loan growth increased to net -- increased net interest income by $3.4 million and $2.8 million, respectiv",1316,"Thank you, Jack. On Slide 3, we provide detail behind the linked quarter change in net interest income. Higher average balances and strong originated loan growth increased to net -- increased net interest income by $3.4 million and $2.8 million, respectively. The largest offset to these increases was a $3.3 million reduction in net interest income due to 2 fewer calendar days in the first quarter. Additionally, a decline in accretion from run-off in the acquired loan portfolio and increased deposit volume lowered net interest margin by $1.7 million and $1.1 million, respectively.
As mentioned on previous calls, growth in net interest income from the originated portfolio outpacing lost accretion on the acquired portfolio is a positive sign looking to the quarters ahead.
On Slide 4, net interest margin for the first quarter was 2.91%, a decline of 9 basis points from the fourth quarter. As we mentioned on our last earnings call, fewer calendar days impacted the margin by 5 basis points in the first quarter. Additionally, new loan volume negatively impacted the margin by 2 basis points, as new business yields remained lower than the total loan portfolio yield.  We continue to expect the full year 2015 margin to be within the range of 2.85% to 2.95% as outlined in January.
Slide 5 provides a breakdown of the increase in loans. The loan portfolio grew $337 million or 5% annualized. Originated loan growth for the quarter totaled $430 million. As in previous quarters, growth was well balanced from a product and geographic perspective.
C&I contributed $240 million of the total originated loan growth, while commercial real estate contributed $118 million. Within C&I, we experienced particular strength in our mortgage warehouse lending business.
The commercial portfolio remains broadly diversified with respect to loan type, geography and industry. Residential mortgages contributed $129 million of originated loan growth in the first quarter. Approximately 90% of the residential mortgage originations held for investment were high-grade adjustable rate mortgages.
In addition, the residential mortgage portfolio is strong -- the residential mortgage pipeline is strong and ended the quarter at the highest level in 2 years. We experienced acquired loan run-off of $93 million this quarter, compared to $129 million in the fourth quarter and $114 million in prior -- in the prior year quarter. The balance of the acquired portfolio at quarter end was $958 million.
Slide 6 shows the growth in deposits by segment from the fourth quarter. Deposits increased over $1 billion or 15.5% on an annualized basis, as commercial and retail deposits grew $635 million and $377 million, respectively. Broker deposits ended the quarter at $2.6 billion, unchanged from the end of the fourth quarter. As such, the deposit growth in the first quarter was organically driven. We experienced strong growth across all geographies and all business lines. 
Just as a reminder, the first and fourth quarters are typically our strongest quarters for deposits. It is worth noting that our loan-to-deposit ratio was 99% at March 31 and our cost of deposits came down 1 basis point in the quarter.
Overall, we are very pleased with the progress we are making gathering deposits. We firmly believe that deposits are an integral part of customer relationships, and we continue to focus on organic deposit growth.
On Slide 7, we take a closer look at noninterest income. Noninterest income grew 3% from the fourth quarter and was primarily driven by strong commercial banking lending fees, higher customer interest rate swap income, as well as gains on the sale of loans, which was primarily driven by the sale of one loan from the acquired portfolio. The increase in noninterest income was partially offset by the absence of security gains and lower bank service charges. As you will recall in the fourth quarter, the net security gain resulted from the call of a single acquired security.
On Slide 8, we illustrate the key components of changes in noninterest expense during the quarter. Nonoperating expenses increased over $5 million, which is mainly attributable to branch closure costs. We closed 8 branches during the first quarter, as we continue to optimize our branch delivery channel.
Since the beginning of 2011, we have closed 44 branches, which were mostly traditional branches. During the same period, we opened 24 branches, many of which are more cost-efficient, in-store branches.
We expect to close approximately 10 more branches during the remainder of the year, as well as to look for opportunities to reduce real estate costs further by consolidating other facilities. We are committed to branches as they provide valuable support to revenue-generating activities across all of our business lines.
From an operating perspective, expenses increased $4.5 million from the fourth quarter. Compensation and benefits increased $6.6 million, primarily due to traditionally higher first quarter payroll-related and benefit costs, while occupancy and equipment costs increased $2.4 million, of which approximately 1/2 was due to higher snow removal costs. As we have mentioned before, we continue to tightly control expenses, while investing in revenue-producing initiatives and covering the higher costs of regulatory compliance.
The next slide details our efficiency ratio over the last 5 quarters. While the ratio ticked up slightly in the first quarter, the results are still generally consistent with recent quarters and improved from the first quarter of 2014.
An important area of focus for the organization is to continue to improve operating leverage through revenue growth and effective expense management.
Slides 10 and 11 are a reminder of our excellent credit quality. Once again, we did see an improvement in nonperforming assets this quarter. Originated nonperforming assets, as a percentage of originated loans and REO at 80 basis points, remains below our peer group and top 50 banks, and has improved from 100 basis points in the first quarter 2014.
Looking at Slide 11, net charge-offs remained low at 11 basis points and improved from 13 basis points last quarter and 12 basis points 1 year ago. These levels reflect the minimal loss content in our nonperforming assets.
Slide 12 highlights our ability to grow both sides of the balance sheet. We continue to make progress on loan and deposit growth on a per share basis, while maintaining excellent asset quality. Over the past year, loans per share and deposits per share have grown at compound annual rates of 9% and 14%, respectively.
As shown on Slide 13, operating return on average assets decreased 4 basis points from last quarter, but improved 2 basis points from the first quarter of 2014. Our return on average assets continues to be impacted by the persistently low interest rate environment and the effective initiatives that have not yet attained expected levels of operating leverage. Progress will be driven by continued loan and deposit growth, fee income growth and an ongoing disciplined approach to expenses.
Slide 14 illustrates our return on average tangible equity. As profitability improves, we expect to see continued progress on this metric over time, as we have seen in recent quarters.
Turning to Slide 15. We are comfortable with our capital structure and balance sheet strength. Capital levels at the holding company and the bank remain strong, especially in light of our low-risk business model. Effective this quarter, our capital ratios are calculated in accordance with Basel III capital rep -- capital rules. Additionally, our leverage ratio benefited due to our charter change, as the denominator changed from period end total assets to quarterly average assets.
Slide 16 illustrates our interest rate risk profile for both parallel rate changes and yield curve twists. As you can see, we are a bit more asset-sensitive as compared to last quarter, primarily due to a loan mix -- our loan -- due to our loan mix trending towards floating rate loans, as well as the strong deposit growth that we achieved in the quarter.
Now I'd like to pass it back to Jack to wrap up."

As I often do, I'd spend time during the quarter following on with customers. These visits always provide me with a great sense of how well we are meeting their needs. The feedback I continually receive from customers is how our approach to relationship banking differentiates us in the market. In fact, we recently were recognized with an excellence award Associates in delivering exceptional service quality to small and middle-market businesses. While our extensive suite of products is comparable to larger banks, we also have a long history of focusing on relationship management at the local level. This combination uniquely positions us in our large and attractive markets and resonates deeply with customers. This enables us to broaden existing relationships and foster new ones, hoping to generate momentum across the franchise. We look to sustain this momentum and not only continuing to invest in talent, products and services, but also by showcasing our strengths to a wider audience through our new marketing campaign. The know-how starts with knowing new campaigns starting at the end of June and focuses on our ability to understand the needs of customers and the breadth of products and service offered by our commercial, wealth management and consumer businesses. If you reside in one of our markets, I'm sure you've already seen one of our new television spots, billboards or print ads. 
Now turning to the overview of the quarter on Slide 2. Our performance in the second quarter reflects this continued momentum. We grew loans 9% on an annualized basis, marking the 19th consecutive quarter of growth while at the same time, maintaining excellent asset quality. In addition, we are pleased with the continued progress in gathering organic deposits as evidenced by the 5% annualized growth during the quarter. As we maintain emphasis on our franchise wide, cross-sell and deposit gathering efforts, the deposit base will continue to see growth. Our continued focus on improving profitability drove a 6% increase in operating earnings from the prior year quarter. These results bring our operating earnings through the first half of the year to $127 million, a 9% increase from the same period in 2014. Revenues decreased slightly from the first quarter as a result of modestly lowered noninterest income, partially offset by higher net interest income. As discussed in the conference call in April, we expected noninterest income to moderate in subsequent quarters from a very strong first quarter results. In comparison to the prior year quarter, revenues on the -- on an operating basis increased 2%, driven by improvements in both net interest income and noninterest income. As expected, operating expenses improved from the first quarter, primarily resulting from lower compensation and benefits costs. On a year-over-year basis, operating expenses were slightly higher. However, we remain confident in our ability to control costs despite the ongoing impact of strategic investments and increasing regulatory compliance costs. 
With that, I'll pass it to David to discuss the quarter in more detail."

On Slide 3, we provide detail behind the linked quarter increase in net interest income from the first quarter. Strong originated loan growth and higher average balances and yields from the securities portfolio increased net interest income by $1.7 million and $1.5 million, respectively. Net interest income also benefited by $1.7 million from an additional calendar day in the second quarter. The largest offset to these improvements was a $1.4 million reduction in net interest income from higher deposit costs and volumes. Additionally, a decline in accretion from runoff in the acquired loan portfolio forward net interest income by $1 million. 
On Slide 4, net interest margin for the second quarter was 288, a decline of 3 basis points from the first quarter. New loan volume negatively impacted the margin by 4 basis points as new business yields remained lower than the total loan portfolio yield. In addition, the margin was lowered by 2 basis points from higher deposit volumes and costs. Contributing to the slightly higher cost of funds in the quarter where successful CB campaigns in the retail bank that targeted new customers drove increased foot traffic into the branches. Margin benefited by 2 basis points from an additional calendar day in the second quarter and 1 basis point from higher average balances and yields in the securities portfolio. 
Turning to Slide 5. Loan portfolio grew $633 million or 9% annualized from the first quarter. Originated loan growth through the quarter totaled $691 million. As in prior quarters, growth was well-balanced from a product and geographic perspective. C&I contributed $375 million of the total originated loan growth, while commercial real estate contributed $149 million. Within C&I, we experienced strength across several categories, including traditional C&I, asset based lending and most notably, in our mortgage warehouse lending business. The portfolio remains broadly diversified with respect to loan type, geography and industry. Residential mortgages had another strong quarter with $151 million of originated along growth. Similar with recent quarters, most of the newly-originated residential mortgages retained in our portfolio were hybrid adjustable-rate mortgages. The recent addition of a veteran sales manager and seasoned residential loan officers in our newer markets helped drive growth. This is another example of a targeted strategic investment in talent. We experienced acquired loan runoff of $58 million this quarter compared to $93 million in the first quarter. The remaining balance of the acquired portfolio at quarter end was $900 million. 
Slide 6 shows the growth in deposits by segment from the first quarter. Deposits increased $285 million or 4% on an annualized basis. Commercial deposits grew $310 million and retail deposits, in line with historical second quarter patterns, declined slightly as expected. Brokered deposits ended the quarter at $2.6 billion, down $13 million from the end of the first quarter. As such, the deposit growth in the second quarter was once again organically driven. Overall, we are very pleased with the progress we are making gathering deposits. We firmly believe that deposits are an integral part of customer relationships and we continue to focus on organic deposit growth. 
On Slide 7, we take a closer look at noninterest income. Noninterest income decreased 7% from the first quarter. As discussed on our conference call in April, we expected noninterest income would moderate in subsequent quarters. As such, commercial banking lending fees and customer interest rate swap income were down from very strong first quarter levels. Insurance revenues were also lower due to seasonal nature of insurance renewals. In addition, as you will recall, the first quarter benefited from the sale of 1 acquired loan. These decreases in noninterest income were partially offset by higher gains on sales of residential mortgages as well as higher bank service charges. 
On Slide 8, we illustrate the key components of changes in noninterest expense during the quarter. Nonoperating expenses decreased $3 million from the first quarter, which is mainly attributable to lower branch closure costs. Although branch closure costs were lower compared to last quarter, we did close 10 branches, bringing the year-to-date total to 18 as we continue to optimize our branch delivery channel. Since the beginning of 2011, we have closed 54 branches, which were mostly traditional branches. During the same period, we opened 24 branches,  most of which are more cost efficient in-store branches. In addition to optimizing the branch footprint, we have begun to install new technology in our branches to improve efficiencies and further reduce costs moving forward. From an operating perspective, expenses decreased $2.8 million from the first quarter. As expected, compensation and benefits decreased $5.1 million, resulting from lower payroll-related and benefit costs, which are traditionally higher in the first quarter. In addition, the quarter benefited from nearly $2 million in lower occupancy and equipment costs. Largest offset to these improvements was a $1.5 million increase in professional and outside services, increases primarily related to costs associated with a number of initiatives focused on enhancing our product offerings and processes. As we have mentioned before, we continue to tightly control expenses while investing in revenue producing initiatives and covering the higher costs of regulatory compliance. 
Next slide details our efficiency ratio over the last 5 quarters. The ratio improved from both the most recent quarter and the second quarter of 2014. Important area of focus for the organization is to continue to improve operating leverage with revenue growth and effective expense management. 
Slides 10 and 11 are a reminder of our excellent credit quality. Originated nonperforming assets, as a percentage of originated loans and REO at 83 basis points, remains below the peer group and top 50 banks, and has improved from 96 basis points in the second quarter of 2014.  Looking at Slide 11. Net charge-offs for the quarter were 5 basis points, an improvement from recent quarters and the lowest level in over 8 years. These levels reflect the minimal loss content in our nonperforming assets, in our view, that conservative underwriting is vital for sustainable value creation. 
As shown on Slide 12, operating return on average assets decreased 1 basis point and 2 basis points, respectively, from last quarter and the second quarter of 2014. Our return on average assets continues to be impacted by the persistently low interest rate environment. Progress will be driven by continued loan and deposit growth, fee income growth and an ongoing disciplined approach to expenses. 
Slide 13 illustrates our return on average tangible equity. While this metric is down slightly from recent quarters, as profitability improves, we expect to see continued progress over time as we have seen in previous quarters. 
Turning to Slide 14. We remain comfortable with our capital structure and balance sheet strength. Capital levels at the holding company and the bank continue to be strong, especially in light of our diversified business mix and history of exceptional Credit Risk Management. 
Slide 15 displays our interest rate risk profile for both parallel rate changes and yield curve twist. As you can see, we are a bit more asset-sensitive as compared to last quarter, primarily due to a loan mix trending towards floating rate loans. At June 30, 41% of the loan portfolio was either 1 month LIBOR or prime based, 70% of these loans being 1 month LIBOR-based. 
Now, I'd like to pass it back to Jack to wrap up."

So one is to cover net charge-off activity and the other is to build the allowance as we grow the portfolio. So when you think about covering net charge-offs, we did have some very good recoveries this quarter, not too far out of normal range, but better than average. So that impacted the net charge-off of some as well. So."

As I often do, I spend time during the quarter following on customers. These visits always provide me with a great sense of how well we are meeting their needs. The feedback I continually receive from customers is how our approach to relationship banking differentiates us in the market. In fact, we recently were recognized with an excellence award by Greenwich Associates in delivering exceptional service quality to small and middle-market businesses. While our extensive suite of products is comparable to larger banks, we also have a long history of focusing on relationship management at the local level. This combination uniquely positions us in our large and attractive markets and resonates deeply with customers. This enables us to broaden existing relationships and foster new ones, hoping to generate momentum across the franchise. We look to sustain this momentum and not only continuing to invest in talent, products and services, but also by showcasing our strengths to a wider audience through our new marketing campaign. The know-how starts with knowing new campaigns starting at the end of June and focuses on our ability to understand the needs of customers and the breadth of products and service offered by our commercial, wealth management and consumer businesses. If you reside in one of our markets, I'm sure you've already seen one of our new television spots, billboards or print ads. 
Now turning to the overview of the quarter on Slide 2. Our performance in the second quarter reflects this continued momentum. We grew loans 9% on an annualized basis, marking the 19th consecutive quarter of growth while at the same time, maintaining excellent asset quality. In addition, we are pleased with the continued progress in gathering organic deposits as evidenced by the 5% annualized growth during the quarter. As we maintain emphasis on our franchise-wide cross-sell and deposit gathering efforts, the deposit base will continue to see growth. Our continued focus on improving profitability drove a 6% increase in operating earnings from the prior year quarter. These results bring our operating earnings through the first half of the year to $127 million, a 9% increase from the same period in 2014. Revenues decreased slightly from the first quarter as a result of modestly lowered noninterest income, partially offset by higher net interest income. As discussed in the conference call in April, we expected noninterest income to moderate in subsequent quarters from a very strong first quarter results. In comparison to the prior year quarter, revenues on an operating basis increased 2%, driven by improvements in both net interest income and noninterest income. As expected, operating expenses improved from the first quarter, primarily resulting from lower compensation and benefits costs. On a year-over-year basis, operating expenses were slightly higher. However, we remain confident in our ability to control costs despite the ongoing impact of strategic investments and increasing regulatory compliance costs. 
With that, I'll pass it to David to discuss the quarter in more detail."
295774,306067647,834107,"People's United Financial Inc., Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 16, 2015",2015-07-16,"Earnings Calls","People's United Financial, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Jack. On Slide 3, we provide detail behind the linked quarter increase in net interest income from the first quarter.

On Slide 3, we provide detail behind the linked quarter increase in net interest income from the first quarter. Strong originated loan growth and higher average balances and yields from the securities portfolio increased net interest income by $1.7 million and $1.5 million, respectively. Net interest income also benefited by $1.7 million from an additional calendar day in the second quarter. The largest offset to these improvements was a $1.4 million reduction in net interest income from higher deposit costs and volumes. Additionally, a decline in accretion from runoffs in the acquired loan portfolio forward net interest income by $1 million. 
On Slide 4, net interest margin for the second quarter was 2.88%, a decline of 3 basis points from the first quarter. New loan volume negatively impacted the margin by 4 basis points as new business yields remained lower than the total loan portfolio yield. In addition, the margin was lowered by 2 basis points from higher deposit volumes and costs. Contributing to the slightly higher cost of funds in the quarter were successful CB campaigns in the retail bank that targeted new customers and drove increased foot traffic into the branches. Margin benefited by 2 basis points from an additional calendar day in the second quarter and 1 basis point from higher average balances and yields in the securities portfolio. 
Turning to Slide 5. Loan portfolio grew $633 million or 9% annualized from the first quarter. Originated loan growth through the quarter totaled $691 million. As in prior quarters, growth was well-balanced from a product and geographic perspective. C&I contributed $375 million of the total originated loan growth, while commercial real estate contributed $149 million. Within C&I, we experienced strength across several categories, including traditional C&I, asset based lending and most notably, in our mortgage warehouse lending business. The portfolio remains broadly diversified with respect to loan type, geography and industry. Residential mortgages had another strong quarter with $151 million of originated loan growth. Similar with recent quarters, most of the newly-originated residential mortgages retained in our portfolio were hybrid adjustable-rate mortgages. The recent addition of a veteran sales manager and seasoned residential loan officers in our newer markets helped drive growth. This is another example of a targeted strategic investment in talent. We experienced acquired loan runoff of $58 million this quarter compared to $93 million in the first quarter. The remaining balance of the acquired portfolio at quarter end was $900 million. 
Slide 6 shows the growth in deposits by segment from the first quarter. Deposits increased $285 million or 4% on an annualized basis. Commercial deposits grew $310 million and retail deposits, in line with historical second quarter patterns, declined slightly as expected. Broker deposits ended the quarter at $2.6 billion, down $13 million from the end of the first quarter. As such, the deposit growth in the second quarter was once again organically driven. Overall, we are very pleased with the progress we are making gathering deposits. We firmly believe that deposits are an integral part of customer relationships and we continue to focus on organic deposit growth. 
On Slide 7, we take a closer look at noninterest income. Noninterest income decreased 7% from the first quarter. As discussed on our conference call in April, we expected noninterest income would moderate in subsequent quarters. As such, commercial banking lending fees and customer interest rate swap income were down from very strong first quarter levels. Insurance revenues were also lower due to the seasonal nature of insurance renewals. In addition, as you will recall, the first quarter benefited from the sale of 1 acquired loan. These decreases in noninterest income were partially offset by higher gains on sales of residential mortgages as well as higher bank service charges. 
On Slide 8, we illustrate the key components of changes in noninterest expense during the quarter. Nonoperating expenses decreased $3 million from the first quarter which is mainly attributable to lower branch closure costs. Although branch closure costs were lower compared to last quarter, we did close 10 branches, bringing the year-to-date total to 18 as we continue to optimize our branch delivery channel. Since the beginning of 2011, we have closed 54 branches which were mostly traditional branches. During the same period, we opened 24 branches, most of which are more cost efficient in-store branches. In addition to optimizing the branch footprint, we have begun to install new technology in our branches to improve efficiencies and further reduce costs moving forward. From an operating perspective, expenses decreased $2.8 million from the first quarter. As expected, compensation and benefits decreased $5.1 million, resulting from lower payroll-related and benefit costs which are traditionally higher in the first quarter. In addition, the quarter benefited from nearly $2 million in lower occupancy and equipment costs. Largest offset to these improvements was a $1.5 million increase in professional and outside services, increases primarily related to costs associated with a number of initiatives focused on enhancing our product offerings and processes. As we have mentioned before, we continue to tightly control expenses while investing in revenue producing initiatives and covering the higher costs of regulatory compliance. 
Next slide details our efficiency ratio over the last 5 quarters. Ratio improved from both the most recent quarter and the second quarter of 2014. An important area of focus for the organization is to continue to improve operating leverage with revenue growth and effective expense management. 
Slides 10 and 11 are a reminder of our excellent credit quality. Originated nonperforming assets as a percentage of originated loans and REO at 83 basis points remains below the peer group and top 50 banks, and has improved from 96 basis points in the second quarter of 2014.  Looking at Slide 11. Net charge-offs for the quarter were 5 basis points, an improvement from recent quarters and the lowest level in over 8 years. These levels reflect the minimal loss content in our nonperforming assets, and our view that conservative underwriting is vital for sustainable value creation. 
As shown on Slide 12, operating return on average assets decreased 1 basis point and 2 basis points, respectively, from last quarter and the second quarter of 2014. Our return on average assets continues to be impacted by the persistently low interest rate environment. Progress will be driven by continued loan and deposit growth, fee income growth and an ongoing disciplined approach to expenses. 
Slide 13 illustrates our return on average tangible equity. While this metric is down slightly from recent quarters, as profitability improves, we expect to see continued progress over time as we have seen in previous quarters. 
Turning to Slide 14. We remain comfortable with our capital structure and balance sheet strength. Capital levels at the holding company and the bank continue to be strong, especially in light of our diversified business mix and the history of exceptional Credit Risk Management. 
Slide 15 displays our interest rate risk profile for both parallel rate changes and yield curve twist. As you can see, we are a bit more asset-sensitive as compared to last quarter, primarily due to a loan mix trending towards floating rate loans. At June 30, 41% of the loan portfolio was either 1 month LIBOR or prime based, 70% of these loans being 1 month LIBOR-based. 
Now, I'd like to pass it back to Jack to wrap up."

North of that in Massachusetts, in the northern pieces, we only have one, actually, to my knowledge and recollection. So when you think about where we do have in-stores, we think of it in a watch traffic pattern, as many, many of our customers use both. So they'll use an in-store and a traditional. And so we like the idea of, sometimes we call it a hub and spoke kind of thing. But if you think about it, when somebody's taking advantage of the convenience of 7 days and extended hours, but at the same time, maybe whizz there the traditional branch and uses the drive-up and that kind of thing, it's really how they play together. And I don't know that we really think of it, say, as a percentage in terms of optimization as much as how are both types of branches working within a particular market. Naturally, the kind of geographic and access particulars are different, unique in each place. But what we do find very successful is the combined convenience of both."

As I often do, I spend time during the quarter calling on customers. These visits always provide me with a great sense of how well we are meeting their needs. The feedback I continually receive from customers is how our approach to relationship banking differentiates us in the market. In fact, we recently were recognized with an excellence award by Greenwich Associates in delivering exceptional service quality to small and middle-market businesses. While our extensive suite of products is comparable to larger banks, we also have a long history of focusing on relationship management at the local level. This combination uniquely positions us in our large and attractive markets and resonates deeply with customers. This enables us to broaden existing relationships and foster new ones, helping to generate momentum across the franchise. We look to sustain this momentum and not only continuing to invest in talent, products and services, but also by showcasing our strengths to a wider audience through our new marketing campaign. The know-how starts with knowing new campaigns starting at the end of June and focuses on our ability to understand the needs of customers and the breadth of products and service offered by our commercial, wealth management and consumer businesses. If you reside in one of our markets, I'm sure you've already seen one of our new television spots, billboards or print ads. 
Now turning to the overview of the quarter on Slide 2. Our performance in the second quarter reflects this continued momentum. We grew loans 9% on an annualized basis, marking the 19th consecutive quarter of growth while at the same time, maintaining excellent asset quality. In addition, we are pleased with the continued progress in gathering organic deposits as evidenced by the 5% annualized growth during the quarter. As we maintain emphasis on our franchise-wide cross-sell and deposit gathering efforts, the deposit base will continue to see growth. Our continued focus on improving profitability drove a 6% increase in operating earnings from the prior year quarter. These results bring our operating earnings through the first half of the year to $127 million, a 9% increase from the same period in 2014. Revenues decreased slightly from the first quarter as a result of modestly lower noninterest income, partially offset by higher net interest income. As discussed in the conference call in April, we expected noninterest income to moderate in subsequent quarters from a very strong first quarter results. In comparison to the prior year quarter, revenues on an operating basis increased 2%, driven by improvements in both net interest income and noninterest income. As expected, operating expenses improved from the first quarter, primarily resulting from lower compensation and benefits costs. On a year-over-year basis, operating expenses were slightly higher. However, we remain confident in our ability to control costs despite the ongoing impact of strategic investments and increasing regulatory compliance costs. 
With that, I'll pass it to David to discuss the quarter in more detail."

On Slide 3, we provide detail behind the linked quarter increase in net interest income from the first quarter.

On Slide 3, we provide detail behind the linked quarter increase in net interest income from the first quarter. Strong originated loan growth and higher average balances and yields from the securities portfolio increased net interest income by $1.7 million and $1.5 million, respectively. Net interest income also benefited by $1.7 million from an additional calendar day in the second quarter. The largest offset to these improvements was a $1.4 million reduction in net interest income from higher deposit costs and volumes. Additionally, a decline in accretion from runoffs in the acquired loan portfolio lowered net interest income by $1 million. 
On Slide 4, net interest margin for the second quarter was 2.88%, a decline of 3 basis points from the first quarter. New loan volume negatively impacted the margin by 4 basis points as new business yields remained lower than the total loan portfolio yield. In addition, the margin was lowered by 2 basis points from higher deposit volumes and costs. Contributing to the slightly higher cost of funds in the quarter were successful CB campaigns in the retail bank that targeted new customers and drove increased foot traffic into the branches. Margin benefited by 2 basis points from an additional calendar day in the second quarter and 1 basis point from higher average balances and yields in the securities portfolio. 
Turning to Slide 5. Loan portfolio grew $633 million or 9% annualized from the first quarter. Originated loan growth through the quarter totaled $691 million. As in prior quarters, growth was well-balanced from a product and geographic perspective. C&I contributed $375 million of the total originated loan growth, while commercial real estate contributed $149 million. Within C&I, we experienced strength across several categories, including traditional C&I, asset based lending and most notably, in our mortgage warehouse lending business. The portfolio remains broadly diversified with respect to loan type, geography and industry. Residential mortgages had another strong quarter with $151 million of originated loan growth. Similar with recent quarters, most of the newly-originated residential mortgages retained in our portfolio were hybrid adjustable-rate mortgages. The recent addition of a veteran sales manager and seasoned residential loan officers in our newer markets helped drive growth. This is another example of a targeted strategic investment in talent. We experienced acquired loan runoff of $58 million this quarter compared to $93 million in the first quarter. The remaining balance of the acquired portfolio at quarter end was $900 million. 
Slide 6 shows the growth in deposits by segment from the first quarter. Deposits increased $285 million or 4% on an annualized basis. Commercial deposits grew $310 million and retail deposits, in line with historical second quarter patterns, declined slightly as expected. Broker deposits ended the quarter at $2.6 billion, down $13 million from the end of the first quarter. As such, the deposit growth in the second quarter was once again organically driven. Overall, we are very pleased with the progress we are making gathering deposits. We firmly believe that deposits are an integral part of customer relationships and we continue to focus on organic deposit growth. 
On Slide 7, we take a closer look at noninterest income. Noninterest income decreased 7% from the first quarter. As discussed on our conference call in April, we expected noninterest income would moderate in subsequent quarters. As such, commercial banking lending fees and customer interest rate swap income were down from very strong first quarter levels. Insurance revenues were also lower due to the seasonal nature of insurance renewals. In addition, as you will recall, the first quarter benefited from the sale of 1 acquired loan. These decreases in noninterest income were partially offset by higher gains on sales of residential mortgages as well as higher bank service charges. 
On Slide 8, we illustrate the key components of changes in noninterest expense during the quarter. Nonoperating expenses decreased $3 million from the first quarter which is mainly attributable to lower branch closure costs. Although branch closure costs were lower compared to last quarter, we did close 10 branches, bringing the year-to-date total to 18 as we continue to optimize our branch delivery channel. Since the beginning of 2011, we have closed 54 branches which were mostly traditional branches. During the same period, we opened 24 branches, most of which are more cost efficient in-store branches. In addition to optimizing the branch footprint, we have begun to install new technology in our branches to improve efficiencies and further reduce costs moving forward. From an operating perspective, expenses decreased $2.8 million from the first quarter. As expected, compensation and benefits decreased $5.1 million, resulting from lower payroll-related and benefit costs which are traditionally higher in the first quarter. In addition, the quarter benefited from nearly $2 million in lower occupancy and equipment costs. The largest offset to these improvements was a $1.5 million increase in professional and outside services, increases primarily related to costs associated with a number of initiatives focused on enhancing our product offerings and processes. As we have mentioned before, we continue to tightly control expenses while investing in revenue producing initiatives and covering the higher costs of regulatory compliance. 
Next slide details our efficiency ratio over the last 5 quarters. The ratio improved from both the most recent quarter and the second quarter of 2014. An important area of focus for the organization is to continue to improve operating leverage with revenue growth and effective expense management. 
Slides 10 and 11 are a reminder of our excellent credit quality. Originated nonperforming assets as a percentage of originated loans and REO at 83 basis points remains below the peer group and top 50 banks, and has improved from 96 basis points in the second quarter of 2014.  Looking at Slide 11. Net charge-offs for the quarter were 5 basis points, an improvement from recent quarters and the lowest level in over 8 years. These levels reflect the minimal loss content in our nonperforming assets, and our view that conservative underwriting is vital for sustainable value creation. 
As shown on Slide 12, operating return on average assets decreased 1 basis point and 2 basis points, respectively, from last quarter and the second quarter of 2014. Our return on average assets continues to be impacted by the persistently low interest rate environment. Progress will be driven by continued loan and deposit growth, fee income growth and an ongoing disciplined approach to expenses. 
Slide 13 illustrates our return on average tangible equity. While this metric is down slightly from recent quarters, as profitability improves, we expect to see continued progress over time as we have seen in previous quarters. 
Turning to Slide 14. We remain comfortable with our capital structure and balance sheet strength. Capital levels at the holding company and the bank continue to be strong, especially in light of our diversified business mix and  history of exceptional Credit Risk Management. 
Slide 15 displays our interest rate risk profile for both parallel rate changes and yield curve twist. As you can see, we are a bit more asset-sensitive as compared to last quarter, primarily due to a loan mix trending towards floating rate loans. At June 30, 41% of the loan portfolio was either 1 month LIBOR or prime based, 70% of these loans being 1 month LIBOR-based. 
Now, I'd like to pass it back to Jack to wrap up."

North of that in Massachusetts, in the northern pieces, we only have one, actually, to my knowledge and recollection. So when you think about where we do have in-stores, we think of it in a watch traffic pattern, as many, many of our customers use both. So they'll use an in-store and a traditional. And so we like the idea of, sometimes we call it a hub and spoke kind of thing. But if you think about it, when somebody's taking advantage of the convenience of 7 days and extended hours, but at the same time, maybe lives there, near the traditional branch and uses the drive-up and that kind of thing, it's really how they play together. And I don't know that we really think of it, say, as a percentage in terms of optimization as much as how are both types of branches working within a particular market.

And that's a one time event. And then, we also paid some outside fees in our payments space, those same folks that helped us with the joint venture in the merchant service helped us evaluate several other aspects of our payments environment and some of the offerings we have there. So that trend and the uptick that you see should not continue as we go forward. We will -- we've got other things going on in terms of other outside professional service vendors that we continue to negotiate a contract with and we continue to increase utilization of. So it should be relatively in the range of spending shortly."

And that's been -- our efforts have been in place for 2 years now or so, where we've really impressed upon our relationship managers the need to raise commercial deposits because we've been undersized in commercial deposits as an institution for a long period of time. And so we did a couple of things there. We increased incentives for deposits but more importantly, we put in profitability models that lenders need to submit with every loan request. So it's looking at the totality of the relationship, both the loan, all the fee income businesses as well as the deposits. And the deposits are a large component of the profitability. So we changed focus on that across the organization and that's what we're seeing flow through. The commercial growth in the quarter was $310 million, to give you the number."

Good afternoon. We appreciate everyone joining us today. The results this quarter reflect our unwavering commitment to further improve profitability, which remains our most important objective. While we are proud of our accomplishments",421,"Thank you, Andrew. Good afternoon. We appreciate everyone joining us today. The results this quarter reflect our unwavering commitment to further improve profitability, which remains our most important objective. While we are proud of our accomplishments over recent years, particularly given the persistently low interest rate environment, we must continue to drive forward further execute on the significant opportunities that exist across our large and attractive markets. 
Given the breadth of our products and services, we provide the exceptional talent we continue to attract and our strong focus on relationship banking, we are confident in our ability to deliver consistent quality earnings growth for our shareholders. 
Now turning to the overview of the third quarter on Slide 2. Operating earnings of $68.4 million or $0.23 per share represent a 9% increase from the prior year quarter or a 10% increase on a per share basis. Revenues increased 3% on both a linked-quarter and a year-over-year basis, driven by higher net interest income and higher fee revenues. 
It's important to note the pace of net interest margin decline continued to moderate in the third quarter. Net interest margin was 2.87%, a decrease of only 1 basis point from the second quarter. 
Expenses were up modestly on both a linked quarter and a year-over-year basis, primarily reflecting higher compensation and benefits cost. However, we remain confident in our ability to control costs despite the ongoing impact of strategic investments and higher regulatory compliance costs. 
Loans grew for the 20th consecutive quarter, although the 2% annualized growth rate is a slower pace than recent quarters. The portfolio was primarily impacted by lower line utilizations and volumes within our mortgage warehouse lending business. 
Loan outstandings within this business tend to be more volatile than our other businesses. Excluding mortgage warehouse lending, loans grew over 6% on an annualized basis, driven by strong residential mortgage and commercial real estate results. 
Highlighting the importance of our diversified business mix. Our progress gathering deposits continued during the quarter as evidenced by annualized growth of 12% from the end of the second quarter. As we maintain emphasis on franchise-wide cross-sell and deposit gathering efforts, the deposit base will continue to see growth. 
Recently released FDIC data show we either increased or maintained our deposit market share rank in each state we operate in and we are particularly pleased with our continued #1 market share position within the Fairfield County, Connecticut in the state of Vermont. 
With that, I'll pass it to David to discuss the quarter in more detail."

Our ongoing loan growth as well as higher average balances and yields in the securities portfolio each increased net interest income by $2.2 million. Net interest income also increased $1.7 million from an additional calendar day in the third quarter. 
The largest offset to these improvements was a $1 million reduction in net interest income due to a decline in accretion from runoff in the acquired loan portfolio. 
On Slide 4, net interest margin of 2.87% was lower by only 1 basis point compared to the second quarter as the pace of decline continued to moderate. As such, this result is the smallest linked-quarter decline in over 3 years. 
New loan volume negatively impacted the margin by 2 basis points as new business yields remained lower than the total loan portfolio yield. In addition, the margin decreased a basis point from higher deposit volumes and costs, which primarily resulted from the successful CD campaigns discussed last quarter. These declines were largely offset by a 2 basis point increase from an additional calendar day in the third quarter. 
Through 9 months, the net interest margin is 2.89%. Given these results, we expect the full year margin will be within the range of 2.85% to 2.95% we outlined in January. 
Turning to Slide 5, the loan portfolio grew $110 million or 2% annualized from the second quarter. Originated loan growth for the quarter totaled $169 million. 
Retail contributed $208 million of originated loan growth, which was almost entirely driven by strong residential mortgage growth of $201 million. As is our practice, most of the newly originated residential mortgages retained in our portfolio were hybrid arms. 
Originated loans in the commercial portfolio were down $39 million from the second quarter due to a $248 million reduction in C&I. As Jack discussed earlier, this result was entirely driven by lower volumes and utilization rates in our mortgage warehouse lending business. 
The period end balance for this business was $839 million, down $312 million from June 30. However, the quarterly average balance decline for mortgage warehouse lending was only $45 million. 
Commercial real estate contributed solid originated growth of $209 million, marking the second consecutive quarter the pace of originated commercial real estate growth has increased. 
We experienced acquired loan runoff of $59 million this quarter compared to $58 million in the second quarter. The remaining balance of the acquired portfolio at quarter end was $841 million. 
The fourth quarter historically has been our strongest quarter in terms of loan originations and our current view is for this trend to continue this year. However, with annualized loan growth of 5% through 9 months, achieving the lower end of the range we outlined in January will be challenging. 
Slide 6 shows the change in deposits by segment from the second quarter. Total deposits increased $845 million or 12% on an annualized basis, primarily due to continued progress gathering commercial deposits. Commercial grew $883 million in the quarter compared to a $39 million reduction in retail. 
The seasonality of our municipal business had a favorable $486 million impact on commercial deposits, while the third quarter represents a seasonal low point for retail deposits with growth expected in the fourth quarter. 
Broker deposits ended the quarter at $2.7 billion, an increase of $60 million. This small increase does not change our expectation that broker deposits will represent a decrease in percentage of our deposit base as we continue to grow organically. 
It is also worth noting that our loan-to-deposit ratio is 28% at the end of the quarter. Overall, we are very pleased with our progress gathering deposits and firmly believe that deposits are an integral part of customer relationships. 
On Slide 7, we take a closer look at the 3% increase in non-interest income from the second quarter. As seasonal nature of insurance renewals increase noninterest income by $2.6 million while the continued success of our customer interest rates swap business contributed an additional $1.2 million compared to the second quarter. 
In addition, bank service charges improved $1 million, primarily as a result of 1 more business day in the third quarter and higher cash management fees, which have benefited from efforts to grow commercial deposits. 
On Slide 8, we illustrate the key components of changes in non-interest expenses on a linked-quarter basis. Nonoperating expenses decreased $2.9 million, primarily resulting from no branch closures in the third quarter. 
As you will recall, we closed 10 branches in the second quarter. From an operating perspective, expenses were up $5.3 million from the second quarter due in large part to a $4.3 million increase in compensation and benefits, primarily reflecting an additional work day and higher medical-related cost in the third quarter. 
While operating expenses were modestly higher than recent quarters, we remain confident our proactive approach to expense management will continue to control costs. 
Next slide details our efficiency ratio over the last 5 quarters. While the ratio ticked up slightly in the third quarter, the results were still generally consistent with recent quarters. 
As we have mentioned before, continuing to improve operating leverage through revenue growth and effective expense management remains a highly important commitment of the company. 
Slides 10 and 11 are a reminder of our excellent credit quality. Originated nonperforming assets as a percentage of originated loans and REO at 78 basis points remains below our peer group in top 50 banks and has improved from 92 basis points in the third quarter of 2014. 
Looking at Slide 11. Net charge-offs for the quarter remained at a very low level. These levels reflect the minimal loss content in our nonperforming assets as well as our conservative and well-defined underlining philosophy that has served us so well for many years. 
As shown on Slide 12, operating return on average assets increased 3 basis points from the second quarter. Notwithstanding this improvement, our return on average assets continues to be impacted by the persistently low interest rate environment. 
Further progress will be achieved by balance sheet growth, fee income growth and an ongoing disciplined approach to expenses. 
Looking at Slide 13, our return on average tangible equity was 10.5% for the third quarter, an improvement of 70 basis points on a linked-quarter basis. 
As we continue to focus on our most important objective, improving profitability, we expect to see further progress in this metric over time. 
Turning to Slide 14. We remain comfortable with our capital structure and balance sheet strength. Capital levels at the holding company and the bank continue to be strong, especially in light of our diversified business mix and history of exceptional credit risk management. 
Slide 15 displays our interest rate risk profile for both parallel rate changes and yield curve twist. As you can see, we remain asset-sensitive though slightly less so than last quarter. However, we remain well positioned for an eventual rise in interest rates. 
Now I'd like to pass it back to Jack to wrap up."

I think very positive news in mortgage warehouse, if you look back over the last 3 or 4 years is the level of commitments that they have had outstanding has steadily increased. They've continued to build the business. And so the peak that we had in line utilization in the second quarter has proved to be -- and right at the end of the period, proved to be more than we expected in. And in hindsight now, it kind of feels that a lot of the discussion about the change and the regulatory disclosure was pushing volume and are pulling it through ahead of that transition and certainly our customer base on a display that. If you look where the third quarter is and then go back to the first and the fourth quarter, the line utilization has kind of come back to the range where it's been. So very, very much in line with those other quarters. So kind of forecasting forward into the fourth quarter is difficult. There's certainly some discussion out there that mortgage bankers and then Freddie, people expect things to slow and we're evaluating that, especially as we think about fourth quarter, but also the plan for next year. I would say our folks on the ground are cautiously expecting some continued reduction, but I don't see it as being dramatic right now. It's just like interest rate, how do you predict it?"

As you can see, some of the residual effects of that were at the bank, we have higher total risk-based capital currently and you can see the changes over time. So the -- we go back to -- there's been a long evolution of capital management at this company going back to being grossly over capitalized, coming out of the Tier 2  second step conversion and there's been a series of acquisitions. There's -- we bought back 25% of the stock that was issued in that transaction to a bunch of buybacks. And we've also had a nice and strong dividend payout to shareholders. So the capital rose under Basel III are pretty clear about what an efficient capital structure is. And that the most efficient capital structure does include preferred. And our job is to create that efficient capital structure, the most efficient capital structure we can for shareholders.

Good afternoon. We appreciate everyone joining us today. The results of this quarter reflect our unwavering commitment to further improve profitability, which remains our most important objective.

The results of this quarter reflect our unwavering commitment to further improve profitability, which remains our most important objective. While we are proud of our accomplishments over recent years, particularly given the persistently low interest rate environment, we must continue to drive forward and further execute on the significant opportunities that exist across our large and attractive markets. 
Given the breadth of our products and services we provide, the exceptional talent we continue to attract and our strong focus on relationship banking, we are confident in our ability to deliver consistent quality earnings growth for our shareholders. 
Now turning to the overview of the third quarter on Slide 2. Operating earnings of $68.4 million or $0.23 per share represent a 9% increase from the prior year quarter or a 10% increase on a per share basis. Revenues increased 3% on both a linked-quarter and a year-over-year basis, driven by higher net interest income and higher fee revenues. 
It's important to note the pace of net interest margin decline continued to moderate in the third quarter. Net interest margin was 2.87%, a decrease of only 1 basis point from the second quarter. 
Expenses were up modestly on both a linked quarter and a year-over-year basis, primarily reflecting higher compensation and benefits cost. However, we remain confident in our ability to control costs despite the ongoing impact of strategic investments and higher regulatory compliance costs. 
Loans grew for the 20th consecutive quarter, although the 2% annualized growth rate is a slower pace than recent quarters. The portfolio was primarily impacted by lower line utilizations and volumes within our mortgage warehouse lending business. 
Loan outstandings within this business tend to be more volatile than our other businesses. Excluding mortgage warehouse lending, loans grew over 6% on an annualized basis, driven by strong residential mortgage and commercial real estate results, highlighting the importance of our diversified business mix. Our progress gathering deposits continued during the quarter as evidenced by annualized growth of 12% from the end of the second quarter. As we maintain emphasis on franchise-wide cross-sell and deposit gathering efforts, the deposit base will continue to see growth. 
Recently released FDIC data show we either increased or maintained our deposit market share rank in each state we operate in, and we are particularly pleased with our continued #1 market share position within the Fairfield County, Connecticut in the state of Vermont.

On Slide 3, we provide detail behind the linked-quarter increase in net interest income from the second quarter. Our ongoing loan growth as well as higher average balances and yields in the securities portfolio each increased net interest",1179,"Thank you, Jack. On Slide 3, we provide detail behind the linked-quarter increase in net interest income from the second quarter. Our ongoing loan growth as well as higher average balances and yields in the securities portfolio each increased net interest income by $2.2 million. Net interest income also increased $1.7 million from an additional calendar day in the third quarter. 
The largest offset to these improvements was a $1 million reduction in net interest income due to a decline in accretion from runoff in the acquired loan portfolio. 
On Slide 4, net interest margin of 2.87% was lower by only 1 basis point compared to the second quarter as the pace of decline continued to moderate. As such, this result is the smallest linked-quarter decline in over 3 years. 
New loan volume negatively impacted the margin by 2 basis points as new business yields remained lower than the total loan portfolio yield. In addition, the margin decreased a basis point from higher deposit volumes and costs, which primarily resulted from the successful CD campaigns discussed last quarter. These declines were largely offset by a 2 basis point increase from an additional calendar day in the third quarter. 
Through 9 months, the net interest margin is 2.89%. Given these results, we expect the full year margin will be within the range of 2.85% to 2.95% we outlined in January. 
Turning to Slide 5, the loan portfolio grew $110 million or 2% annualized from the second quarter. Originated loan growth for the quarter totaled $169 million. 
Retail contributed $208 million of originated loan growth, which was almost entirely driven by strong residential mortgage growth of $201 million. As is our practice, most of the newly originated residential mortgages retained in our portfolio were hybrid arms. 
Originated loans in the commercial portfolio were down $39 million from the second quarter due to a $248 million reduction in C&I. As Jack discussed earlier, this result was entirely driven by lower volumes and utilization rates in our mortgage warehouse lending business. 
The period end balance for this business was $839 million, down $312 million from June 30. However, the quarterly average balance decline for mortgage warehouse lending was only $45 million. 
Commercial real estate contributed solid originated growth of $209 million, marking the second consecutive quarter the pace of originated commercial real estate growth has increased. 
We experienced acquired loan runoff of $59 million this quarter compared to $58 million in the second quarter. The remaining balance of the acquired portfolio at quarter end was $841 million. 
The fourth quarter historically has been our strongest quarter in terms of loan originations, and our current view is for this trend to continue this year. However, with annualized loan growth of 5% through 9 months, achieving the lower end of the range we outlined in January will be challenging. 
Slide 6 shows the change in deposits by segment from the second quarter. Total deposits increased $845 million or 12% on an annualized basis, primarily due to continued progress gathering commercial deposits. Commercial grew $883 million in the quarter compared to a $39 million reduction in retail. 
The seasonality of our municipal business had a favorable $486 million impact on commercial deposits, while the third quarter represents a seasonal low point for retail deposits with growth expected in the fourth quarter. 
Broker deposits ended the quarter at $2.7 billion, an increase of $60 million. This small increase does not change our expectation that broker deposits will represent a decrease in percentage of our deposit base, as we continue to grow organically. 
It is also worth noting that our loan-to-deposit ratio was 98% at the end of the quarter. Overall, we are very pleased with our progress gathering deposits and firmly believe that deposits are an integral part of customer relationships. 
On Slide 7, we take a closer look at the 3% increase in noninterest income from the second quarter. The seasonal nature of insurance renewals increased noninterest income by $2.6 million while the continued success of our customer interest rate swap business contributed an additional $1.2 million compared to the second quarter. 
In addition, bank service charges improved $1 million, primarily as a result of one more business day in the third quarter and higher cash management fees, which have benefited from efforts to grow commercial deposits. 
On Slide 8, we illustrate the key components of changes in noninterest expenses on a linked-quarter basis. Nonoperating expenses decreased $2.9 million, primarily resulting from no branch closures in the third quarter. 
As you will recall, we closed 10 branches in the second quarter. From an operating perspective, expenses were up $5.3 million from the second quarter due in large part to a $4.3 million increase in compensation and benefits, primarily reflecting an additional work day and higher medical-related costs in the third quarter. 
While operating expenses were modestly higher than recent quarters, we remain confident our proactive approach to expense management will continue to control costs. 
The next slide details our efficiency ratio over the last 5 quarters. While the ratio ticked up slightly in the third quarter, the results were still generally consistent with recent quarters. 
As we have mentioned before, continuing to improve operating leverage through revenue growth and effective expense management remains a highly important commitment of the company. 
Slides 10 and 11 are a reminder of our excellent credit quality. Originated nonperforming assets as a percentage of originated loans and REO at 78 basis points remains below our peer group and top 50 banks and has improved from 92 basis points in the third quarter of 2014. 
Looking at Slide 11. Net charge-offs for the quarter remained at a very low level. These levels reflect the minimal loss content in our nonperforming assets as well as our conservative and well-defined underwriting philosophy that has served us so well for many years. 
As shown on Slide 12, operating return on average assets increased 3 basis points from the second quarter. Notwithstanding this improvement, our return on average assets continues to be impacted by the persistently low interest rate environment. 
Further progress will be achieved by balance sheet growth, fee income growth and an ongoing disciplined approach to expenses. 
Looking at Slide 13, our return on average tangible equity was 10.5% for the third quarter, an improvement of 70 basis points on a linked-quarter basis. 
As we continue to focus on our most important objective, improving profitability, we expect to see further progress in this metric over time. 
Turning to Slide 14. We remain comfortable with our capital structure and balance sheet strength. Capital levels at the holding company and the bank continue to be strong, especially in light of our diversified business mix and history of exceptional credit risk management. 
Slide 15 displays our interest rate risk profile for both parallel rate changes and yield curve twist. As you can see, we remain asset-sensitive though slightly less so than last quarter. However, we remain well positioned for an eventual rise in interest rates. 
Now I'd like to pass it back to Jack to wrap up."

I think the very positive news in mortgage warehouse, if you look back over the last 3 or 4 years is the level of commitments that they have had outstanding has steadily increased.

And so the peak that we had in line utilization in the second quarter has proved to be -- and right at the end of the period, proved to be more than we expected. And in hindsight now, it kind of feels like a lot of the discussion about the change in the regulatory disclosure was pushing volume and are pulling it through ahead of that transition and certainly our customer base displayed that. If you look where the third quarter is and then go back to the first and the fourth quarter, the line utilization has kind of come back to the range where it's been. So very, very much in line with those other quarters. So kind of forecasting forward into the fourth quarter is difficult. There's certainly some discussion out there that mortgage bankers and Fannie and Freddie, people expect things to slow and we're evaluating that, especially as we think about fourth quarter, but also the plan for next year.

As you can see, some of the residual effects of that were at the bank, we have higher total risk-based capital currently and you can see the changes over time. So the -- we go back to -- there's been a long evolution of capital management at this company going back to being grossly over capitalized, coming out of the Tier 2  second step conversion and there's been a series of acquisitions. There's -- we bought back 25% of the stock that was issued in that transaction through a bunch of buybacks. And we've also had a nice and strong dividend payout to shareholders. So the capital rules under Basel III are pretty clear about what an efficient capital structure is. And that the most efficient capital structure does include preferred. And our job is to create that efficient capital structure, the most efficient capital structure we can for shareholders. And that's the simple logic behind the need to add preferred at some point and into the capital structure.

While we are proud of our accomplishments over recent years, particularly given the persistently low interest rate environment, we must continue to drive forward, further execute on the significant opportunities that exist across our large and attractive markets. 
Given the breadth of our products and services we provide, the exceptional talent we continue to attract and our strong focus on relationship banking, we are confident in our ability to deliver consistent quality earnings growth for our shareholders. 
Now turning to the overview of the third quarter on Slide 2. Operating earnings of $68.4 million or $0.23 per share represent a 9% increase from the prior year quarter or a 10% increase on a per-share basis. Revenues increased 3% on both a linked quarter and a year-over-year basis, driven by higher net interest income and higher fee revenues. 
It's important to note the pace of net interest margin decline continued to moderate in the third quarter. Net interest margin was 2.87%, a decrease of only 1 basis point from the second quarter. 
Expenses were up modestly on both a linked quarter and a year-over-year basis primarily reflecting higher compensation and benefits costs. However, we remain confident in our ability to control costs despite the ongoing impact of strategic investments and higher regulatory compliance costs. 
Loans grew for the 20th consecutive quarter, although the 2% annualized growth rate is a slower pace than recent quarters. The portfolio was primarily impacted by lower line utilizations and volumes within our mortgage warehouse lending business. 
Loan outstandings within this business tend to be more volatile than our other businesses. Excluding mortgage warehouse lending, loans grew over 6% on an annualized basis driven by strong residential mortgage and commercial real estate results, highlighting the importance of our diversified business mix. Our progress gathering deposits continued during the quarter as evidenced by annualized growth of 12% from the end of the second quarter. As we maintain emphasis on franchise-wide cross-sell and deposit gathering efforts, the deposit base will continue to see growth. 
Recently released FDIC data show we either increased or maintained our deposit market share rank in each state we operate in, and we are particularly pleased with our continued #1 market share position within Fairfield County, Connecticut, and the state of Vermont. 
With that, I'll pass it to David to discuss the quarter in more detail."

On Slide 3, we provide detail behind the linked quarter increase in net interest income from the second quarter. Our ongoing loan growth as well as higher average balances and yields in the securities portfolio each increased net interest",1188,"Thank you, Jack. On Slide 3, we provide detail behind the linked quarter increase in net interest income from the second quarter. Our ongoing loan growth as well as higher average balances and yields in the securities portfolio each increased net interest income by $2.2 million. Net interest income also increased $1.7 million from an additional calendar day in the third quarter. 
The largest offset to these improvements was a $1 million reduction in net interest income due to a decline in accretion from runoff in the acquired loan portfolio. 
On Slide 4, net interest margin of 2.87% was lower by only 1 basis point compared to the second quarter as the pace of decline continued to moderate. As such, this result is the smallest linked quarter decline in over 3 years. 
New loan volume negatively impacted the margin by 2 basis points as new business yields remained lower than the total loan portfolio yield. In addition, the margin decreased 1 basis point from higher deposit volumes and costs, which primarily resulted from the successful CD campaigns discussed last quarter. These declines were largely offset by a 2 basis point increase from an additional calendar day in the third quarter. 
Through 9 months, the net interest margin is 2.89%. Given these results, we expect the full year margin will be within the range of 2.85% to 2.95% we outlined in January. 
Turning to Slide 5, the loan portfolio grew $110 million or 2% annualized from the second quarter. Originated loan growth for the quarter totaled $169 million. 
Retail contributed $208 million of originated loan growth, which was almost entirely driven by strong residential mortgage growth of $201 million. As is our practice, most of the newly originated residential mortgages retained in our portfolio were hybrid arms. 
Originated loans in the commercial portfolio were down $39 million from the second quarter due to a $248 million reduction in C&I. As Jack discussed earlier, this result was entirely driven by lower volumes and utilization rates in our mortgage warehouse lending business. 
The period end balance for this business was $839 million, down $312 million from June 30. However, the quarterly average balance decline for mortgage warehouse lending was only $45 million. 
Commercial real estate contributed solid originated growth of $209 million, marking the second consecutive quarter the pace of originated commercial real estate growth has increased. 
We experienced acquired loan runoff of $59 million this quarter compared to $58 million in the second quarter. The remaining balance of the acquired portfolio at quarter-end was $841 million. 
The fourth quarter historically has been our strongest quarter in terms of loan originations, and our current view is for this trend to continue this year. However, with annualized loan growth of 5% through 9 months, achieving the lower end of the range we outlined in January will be challenging. 
Slide 6 shows the change in deposits by segment from the second quarter. Total deposits increased $845 million or 12% on an annualized basis primarily due to continued progress gathering commercial deposits. Commercial grew $883 million in the quarter compared to a $39 million (sic) [ $38 million ] reduction in retail. 
The seasonality of our municipal business had a favorable $486 million impact on commercial deposits, while the third quarter represents a seasonal low point for retail deposits with growth expected in the fourth quarter. 
Broker deposits ended the quarter at $2.7 billion, an increase of $60 million. This small increase does not change our expectation that broker deposits will represent a decreasing percentage of our deposit base as we continue to grow organically. 
It is also worth noting that our loan-to-deposit ratio was 98% at the end of the quarter. Overall, we are very pleased with our progress gathering deposits and firmly believe that deposits are an integral part of customer relationships. 
On Slide 7, we take a closer look at the 3% increase in noninterest income from the second quarter. The seasonal nature of insurance renewals increased noninterest income by $2.6 million while the continued success of our customer interest rate swap business contributed an additional $1.2 million compared to the second quarter. 
In addition, bank service charges improved $1 million primarily as a result of 1 more business day in the third quarter and higher cash management fees which have benefited from efforts to grow commercial deposits. 
On Slide 8, we illustrate the key components of changes in noninterest expenses on a linked quarter basis. Nonoperating expenses decreased $2.9 million primarily resulting from no branch closures in the third quarter. 
As you will recall, we closed 10 branches in the second quarter. From an operating perspective, expenses were up $5.3 million from the second quarter due in large part to a $4.3 million increase in compensation and benefits primarily reflecting an additional work day and higher medical-related costs in the third quarter. 
While operating expenses were modestly higher than recent quarters, we remain confident our proactive approach to expense management will continue to control costs. 
The next slide details our efficiency ratio over the last 5 quarters. While the ratio ticked up slightly in the third quarter, the results were still generally consistent with recent quarters. 
As we have mentioned before, continuing to improve operating leverage through revenue growth and effective expense management remains a highly important commitment of the company. 
Slides 10 and 11 are a reminder of our excellent credit quality. Originated nonperforming assets as a percentage of originated loans and REO at 78 basis points remains below our peer group and top 50 banks and has improved from 92 basis points in the third quarter of 2014. 
Looking at Slide 11. Net charge-offs for the quarter remained at a very low level. These levels reflect the minimal loss content in our nonperforming assets as well as our conservative and well-defined underwriting philosophy that has served us so well for many years. 
As shown on Slide 12, operating return on average assets increased 3 basis points from the second quarter. Notwithstanding this improvement, our return on average assets continues to be impacted by the persistently low interest rate environment. 
Further progress will be achieved by balance sheet growth, fee income growth and an ongoing disciplined approach to expenses. 
Looking at Slide 13, our return on average tangible equity was 10.5% for the third quarter, an improvement of 70 basis points on a linked quarter basis. 
As we continue to focus on our most important objective -- improving profitability -- we expect to see further progress in this metric over time. 
Turning to Slide 14. We remain comfortable with our capital structure and balance sheet strength. Capital levels at the holding company and the bank continue to be strong, especially in light of our diversified business mix and history of exceptional credit risk management. 
Slide 15 displays our interest rate risk profile for both parallel rate changes and yield curve twist. As you can see, we remain asset-sensitive, though slightly less so than last quarter. However, we remain well positioned for an eventual rise in interest rates. 
Now I'd like to pass it back to Jack to wrap up."

And so the peak that we had in line utilization in the second quarter has proved to be -- and right at the end of the period, proved to be more than we expected. And in hindsight now, it kind of feels like a lot of the discussion about the change in the regulatory disclosure was pushing volume, kind of pulling it through ahead of that transition, and certainly our customer base kind of displayed that. If you look where the third quarter is and then go back to the first and the fourth quarter, the line utilization has kind of come back to the range where it's been. So very, very much in line with those other quarters. So kind of forecasting forward into the fourth quarter is difficult. There's certainly some discussion out there that mortgage bankers and Fannie and Freddie, people expect things to slow, and we're evaluating that, especially as we think about fourth quarter but also the plan for next year.

So if you want to get really minute on it, we had slower growth in the third quarter than we thought we would have, right. So you could take that preferred deal and push it out, let's say, 3 months. But -- and that conceivably could happen. But today, as we sit here, there's an expectation that we'll have reasonable loan growth in the fourth quarter. And as we start working through the budget process, there's no reason to think that the momentum and the people that we have in the field and the customer relationships are -- there's a fundamental change in our ability to grow loans. So with all that said at a high level, we -- I can see a need for capital sometime in the back half of 2016. Whether it's midyear or whether it's sometime in the third quarter or the beginning of the fourth quarter, it's an open question at this point."

And I'd remind you that we did do a $400 million bank subdebt issuance in the second -- towards the end of the second quarter of 2014. As you can see, some of the residual effects of that were at the bank, we have higher total risk-based capital currently, and you can see the changes over time. So the -- we go back to -- there's been a long evolution of capital management at this company going back to being grossly overcapitalized coming out of the Tier 2 second-step conversion and there's been a series of acquisitions. There's -- we bought back 25% of the stock that was issued in that transaction through a bunch of buybacks. And we've also had a nice and strong dividend payout to shareholders. So the capital rules under Basel III are pretty clear about what an efficient capital structure is. And that the most efficient capital structure does include preferred. And our job is to create that efficient capital structure, the most efficient capital structure we can for shareholders. And that's the simple logic behind the need to add preferred at some point and into the capital structure. If you look at our peer group, you'll see many of them, not all of them, but many of them do have preferred in the -- in their capital structure."

Good afternoon. We appreciate everyone joining us today. The results of this quarter reflect our unwavering commitment to further improve profitability, which remains our most important objective. While we are proud of our accomplishmen",421,"Thank you, Andrew. Good afternoon. We appreciate everyone joining us today. The results of this quarter reflect our unwavering commitment to further improve profitability, which remains our most important objective. While we are proud of our accomplishments over recent years, particularly given the persistently low interest rate environment, we must continue to drive forward, further execute on the significant opportunities that exist across our large and attractive markets. 
Given the breadth of our products and services we provide, the exceptional talent we continue to attract and our strong focus on relationship banking, we are confident in our ability to deliver consistent quality earnings growth for our shareholders. 
Now turning to the overview of the third quarter on Slide 2. Operating earnings of $68.4 million or $0.23 per share represent a 9% increase from the prior year quarter or a 10% increase on a per-share basis. Revenues increased 3% on both a linked quarter and a year-over-year basis, driven by higher net interest income and higher fee revenues. 
It's important to note the pace of net interest margin decline continued to moderate in the third quarter. Net interest margin was 2.87%, a decrease of only 1 basis point from the second quarter. 
Expenses were up modestly on both a linked quarter and a year-over-year basis primarily reflecting higher compensation and benefits costs. However, we remain confident in our ability to control costs despite the ongoing impact of strategic investments and higher regulatory compliance costs. 
Loans grew for the 20th consecutive quarter, although the 2% annualized growth rate is a slower pace than recent quarters. The portfolio was primarily impacted by lower line utilizations and volumes within our mortgage warehouse lending business. 
Loan outstandings within this business tend to be more volatile than our other businesses. Excluding mortgage warehouse lending, loans grew over 6% on an annualized basis driven by strong residential mortgage and commercial real estate results, highlighting the importance of our diversified business mix. Our progress gathering deposits continued during the quarter as evidenced by annualized growth of 12% from the end of the second quarter. As we maintain emphasis on franchise-wide cross-sell and deposit gathering efforts, the deposit base will continue to see growth. 
Recently released FDIC data show we either increased or maintained our deposit market share rank in each state we operate in, and we are particularly pleased with our continued #1 market share position within Fairfield County, Connecticut, and the state of Vermont. 
With that, I'll pass it to David to discuss the quarter in more detail."

On Slide 3, we provide detail behind the linked quarter increase in net interest income from the second quarter. Our ongoing loan growth as well as higher average balances and yields in the securities portfolio each increased net interest",1188,"Thank you, Jack. On Slide 3, we provide detail behind the linked quarter increase in net interest income from the second quarter. Our ongoing loan growth as well as higher average balances and yields in the securities portfolio each increased net interest income by $2.2 million. Net interest income also increased $1.7 million from an additional calendar day in the third quarter. 
The largest offset to these improvements was a $1 million reduction in net interest income due to a decline in accretion from runoff in the acquired loan portfolio. 
On Slide 4, net interest margin of 2.87% was lower by only 1 basis point compared to the second quarter as the pace of decline continued to moderate. As such, this result is the smallest linked quarter decline in over 3 years. 
New loan volume negatively impacted the margin by 2 basis points as new business yields remained lower than the total loan portfolio yield. In addition, the margin decreased 1 basis point from higher deposit volumes and costs, which primarily resulted from the successful CD campaigns discussed last quarter. These declines were largely offset by a 2 basis point increase from an additional calendar day in the third quarter. 
Through 9 months, the net interest margin is 2.89%. Given these results, we expect the full year margin will be within the range of 2.85% to 2.95% we outlined in January. 
Turning to Slide 5, the loan portfolio grew $110 million or 2% annualized from the second quarter. Originated loan growth for the quarter totaled $169 million. 
Retail contributed $208 million of originated loan growth, which was almost entirely driven by strong residential mortgage growth of $201 million. As is our practice, most of the newly originated residential mortgages retained in our portfolio were hybrid arms. 
Originated loans in the commercial portfolio were down $39 million from the second quarter due to a $248 million reduction in C&I. As Jack discussed earlier, this result was entirely driven by lower volumes and utilization rates in our mortgage warehouse lending business. 
The period end balance for this business was $839 million, down $312 million from June 30. However, the quarterly average balance decline for mortgage warehouse lending was only $45 million. 
Commercial real estate contributed solid originated growth of $209 million, marking the second consecutive quarter the pace of originated commercial real estate growth has increased. 
We experienced acquired loan runoff of $59 million this quarter compared to $58 million in the second quarter. The remaining balance of the acquired portfolio at quarter-end was $841 million. 
The fourth quarter historically has been our strongest quarter in terms of loan originations, and our current view is for this trend to continue this year. However, with annualized loan growth of 5% through 9 months, achieving the lower end of the range we outlined in January will be challenging. 
Slide 6 shows the change in deposits by segment from the second quarter. Total deposits increased $845 million or 12% on an annualized basis primarily due to continued progress gathering commercial deposits. Commercial grew $883 million in the quarter compared to a $39 million (sic) [ $38 million ] reduction in retail. 
The seasonality of our municipal business had a favorable $486 million impact on commercial deposits, while the third quarter represents a seasonal low point for retail deposits with growth expected in the fourth quarter. 
Broker deposits ended the quarter at $2.7 billion, an increase of $60 million. This small increase does not change our expectation that broker deposits will represent a decreasing percentage of our deposit base as we continue to grow organically. 
It is also worth noting that our loan-to-deposit ratio was 98% at the end of the quarter. Overall, we are very pleased with our progress gathering deposits and firmly believe that deposits are an integral part of customer relationships. 
On Slide 7, we take a closer look at the 3% increase in noninterest income from the second quarter. The seasonal nature of insurance renewals increased noninterest income by $2.6 million while the continued success of our customer interest rate swap business contributed an additional $1.2 million compared to the second quarter. 
In addition, bank service charges improved $1 million primarily as a result of 1 more business day in the third quarter and higher cash management fees which have benefited from efforts to grow commercial deposits. 
On Slide 8, we illustrate the key components of changes in noninterest expenses on a linked quarter basis. Nonoperating expenses decreased $2.9 million primarily resulting from no branch closures in the third quarter. 
As you will recall, we closed 10 branches in the second quarter. From an operating perspective, expenses were up $5.3 million from the second quarter due in large part to a $4.3 million increase in compensation and benefits primarily reflecting an additional work day and higher medical-related costs in the third quarter. 
While operating expenses were modestly higher than recent quarters, we remain confident our proactive approach to expense management will continue to control costs. 
The next slide details our efficiency ratio over the last 5 quarters. While the ratio ticked up slightly in the third quarter, the results were still generally consistent with recent quarters. 
As we have mentioned before, continuing to improve operating leverage through revenue growth and effective expense management remains a highly important commitment of the company. 
Slides 10 and 11 are a reminder of our excellent credit quality. Originated nonperforming assets as a percentage of originated loans and REO at 78 basis points remains below our peer group and top 50 banks and has improved from 92 basis points in the third quarter of 2014. 
Looking at Slide 11. Net charge-offs for the quarter remained at a very low level. These levels reflect the minimal loss content in our nonperforming assets as well as our conservative and well-defined underwriting philosophy that has served us so well for many years. 
As shown on Slide 12, operating return on average assets increased 3 basis points from the second quarter. Notwithstanding this improvement, our return on average assets continues to be impacted by the persistently low interest rate environment. 
Further progress will be achieved by balance sheet growth, fee income growth and an ongoing disciplined approach to expenses. 
Looking at Slide 13, our return on average tangible equity was 10.5% for the third quarter, an improvement of 70 basis points on a linked quarter basis. 
As we continue to focus on our most important objective -- improving profitability -- we expect to see further progress in this metric over time. 
Turning to Slide 14. We remain comfortable with our capital structure and balance sheet strength. Capital levels at the holding company and the bank continue to be strong, especially in light of our diversified business mix and history of exceptional credit risk management. 
Slide 15 displays our interest rate risk profile for both parallel rate changes and yield curve twist. As you can see, we remain asset-sensitive, though slightly less so than last quarter. However, we remain well positioned for an eventual rise in interest rates. 
Now I'd like to pass it back to Jack to wrap up."

I think the very positive news in mortgage warehouse, if you look back over the last 3 or 4 years is the level of commitments that they have had outstanding has steadily increased. They've continued to build the business. And so the peak that we had in line utilization in the second quarter has proved to be -- and right at the end of the period, proved to be more than we expected. And in hindsight now, it kind of feels like a lot of the discussion about the change in the regulatory disclosure was pushing volume, kind of pulling it through ahead of that transition, and certainly our customer base kind of displayed that. If you look where the third quarter is and then go back to the first and the fourth quarter, the line utilization has kind of come back to the range where it's been. So very, very much in line with those other quarters. So kind of forecasting forward into the fourth quarter is difficult. There's certainly some discussion out there that mortgage bankers and Fannie and Freddie, people expect things to slow, and we're evaluating that, especially as we think about fourth quarter but also the plan for next year. I would say our folks on the ground are cautiously expecting some continued reduction, but I don't see it as being dramatic right now. It's just -- it's like interest rates. How do you predict it?"

As you can see, some of the residual effects of that were at the bank, we have higher total risk-based capital currently, and you can see the changes over time. So the -- we go back to -- there's been a long evolution of capital management at this company going back to being grossly overcapitalized coming out of the Tier 2 second-step conversion and there's been a series of acquisitions. There's -- we bought back 25% of the stock that was issued in that transaction through a bunch of buybacks. And we've also had a nice and strong dividend payout to shareholders. So the capital rules under Basel III are pretty clear about what an efficient capital structure is. And that the most efficient capital structure does include preferred. And our job is to create that efficient capital structure, the most efficient capital structure we can for shareholders. And that's the simple logic behind the need to add preferred at some point and into the capital structure. If you look at our peer group, you'll see many of them, not all of them, but many of them do have preferred in the -- in their capital structure."
