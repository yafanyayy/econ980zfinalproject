For the full year, we again delivered against our 2 long-term financial goals. We grew adjusted diluted EPS by 8% and we paid out approximately 80% of adjusted diluted EPS to shareholders in dividends, which totaled $3.9 billion. We also raised our dividend by 8.3%, marking the 48th increase in the last 45 years. We further rewarded shareholders by repurchasing nearly $1 billion in shares between the program we completed in 2014 and the new $1 billion program we announced in July.
And in 2014, Altria delivered total shareholder return of 34.5%, far outpacing both the S&P 500 and the food beverage and tobacco index. We achieved these results by the clarity of our core strategies and our talented employee's strong execution against them. Here are some important segment highlights from the quarter and the full year.
The Smokeable Products segment produced outstanding results by consistently executing its strategy of maximizing income while maintaining modest share growth on Marlboro and Black & Mild over time. The segment grew adjusted operating companies income by almost 8% in the quarter and by nearly 7% for the full year, primarily through higher pricing. The end of the federal tobacco quota buyout payment also contributed in the quarter. This segment also expanded adjusted operating companies income margins in both periods.
Marlboro was the primary driver of these strong financial results. PM USA's long-term investments in the Marlboro architecture have strengthened the brand's equity and expanded its ability to engage both loyal and competitive adult smokers. In 2014, the brand posted its third consecutive year of retail share growth.
And Marlboro continues to innovate. In November, PM USA expanded distribution of Marlboro Menthol Rich Blue to 28 states, primarily in the Eastern U.S., to enhance Marlboro's position in the menthol segment. It's early, but Rich Blue is off to a good start.
In the machine made large cigar category, John Middleton strengthened its leadership position in the tip segment. The company posted solid volume growth in the quarter and the full year driven primarily by Black & Mild. Over time, Middleton has enhanced the brand with innovative actions like Black & Mild Jazz. In December, Middleton announced the national expansion of Black & Mild Casino, a dark tobacco blend in the tip segment.
In the Smokeless Product segment, USSTC continued to execute its strategy in 2014. USSTC grew full year adjusted operating companies income by more than 3% and expanded its already strong adjusted operating companies income margin by more than 1% despite a slowdown in the industry volume growth rate. We estimate that growth rate to be about 2% for the last 12 months.
USSTC maintained retail share leadership in the smokeless category in 2014 with its premium brands, as Copenhagen and Skoal grew their combined share in the quarter and for the full year. Copenhagen posted strong share gains in both periods behind the strength of Copenhagen wall of winter green.
In 2014, USSTC began enhancing Skoal's value equation with a new equity campaign and targeted investments to narrow price gaps on Skoal plastic. We're pleased results we've seen so far.
Turning to innovative tobacco products, Nu Mark made steady progress as it builds e-vapor category leadership. The company is taking a disciplined approach and remains focused on building a robust portfolio of superior, innovative products for adult smokers and vapor.
In the fourth quarter, Nu Mark evolved MarkTen by adding a new offering with 2.5% nicotine concentration by weight in classic and menthol varieties. In December, Nu Mark completed its national launch of MarkTen e-vapor products, achieving distribution in over 130,000 stores. And at year-end, MarkTen was ranked among the top e-vapor brands nationally based on retail market share. Nu Mark also acquired and integrated Green Smoke in 2014. This acquisition added great people, deep supply chain expertise and technology, and we're excited about the brand's potential. It's still early days in this dynamic and evolving category, but we believe Nu Mark is increasingly well-positioned for the future.
In 2014, our alcohol assets continued to diversify our income and contribute to income growth. In the Wine segment, Ste. Michelle posted another year of double-digit operating companies income growth primarily through higher volume. Awarded Ste. Michelle's premium wines more than 180 ratings of 90 or better in 2014. 
Our earnings also benefited from our SAB Miller investment, which continues to support our strong balance sheet. So to sum up, 2014 was another excellent year for our strong premium brands, for our company and for our shareholders. We are maximizing income in our core premium tobacco businesses and innovating for the future. We are extremely proud of the results produced by our very talented employees and of our track record for creating value for shareholders. 
Looking ahead to 2015, Altria forecast its 2015 adjusted diluted EPS will increase by 7% to 9% to a range of $2.75 to $2.80 from an adjusted diluted EPS base of $2.57 in 2014. 
Finally, today, we are announcing some executive leadership changes all to the effect of March 1 this year. First, Dave Beran, our President and Chief Operating Officer, has decided to retire after 38 years of distinguished service to the company. Dave's strong expertise, knowledge, financial acumen and leadership have contributed measurably to Altria's success, and he will be missed.
When Dave retires, Howard Willard will become Altria's Chief Operating Officer. He has significant expense, having been with the company since 1992. In addition to his current role of CEO, Howard has led leadership positions in numerous business functions of the Altria companies.
Billy Gifford will succeed Howard as Altria's Chief Financial Officer. Billy has been with Altria since 1994 and also has held numerous roles, including President and CEO of PM USA and his current role as Altria's Senior Vice President, Strategy and Business development.
These moves are consistent with our long-term succession planning, and these talented experienced leaders will serve us well for the future.
I'll now turn things over to Howard, who will discuss Altria's business results in more detail."

In 2014, strong performance in our Smokeable Products segment helped drive adjusted diluted EPS growth of almost 16% in the fourth quarter and 8% for the full year. A lower effective tax rate on operations and lower interest expense were also contributors to adjusted diluted EPS growth in both periods.
The Smokeable Products segment delivered strong adjusted operating companies income growth in the quarter and for the full year. The segment also expanded adjusted operating companies income margins 1.8 percentage points in the fourth quarter and 1.9 percentage points in the full year. For the full year, PM USA grew Marlboro's retail share by 1/10 of a share point and grew its total cigarette category retail share by 2/10 of a share point.
L&M share gains also contributed to PM USA's full year retail share performance, while the cigarette discount segment declined slightly. The Smokeable Products segment fourth quarter reported operating companies income grew 7.6%, primarily driven by higher pricing. For the full year, the segment's reported operating companies income declined 2.7%, primarily due to higher gains on NPM adjustment items in 2013. After adjusting for trade inventory changes and other factors, PM USA estimates that its fourth quarter and full year cigarette shipment volume declined approximately 2% and 3%, respectively, and the total industry volumes declined approximately 2.5% and 3.5%, respectively.
The 2014 full year industry cigarette decline of 3.5% continues to be in the range of the decline rate we've seen in the last few years.
In Cigars, Middleton's reported cigar shipment volume increased by almost 4% for the fourth quarter and over 6% for the full year, driven primarily by Black & Mild's strong performance in the tip Cigar segment. Black & Mild retail share declined 4/10 for the quarter and 3/10 for the full year. 
In the Smokeless Product segment, adjusted operating companies income was unchanged in the fourth quarter, as higher pricing and higher volume were offset by higher promotional investments in the timing of selling, general and administrative expenses.
For the full year, the segment grew adjusted operating companies income 3.3%, primarily due to higher pricing and higher volume, partially offset by higher promotional investments and product mix. Adjusted operating margins declined 2.5 percentage points in the fourth quarter to 60%, and grew 1.1 percentage points to 63.4% in the full year.
After adjusting for trade inventory changes and other factors, USSTC estimates that its domestic smokeless products shipment volume grew approximately 2.5% in both the fourth quarter and full year of 2014. Copenhagen and Skoals combined retail share grew 4/10 of a share point in the quarter to 51.3% and grew 5/10 to 51.2% for the full year.
The Wine segment delivered strong results in the fourth quarter and the full year. Ste. Michelle grew operating companies income by 17.8% in the fourth quarter and 13.6% in the full year, primarily driven by higher volume. Shipments increased 9.6% in the quarter and 4.8% for the full year. 
That wraps up our operating results. Marty and I will now take your questions. While the calls are being complied, let's cover a few housekeeping items. As a reminder, comparisons, when made are, against the fourth quarter and full year of 2013, unless we note otherwise.
Marlboro's price gap versus the lowest effective priced cigarette was 32% in the fourth quarter, down 2 percentage points, and, 33% for the full year, down 1 percentage point. For the fourth quarter, Marlboro's net pack price was $6.02, up $0.16, and the lowest effective priced cigarette was $4.55, up $0.17. For the full year, Marlboro's net pack price was $5.96, up $0.13, while the lowest effective priced cigarette was $4.49, up $0.15. The Cigarette Discount segment's retail share was 24.9% for the fourth quarter and full year, down 3/10 in each period. The estimated weighted average cigarette state excise tax was $1.49 per pack for the fourth quarter, up $0.02; and $1.48 per pack for the full year, up $0.04.
Wholesale inventory changes are one factor PM USA uses to estimate adjusted PM USA and industry volumes. PM USA estimates that its 2014 wholesale inventories were approximately 2.4 billion units at the end of the fourth quarter and $2.3 billion units at the end of the third quarter. In 2013, PM USA's wholesale inventories were estimated to be approximately 2.5 billion units at the end of both the fourth and third quarter.
PM USA estimates that the 2014 cigarette industry wholesale inventory levels were 5.5 billion units at the end of the fourth quarter and 5.7 billion units at the end of the third quarter. PM USA estimates that 2013 wholesale inventory levels were 5.9 billion units at the end of the fourth quarter and 6.3 billion units at the end of the third quarter.
Copenhagen's price gap versus the leading discount brand was 32% in the fourth quarter and full year, down 3 percentage points for the fourth quarter and 4 percentage points for the full year. Copenhagen's retail price was $4.19 in the fourth quarter, up $0.12; and $4.13 for the full year, up $0.07.
The price of a leading discount brand was $3.17 in the fourth quarter and $3.14 for the full year, up $0.15 in each period. CapEx was $47 million for the fourth quarter and $163 million for the full year. Ongoing depreciation and amortization was $59 million for the quarter and $208 million for the full year. Looking ahead to 2015, we expect capital expenditures will be in the range of $200 million to $250 million, and that depreciation and amortization will be approximately $200 million.

We've been cautious for the last several years, as you know, as we went through this difficult recession. We are actually seeing a modest improvement, I think, in the economic situation for the adult tobacco consumer, although it remains a bit of a mixed bag. The U.S. economy is clearly improving, as everyone knows, and particularly in relation to the rest of the world economies. We see on implement and underemployment have come down. We see housing starts are coming back. We see very good consumer confidence numbers. So I think all of that is a positive, those are positive factors. On the other side of the ledger, you have labor participation rates maybe not where they should be and then year-over-year wage gains are still modest. But I think, on balance, our view so that the adult tobacco consumers is feeling better about their economic situation and their economic future, and we expect some modest improvement in that over 2015."

So Vivian, they have more choices today, and so there's some movement in there, but these things best I think are evaluated over time. So I'm not sure I have any big insights to share with you this morning on that except to say that it speaks, I think, first to the wisdom of having a total tobacco platform. So as adult tobacco consumers move within these categories that Altria is well positioned to offer them premium brands with great margin structure. So that's how we think about the business. And we'll have to study the volume, I think, for some time yet to know the answer to the question you're asking."

And the factors that went into our judgment this year about how the guy includes some the things we already spoken about on the call, which is a modestly improving situation for our adult tobacco consumer. Obviously, we have the benefit of some FETRA payments. But we, I think, pointed out in our release, we have some pension and health care cost changes due to long-term assumptions. And so every year, you put your guidance together, and you have puts and takes about what you're going to do. Some years, we invest. Some years, we have factors, which are flowing in the other direction. I think 7 to 9 in the current environment is a strong signal about the confidence we have in our business and our operating company plans. And Howard, you may want to supplement that answer?"

I think gas prices for us, historically, we have not called out gas prices as one of the principal drivers of consumer behavior, although we acknowledge that it had some effect. To us, it was really more about the unemployment rate, consumer confidence and housing starts. Now the way that gasoline prices have come down so precipitously has obviously had a bigger effect of the consumer right to see stores, as you and others have pointed out, are seeing better traffic. I don't think there is a question contributing to consumers feeling better about the economy situation. But historically, Bonnie, we have not called that out is one of the big 3 drivers. So I don't know what people are expecting for gasoline prices. But probably, will not have much more of an effect. We did have very good pricing. And the way that we achieved pricing, as you know, is we took list pricing in 2014, combined $0.13 a pack. And then, as always, we can moderate our promotional allowances, and we did so last year. We moderated our allowances on special blend, Marlboro Special Blend, and on Black. And as you know, we're able to do that white tactically by state by using our SBP tools. So we did a year, in which we team we can take some pricing, and I think you can see that in the numbers for 2014."

Our estimate is that the consumer spending in 2014 increased by about 50% to about $2 billion, and that's compared to a year before, which I think you've seen the numbers are roughly of 160% increase. So you can see that it has slowed, although its a 50% increase is still fairly large. It's growing about traditional trade channels and it's also growing in vape shops, which are harder to get a line of sight into. Two-dimensional ice that spent though, $80 billion is spent on conventional tobacco products versus the 2 that we estimate. So just to put it into its proper context. With respect to Nu Mark, our belief is, is that, that is an interesting enough category for us to participate in and to aspire to have ladyship in. That is leadership that will be achieved over the long term and for the long term, which is why we use of these words about financially disciplined and over time. We want to participate in there. We believe Nu Mark had a very good year. Gosh, we got the MarkTen product in 130,000 retail stores. And I mean, that's easy to stay and that's hard to do. And so our sales force at Nu Mark did a great job there. They rolled out, as we mentioned in our remarks, the 2.5 product. Consumers continue to look for their product. And so I think a lot of what's going to happen with the paper it is about manufacturers trying to bring products that better satisfy their consumers. And that's what Nu Mark is doing. It's for the long term. It will be for the long-term. And we are learning our way and with our consumer and using a disciplined approach. But with the acquisition of Green Smoke and their people and their technology in addition to Nu Mark, I am very encouraged about what we have in the pipeline for MarkTen."

That speaks both to the product's for auction and to its equity, and that's been Marlboro story. Up a committed in the call about we see that the economy is strengthening a bit, hopefully, for our adult tobacco consumers. We certainly hope that's going to be the case in 2015."

For the full year, we again delivered against our 2 long-term financial goals. We grew adjusted diluted EPS by 8% and we paid out approximately 80% of adjusted diluted EPS to shareholders in dividends, which totaled $3.9 billion. We also raised our dividend by 8.3%, marking the 48th increase in the last 45 years. We further rewarded shareholders by repurchasing nearly $1 billion in shares between the program we completed in 2014, and the new $1 billion program we announced in July, and in 2014, Altria delivered total shareholder return of 34.5%, far outpacing both the S&P 500 and the food beverage and tobacco index. We achieved these results by the clarity of our core strategies and our talented employees' strong execution against them. Here are some important segment highlights from the quarter and the full year.
The smokeable products segment produced outstanding results by consistently executing its strategy of maximizing income while maintaining modest share growth on Marlboro and Black & Mild over time. The segment grew adjusted operating companies income by almost 8% in the quarter and by nearly 7% for the full year, primarily through higher pricing. The end of the federal tobacco quota buyout payment also contributed in the quarter. The segment also expanded adjusted operating companies income margins in both periods. Marlboro was the primary driver of these strong financial results. PM USA's long-term investments in the Marlboro architecture have strengthened the brand's equity and expanded its ability to engage both loyal and competitive adult smokers. In 2014, the brand posted its third consecutive year of retail share growth, and Marlboro continues to innovate. In November, PM USA expanded distribution of Marlboro Menthol Rich Blue to 28 states, primarily in the Eastern U.S. to enhance Marlboro's position in the menthol segment. It's early, but Rich Blue is off to a good start.
In the machine-made large cigar category, John Middleton strengthened its leadership position in the tip segment. The company posted solid volume growth in the quarter and the full year, driven primarily by Black & Mild. Over time, Middleton has enhanced the brand with innovative introductions like Black & Mild Jazz, and in December, Middleton announced the national expansion of Black & Mild Casino, a dark tobacco blend in the tipped segment.
In the smokeless product segment, USSTC continued to execute its strategy in 2014. USSTC grew full year adjusted operating companies income by more than 3%, and expanded its already strong adjusted operating companies income margin by more than 1% despite a slowdown in the industry volume growth rate. We estimate that growth rate to be about 2% for the last 12 months. USSTC maintained retail share leadership in the smokeless category in 2014 with its premium brands, as Copenhagen and Skoal grew their combined share in the quarter and for the full year. Copenhagen posted strong share gains in both periods behind the strength of Copenhagen long-cut winter green. In 2014, USSTC began enhancing Skoal's value equation with a new equity campaign and targeted investments to narrow price gaps on Skoal plastic. We're pleased with the results we've seen so far.
Turning to innovative tobacco products, Nu Mark made steady progress as it builds e-vapor category leadership. The company is taking a disciplined, approach and remains focused on building a robust portfolio of superior, innovative products for adult smokers and vapor. In the fourth quarter, Nu Mark evolved MarkTen by adding a new offering, with 2.5% nicotine concentration by weight in classic and menthol varieties. In December, Nu Mark completed its national launch of MarkTen e-vapor products, achieving distribution in over 130,000 stores. And at year-end, MarkTen was ranked among the top e-vapor brands nationally based on retail market share. Nu Mark also acquired and integrated Green Smoke in 2014. This acquisition added great people, deep supply chain expertise and technology, and we're excited about the brand's potential. It's still early days in this dynamic and evolving category, but we believe Nu Mark is increasingly well-positioned for the future.
In 2014, our alcohol assets continued to diversify our income and contribute to income growth. In the Wine segment, Ste. Michelle posted another year of double-digit operating companies income growth primarily through higher volume. Awarded Ste. Michelle's premium wines more than 180 ratings of 90 or better in 2014. 
Our earnings also benefited from our SAB Miller investment, which continues to support our strong balance sheet. So to sum up, 2014 was another excellent year for our strong premium brands, for our company and for our shareholders. We are maximizing income in our core premium tobacco businesses and innovating for the future. We're extremely proud of the results produced by our very talented employees and of our track record for creating value for shareholders. 
Looking ahead to 2015, Altria forecast its 2015 adjusted diluted EPS will increase by 7% to 9% to a range of $2.75 to $2.80 from an adjusted diluted EPS base of $2.57 in 2014. 
Finally, today, we are announcing some executive leadership changes all to the effect of March 1 this year. First, Dave Beran, our President and Chief Operating Officer, has decided to retire after 38 years of distinguished service to the company. Dave's strong expertise, knowledge, financial acumen and leadership have contributed measurably to Altria's success, and he will be missed.
When Dave retires, Howard Willard will become Altria's Chief Operating Officer. He has significant experience, having been with the company since 1992. In addition to his current role of CEO, Howard has held leadership positions in numerous business functions of the Altria companies. Billy Gifford will succeed Howard as Altria's Chief Financial Officer. Billy has been with Altria since 1994, and also has held numerous roles, including President and CEO of PM USA and his current role as Altria's Senior Vice President, Strategy and Business development. These moves are consistent with our long-term succession planning, and these talented experienced leaders will serve us well for the future.
I'll now turn things over to Howard, who will discuss Altria's business results in more detail."

In 2014, strong performance in our Smokeable Products segment helped drive adjusted diluted EPS growth of almost 16% in the fourth quarter and 8% for the full year. A lower effective tax rate on operations and lower interest expense were also contributors to adjusted diluted EPS growth in both periods. The smokeable products segment delivered strong adjusted operating companies income growth in the quarter and for the full year. The segment also expanded adjusted operating companies income margins 1.8 percentage points in the fourth quarter and 1.9 percentage points in the full year. For the full year, PM USA grew Marlboro's retail share by 1/10 of a share point, and grew its total cigarette category retail share by 2/10 of a share point.
L&M share gains also contributed to PM USA's full year retail share performance, while the cigarette discount segment declined slightly. The Smokeable Products segment's fourth quarter reported operating companies income grew 7.6%, primarily driven by higher pricing. For the full year, the segment's reported operating companies income declined 2.7%, primarily due to higher gains on NPM adjustment items in 2013. After adjusting for trade inventory changes and other factors, PM USA estimates that its fourth quarter and full year cigarette shipment volume declined approximately 2% and 3%, respectively, and the total industry volumes declined approximately 2.5% and 3.5%, respectively. The 2014 full year industry cigarette decline of 3.5% continues to be in the range of the decline rate we've seen in the last few years.
In Cigars, Middleton's reported cigar shipment volume increased by almost 4% for the fourth quarter and over 6% for the full year, driven primarily by Black & Mild's strong performance in the tipped cigar segment. Black & Mild retail share declined 4/10 for the quarter and 3/10 for the full year. In the smokeless product segment, adjusted operating companies income was unchanged in the fourth quarter, as higher pricing and higher volume were offset by higher promotional investments in the timing of selling, general and administrative expenses.
For the full year, the segment grew adjusted operating companies income 3.3%, primarily due to higher pricing and higher volume, partially offset by higher promotional investments and product mix. Adjusted operating margins declined 2.5 percentage points in the fourth quarter to 60%, and grew 1.1 percentage points to 63.4% in the full year.
After adjusting for trade inventory changes and other factors, USSTC estimates that its domestic smokeless product shipment volume grew approximately 2.5% in both the fourth quarter and full year of 2014. Copenhagen and Skoals combined retail share grew 4/10 of a share point in the quarter to 51.3% and grew 5/10 to 51.2% for the full year.
The Wine segment delivered strong results in the fourth quarter and the full year. Ste. Michelle grew operating companies income by 17.8% in the fourth quarter and 13.6% in the full year, primarily driven by higher volume. Shipments increased 9.6% in the quarter and 4.8% for the full year. 
That wraps up our operating results. Marty and I will now take your questions. While the calls are being complied, let's cover a few housekeeping items. As a reminder, comparisons when made are against the fourth quarter and full year of 2013, unless we note otherwise.
Marlboro's price gap versus the lowest effective priced cigarette was 32% in the fourth quarter, down 2 percentage points and 33% for the full year, down 1 percentage point. For the fourth quarter, Marlboro's net pack price was $6.02, up $0.16, and the lowest effective priced cigarette was $4.55, up $0.17. For the full year, Marlboro's net pack price was $5.96, up $0.13, while the lowest effective priced cigarette was $4.49, up $0.15. The cigarette discount segment's retail share was 24.9% for the fourth quarter and full year, down 3/10 in each period. The estimated weighted average cigarette state excise tax was $1.49 per pack for the fourth quarter, up $0.02; and $1.48 per pack for the full year, up $0.04. Wholesale inventory changes are one factor PM USA uses to estimate adjusted PM USA and industry volumes. PM USA estimates that its 2014 wholesale inventories were approximately 2.4 billion units at the end of the fourth quarter and $2.3 billion units at the end of the third quarter. In 2013, PM USA's wholesale inventories were estimated to be approximately 2.5 billion units at the end of both the fourth and third quarter.
PM USA estimates that the 2014 cigarette industry wholesale inventory levels were 5.5 billion units at the end of the fourth quarter and 5.7 billion units at the end of the third quarter. PM USA estimates that 2013 wholesale inventory levels were 5.9 billion units at the end of the fourth quarter and 6.3 billion units at the end of the third quarter.
Copenhagen's price gap versus the leading discount brand was 32% in the fourth quarter and full year, down 3 percentage points for the fourth quarter and 4 percentage points for the full year. Copenhagen's retail price was $4.19 in the fourth quarter, up $0.12; and $4.13 for the full year, up $0.07. The price of the leading discount brand was $3.17 in the fourth quarter and $3.14 for the full year, up $0.15 in each period. CapEx was $47 million for the fourth quarter and $163 million for the full year. Ongoing depreciation and amortization was $59 million for the quarter and $208 million for the full year. Looking ahead to 2015, we expect capital expenditures will be in the range of $200 million to $250 million, and that depreciation and amortization will be approximately $200 million.

Let me give you our view of the adult tobacco consumer for '15, which I really think goes to the heart of what you're asking about. We've been cautious for the last several years, as you know, as we went through this difficult recession. We are actually seeing a modest improvement, I think, in the economic situation for the adult tobacco consumer, although it remains a bit of a mixed bag. The U.S. economy is clearly improving, as everyone knows, and particularly in relation to the rest of the world economies. We see unemployment and underemployment have come down. We see housing starts are coming back. We see very good consumer confidence numbers. So I think all of that is a positive. Those are positive factors. On the other side of the ledger, you have labor participation rates maybe not where they should be and then year-over-year wage gains are still modest. But I think, on balance, our view is that the adult tobacco consumer is feeling better about their economic situation and their economic future, and we expect some modest improvement in that over 2015."

So Vivian, they have more choices today, and so there's some movement in there, but these things best, I think, are evaluated over time. So I'm not sure I have any big insights to share with you this morning on that, except to say that it speaks, I think, first to the wisdom of having a total tobacco platform, so as adult tobacco consumers move within these categories, that Altria is well-positioned to offer them premium brands with great margin structure. So that's how we think about the business, and we'll have to study the volume, I think, for some time yet to know the answer to the question you're proposing."

It's been a fairly moderate environment over the last several years, and we hope that plays out in '15."

Obviously, we have the benefit of some FETRA payments. But we, I think, pointed out in our release, we have some pension and health care cost changes due to long-term assumptions, and so every year, you put your guidance together, and you have puts and takes about what you're going to do.

Let me try to comment on a couple of those to try to help you. I think gas prices for us, historically, we have not called out gas prices as one of the principal drivers of consumer behavior, although we acknowledge that it had some effect. To us, it was really more about the unemployment rate, consumer confidence and housing starts. Now the way that gasoline prices have gone down so precipitously has obviously had a bigger effect on the consumer, right? The C stores, as you and others have pointed out, are seeing better traffic, and I don't think there is a question that it's contributing to consumers feeling better about their economy situation. But historically, Bonnie, we have not called that out. It's one of the big 3 drivers. So I don't know what people are expecting for gasoline prices, but probably, we'll not have that much more of an effect. We did have very good pricing, and the way that we achieved pricing, as you know, is we took list pricing in 2014, combined $0.13 a pack, and then, as always, we can moderate our promotional allowances, and we did so last year. We moderated our allowances on special blend, Marlboro Special Blend and on Black. And as you know, we're able to do that quite tactically by state by using our STP [ph] tools. So we did see a year in which we think we could take some pricing, and I think you can see that in the numbers for 2014."

So you can see",325,"Sure. Well, let's start with the category. Our estimate is that the consumer spending in 2014 increased by about 50% to about $2 billion, and that's compared to a year before, which I think you've seen the numbers are roughly 160% increase. So you can see that it has slowed, although its 50% increase is still fairly large. It's growing about traditional trade channels, and it's also growing in vape shops, which are harder to get a line of sight into. To dimensional that spent, though, $80 billion is spent on conventional tobacco products versus the 2 that we estimate. So just to put it into its proper context. With respect to Nu Mark, our belief is, is that, that is an interesting enough category for us to participate in and to aspire to have leadership in. That is leadership that will be achieved over the long term and for the long term, which is why we use these words about financially disciplined and over time. We want to participate there. We believe Nu Mark had a very good year. Gosh, we got the MarkTen product in 130,000 retail stores, and I mean, that's easy to stay and that's hard to do, and so our sales force at Nu Mark did a great job there. They rolled out, as we mentioned in our remarks, the 2.5 product. Consumers continue to look for their product. And so I think a lot of what's going to happen with vapor is about manufacturers trying to bring out products that better satisfy their consumers, and that's what Nu Mark is doing. It's for the long term. It will be for the long term, and we are learning our way in with our consumer and using a disciplined approach. But with the acquisition of Green Smoke and their people and their technology in addition to Nu Mark, I am very encouraged about what we have in the pipeline for MarkTen."

We talked previously about having the flavor families and allowing different marketing approaches in the families and what it's done for Marlboro.com has been great. I think that's shown up in the performance of Marlboro. With respect to any quantitative brand equity data, we may talk about that some in CAGNY. So if I can just ask you to hold tight on that, I think we'll have some further information for you in that regard. With respect to super premium, the way -- let me just mention the strategic approach to this, which is we're always looking for places in the market where there is business, where we either are under indexed or we don't have an offering, and so we look at things all the time. And while I don't have anything to announce about that, I can assure you, we look at places to build our business both there and elsewhere."

For the full year, we again delivered against our 2 long-term financial goals. We grew adjusted diluted EPS by 8% and we paid out approximately 80% of adjusted diluted EPS to shareholders in dividends, which totaled $3.9 billion. We also raised our dividend by 8.3%, marking the 48th increase in the last 45 years. We further rewarded shareholders by repurchasing nearly $1 billion in shares between the program we completed in 2014, and the new $1 billion program we announced in July, and in 2014, Altria delivered total shareholder return of 34.5%, far outpacing both the S&P 500 and the food beverage and tobacco index. We achieved these results by the clarity of our core strategies and our talented employees' strong execution against them. Here are some important segment highlights from the quarter and the full year.
The smokeable products segment produced outstanding results by consistently executing its strategy of maximizing income while maintaining modest share growth on Marlboro and Black & Mild over time. The segment grew adjusted operating companies income by almost 8% in the quarter and by nearly 7% for the full year, primarily through higher pricing. The end of the federal tobacco quota buyout payment also contributed in the quarter. The segment also expanded adjusted operating companies income margins in both periods. Marlboro was the primary driver of these strong financial results. PM USA's long-term investments in the Marlboro architecture have strengthened the brand's equity and expanded its ability to engage both loyal and competitive adult smokers. In 2014, the brand posted its third consecutive year of retail share growth. And Marlboro continues to innovate. In November, PM USA expanded distribution of Marlboro Menthol Rich Blue to 28 states, primarily in the Eastern U.S. to enhance Marlboro's position in the menthol segment. It's early, but Rich Blue is off to a good start.
In the machine-made large cigar category, John Middleton strengthened its leadership position in the tip segment. The company posted solid volume growth in the quarter and the full year, driven primarily by Black & Mild. Over time, Middleton has enhanced the brand with innovative introductions like Black & Mild Jazz, and in December, Middleton announced the national expansion of Black & Mild Casino, a dark tobacco blend in the tipped segment.
In the smokeless product segment, USSTC continued to execute its strategy in 2014. USSTC grew full year adjusted operating companies income by more than 3%, and expanded its already strong adjusted operating companies income margin by more than 1% despite a slowdown in the industry volume growth rate. We estimate that growth rate to be about 2% for the last 12 months. USSTC maintained retail share leadership in the smokeless category in 2014 with its premium brands, as Copenhagen and Skoal grew their combined share in the quarter and for the full year. Copenhagen posted strong share gains in both periods behind the strength of Copenhagen long-cut winter green. In 2014, USSTC began enhancing Skoal's value equation with a new equity campaign and targeted investments to narrow price gaps on Skoal Classic. We're pleased with the results we've seen so far.
Turning to innovative tobacco products, Nu Mark made steady progress as it builds e-vapor category leadership. The company is taking a disciplined approach and remains focused on building a robust portfolio of superior, innovative products for adult smokers in vapor. In the fourth quarter, Nu Mark evolved MarkTen by adding a new offering, with 2.5% nicotine concentration by weight in classic and menthol varieties. In December, Nu Mark completed its national launch of MarkTen e-vapor products, achieving distribution in over 130,000 stores. And at year-end, MarkTen was ranked among the top e-vapor brands nationally based on retail market share. Nu Mark also acquired and integrated Green Smoke in 2014. This acquisition added great people, deep supply chain expertise and technology, and we're excited about the brand's potential. It's still early days in this dynamic and evolving category, but we believe Nu Mark is increasingly well-positioned for the future.
In 2014, our alcohol assets continued to diversify our income and contribute to income growth. In the Wine segment, Ste. Michelle posted another year of double-digit operating companies income growth primarily through higher volume. Critics awarded Ste. Michelle's premium wines more than 180 ratings of 90 or better in 2014. Our earnings also benefited from our SAB Miller investment, which continues to support our strong balance sheet. So to sum up, 2014 was another excellent year for our strong premium brands, for our company and for our shareholders. We are maximizing income in our core premium tobacco businesses and innovating for the future. We're extremely proud of the results produced by our very talented employees and of our track record for creating value for shareholders. Looking ahead to 2015, Altria forecasts its 2015 adjusted diluted EPS will increase by 7% to 9% to a range of $2.75 to $2.80 from an adjusted diluted EPS base of $2.57 in 2014. 
Finally, today, we are announcing some executive leadership changes all to the effect of March 1 this year. First, Dave Beran, our President and Chief Operating Officer, has decided to retire after 38 years of distinguished service to the company. Dave's strong expertise, knowledge, financial acumen and leadership have contributed measurably to Altria's success, and he will be missed.
When Dave retires, Howard Willard will become Altria's Chief Operating Officer. He has significant experience, having been with the company since 1992. In addition to his current role of CEO, Howard has held leadership positions in numerous business functions of the Altria companies. Billy Gifford will succeed Howard as Altria's Chief Financial Officer. Billy has been with Altria since 1994, and also has held numerous roles, including President and CEO of PM USA and his current role as Altria's Senior Vice President, Strategy and Business development. These moves are consistent with our long-term succession planning, and these talented experienced leaders will serve us well for the future.
I'll now turn things over to Howard, who will discuss Altria's business results in more detail."

In 2014, strong performance in our Smokeable Products segment helped drive adjusted diluted EPS growth of almost 16% in the fourth quarter and 8% for the full year. A lower effective tax rate on operations and lower interest expense were also contributors to adjusted diluted EPS growth in both periods. The smokeable products segment delivered strong adjusted operating companies income growth in the quarter and for the full year. The segment also expanded adjusted operating companies income margins 1.8 percentage points in the fourth quarter and 1.9 percentage points in the full year. For the full year, PM USA grew Marlboro's retail share by 1/10 of a share point, and grew its total cigarette category retail share by 2/10 of a share point.
L&M share gains also contributed to PM USA's full year retail share performance, while the cigarette discount segment declined slightly. The Smokeable Products segment's fourth quarter reported operating companies income grew 7.6%, primarily driven by higher pricing. For the full year, the segment's reported operating companies income declined 2.7%, primarily due to higher gains on NPM adjustment items in 2013. After adjusting for trade inventory changes and other factors, PM USA estimates that its fourth quarter and full year cigarette shipment volume declined approximately 2% and 3%, respectively, and the total industry volumes declined approximately 2.5% and 3.5%, respectively. The 2014 full year industry cigarette decline of 3.5% continues to be in the range of the decline rate we've seen in the last few years.
In Cigars, Middleton's reported cigar shipment volume increased by almost 4% for the fourth quarter and over 6% for the full year, driven primarily by Black & Mild's strong performance in the tipped cigar segment. Black & Mild's retail share declined 0.4% for the quarter and 0.3% for the full year. In the smokeless product segment, adjusted operating companies income was unchanged in the fourth quarter, as higher pricing and higher volume were offset by higher promotional investments in the timing of selling, general and administrative expenses.
For the full year, the segment grew adjusted operating companies income 3.3%, primarily due to higher pricing and higher volume, partially offset by higher promotional investments and product mix. Adjusted operating margins declined 2.5 percentage points in the fourth quarter to 60%, and grew 1.1 percentage points to 63.4% in the full year.
After adjusting for trade inventory changes and other factors, USSTC estimates that its domestic smokeless product shipment volume grew approximately 2.5% in both the fourth quarter and full year of 2014. Copenhagen and Skoals combined retail share grew 4/10 of a share point in the quarter to 51.3% and grew 5/10 to 51.2% for the full year.
The Wine segment delivered strong results in the fourth quarter and the full year. Ste. Michelle grew operating companies income by 17.8% in the fourth quarter and 13.6% in the full year, primarily driven by higher volume. Shipments increased 9.6% in the quarter and 4.8% for the full year. 
That wraps up our operating results. Marty and I will now take your questions. While the calls are being complied, let's cover a few housekeeping items. As a reminder, comparisons when made are against the fourth quarter and full year of 2013, unless we note otherwise.
Marlboro's price gap versus the lowest effective priced cigarette was 32% in the fourth quarter, down 2 percentage points and 33% for the full year, down 1 percentage point. For the fourth quarter, Marlboro's net pack price was $6.02, up $0.16, and the lowest effective priced cigarette was $4.55, up $0.17. For the full year, Marlboro's net pack price was $5.96, up $0.13, while the lowest effective priced cigarette was $4.49, up $0.15. The cigarette discount segment's retail share was 24.9% for the fourth quarter and full year, down 3/10 in each period. The estimated weighted average cigarette state excise tax was $1.49 per pack for the fourth quarter, up $0.02; and $1.48 per pack for the full year, up $0.04. 
Wholesale inventory changes are one factor PM USA uses to estimate adjusted PM USA and industry volumes. PM USA estimates that its 2014 wholesale inventories were approximately 2.4 billion units at the end of the fourth quarter and $2.3 billion units at the end of the third quarter. In 2013, PM USA's wholesale inventories were estimated to be approximately 2.5 billion units at the end of both the fourth and third quarter. PM USA estimates that the 2014 cigarette industry wholesale inventory levels were 5.5 billion units at the end of the fourth quarter and 5.7 billion units at the end of the third quarter. PM USA estimates that 2013 wholesale inventory levels were 5.9 billion units at the end of the fourth quarter and 6.3 billion units at the end of the third quarter.
Copenhagen's price gap versus the leading discount brand was 32% in the fourth quarter and full year, down 3 percentage points for the fourth quarter and 4 percentage points for the full year. Copenhagen's retail price was $4.19 in the fourth quarter, up $0.12; and $4.13 for the full year, up $0.07. The price of the leading discount brand was $3.17 in the fourth quarter and $3.14 for the full year, up $0.15 in each period. CapEx was $47 million for the fourth quarter and $163 million for the full year. Ongoing depreciation and amortization was $59 million for the quarter and $208 million for the full year. Looking ahead to 2015, we expect capital expenditures will be in the range of $200 million to $250 million, and that depreciation and amortization will be approximately $200 million.

We've been cautious for the last several years, as you know, as we went through this difficult recession. We are actually seeing a modest improvement, I think, in the economic situation for the adult tobacco consumer, although it remains a bit of a mixed bag. The U.S. economy is clearly improving, as everyone knows, and particularly in relation to the rest of the world economies. We see unemployment and underemployment have come down. We see housing starts are coming back. We see very good consumer confidence numbers. So I think all of that is a positive. Those are positive factors. On the other side of the ledger, you have labor participation rates maybe not where they should be and then year-over-year wage gains are still modest. But I think, on balance, our view is that the adult tobacco consumer is feeling better about their economic situation and their economic future, and we expect some modest improvement in that over 2015."

So Vivian, they have more choices today, and so there's some movement there, but these things best, I think, are evaluated over time. So I'm not sure I have any big insights to share with you this morning on that, except to say that it speaks, I think, first to the wisdom of having a total tobacco platform. So as adult tobacco consumers move within these categories, that Altria is well-positioned to offer them premium brands with great margin structure. So that's how we think about the business, and we'll have to study the volume, I think, for some time yet to know the answer to the question you're posing."

Let me try to comment on a couple of those to try to help you. I think gas prices for us, historically, we have not called out gas prices as one of the principal drivers of consumer behavior, although we acknowledge that it had some effect. To us, it was really more about the unemployment rate, consumer confidence and housing starts. Now the way that gasoline prices have gone down so precipitously has obviously had a bigger effect on the consumer, right? The C stores, as you and others have pointed out, are seeing better traffic, and I don't think there's any question that it's contributing to consumers feeling better about their economy situation. But historically, Bonnie, we have not called that out as one of the big 3 drivers. So I don't know what people are expecting for gasoline prices, but it probably will not have that much more of an effect. We did have very good pricing, and the way that we achieved pricing, as you know, is we took list pricing in 2014, combined $0.13 a pack, and then, as always, we can moderate our promotional allowances, and we did so last year. We moderated our allowances on special blend, Marlboro Special Blend and on Black. And as you know, we're able to do that quite tactically by state by using our SPP [ph] tools. So we did see a year in which we think we could take some pricing, and I think you can see that in the numbers for 2014."

Our estimate is that the consumer spending in 2014 increased by about 50% to about $2 billion, and that's compared to a year before, which I think you've seen the numbers, of roughly a 160% increase. So you can see that it has slowed, although its 50% increase is still fairly large. It's growing about traditional trade channels, and it's also growing in vape shops, which are harder to get a line of sight into. To dimensional that spent, though, $80 billion is spent on conventional tobacco products versus the 2 that we estimate. So just to put it in its proper context. With respect to Nu Mark, our belief is, is that, that is an interesting enough category for us to participate in and to aspire to have leadership in. That is leadership that will be achieved over the long term and for the long term, which is why we use these words about financially disciplined and over time. We want to participate there. We believe Nu Mark had a very good year. Gosh, we got the MarkTen product in 130,000 retail stores, and I mean, that's easy to stay and that's hard to do, and so our sales force at Nu Mark did a great job there. They rolled out, as we mentioned in our remarks, the 2.5 product. Consumers continue to look for their product. And so I think a lot of what's going to happen with vapor is about manufacturers trying to bring out products that better satisfy their consumers, and that's what Nu Mark is doing. It's for the long term. It will be for the long term, and we are learning our way in with our consumer and using a disciplined approach. But with the acquisition of Green Smoke and their people and their technology in addition to Nu Mark, I am very encouraged about what we have in the pipeline for MarkTen."

They've really helped us quite a lot on the front end with supply chain. They had a well-established supply chain, and we've been relying on them quite heavily to help us in that regard. They have very good people, and they do have a good technology pipeline. We've been integrating all that in 2014. Remember, we closed in this, I think, in April, if memory serves. And so we've now been integrating that, and we have an integrated pipeline of products, as well as we become more efficient with those 2 organizations. So yes, I would expect to see more from the combined Nu Mark Green Smoke assets."

And I was wondering if maybe you had some context perspective you can share in terms of brand equity scores or any kind of indicator, quantitative indicator on kind of what the effect has been. I mean, clearly, we've seen the Marlboro franchise do well over this timeframe. So I just wondered if you have some more granularity on some of the quantification behind Marlboro? And the second question is, and this is, I guess, more strategic. It seems like the Super Premium Cigarettes segment is doing fairly well and has been doing fairly well, and there's really not that many players in that market.

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our call. Altria had strong start in 2015. Our core tobacco businesses continue to deliver on their strategies back by the strength of the leading premium brands. Each of our reportable segments grew operating company's income and expanded their margins. Altria grew it's adjusted diluted EPS by 10.5%, paid approximately $1 billion in dividends and repurchased 3.6 million shares in the first quarter, and earlier this morning we reaffirmed our guidance for 2015 full year adjusted diluted EPS growth of 7% to 9%. 
Here are some important highlights from the quarter. PM USA delivered on its multiple segment strategy of maximizing income while maintaining modest share momentum on Marlboro over time. The segment produced outstanding results in the first quarter driven by higher pricing, higher volume and Marlboro retail share growth. PM USA has invested steadily today's press in Marlboro and those investment continue to pay off. As a result, the smokable segment grew adjusted operating company's income by over 12% in the quarter. PM USA's reported cigarettes shipment once grew 1.6% in the quarter, benefited from a moderation in the industry decline rate, trade inventory movements and retail share gains. In the machine-made large cigar categories, John Middleton continued to strengthen its leadership position in the profitable tipped cigar segment. The company posted strong double-digit volume growth in the quarter, driven primarily by Black & Mild. 
In the smokeless products segment, USSTC grew first quarter operating company's income by 5% and expanded its operating company's income margin by 1 percentage points to over 63%. USSTC estimates that it's adjusted smokeless segment volumes grew approximately 4% in the quarter or smokeless industry volumes grew 2% over the past 12 months. Copenhagen and Skoal grew their combined retail share by 0.5 percentage points in the quarter. 
Turning to innovative tobacco products. Nu Mark remains focus on building a robust portfolio of innovative tobacco products for adult smokers and vapors. Nu Mark began shipping its next-generation e-vapor product, MarkTen XL into lead markets this month. 
In the line segment, segment posted a quarter of nearly 23% operating company's income growth, primarily through improved premium mix. In the first quarter, equity earnings from our SABMiller investment for negatively affected by SABMiller special items and unfavorable currency impacts from a stronger dollar. The investment continues to support our strong balance sheet and provides cash through its dividend. 
So we came into 2015 with momentum in our first quarter results reflect another quarter of strong execution against our well-defined strategies. We believe our businesses are positioned to help us deliver against our full year guidance.
Billy will now discuss our business returns in more detail."

The smokeable products segment delivered strong adjusted operating company's income growth of 12.6%, primarily driven by higher pricing, higher shipment volume and lower resolution expenses, due primarily to the dthat end of the federal tobacco quarter buyout payments. Despite cost being higher in the quarter, due primarily to higher pension and benefit cost and the time of SG&A spending, the smokable segment expanded it's adjusted OCA margins by 2.3 percentage points. Volume was also strong, after adjusting trade inventory changes and other factors, PM USA estimates and that its first quarter shipment volume was essentially unchanged, and the total industry volumes declined approximately 0.5%. For the quarter, PM USA grew Marlboro retail share by 3/10 of the share to 44% and grew its total cigarettes categories retail by 0.4 of the share point. share gains also contributed to PM USA's first quarter performance as the brand continue to grow its share while the overall industry discount categories decline in the quarter. In the total machine large cigar categories, Black & Mild retail sales declined 6/10 of a share point in the first quarter. As Marty mentioned, Middleton continue to concentrate on the more profitable tipped cigar segment where Black & Mild gain share. In the smokeless products segment, operating company's income increased 5% in the first quarter as higher pricing was partially offset by higher promotional investments. After adjusting for trade inventory changes and other factors, USSTC estimates that it's domestic smokeless product shipment product grew approximately 4% in the quarter, while the industry grew approximately 2% over the past 12 months. Copenhagen and Skoal's combined retail share grew 5/10 of a share point in the quarter to 51.2%. Copenhagen's retail share 1 share point, while Skoal declined 5/10 a share point. 
The line segment delivered very strong results in the first quarter. Shipment grew operating company's by 22.7% in the first quarter, primarily driven by improved premium mix. Shipments increased by 0.5% in the quarter. That wraps up our operating results. Marty and now we'll take your questions. While the call is being compiled, lets cover a few items. As a reminder, comparisons were made against the first quarter of 2014, unless we note otherwise. Marlboro's price gap versus the lowest effective price cigarettes was 31% in the first quarter, down 2 percentage points.

Wholesale inventory changes were one factor PM USA U.S. as adjusted PM USA and industry volumes. PM USA estimates that its wholesale inventories were approximately 2.6 billion units at the end of the first quarter 2015 and 2.4 billion units at the end of the fourth quarter of 2014. At the end of the first quarter of 2014, PM USA's wholesale inventories were estimated to be approximately 2.5 billion units.

This is several quarters in a row where the price gap between Marlborough and the price product in the market has been down, and even taking strong pricing I have 2 questions around that. One would be, as you look at your promotional spending overall in the quarter, could you say that was up or down, and I mean for the cigarette business overall? And then, is there -- are you pulling back on promotions say in the premium side versus discounts to help widen the gap, assuming a little bit economics today plus they that gap could widen from this level?"

Let me go out at this way. We had net pricing realization in the cigarette in the smokable segment more than 5%, so we can say that despite the fact that the price gap has narrowed, where as you pointed out taking strong pricing, which is great. The reason the price gap has narrowed in the quarter is because some discount brands increased their pricing faster than the premium brands did, and that's what accounts for the math including some frankly when you do the math and the price caps. So price gaps are important metric as we've spoken about, and we keep an eye on them, but boy, to have a quarter where we can grow our volume, grow our margin, great strong pricing realization, you can see the result of that Chris with nearly 13% operating company income growth, that's pretty good for us price gap narrowing or not.

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our call. Altria is off to a strong start in 2015.

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our call. Altria is off to a strong start in 2015. Our core tobacco businesses continue to deliver on their strategies, backed by the strengths of their leading premium brands. Each of our reportable segments grew operating company's income and expanded their margins. Altria grew it's adjusted diluted EPS by 10.5%, paid approximately $1 billion in dividends and repurchased 3.6 million shares in the first quarter, and earlier this morning we reaffirmed our guidance for 2015 full year adjusted diluted EPS growth of 7% to 9%. 
Here are some important highlights from the quarter. PM USA delivered on its multiple segment strategy of maximizing income while maintaining modest share momentum on Marlboro over time. The segment produced outstanding results in the first quarter, driven by higher pricing, higher volume and Marlboro retail share growth. PM USA has invested steadily to strengthen Marlboro and those investment continue to pay off. As a result, the smokable segment grew adjusted operating company's income by over 12% in the quarter. PM USA's reported cigarette shipment volumes grew 1.6% in the quarter, benefiting from a moderation in the industry decline rate, trade inventory movements and retail share gains. In the machine-made large cigar category, John Middleton continued to strengthen its leadership position in the profitable tipped cigar segment. The company posted strong double-digit volume growth in the quarter, driven primarily by Black & Mild. 
In the smokeless products segment, USSTC grew first quarter operating company's income by 5% and expanded its operating company's income margin by 1 percentage point to over 63%. USSTC estimates that it's adjusted smokeless segment volumes grew approximately 4% in the quarter, all smokeless industry volumes grew 2% over the past 12 months. Copenhagen and Skoal grew their combined retail share by 0.5 percentage point in the quarter. 
Turning to innovative tobacco products. Nu Mark remains focused on building a robust portfolio of innovative tobacco products for adult smokers and vapors. Nu Mark began shipping its next-generation e-vapor product, MarkTen XL into lead markets this month. 
In the line segment, Ste. Michelle posted a quarter of nearly 23% operating company's income growth, primarily through improved premium mix. In the first quarter, equity earnings from our SABMiller investment were negatively affected by SABMiller special items and unfavorable currency impacts from a stronger dollar. The investment continues to support our strong balance sheet and provides cash flow through its dividend. 
So we came into 2015 with momentum, and our first quarter results reflect another quarter of strong execution against our well-defined strategies. We believe our businesses are positioned to help us deliver against our full year guidance.
Billy Gifford will now discuss our business results in more detail."

The smokeless product segment and fewer shares outstanding also contributed to that growth. The smokeable products segment delivered strong adjusted operating company's income growth of 12.6%, primarily driven by higher pricing, higher shipment volume and lower resolution expenses, due primarily to the end of the federal tobacco quarter buyout payments. Despite costs being higher in the quarter, due primarily to higher pension and benefit cost and timing of SG&A spending, the smokable segment expanded its adjusted OCI  margins by 2.3 percentage points. Volume was also strong, after adjusting for trade inventory changes and other factors, PM USA estimates that its first quarter cigarette shipment volume was essentially unchanged, and the total industry volumes declined approximately 0.5%. For the quarter, PM USA grew Marlboro's retail share by 0.3 of a share point to 44%, and grew its total cigarette category retail share by 0.4 of a share point. L&M share gains also contributed to PM USA's first quarter performance as the brand continued to grow its share while the overall industry discount category declined in the quarter. In the total machine-made large cigars category, Black & Mild's retail share declined 0.6 of a share point in the first quarter. As Marty mentioned, Middleton continued to concentrate on the more profitable tipped cigar segment, were Black & Mild gain share. In the smokeless product segment, operating company's income increased 5% in the first quarter as higher pricing was partially offset by higher promotional investments. After adjusting for trade inventory changes and other factors, USSTC estimates that it's domestic smokeless product shipment volume grew approximately 4% in the quarter, while the industry grew approximately 2% over the past 12 months. Copenhagen and Skoal's combined retail share grew 0.5 of a share point in the quarter to 51.2%. Copenhagen's retail share grew 1 share point, while Skoal's retail share declined 0.5 of a share point. 
The line segment delivered very strong results in the first quarter. Ste. Michelle grew operating company's income by 22.7% in the first quarter, primarily driven by improved premium mix. Shipments increased by 0.5% in the quarter. That wraps up our operating results. Marty and I will now take your questions. While the calls are being compiled, lets cover a few housekeeping items. As a reminder, comparisons when made are against the first quarter of 2014, unless we note otherwise. Marlboro's price gap versus the lowest effective priced cigarette was 31% in the first quarter, down 2 percentage points. For the first quarter, Marlboro's net pack price was $6.06, up $0.15, and the lowest effective priced cigarette was $4.62, up $0.17. The estimated weighted average cigarette state excise tax was $1.49 per pack for the first quarter, up $0.01. 
Wholesale inventory changes are one factor PM USA uses to estimate adjusted PM USA and industry volumes. PM USA estimates that its wholesale inventories were approximately 2.6 billion units at the end of the first quarter of 2015 and 2.4 billion units at the end of the fourth quarter of 2014. At the end of the first quarter of 2014, PM USA's wholesale inventories were estimated to be approximately 2.5 billion units. PM USA estimates that cigarette industry wholesale inventory levels were 5.5 billion units at the end of the first quarter of 2015, and 5.4 billion units at the end of the fourth quarter of 2014. PM USA estimates that first quarter of 2014 wholesale inventory levels were 5.5 billion units. Copenhagen's price gap versus the leading discount brand was 29% in the first quarter, down 3 percentage points. Copenhagen's retail price was $4.22 in the first quarter, up $0.13. The price of the leading discount brand was $3.26 in the first quarter, up $0.17. CapEx was $48 million for the first quarter. Ongoing depreciation and amortization was $49 million for the quarter.

What that means is we're moving with appropriate dispatch, but with financial discipline, always learning from the consumer and frankly, what we're working on principally right now in addition to our distribution and brand building is product development. Consumers are telling eBay per manufacturers that the products are not yet there. That's why you see us improving our product development pipeline. And to be sure, share is important, but it will be important as soon as the products are established with the consumers. So we are not unduly focused on share.

So that takes into account, Bonnie, all of the products that adult tobacco consumers are trying. And of course, it's a dynamic time. We have seen more moment among the categories.

We had net pricing realization in the cigarette in the smokable segment more than 5%, so you can see that despite the fact that the price gap's narrowed, we're, as you point out taking strong pricing, which is great. The reason the price gap's narrowed in the quarter is because some discount brands increased their pricing faster than the premium brands did, and that's what accounts for the math, including some rounding frankly when you do the math in the price gaps. So price gaps are important metric as we've spoken about, and we keep an eye on them. But boy, to have a quarter where we can grow our volume, grow our margin, get strong pricing realization, you can see the result of that Chris with nearly 13% operating company income growth.

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our call. Altria is off to a strong start in 2015. Our core tobacco businesses continue to deliver on their strategies, backed by the strengths of their leading premium brands. Each of our reportable segments grew operating company's income and expanded their margins. Altria grew it's adjusted diluted EPS by 10.5%, paid approximately $1 billion in dividends and repurchased 3.6 million shares in the first quarter, and earlier this morning we reaffirmed our guidance for 2015 full year adjusted diluted EPS growth of 7% to 9%. 
Here are some important highlights from the quarter. PM USA delivered on its multiple segment strategy of maximizing income while maintaining modest share momentum on Marlboro over time. The segment produced outstanding results in the first quarter, driven by higher pricing, higher volume and Marlboro retail share growth. PM USA has invested steadily to strengthen Marlboro and those investment continue to pay off. As a result, the smokeable segment grew adjusted operating company's income by over 12% in the quarter. PM USA's reported cigarette shipment volumes grew 1.6% in the quarter, benefiting from a moderation in the industry decline rate, trade inventory movements and retail share gains. In the machine-made large cigar category, John Middleton continued to strengthen its leadership position in the profitable tipped cigar segment. The company posted strong double-digit volume growth in the quarter, driven primarily by Black & Mild. 
In the smokeless products segment, USSTC grew first quarter operating company's income by 5% and expanded its operating company's income margin by 1 percentage point to over 63%. USSTC estimates that it's adjusted smokeless segment volumes grew approximately 4% in the quarter, while smokeless industry volumes grew 2% over the past 12 months. Copenhagen and Skoal grew their combined retail share by 0.5 percentage point in the quarter. 
Turning to innovative tobacco products. Nu Mark remains focused on building a robust portfolio of innovative tobacco products for adult smokers and vapors. Nu Mark began shipping its next-generation e-vapor product, MarkTen XL into lead markets this month. 
In the wine segment, Ste. Michelle posted a quarter of nearly 23% operating company's income growth, primarily through improved premium mix. In the first quarter, equity earnings from our SABMiller investment were negatively affected by SABMiller special items and unfavorable currency impacts from a stronger dollar. The investment continues to support our strong balance sheet and provides cash flow through its dividend. 
So we came into 2015 with momentum, and our first quarter results reflect another quarter of strong execution against our well-defined strategies. We believe our businesses are positioned to help us deliver against our full year guidance.
Billy Gifford will now discuss our business results in more detail."

The smokeable products segment delivered",658,"Thank you, Marty. Our smokeable product segment helped drive adjustment diluted EPS growth of 10.5% in the first quarter. The smokeless product segment and fewer shares outstanding also contributed to that growth. The smokeable products segment delivered strong adjusted operating company's income growth of 12.6%, primarily driven by higher pricing, higher shipment volume and lower resolution expenses, due primarily to the end of the federal tobacco quota buyout payments. Despite costs being higher in the quarter, due primarily to higher pension and benefit cost and timing of SG&A spending, the smokeable segment expanded its adjusted OCI margins by 2.3 percentage points. Volume was also strong, after adjusting for trade inventory changes and other factors, PM USA estimates that its first quarter cigarette shipment volume was essentially unchanged, and the total industry volumes declined approximately 0.5%. For the quarter, PM USA grew Marlboro's retail share by 0.3 of a share point to 44%, and grew its total cigarette category retail share by 0.4 of a share point. L&M share gains also contributed to PM USA's first quarter performance as the brand continued to grow its share while the overall industry discount category declined in the quarter. In the total machine-made large cigars category, Black & Mild's retail share declined 0.6 of a share point in the first quarter. As Marty mentioned, Middleton continued to concentrate on the more profitable tipped cigar segment, were Black & Mild gained share. In the smokeless product segment, operating company's income increased 5% in the first quarter as higher pricing was partially offset by higher promotional investments. After adjusting for trade inventory changes and other factors, USSTC estimates that it's domestic smokeless product shipment volume grew approximately 4% in the quarter, while the industry grew approximately 2% over the past 12 months. Copenhagen and Skoal's combined retail share grew 0.5 of a share point in the quarter to 51.2%. Copenhagen's retail share grew 1 share point, while Skoal's retail share declined 0.5 of a share point. 
The wine segment delivered very strong results in the first quarter. Ste. Michelle grew operating company's income by 22.7% in the first quarter, primarily driven by improved premium mix. Shipments increased by 0.5% in the quarter. That wraps up our operating results. Marty and I will now take your questions. While the calls are being compiled, lets cover a few housekeeping items. As a reminder, comparisons when made are against the first quarter of 2014, unless we note otherwise. Marlboro's price gap versus the lowest effective price cigarette was 31% in the first quarter, down 2 percentage points. For the first quarter, Marlboro's net pack price was $6.06, up $0.15, and the lowest effective price cigarette was $4.62, up $0.17. The estimated weighted average cigarette state excise tax was $1.49 per pack for the first quarter, up $0.01. 
Wholesale inventory changes are one factor PM USA uses to estimate adjusted PM USA and industry volumes. PM USA estimates that its wholesale inventories were approximately 2.6 billion units at the end of the first quarter of 2015 and 2.4 billion units at the end of the fourth quarter of 2014. At the end of the first quarter of 2014, PM USA's wholesale inventories were estimated to be approximately 2.5 billion units. PM USA estimates that cigarette industry wholesale inventory levels were 5.5 billion units at the end of the first quarter of 2015, and 5.4 billion units at the end of the fourth quarter of 2014. PM USA estimates that first quarter of 2014 wholesale inventory levels were 5.5 billion units. Copenhagen's price gap versus the leading discount brand was 29% in the first quarter, down 3 percentage points. Copenhagen's retail price was $4.22 in the first quarter, up $0.13. The price of the leading discount brand was $3.26 in the first quarter, up $0.17. CapEx was $48 million for the first quarter. Ongoing depreciation and amortization was $49 million for the quarter.

What that means is we're moving with appropriate dispatch, but with financial discipline, always learning from the consumer and frankly, what we're working on principally right now in addition to our distribution and brand building is product development. Consumers are telling e-vapor manufacturers that the products are not yet there. That's why you see us improving our product development pipeline. And to be sure, share is important, but it will be important as soon as the products are established with the consumers. So we are not unduly focused on share. We are focused on getting the right products in the consumers hands."

So that takes into account, Bonnie, all of the products that adult tobacco consumers are trying. And of course, it's a dynamic time. We have seen more movement among the categories.

We had net pricing realization in the cigarette in the smokeable segment more than 5%, so you can see that despite the fact that the price gap's narrowed, we're, as you point out taking strong pricing, which is great. The reason the price gaps narrowed in the quarter is because some discount brands increased their pricing faster than the premium brands did, and that's what accounts for the math, including some rounding frankly when you do the math in the price gaps. So price gaps are important metric as we've spoken about, and we keep an eye on them.

We have the phenomenon of dropping gas prices, and it occurs for us at a time after we made very significant investments in Marlboro, we implement the Marlboro architecture. We launch Marlboro Black.

In fact, if you look at the quarterly results for Skoal, it's down 0.5 share point but it's the fourth consecutive quarter where its narrowed those share losses year-over-year. We gave it a new equity campaign. We have terrific equity-based promotions, I think that are improving its relationship with its consumer set. And then as you know, we've been working on the price gaps on Skoal Classic. I think all of that is helping to steady up Skoal, and that's spot on strategy for us. So I think it's the combination of Copenhagen's continued growth and our work on the value equation on Skoal."

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our call. Altria is off to a strong start in 2015. Our core tobacco businesses continue to deliver on their strategies, backed by the strengths of their leading premium brands. Each of our reportable segments grew operating company's income and expanded their margins. Altria grew it's adjusted diluted EPS by 10.5%, paid approximately $1 billion in dividends and repurchased 3.6 million shares in the first quarter, and earlier this morning we reaffirmed our guidance for 2015 full year adjusted diluted EPS growth of 7% to 9%. 
Here are some important highlights from the quarter. PM USA delivered on its multiple segment strategy of maximizing income while maintaining modest share momentum on Marlboro over time. The segment produced outstanding results in the first quarter, driven by higher pricing, higher volume and Marlboro retail share growth. PM USA has invested steadily to strengthen Marlboro and those investment continue to pay off. As a result, the smokable segment grew adjusted operating company's income by over 12% in the quarter. PM USA's reported cigarette shipment volumes grew 1.6% in the quarter, benefiting from a moderation in the industry decline rate, trade inventory movements and retail share gains. In the machine-made large cigar category, John Middleton continued to strengthen its leadership position in the profitable tipped cigar segment. The company posted strong double-digit volume growth in the quarter, driven primarily by Black & Mild. 
In the smokeless products segment, USSTC grew first quarter operating company's income by 5% and expanded its operating company's income margin by 1 percentage point to over 63%. USSTC estimates that it's adjusted smokeless segment volumes grew approximately 4% in the quarter, while smokeless industry volumes grew 2% over the past 12 months. Copenhagen and Skoal grew their combined retail share by 0.5 percentage point in the quarter. 
Turning to innovative tobacco products. Nu Mark remains focused on building a robust portfolio of innovative tobacco products for adult smokers and vapors. Nu Mark began shipping its next-generation e-vapor product, MarkTen XL into lead markets this month. 
In the wine segment, Ste. Michelle posted a quarter of nearly 23% operating company's income growth, primarily through improved premium mix. In the first quarter, equity earnings from our SABMiller investment were negatively affected by SABMiller special items and unfavorable currency impacts from a stronger dollar. The investment continues to support our strong balance sheet and provides cash flow through its dividend. 
So we came into 2015 with momentum, and our first quarter results reflect another quarter of strong execution against our well-defined strategies. We believe our businesses are positioned to help us deliver against our full year guidance.
Billy Gifford will now discuss our business results in more detail."

The smokeless product segment and fewer shares outstanding also contributed to that growth. The smokable products segment delivered strong adjusted operating company's income growth of 12.6%, primarily driven by higher pricing, higher shipment volume and lower resolution expenses, due primarily to the end of the federal tobacco quota buyout payments. Despite costs being higher in the quarter, due primarily to higher pension and benefit cost and timing of SG&A spending, the smokable segment expanded its adjusted OCI margins by 2.3 percentage points. Volume was also strong, after adjusting for trade inventory changes and other factors, PM USA estimates that its first quarter cigarette shipment volume was essentially unchanged, and the total industry volumes declined approximately 0.5%. For the quarter, PM USA grew Marlboro's retail share by 0.3 of a share point to 44%, and grew its total cigarette category retail share by 0.4 of a share point. L&M share gains also contributed to PM USA's first quarter performance as the brand continued to grow its share while the overall industry discount category declined in the quarter. In the total machine-made large cigars category, Black & Mild's retail share declined 0.6 of a share point in the first quarter. As Marty mentioned, Middleton continued to concentrate on the more profitable tipped cigar segment, were Black & Mild gained share. In the smokeless product segment, operating company's income increased 5% in the first quarter as higher pricing was partially offset by higher promotional investments. After adjusting for trade inventory changes and other factors, USSTC estimates that it's domestic smokeless product shipment volume grew approximately 4% in the quarter, while the industry grew approximately 2% over the past 12 months. Copenhagen and Skoal's combined retail share grew 0.5 of a share point in the quarter to 51.2%. Copenhagen's retail share grew 1 share point, while Skoal's retail share declined 0.5 of a share point. 
The wine segment delivered very strong results in the first quarter. Ste. Michelle grew operating company's income by 22.7% in the first quarter, primarily driven by improved premium mix. Shipments increased by 0.5% in the quarter. That wraps up our operating results. Marty and I will now take your questions. While the calls are being compiled, lets cover a few housekeeping items. As a reminder, comparisons when made are against the first quarter of 2014, unless we note otherwise. Marlboro's price gap versus the lowest effective price cigarette was 31% in the first quarter, down 2 percentage points. For the first quarter, Marlboro's net pack price was $6.06, up $0.15, and the lowest effective price cigarette was $4.62, up $0.17. The estimated weighted average cigarette state excise tax was $1.49 per pack for the first quarter, up $0.01. 
Wholesale inventory changes are one factor PM USA uses to estimate adjusted PM USA and industry volumes. PM USA estimates that its wholesale inventories were approximately 2.6 billion units at the end of the first quarter of 2015 and 2.4 billion units at the end of the fourth quarter of 2014. At the end of the first quarter of 2014, PM USA's wholesale inventories were estimated to be approximately 2.5 billion units. PM USA estimates that cigarette industry wholesale inventory levels were 5.5 billion units at the end of the first quarter of 2015, and 5.4 billion units at the end of the fourth quarter of 2014. PM USA estimates that first quarter of 2014 wholesale inventory levels were 5.5 billion units. Copenhagen's price gap versus the leading discount brand was 29% in the first quarter, down 3 percentage points. Copenhagen's retail price was $4.22 in the first quarter, up $0.13.

I hope you had a chance to see our remarks at CAGNY about our vapor business. Our aspiration there is to succeed in the long term. What that means is we're moving with appropriate dispatch, but with financial discipline, always learning from the consumer and frankly, what we're working on principally right now in addition to our distribution and brand building is product development. Consumers are telling e-vapor manufacturers that the products are not yet there. That's why you see us improving our product development pipeline. And to be sure, share is important, but it will be important as soon as the products are established with the consumers. So we are not unduly focused on share.

We had net pricing realization in the cigarette in the smokable segment more than 5%, so you can see that despite the fact that the price gap's narrowed, we're, as you point out taking strong pricing, which is great. The reason the price gaps narrowed in the quarter is because some discount brands increased their pricing faster than the premium brands did, and that's what accounts for the math, including some rounding frankly when you do the math in the price gaps. So price gaps are important metric as we've spoken about, and we keep an eye on them. But boy, to have a quarter where we can grow our volume, grow our margin, get strong pricing realization, you can see the result of that Chris with nearly 13% operating company income growth.

If you back go back in history, for example, when you look at the infamous Marlboro Friday price gaps got out of line. The consumer was not feeling good about that. You are much too young to remember, Vivian, but people predicted that it was going to be the end the brands and so forth. In fact it wasn't, it was that when the consumers thought that the price gap was appropriate. They came right back roaring into Marlboro. So Marlboro has that kind of equity, and we would expect that as consumers continue to consolidate around premium brands, that Marlboro will do just fine."

Altria delivered excellent second quarter and first half results, allowing us to raise our 2015 full year guidance earlier this morning. We grew adjusted diluted earnings per share almost 14% in the second quarter an",740,"Thanks, Sarah. Good morning, everyone. Altria delivered excellent second quarter and first half results, allowing us to raise our 2015 full year guidance earlier this morning. We grew adjusted diluted earnings per share almost 14% in the second quarter and more than 13% for the first half of 2015 with a very strong performance from this multiple product segment and solid contributions across our other businesses. The smokeable segment continues to perform extremely well. Adjusted operating company's income grew almost 16% in the second quarter and more than 14% for the first half on very strong fundamentals.
Marlboro delivered 0.3 of retail share growth in both the second quarter the first half of 2015. When adjusted for trade inventory changes and other factors, PM USA estimates its volume grew approximately 1% in the second quarter and 0.5% for the first half. An improvement in the industry's rate of volume decline and retail share gains, supported by relatively low gas prices and an improving economy drove PM USA's strong volume performance.
In addition, strong net price realization and cost savings from the expiration of FETRA payments contributed to the double-digit adjusted OCI growth.
And smokeless product's adjusted OCI grew 4.2% in the second quarter and 4.6% for the first half of 2015. USSTC's estimate of smokeless industry volumes showed near-term improvement with growth over the past 12 months of approximately 3%. This upturn in industry volume stems from similar economic factors as I have described in the smokeable product segment and adult tobacco consumers continued exploration across tobacco categories.
After adjusting for trade inventory changes and other factors, USSTC estimates its smokeless volume increased 2.5% in both the second quarter and the first half of 2015. USSTC grew combined Copenhagen and Skoal share 0.1 in the second quarter and 0.3 for the first half to 51.1% in both periods in line with its strategy.
In the lights segment, volume growth also helped drive another very strong performance from St. Michelle. Second quarter OCI increased 25% with volumes increasing nearly 9%. And for the first half, OCI grew 24%.
In innovative tobacco products, MarkTen XL entered several lead markets in April. And while it's still very early, the results are encouraging. Nu Mark also expanded Green Smoke e-vapor products into retail lead markets in June. We're also continuing to complement our capabilities by partnering with others on innovative tobacco products. As we announced recently, we expanded our agreement with Philip Morris International to include a joint research, development and technology sharing agreement. As part of the agreement, Altria and PMI will collaborate to develop e-vapor products for commercialization in the U.S. by Altria, and in markets abroad by PMI. These supplements the agreement with PMI that we announced in 2013. And is the latest step in our ongoing portfolio approach to innovative product development and commercialization.
And of course, we continue to deliver value to shareholders. We paid approximately $2 billion in dividends in the first half of 2015. We also recently completed our $1 billion share repurchase program, purchasing approximately $263 million in shares in the second quarter and the remaining $63 million in July. In addition, Altria's board has authorized a new $1 billion program, which we expect to complete by the end of 2016.
So in summary, we're very happy with our first half performance and the investments we've made and our making behind our companies brands continue to pay dividends. We remain confident in our strategies and in our ability to deliver long-term value to shareholders. Thus, we now expect to deliver adjusted diluted earnings per share growth in the range of $2.76 to $2.81, representing growth of 7.5% to 9.5% from our 2014 adjusted diluted EPS base of $2.57.
Our guidance reflects a very successful first half and expectations that our businesses will continue to deliver solid results. It also reflects more moderate adjusted diluted EPS growth in the second half of 2015 due to several factors. This include lapping the effects of the improvements in the economy for adult tobacco consumers and lower gasoline prices, expected trade inventory movements and the effect of state excise tax increases and the comparative the benefit from the expiration of the federal tobacco quota buyout payments ends in the fourth quarter and we now estimate our full year effective tax rate on operations will be 35.3%. 
Now I'll turn things over to Billy, who will give us some more detail."

Strong performance in the smokeable product segment helped drive our earnings growth in both the second quarter and first half of 2015. Higher pricing in volumes and lower FETRA expense drove adjusted OCI growth",484,"Thanks, Marty, and good morning, everyone. Strong performance in the smokeable product segment helped drive our earnings growth in both the second quarter and first half of 2015. Higher pricing in volumes and lower FETRA expense drove adjusted OCI growth of nearly 16% in the second quarter and over 14% for the first half. These factors were partially offset by an increase in pension and benefit cost and investments in brand equity in both the second quarter and first half of 2015. The smokeable product segment continued to expand margins. Adjusted OCI margins increased by 3.3 percentage points to 47.5% for the second quarter and by almost 3 points to 47% for the first 6 months. Driven in part by Marlboro's momentum, PMI US grew its overall retail share by 0.5 in both the second quarter and the first half, achieving second quarter retail share of 51.4%. L&M also turned in another strong performance, despite a declining discount segment. PM USA's reported cigarette shipment volume growth benefited from trade inventory movements, and we expect these inventories to moderate going forward.
When adjusted for trade inventory changes and other factors, PM USA estimates that industry cigarette volumes were unchanged in the second quarter and down slightly for the first half of 2015. Also with respect to the cigarette business, 7 states enacted excise tax increases with 5 taking effect July 1. We anticipate these SCT increases will result in weighted average SCT increase of $0.04 per pack through the end of 2015. Machine-made Mar cigars also contributed to the smokeable segment's strong performance. Cigar shipments volumes increased about 1% in the second quarter and over 5% for the first half. And Middleton sustained Black & Mild's very high share position in the high-margin tip cigar segments.
In smokeless products, higher pricing helped drive adjusted OCI growth in both the second quarter and first half of 2015. Adjusted OCI margins contracted slightly to 66.4% in the second quarter and improved 0.4 to nearly 65% year-to-date. 
In the wine segment, increased shipments and improved premium mix drove strong OCI results for the second quarter and the first half of 2015. OCI margins expanded 2.5 points in the second quarter and almost 3 points for the first 6 months. In the all leather category, lower OCI for both the second quarter and the first half was primarily driven by a decrease in residual values of certain aircraft and Philip Morris capital core. And finally, Altria recorded earnings from our SABMiller investment of $225 million in the second quarter and $359 million for the first half.
That wraps up our results. Marty and I will now take your questions. While the calls are being compiled, I'll direct your attention to altria.com. Along with today's earnings release, for your reference, we posted a list of quarterly metrics to include pricing, inventory and other items.

Indeed, I think, it's the highest that it has been in some period of time. So there's no question that we are having a strong year. We're very pleased with the performance of the business, so I think we should begin with that. But we grew 13% in the first half. And so we've recognized that we're starting to lap some benefits that likely contributed, for example, to the volume. So we know that the consumer, the adult tobacco consumer began to feel better in the back half of the year. We had the sharp drop in gasoline prices, and that's going to be lapped in the back half. Billy has called out the end of FETRA payments in the fourth quarter. We're going to have an increase in our tax rate. And so those kinds of benefits have all been taken into account. As we've said regularly, when we talk about guidance, it's always a series of puts and takes. And in addition, we have some excise tax increases that we're going to have to see. So we think that represents our best judgment. I think it's a very strong performance, 7.5% to 9.5% off of an already high Altria base.

And so if you look at what's at about 5.5%, it's industry volume. It's held back to about 2, and now we've seen an uptick to 3. So some of that is probably due to both movement of new users between combustible products and smokeless products, as well as people experimenting with favor and a few people sticking with vapor. So those are probably the right factors to think about there. Listen, Copenhagen is doing terrific work, and I think we're on the path on the stabilizing Skoal. Our strategy is to grow them together, and actually we did that. So you can see it improved 0.3 for the half per share together. And actually, their combined volume was higher than our estimate per industry volume. So Copenhagen is a terrific brand. Skoal has a little bit of a harder job in that it has to compete with its principal competitor and it competes with Copenhagen. And so, we've been working on the value equation. And we're encouraged by what we've seen there. I think the way to think about this is the long-term strategy as is well in place. And it continues to deliver, use it income growth for the half."

296308,306846655,841073,"Altria Group Inc., Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 29, 2015",2015-07-29,"Earnings Calls","Altria Group, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Sarah. Good morning, everyone. Altria delivered excellent second quarter and first half results, allowing us to raise our 2015 full year guidance earlier this morning. We grew adjusted diluted earnings per share almost 14% in the second quarter an",740,"Thanks, Sarah. Good morning, everyone. Altria delivered excellent second quarter and first half results, allowing us to raise our 2015 full year guidance earlier this morning. We grew adjusted diluted earnings per share almost 14% in the second quarter and more than 13% for the first half of 2015 with a very strong performance from this multiple product segment and solid contributions across our other businesses. The smokeable segment continues to perform extremely well. Adjusted operating company's income grew almost 16% in the second quarter and more than 14% for the first half on very strong fundamentals.
Marlboro delivered 0.3 of retail share growth in both the second quarter and the first half of 2015. When adjusted for trade inventory changes and other factors, PM USA estimates its volume grew approximately 1% in the second quarter and 0.5% for the first half. An improvement in the industry's rate of volume decline and retail share gains, supported by relatively low gas prices and an improving economy, drove PM USA's strong volume performance.
In addition, strong net price realization and cost savings from the expiration of FETRA payments contributed to the double-digit adjusted OCI growth.
In smokeless products, adjusted OCI grew 4.2% in the second quarter and 4.6% for the first half of 2015. USSTC's estimate of smokeless industry volumes showed near-term improvement with growth over the past 12 months of approximately 3%. This upturn in industry volume stems from similar economic factors as I have described in the smokeable product segment and adult tobacco consumers continued exploration across tobacco categories.
After adjusting for trade inventory changes and other factors, USSTC estimates its smokeless volume increased 2.5% in both the second quarter and the first half of 2015. USSTC grew combined Copenhagen and Skoal share 0.1 in the second quarter and 0.3 for the first half to 51.1% in both periods in line with its strategy.
In the lights segment, volume growth also helped drive another very strong performance from Ste. Michelle. Second quarter OCI increased 25% with volumes increasing nearly 9%. And for the first half, OCI grew 24%.
In innovative tobacco products, MarkTen XL entered several lead markets in April, and while it's still very early, the results are encouraging. Nu Mark also expanded Green Smoke e-vapor products into retail lead markets in June. We're also continuing to complement our capabilities by partnering with others on innovative tobacco products. As we announced recently, we expanded our agreement with Philip Morris International to include a joint research, development and technology sharing agreement. As part of the agreement, Altria and PMI will collaborate to develop e-vapor products for commercialization in the U.S. by Altria, and in markets abroad by PMI. These supplements the agreement with PMI that we announced in 2013, and is the latest step in our ongoing portfolio approach to innovative product development and commercialization.
And of course, we continue to deliver value to shareholders. We paid approximately $2 billion in dividends in the first half of 2015. We also recently completed our $1 billion share repurchase program, purchasing approximately $263 million in shares in the second quarter and the remaining $63 million in July. In addition, Altria's board has authorized a new $1 billion program, which we expect to complete by the end of 2016.
So in summary, we're very happy with our first half performance and the investments we've made and are making behind our companies brands continue to pay dividends. We remain confident in our strategies and in our ability to deliver long-term value to shareholders. Thus, we now expect to deliver adjusted diluted earnings per share growth in the range of $2.76 to $2.81, representing growth of 7.5% to 9.5% from our 2014 adjusted diluted EPS base of $2.57.
Our guidance reflects a very successful first half and expectations that our businesses will continue to deliver solid results. It also reflects more moderate adjusted diluted EPS growth in the second half of 2015 due to several factors. This include: lapping the effects of the improvements in the economy for adult tobacco consumers and lower gasoline prices; expected trade inventory movements and the effect of state excise tax increases; and the comparative benefit from the expiration of the federal tobacco quota buyout payments ends in the fourth quarter and we now estimate our full year effective tax rate on operations will be 35.3%. 
Now I'll turn things over to Billy, who will give us some more detail."

Strong performance in the smokeable product segment helped drive our earnings growth in both the second quarter and first half of 2015. Higher pricing in volumes and lower FETRA expense drove adjusted OCI growth",484,"Thanks, Marty, and good morning, everyone. Strong performance in the smokeable product segment helped drive our earnings growth in both the second quarter and first half of 2015. Higher pricing in volumes and lower FETRA expense drove adjusted OCI growth of nearly 16% in the second quarter and over 14% for the first half. These factors were partially offset by an increase in pension and benefit cost and investments in brand equity in both the second quarter and first half of 2015. The smokeable product segment continue to expand margins. Adjusted OCI margins increased by 3.3 percentage points to 47.5% for the second quarter and by almost 3 points to 47% for the first 6 months. Driven in part by Marlboro's momentum, PM USA grew its overall retail share by 0.5 in both the second quarter and the first half, achieving second quarter retail share of 51.4%. L&M also turned in another strong performance, despite a declining discount segment. PM USA's reported cigarette shipment volume growth benefited from trade inventory movements, and we expect these inventories to moderate going forward.
When adjusted for trade inventory changes and other factors, PM USA estimates that industry cigarette volumes were unchanged in the second quarter and down slightly for the first half of 2015. Also with respect to the cigarette business, 7 states enacted excise tax increases with 5 taking effect July 1. We anticipate these SET increases will result in weighted average SET increase of $0.04 per pack through the end of 2015. Machine-made large cigars also contributed to the smokeable segment's strong performance. Cigar shipment volumes increased about 1% in the second quarter and over 5% for the first half, and Middleton sustained Black & Mild's very high share position in the high-margin tipped cigar segments.
In smokeless products, higher pricing helped drive adjusted OCI growth in both the second quarter and first half of 2015. Adjusted OCI margins contracted slightly to 66.4% in the second quarter and improved 0.4 to nearly 65% year-to-date. 
In the wine segment, increased shipments and improved premium mix drove strong OCI results for the second quarter and the first half of 2015. OCI margins expanded 2.5 points in the second quarter and almost 3 points for the first 6 months. In the all other category, lower OCI for both the second quarter and the first half was primarily driven by a decrease in residual values of certain aircraft at Philip Morris Capital Corp. And finally, Altria recorded earnings from our SABMiller investment of $225 million in the second quarter and $359 million for the first half.
That wraps up our results. Marty and I will now take your questions. While the calls are being compiled, I'll direct your attention to altria.com. Along with today's earnings release, for your reference, we posted a list of quarterly metrics to include pricing, inventory and other items.

I mean, to begin, the guidance that we have now for 2015 is above our long-term growth aspiration of 7% to 9%. Indeed, I think, it's the highest that it's been in some period of time. So there's no question that we are having a strong year. We're very pleased with the performance of the business, so I think we should begin with that. But we grew 13% in the first half. And so we've recognized that we're starting to lap some benefits that likely contributed, for example, to the volume. So we know that the consumer, the adult tobacco consumer, began to feel better. In the back half of the year, we had the sharp drop in gasoline prices, and that's going to be lapped in the back half. Billy has called out the end of FETRA payments in the fourth quarter. We're going to have an increase in our tax rate. And so those kinds of benefits have all been taken into account. As we've said regularly when we talk about guidance, it's always a series of puts and takes. And in addition, we have some excise tax increases that we're going to have to see. So we think that represents our best judgment. I think it's a very strong performance, 7.5% to 9.5% off of an already high Altria base. So that's the way we're thinking about it for the second half."

And then of course, pricing at retail ultimately is up to the retailers and the strategies that they employ in the cigarette category.

And so if you look it was  growing at about 5.5%, this is industry volume. It's held back to about 2, and now we've seen an uptick to 3. So some of that probably is due to both movement of dual users between combustible products and smokeless products, as well as people experimenting with vapor and a few people sticking with vapor. So those are probably the right factors to think about there. Listen, Copenhagen is doing terrific work, and I think that we're on the path to stabilizing Skoal. Our strategy is to grow them together, and actually we did that. So you can see it grew 0.3 for the half, per share together. And actually, their combined volume was higher than our estimate per industry volume. So Copenhagen is a terrific brand. Skoal has a little bit of a harder job in that it has to compete with its principal competitor and it competes with Copenhagen. And so, we've been working on the value equation. And we're encouraged by what we've seen there. I think the way to think about this is the long-term strategy is well in place. And it continues to deliver, you see the income growth for the half."

Altria delivered excellent second quarter and first half results, allowing us to raise our 2015 full year guidance earlier this morning. We grew adjusted diluted earnings per share almost 14% in the second quarter and more than 13% for the first half of 2015 with a very strong performance from the smokeable products segment and solid contributions across our other businesses. The smokeable segment continues to perform extremely well. Adjusted operating company's income grew almost 16% in the second quarter and more than 14% for the first half on very strong fundamentals.
Marlboro delivered 0.3 of retail share growth in both the second quarter and the first half of 2015. When adjusted for trade inventory changes and other factors, PM USA estimates its volume grew approximately 1% in the second quarter and 0.5% for the first half. An improvement in the industry's rate of volume decline and retail share gains, supported by relatively low gas prices and an improving economy drove PM USA's strong volume performance.
In addition, strong net price realization and cost savings from the expiration of FETRA payments contributed to the double-digit adjusted OCI growth.
In smokeless products, adjusted OCI grew 4.2% in the second quarter and 4.6% for the first half of 2015. USSTC's estimate of smokeless industry volumes showed near-term improvement with growth over the past 12 months of approximately 3%. This upturn in industry volume stems from similar economic factors as I have described in the smokeable product segment, and adult tobacco consumers continued exploration across tobacco categories.
After adjusting for trade inventory changes and other factors, USSTC estimates its smokeless volume increased 2.5% in both the second quarter and the first half of 2015. USSTC grew combined Copenhagen and Skoal share 0.1 in the second quarter and 0.3 for the first half to 51.1% in both periods in line with its strategy.
In the wine segment, volume growth also helped drive another very strong performance from Ste. Michelle. Second quarter OCI increased 25% with volumes increasing nearly 9%. And for the first half, OCI grew 24%.
In innovative tobacco products, MarkTen XL entered several lead markets in April, and while it's still very early, the results are encouraging. Nu Mark also expanded Green Smoke e-vapor products into retail lead markets in June. We're also continuing to complement our capabilities by partnering with others on innovative tobacco products. As we announced recently, we expanded our agreement with Philip Morris International to include a joint research, development and technology sharing agreement. As part of the agreement, Altria and PMI will collaborate to develop e-vapor products for commercialization in the U.S. by Altria and in markets abroad by PMI. This supplements the agreement with PMI that we announced in 2013, and is the latest step in our ongoing portfolio approach to innovative product development and commercialization.
And of course, we continue to deliver value to shareholders. We paid approximately $2 billion in dividends in the first half of 2015. We also recently completed our $1 billion share repurchase program, purchasing approximately $263 million in shares in the second quarter and the remaining $63 million in July. In addition, Altria's board has authorized a new $1 billion program, which we expect to complete by the end of 2016.
So in summary, we're very happy with our first half performance and the investments we've made and are making behind our company's brands continue to pay dividends. We remain confident in our strategies and in our ability to deliver long-term value to shareholders. Thus, we now expect to deliver adjusted diluted earnings per share growth in a range of $2.76 to $2.81, representing growth of 7.5% to 9.5% from our 2014 adjusted diluted EPS base of $2.57.
Our guidance reflects a very successful first half and expectations that our businesses will continue to deliver solid results. It also reflects more moderate adjusted diluted EPS growth in the second half of 2015 due to several factors. These include lapping the effects of the improvements in the economy for adult tobacco consumers at lower gasoline prices, expected trade inventory movements and the effect of state excise tax increases, and the comparative benefit from the expiration of the federal tobacco quota buyout payments ends in the fourth quarter, and we now estimate our full year effective tax rate on operations will be 35.3%. 
Now I'll turn things over to Billy, who will give us some more detail."

Strong performance in the smokeable products segment helped drive our earnings growth in both the second quarter and first half of 2015. Higher pricing and volumes and lower FETRA expense drove adjusted OCI growth of nearly 16% in the second quarter and over 14% for the first half. These factors were partially offset by an increase in pension and benefit cost and investments in brand equity in both the second quarter and first half of 2015. The smokeable product segment continued to expand margins. Adjusted OCI margins increased by 3.3 percentage points to 47.5% for the second quarter and by almost 3 points to 47% for the first 6 months. Driven in part by Marlboro's momentum, PM USA grew its overall retail share by 0.5 in both the second quarter and the first half, achieving second quarter retail share of 51.4%. L&M also turned in another strong performance despite a declining discount segment. PM USA's reported cigarette shipment volume growth benefited from trade inventory movements, and we expect these inventories to moderate going forward.
When adjusted for trade inventory changes and other factors, PM USA estimates that industry cigarette volumes were unchanged in the second quarter and down slightly for the first half of 2015. Also with respect to the cigarette business, 7 states enacted excise tax increases with 5 taking effect July 1. We anticipate these SET increases will result in weighted average SET increase of $0.04 per pack through the end of 2015. Machine-made large cigars also contributed to the smokeable segment's strong performance. Cigar shipment volumes increased about 1% in the second quarter and over 5% for the first half, and Middleton sustained Black & Mild's very high share position in the high-margin tipped cigar segments.
In smokeless products, higher pricing helped drive adjusted OCI growth in both the second quarter and first half of 2015. Adjusted OCI margins contracted slightly to 66.4% in the second quarter and improved 0.4 to nearly 65% year-to-date. 
In the wine segment, increased shipments and improved premium mix drove strong OCI results for the second quarter and the first half of 2015. OCI margins expanded 2.5 points in the second quarter and almost 3 points for the first 6 months. In the all other category, lower OCI for both the second quarter and the first half was primarily driven by a decrease in residual values of certain aircraft at Philip Morris Capital Corp. And finally, Altria recorded earnings from our SABMiller investment of $225 million in the second quarter and $359 million for the first half.
That wraps up our results. Marty and I will now take your questions. While the calls are being compiled, I'll direct your attention to altria.com. Along with today's earnings release, for your reference, we posted a list of quarterly metrics to include pricing, inventory and other items.

So there's no question that we are having a strong year. We're very pleased with the performance of the business, so I think we should begin with that. But we grew 13% in the first half. And so we've recognized that we're starting to lap some benefits that likely contributed, for example, to the volume. So we know that the consumer, the adult tobacco consumer, began to feel better in the back half of the year. We had the sharp drop in gasoline prices, and that's going to be lapped in the back half. Billy has called out the end of FETRA payments in the fourth quarter. We're going to have an increase in our tax rate. And so those kind of benefits have all been taken into account. As we've said regularly when we've talked about guidance, it's always a series of puts and takes. And in addition, we have some excise tax increases that we're going to have to see. So we think that represents our best judgment. I think it's a very strong performance, 7.5% to 9.5% off of a already high Altria base. So that's the way we're thinking about it for the second half."

And so, if you look it was growing at about 5.5% -- this is industry volume. It's held back to about 2%, and now we've seen an uptick to 3%. So some of that probably is due to both movement of dual users between combustible products and smokeless products as well as people experimenting with vapor and a few people sticking with vapor. So those are probably the right factors to think about there. Listen, Copenhagen is doing terrific work, and I think that we're on the path to stabilizing Skoal. Our strategy is to grow them together, and actually, we did that. So you can see it grew 0.3 for the half per share together. And actually, their combined volume was higher than our estimate per industry volume. So Copenhagen is a terrific brand. Skoal has a little bit of a harder job in that it just has to compete with its principal competitor and it competes with Copenhagen. And so, we've been working on the value equation, and we're encouraged by what we've seen there. I think the way to think about this is the long-term strategy is well in place, and it continues to deliver. You see the income growth for the half."

We're pleased to report yet another strong quarter for Altria Group. We delivered outstanding performance in the third quarter and for the first 9 months of 2015. We grew adjusted diluted earnings per share, 8.7% in",985,"Thanks, Sarah. Good morning, everyone. We're pleased to report yet another strong quarter for Altria Group. We delivered outstanding performance in the third quarter and for the first 9 months of 2015. We grew adjusted diluted earnings per share, 8.7% in the quarter and 11.5% for the year-to-date. Each of our reporting segments has contributed to our strong earnings performance, especially the smokeable products segment, led by the terrific Marlboro brand. So let's begin there.
The smokeable products segment grew adjusted operating company's income more than 11% in the third quarter and over 13% for the first 9 months. For the year-to-date, solid net price realization. The benefit from the end of the federal tobacco quota buyout payments in higher volume continue to support double-digit adjusted OCI growth and good margin expansion. The industry continue to benefit from near-term moderation and cigarette volume declines, which combined with PM USA's share gains, resulted in strong volume results for PM USA. Reported cigarette shipment volume for the quarter was up 0.1% after adjusting for trade inventory changes and other factors, PM USA estimates that its cigarette volume was unchanged in the third quarter.
For the year-to-date, reported cigarette shipment volume grew 1.5%, and PM USA estimates that its adjusted cigarette volume increased approximately 0.5% versus the year ago period.
In line with strategy, Marlboro gained 1/10 of retail share in the fourth quarter and 2/10 for the year-to-date. So our investments in the Marlboro architecture continue to pay off. And by all key measures, OCI, margin, price realization, volume and share, our smokeable segment is performing very well.
Turning to the smokeless product segment. USSTC delivered income growth and combined retail share growth on Copenhagen and Skoal. The smokeless product segment grew adjusted OCI to 0.5% in the third quarter and almost 4% for the first 9 months, primarily through higher pricing for partially offset by higher promotional investments and SG&A expenses. The iconic Copenhagen brand remain the fastest-growing brand in the category with 8/10 of retail share growth for the first 9 months of 2015 and thanks to investments in Skoal's equity and overall value equation, the brand's retail share declines continue to moderate. Our objective remains to seek combined share momentum on these 2 brands in this competitive category.
The wine business continued its strong performance. Ste. Michelle grew OCI almost 13% in the third quarter and nearly 20% for the year-to-date, primarily through increased volumes and improved premium mix.
In innovative tobacco products, Nu Mark continues pursuing disciplined innovation in e-vapor. We've seen encouraging on MarkTen XL, allowing us to expand our lead market presence. Nu Mark also continues its in-store evaluation of Green Smoke's retail positioning. We focus first on getting the product right and we're learning a great deal about the adult tobacco consumer response. We're optimistic about these brands as we move forward.
And of course, Altria continued to return cash to shareholders. We paid approximately $3 billion in dividends in the first 9 months of 2015. Additionally, we raised our quarterly dividend by 8.7% in August to an annualized rate of $2.26 per share, marking our 49th dividend increase in 46 years. We remain focused on our target dividend payout ratio of 80% of adjusted diluted EPS.
So our year-to-date results have been very strong. And we're happy with our progress against our full year plans. Thus, we reaffirm that we expect to deliver adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $2.76 to $2.81, representing growth of 7.5% to 9.5% from our 2014 adjusted diluted EPS base of $2.57. This guidance reflects expected moderated EPS results in the fourth quarter as compared to last year due to several factors we've discussed previously, including lapping the benefit from the expiration of federal tobacco quota buyout payments, lapping some of the effects of a stronger economy and lower gasoline prices and a higher effective tax rate on operations. Additionally, trade inventories for cigarettes may moderate going forward and unfavorable foreign currency translation could affect prior year comparisons of earnings from Altria's equity investment in SABMiller.
Finally, let us provide you with a word on the proposed AB InBev combination with SABMiller. We know there is a great deal of interest in this transaction and we look forward to providing the details for us at the appropriate time. But as I hope you can appreciate, we have to wait until final terms have been reached before doing so. But until then, here's a brief update and some background on this transaction.
Earlier this month, AB InBev and SABMiller announced an agreement in principle on key terms regarding a possible transaction between the 2 companies. Yesterday, AB InBev and SABMiller jointly announced that the U.K. takeover panel has extended the relevant deadline until November 4, 2015. We're pleased to see this transaction moving forward, and that the parties are reporting progress has been made including AB InBev's completion of confirmatory due diligence of SABMiller, reconfirming the financial and other terms of the possible offer and confirming the availability of financing facilities. The extension gives AB InBev and SABMiller additional time to finalize the details necessary for AB InBev to announce a firm intention to make an offer for SABMiller.
As you know, Altria has been a shareholder of SABMiller since 2002, indeed its largest shareholder. The SABMiller state has provided us with access to the global growing profit pool, diversified our business, contributed nicely to our long-term earnings growth and strengthened our balance sheet.
Of course, the approach we have always taken is to manage that asset for the best interest of Altria's shareholders.
We believe that combining the largely complementary businesses of SAB and AB InBev to create the world's largest brewer is a compelling opportunity. So we're excited about the proposed transaction and are working constructively with the parties to complete the transaction.
And with that, I'll turn things over to Billy."

As Marty mentioned, stronger volume in the smokeable product segment helped deliver double-digit adjusted OCI growth for the first 9 months. When adjusted for trade inventory changes and other factors, PM USA estimates that industry cigarette volume was down 1% in the third quarter and 0.5% for the first 9 months. In addition to retail share gains on Marlboro, L&M also gained share, allowing PM USA's total retail share to hit 51.3% for both the quarter and the first 9 months. This represents an increase of 0.4 of a retail share point and 0.5 share point, respectively from the year ago periods. Cigar volume growth also contributed to the smokeable product segment's results.
reported shipment volume increased just over 1% in the third quarter and nearly 4% for the first 9 months and contributions from Black & Mild Jazz and Casino helped Black & Mild grow its leading position in the high-margin cigar segment.
In fact, Black & Mild Casino was recently recognized by CSP Magazine as the 2015 retailer's choice, best new product in the cigar category. In total, the smokeable product segment increased adjusted OCI margins by 2.7 points in the third quarter to 47%. For the year-to-date, adjusted OCI margins in the smokable product segment expanded 2.8 points.
In the smokeless product segment, USSTC reported shipments increased approximately 1% in the third quarter and 2% for the first 9 months. We estimate that smokeless industry volume has grown approximately 2.5% over the past 6 months.
In both the third quarter and for the first 9 months, Copenhagen and Skoal grew their retail share on a combined basis. In the third quarter, higher pricing was partially offset by higher promotional investments and SG&A expenses, resulting in adjusted OCI margins contracting 1.1 percentage points to 63.8%.
For the year-to-date, adjusted OCI margins narrowed 0.1 percentage points to 64.5%.
In the wine segment, reported shipment volumes have remained robust, growing at nearly 9% in the third quarter and over 6% for the first 9 months.
OCI margins expanded 0.8 percentage points to 21.7% in the third quarter, and over 2 points to 21.7% for the year-to-date.
Additionally, Altria recorded -- reported equity earnings from our SABMiller investment of $187 million in the third quarter and $546 million for the year-to-date.
And finally, you will remember that we completed our $1 billion share repurchase program early in the third quarter, and that our board authorized a new $1 billion program, which we expect to complete by the end of 2016. 
That wraps up our results. Marty and I will now take your questions. While the calls are being compiled, I'll direct your attention to altria.com. Along with today's earnings release, for your reference, we posted a list of quarterly metrics to include pricing, inventory and other items.
Operator, do we have any questions?"

We talked about innovation in the innovative product side, but it's important to remember that innovation is everywhere and boy, at Marlboro, you see it all the time. So Marlboro Midnight is the latest innovation under the architecture. It will come out in the Black family. It is a unique and a bold menthol for Marlboro and should help Marlboro participate in the growing menthol category. Has a very differentiated and unique pack. It's going to be supported with beautiful POS to raise awareness among adult smokers. And we'll position it as a new and exciting product in the Marlboro family, particularly for menthol smokers. So we're excited about Midnight, and I think it's off to a good start. I think it's going to hit wholesale, if I recall, Bonnie, in mid-November. And it will be retailed a couple of weeks after that, so you will be seeing there. And on the digital side, we continue to see strong innovation as well. We now have a mobile couponing. As you know, that coupons can be delivered to adult smokers' smartphones. It's a tremendous step forward in terms of efficiency and meeting adult smokers where they are. That's now available nationally. And we have launched the Marlboro app. It's available on the 2 large app platforms. It's responsibly done, age-verified. And it will be a place for the brand to connect again with adult smokers in a very innovative way in the digital space. So we're excited about both those innovations."

Copenhagen is growing, you're right. And Skoal doesn't grow share, but I would point out that I think we've begun to moderate the share. If you look at it sequentially, it's at 19 8, I think. If you look at the year-to-date number, Bonnie. And boy, I tell you, we're glad to have 20 share points of Skoal business in this category that has 65% operating margins.

The industry, as a whole, is moving more towards premium. And so what you see is that L&M is basically consolidating share out of the other discount players, so it works spot-on strategy for PM USA.

Obviously, the effect sounds like it's going to be another drag in terms of the fourth quarter. If I just look at your smokeable segment in the fourth quarter last year though, it doesn't look like the profitability comparisons are that much tougher. So is this really more of an FX issue? Or any other investments that we should be thinking about in the fourth quarter if you do get some volume upside that potentially you're looking to invest back the upside into any of those initiatives?"

We're pleased to report yet another strong quarter for Altria Group. We delivered outstanding performance in the third quarter and for the first 9 months of 2015. We grew adjusted diluted earnings per share, 8.7% in",985,"Thanks, Sarah. Good morning, everyone. We're pleased to report yet another strong quarter for Altria Group. We delivered outstanding performance in the third quarter and for the first 9 months of 2015. We grew adjusted diluted earnings per share, 8.7% in the quarter and 11.5% for the year-to-date. Each of our reporting segments has contributed to our strong earnings performance, especially the smokeable products segment, led by the terrific Marlboro brand. So let's begin there.
The smokeable products segment grew adjusted operating company's income more than 11% in the third quarter and over 13% for the first 9 months. For the year-to-date, solid net price realization, a benefit from the end of the federal tobacco quota buyout payments and higher volume, continued to support double-digit adjusted OCI growth and good margin expansion. The industry continued to benefit from near-term moderation and cigarette volume declines, which combined with PM USA's share gains, resulted in strong volume results for PM USA. Reported cigarette shipment volume for the quarter was up 0.1%. After adjusting for trade inventory changes and other factors, PM USA estimates that its cigarette volume was unchanged in the third quarter. For the year-to-date, reported cigarette shipment volume grew 1.5%, and PM USA estimates that its adjusted cigarette volume increased approximately 0.5% versus the year-ago period.
In line with strategy, Marlboro gained 1/10 of retail share in the fourth quarter and 2/10 for the year-to-date. So our investments in the Marlboro architecture continue to pay off. And by all key measures, OCI, margin, price realization, volume and share, our smokeable segment is performing very well.
Turning to the smokeless products segment. USSTC delivered income growth and combined retail share growth on Copenhagen and Skoal. The smokeless products segment grew adjusted OCI 2.5% in the third quarter and almost 4% for the first 9 months, primarily through higher pricing, partially offset by higher promotional investments and SG&A expenses. The iconic Copenhagen brand remain the fastest-growing brand in the category with 8/10 of retail share growth for the first 9 months of 2015 and thanks to investments in Skoal's equity and overall value equation, the brand's retail share declines continue to moderate. Our objective remains to seek combined share momentum on these 2 brands in this competitive category.
The wine business continued its strong performance. Ste. Michelle grew OCI almost 13% in the third quarter and nearly 20% for the year-to-date, primarily through increased volume and improved premium mix.
In innovative tobacco products, Nu Mark continues pursuing disciplined innovation in e-vapor. We've seen encouraging trial on MarkTen XL, allowing us to expand our lead market presence. Nu Mark also continues its in-store evaluation of Green Smoke's retail positioning. We focused first on getting the product right, and we're learning a great deal about the adult tobacco consumer response. We're optimistic about these brands as we move forward.
And of course, Altria continued to return cash to shareholders. We paid approximately $3 billion in dividends in the first 9 months of 2015. Additionally, we raised our quarterly dividend by 8.7% in August to an annualized rate of $2.26 per share, marking our 49th dividend increase in 46 years. We remain focused on our target dividend payout ratio of 80% of adjusted diluted EPS.
So our year-to-date results have been very strong, and we're happy with our progress against our full year plans. Thus, we reaffirm that we expect to deliver adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $2.76 to $2.81, representing growth of 7.5% to 9.5% from our 2014 adjusted diluted EPS base of $2.57. This guidance reflects expected moderated EPS results in the fourth quarter as compared to last year due to several factors we've discussed previously, including lapping the benefit from the expiration of federal tobacco quota buyout payments, lapping some of the effects of a stronger economy and lower gasoline prices and a higher effective tax rate on operations. Additionally, trade inventories for cigarettes may moderate moving -- going forward and unfavorable foreign currency translation could affect prior year comparisons of earnings from Altria's equity investment in SABMiller.
Finally, let us provide you with a word on the proposed AB InBev combination with SABMiller. We know there is a great deal of interest in this transaction and we look forward to providing the details for us at the appropriate time. But as I hope you can appreciate, we have to wait until final terms have been reached before doing so. But until then, here's a brief update and some background on this transaction.
Earlier this month, AB InBev and SABMiller announced an agreement in principle on key terms regarding a possible transaction between the 2 companies. Yesterday, AB InBev and SABMiller jointly announced that the U.K. Takeover Panel has extended the relevant deadline until November 4, 2015. We're pleased to see this transaction moving forward, and that the parties are reporting progress has been made, including AB InBev's completion of confirmatory due diligence of SABMiller, reconfirming the financial and other terms of the possible offer and confirming the availability of financing facilities. The extension gives AB InBev and SABMiller additional time to finalize the details necessary for AB InBev to announce a firm intention to make an offer for SABMiller.
As you know, Altria has been a shareholder of SABMiller since 2002, indeed its largest shareholder. The SABMiller stake has provided us with access to the global growing profit pool, diversified our business, contributed nicely to our long-term earnings growth and strengthened our balance sheet. Of course, the approach we have always taken is to manage that asset for the best interest of Altria's shareholders.
We believe that combining the largely complementary businesses of SAB and AB InBev to create the world's largest brewer is a compelling opportunity. So we're excited about the proposed transaction and are working constructively with the parties to complete the transaction.
And with that, I'll turn things over to Billy."

As Marty mentioned, stronger volume in the smokeable products segment helped deliver double-digit adjusted OCI growth for the first 9 months. When adjusted for trade inventory changes and other factors, PM USA estimates that industry cigarette volume was down 1% in the third quarter and 0.5% for the first 9 months. In addition to retail share gains on Marlboro, L&M also gained share, allowing PM USA's total retail share to hit 51.3% for both the quarter and the first 9 months. This represents an increase of 0.4 of a retail share point and 0.5 a retail share point, respectively from the year-ago periods. Cigar volume growth also contributed to the smokeable products segment's results. Middleton's reported shipment volume increased just over 1% in the third quarter and nearly 4% for the first 9 months. And contributions from Black & Mild Jazz and Casino helped Black & Mild grow its leading position in the high-margin cigar segment. In fact, Black & Mild Casino was recently recognized by CSP Magazine as the 2015 retailer's choice best new product in the cigar category. 
In total, the smokeable products segment increased adjusted OCI margins by 2.7 points in the third quarter to 47%. For the year-to-date, adjusted OCI margins in the smokeable products segment expanded 2.8 points.
In the smokeless products segment, USSTC reported shipments increased approximately 1% in the third quarter and 2% for the first 9 months. We estimate that smokeless industry volume has grown approximately 2.5% over the past 6 months.
In both the third quarter and for the first 9 months, Copenhagen and Skoal grew their retail share on a combined basis. In the third quarter, higher pricing was partially offset by higher promotional investments and SG&A expenses, resulting in adjusted OCI margins contracting 1.1 percentage points to 63.8%. For the year-to-date, adjusted OCI margins narrowed 0.1 percentage points to 64.5%.
In the wine segment, reported shipment volumes have remained robust, growing at nearly 9% in the third quarter and over 6% for the first 9 months. OCI margins expanded 0.8 percentage points to 21.7% in the third quarter, and over 2 points to 21.7% for the year-to-date. 
Additionally, Altria recorded -- reported equity earnings from our SABMiller investment of $187 million in the third quarter and $546 million for the year-to-date. And finally, you'll remember that we completed our $1 billion share repurchase program early in the third quarter, and that our board authorized a new $1 billion program, which we expect to complete by the end of 2016. 
That wraps up our results. Marty and I will now take your questions. While the calls are being compiled, I'll direct your attention to altria.com. Along with today's earnings release, for your reference, we posted a list of quarterly metrics to include pricing, inventory and other items.

I think they both represent good examples of how Marlboro is innovating at the core of our business. We talk about innovation in the innovative products side, but it's important to remember that innovation is everywhere. And boy, at Marlboro, you see it all the time. So Marlboro Midnight is the latest innovation in the -- under the architecture. It will come out in the Black family. It is a unique and a bold menthol for Marlboro and should help Marlboro participate in the growing menthol category. Has a very differentiated and unique pack. It's going to be supported with beautiful POS to raise awareness among adult smokers. And we'll position it as a new and exciting product in the Marlboro family, particularly for menthol smokers. So we're excited about Midnight, and I think it's off to a good start. I think it's going to hit wholesale, if I recall, Bonnie, in mid-November. And it will be retail a couple of weeks after that, so you'll be seeing there. And on the digital side, we continue to see strong innovation as well. We now have mobile couponing. As you know, that coupons can be delivered to adult smokers' smartphones. It's a tremendous step forward in terms of efficiency and meeting adult smokers where they are. That's now available nationally. And we have launched the Marlboro app. It's available on the 2 large app platforms. It's responsibly done, age-verified and it will be a place for the brand to connect again with adult smokers in a very innovative way in the digital space. So we're excited about both those innovations."

We're pleased to report yet another strong quarter for Altria Group. We delivered outstanding performance in the third quarter and for the first 9 months of 2015. We grew adjusted diluted earnings per share, 8.7% in",985,"Thanks, Sarah. Good morning, everyone. We're pleased to report yet another strong quarter for Altria Group. We delivered outstanding performance in the third quarter and for the first 9 months of 2015. We grew adjusted diluted earnings per share, 8.7% in the quarter and 11.5% for the year-to-date. Each of our reporting segments has contributed to our strong earnings performance, especially the smokeable products segment, led by the terrific Marlboro brand. So let's begin there.
The smokeable products segment grew adjusted operating company's income more than 11% in the third quarter and over 13% for the first 9 months. For the year-to-date, solid net price realization, a benefit from the end of the federal tobacco quota buyout payments and higher volume, continued to support double-digit adjusted OCI growth and good margin expansion. The industry continued to benefit from near-term moderation and cigarette volume declines, which combined with PM USA's share gains, resulted in strong volume results for PM USA. Reported cigarette shipment volume for the quarter was up 0.1%. After adjusting for trade inventory changes and other factors, PM USA estimates that its cigarette volume was unchanged in the third quarter. For the year-to-date, reported cigarette shipment volume grew 1.5%, and PM USA estimates that its adjusted cigarette volume increased approximately 0.5% versus the year-ago period.
In line with strategy, Marlboro gained 1/10 of retail share in the third quarter and 2/10 for the year-to-date. So our investments in the Marlboro architecture continue to pay off. And by all key measures, OCI, margin, price realization, volume and share, our smokeable segment is performing very well.
Turning to the smokeless products segment. USSTC delivered income growth and combined retail share growth on Copenhagen and Skoal. The smokeless products segment grew adjusted OCI 2.5% in the third quarter and almost 4% for the first 9 months, primarily through higher pricing, partially offset by higher promotional investments and SG&A expenses. The iconic Copenhagen brand remain the fastest-growing brand in the category with 8/10 of retail share growth for the first 9 months of 2015 and thanks to investments in Skoal's equity and overall value equation, the brand's retail share declines continue to moderate. Our objective remains to seek combined share momentum on these 2 brands in this competitive category.
The wine business continued its strong performance. Ste. Michelle grew OCI almost 13% in the third quarter and nearly 20% for the year-to-date, primarily through increased volume and improved premium mix.
In innovative tobacco products, Nu Mark continues pursuing disciplined innovation in e-vapor. We've seen encouraging trial on MarkTen XL, allowing us to expand our lead market presence. Nu Mark also continues its in-store evaluation of Green Smoke's retail positioning. We focused first on getting the product right, and we're learning a great deal about the adult tobacco consumer response. We're optimistic about these brands as we move forward.
And of course, Altria continued to return cash to shareholders. We paid approximately $3 billion in dividends in the first 9 months of 2015. Additionally, we raised our quarterly dividend by 8.7% in August to an annualized rate of $2.26 per share, marking our 49th dividend increase in 46 years. We remain focused on our target dividend payout ratio of 80% of adjusted diluted EPS.
So our year-to-date results have been very strong, and we're happy with our progress against our full year plans. Thus, we reaffirm that we expect to deliver adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $2.76 to $2.81, representing growth of 7.5% to 9.5% from our 2014 adjusted diluted EPS base of $2.57. This guidance reflects expected moderated EPS results in the fourth quarter as compared to last year due to several factors we've discussed previously, including lapping the benefit from the expiration of federal tobacco quota buyout payments, lapping some of the effects of a stronger economy and lower gasoline prices and a higher effective tax rate on operations. Additionally, trade inventories for cigarettes may moderate moving -- going forward and unfavorable foreign currency translation could affect prior year comparisons of earnings from Altria's equity investment in SABMiller.
Finally, let us provide you with a word on the proposed AB InBev combination with SABMiller. We know there is a great deal of interest in this transaction and we look forward to providing the details for us at the appropriate time. But as I hope you can appreciate, we have to wait until final terms have been reached before doing so. But until then, here's a brief update and some background on this transaction.
Earlier this month, AB InBev and SABMiller announced an agreement in principle on key terms regarding a possible transaction between the 2 companies. Yesterday, AB InBev and SABMiller jointly announced that the U.K. Takeover Panel has extended the relevant deadline until November 4, 2015. We're pleased to see this transaction moving forward, and that the parties are reporting progress has been made, including AB InBev's completion of confirmatory due diligence of SABMiller, reconfirming the financial and other terms of the possible offer and confirming the availability of financing facilities. The extension gives AB InBev and SABMiller additional time to finalize the details necessary for AB InBev to announce a firm intention to make an offer for SABMiller.
As you know, Altria has been a shareholder of SABMiller since 2002, indeed its largest shareholder. The SABMiller stake has provided us with access to the global brewing profit pool, diversified our business, contributed nicely to our long-term earnings growth and strengthened our balance sheet. Of course, the approach we have always taken is to manage that asset for the best interest of Altria's shareholders.
We believe that combining the largely complementary businesses of SAB and AB InBev to create the world's largest brewer is a compelling opportunity. So we're excited about the proposed transaction and are working constructively with the parties to complete the transaction.
And with that, I'll turn things over to Billy."

As Marty mentioned, stronger volume in the smokeable products segment helped deliver double-digit adjusted OCI growth for the first 9 months. When adjusted for trade inventory changes and other factors, PM USA estimates that industry cigarette volume was down 1% in the third quarter and 0.5% for the first 9 months. In addition to retail share gains on Marlboro, L&M also gained share, allowing PM USA's total retail share to hit 51.3% for both the quarter and the first 9 months. This represents an increase of 0.4 of a retail share point and 0.5 a retail share point, respectively from the year-ago periods. Cigar volume growth also contributed to the smokeable products segment's results. Middleton's reported shipment volume increased just over 1% in the third quarter and nearly 4% for the first 9 months. And contributions from Black & Mild Jazz and Casino helped Black & Mild grow its leading position in the high-margin cigar segment. In fact, Black & Mild Casino was recently recognized by CSP Magazine as the 2015 retailer's choice best new product in the cigar category. 
In total, the smokeable products segment increased adjusted OCI margins by 2.7 points in the third quarter to 47%. For the year-to-date, adjusted OCI margins in the smokeable products segment expanded 2.8 points.
In the smokeless products segment, USSTC reported shipments increased approximately 1% in the third quarter and 2% for the first 9 months. We estimate that smokeless industry volume has grown approximately 2.5% over the past 6 months.
In both the third quarter and for the first 9 months, Copenhagen and Skoal grew their retail share on a combined basis. In the third quarter, higher pricing was partially offset by higher promotional investments and SG&A expenses, resulting in adjusted OCI margins contracting 1.1 percentage points to 63.8%. For the year-to-date, adjusted OCI margins narrowed 0.1 percentage points to 64.5%.
In the wine segment, reported shipment volumes have remained robust, growing at nearly 9% in the third quarter and over 6% for the first 9 months. OCI margins expanded 0.8 percentage points to 21.7% in the third quarter, and over 2 points to 21.7% for the year-to-date. 
Additionally, Altria recorded -- reported equity earnings from our SABMiller investment of $187 million in the third quarter and $546 million for the year-to-date. And finally, you'll remember that we completed our $1 billion share repurchase program early in the third quarter, and that our board authorized a new $1 billion program, which we expect to complete by the end of 2016. 
That wraps up our results. Marty and I will now take your questions. While the calls are being compiled, I'll direct your attention to altria.com. Along with today's earnings release, for your reference, we posted a list of quarterly metrics to include pricing, inventory and other items.

And it will be retailed a couple of weeks after that, so you'll be seeing there. And on the digital side, we continue to see strong innovation as well. We now have mobile couponing.

That's now available nationally. And we have launched the Marlboro app. It's available on the 2 large app platforms. It's responsibly done, age-verified and it will be a place for the brand to connect again with adult smokers in a very innovative way in the digital space.

And of course, the category volume has picked back up again. We estimate about 2.5%. And actually, you see Copenhagen and Skoal combined doing a little bit better than that at about 2.9%. Copenhagen is growing. You're right. And Skoal doesn't grow share, but I would point out that I think we've begun to moderate the share. If you look at it sequentially, it's at 19.8%, I think, if you look at the year-to-date number, Bonnie. And boy, I tell you, we're glad to have 20 share points of Skoal business in this category that has 65% operating margins. So Skoal can always work harder. It's got to compete with both Copenhagen and its principal competitor. But we're pretty pleased. I think they're having a solid performance over there. Maybe Billy could comment on your cost question."

Our focus is on premium. 90% of those shipments for PM USA are premium. But L&M has a role to play and what it does is it competes nicely in the discount space without growing it. The industry, as a whole, is moving more towards premium. And so what you see is that L&M is basically consolidating share out of the other discount players, so it works spot-on strategy for PM USA.

One being that MarkTen XL is expanding beyond categories. Does that mean it's going national? Will we see this across the country or does it -- is it just a slow methodical build from here? And maybe related to that then, how your promotional tactic has changed in the category just given the category has slowed, and we're lapping the initial launch of the product last year? Are you changing your promotional tactic now and maybe focusing more so on profitability than on pure trial of the product?"

We were in lead markets, as you know, and then we've had a terrific consumer response there. So what we're going to do is with discipline, we're going to roll it out in some additional lead markets through select accounts and learn more and try to get wider awareness and distribution of MarkTen XL. We're very encouraged about the consumer response to MarkTen, so we'll do that in a disciplined way. I would say in promotions, it's the same thing. We have to get the product right. You have to listen to the consumer. You want to build awareness and trial. But you certainly don't want to overspend, particularly I might note in a category where the growth has slowed. So we'll be very disciplined about how we do that, but it's a place where we want to play. Our aspiration is ultimately for leadership. But this is emerging -- an emerging product category. We want to do it with a lot of financial discipline."
