But it was also a building year. As we entered 2014, we were well aware of the obstacles that we faced in terms of growing comparable sales and margins amid ongoing broad-based challenges and cost pressures throughout our P&L. 
Now while some of the challenges were anticipated, others were not like the supplier issue in Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa and the volatile operating environment in Russia and Ukraine. And we experienced shortfalls enough internal plans, particularly in key markets such as the U.S. 
In response to these shortfalls, we took a number of important steps to lay the foundation for our turnaround. We're acting with a sense of urgency as these steps are critical to addressing current performance and to advancing our longer-term strategies.
Specifically, we renewed our focus on our customers with the evolution of our strategic plan. We brought in new talent in several major markets around the world to provide innovative thinking and fresh perspectives. We announced the changes that we're making to the U.S. organization to put decision-making and accountability closer to the customer. We redefined menu choice and personalization with the introduction of the Create Your Taste platform in Australia and the U.S. We focused on the service experience through an increased emphasis on operations excellence and the initiation of our global digital strategy. And we did more to bolster trust in brand McDonald's because we know that when our customers feel good about us and about eating at McDonald's, they visit us more often.
Now let's turn to 2014 results. In constant currencies, operating income was down 15% for the fourth quarter and 8% for the year. Earnings per share was down 14% for the quarter and 11% for the full year, both in constant currencies. Excluding the impact of the higher tax rate and the supplier issue in APMEA, earnings per share for the year would have been down 1% in constant currencies.
For the full year, global system-wide sales grew 1% in constant currencies, and global comparable sales were down 1%. Comparable sales were down 90 basis points for the quarter. Looking to January, comparable sales are expected to be negative due in part to the shifting Chinese New Year and consumer perception issues in Japan.
The changes we're making are designed to refocus our system to those areas that matter most to our customers today and for the future. And that starts with deepening our relationship with customers to increase relevance, drive traffic and position McDonald's for longer-term growth. Our actions are guided by our 4 strategic growth priorities, which are broadening up the markets and adapt and focus on those elements most relevant to the local customer bases.
Beyond our existing menu, we're asserting McDonald's brand leadership they offer greater customization and choice. Not only does this Create Your Taste menus that excites consumers, it has the potential to lift sales of core classics by bringing more customers into our restaurants. At same time, we're strengthening the menu pipeline to create greater at the local level that reflect attributes like taste preferences and demographics and those things that make each market unique. Greater localization enables us to take advantage of both attributes and tailor our menu and our marketing efforts to strengthen our relevance and appeal to customers in those regions. 
You'll also see changes in our customer service models as we work to create more memorable experiences and to deliver unparalleled convenience.  For example, multiple order point strategies include self-order kiosks, table service or mobile ordering and payment will modernize how customers interact with our brand and quite simply, make it easier to give McDonald's their way whatever that might be. 
We're also strengthening the value proposition. We're strategically evaluating pricing relationships across the entry level, core and premium tiers of our menu. At the same time, we're thinking differently about how to encourage customers to bundle products and use add-on purchases to create a satisfying, affordable meal.
You'll also see a shift in the way we engage our customers and consumers in general. We're being bold and direct as we talk about what matters most to customers, especially the quality of our menu ingredients with multifaceted efforts like our Your Questions in markets including the U.S, Canada and Australia. Collectively, these changes create the McDonald's Experience of the Future, which brings the work that's happening within each strategic priority together to deliver changes our customers will notice. It builds on investments we've already made and technology, re-imaging our restaurants and our operations improvement, with an increased emphasis on tangible customer centric innovations for menu and service to profitably grow the business.
We have enduring competitive advantages that have served us well over time, and those advantages are even more relevant today. Our size and geographically diversified restaurant portfolio allow us to test new products and concepts at a local level and then, broadly scale those that are successful, like we've done with the past of beverages and like we're currently doing with Create Your Taste.  McDonald's operates as one single brand, allowing us the focus our energy and resources on evolving the customer experience and changing the way we engage with consumers, while also leveraging the equity inherent in our iconic core products. Our global infrastructure enables us to tap into a variety of perspectives and expertise. Our franchisees are an integral part of the communities in which we do business. Suppliers bring innovation and the discipline that company employees focused on strategic direction to complement day-to-day execution in our restaurants. And, finally, our strong financial foundation, which is supported by industry-leading average unit volumes, it enables us to pursue our global growth priorities in every type of operating environment while returning significant amount of cash to shareholders each year.
Now on our July call, we outlined the steps required over a 12- to 18-month period to strengthen our foundation and enhance our relevance and appeal to customers. Having reached the 6-month mark, we're beginning to see signs of progress in some of our priority markets. While specifics vary across the market, the underlying formula has been very consistent. In 2014, these markets brought in fresh leadership with new perspective on how to get customers back in the restaurants. The strengthen franchisee alignment in those relationships and reemphasized value and renergize our marketing approaches. 
We're already seeing a shift in Australia, which has over 900 restaurants. It started with fundamental improvements in our marketing efforts and across our entire menu, and it was enabled by much stronger alignment with our franchisees. We're building on this strong foundation with plans to roll Create Your Taste across the majority of our restaurants by the end of this year. It's the first of our priority markets to demonstrate signs of recovery, with positive comparable sales and guest counts since September.
It will take longer to see an uptick in the U.S, which has more than 14,000 restaurants across 22 different regions. The changes we announced last year to create a flatter, more nimble organization have opened the door for decisions to be made closer to the customer. Mike Andres is on the call today, and he can share more during the Q&A about the work that's being done to take shape around our menu, marketing and service, which will enhance our relevance and appeal to customers.
Now over to Germany. Negative trends are beginning to moderate, with the month of December marking the highest comparable sales performance in more than 2 years. While we expect an uneven recovery as market dynamics remain challenging in the near term, we are focused on driving sales and guest counts by strengthening value offers, highlighting the quality of both core and premium product in our marketing messages and aggressively pursuing growth opportunities within the family and breakfast businesses.
  Our position in Australia, the U.S. and Germany is much like what the U.K. experienced in the early 2000s. We can and will turn around these markets with a balanced approach. 
Russia and China are also key markets that are in a recovery mode. While the specific tactics are different, both markets are focused on enhancing our brand image and winning customers back by emphasizing food quality and also celebrating the many reasons to choose McDonald's, such as convenience and affordability.  Fourth quarter comparable sales in China were negative 6.7% due to the lingering impact of the supplier issue. Each month of the quarter showed sequential improvement, reflecting the positive impact of our ongoing customer recovery efforts and the market.
Finally, in Japan, the team continues to work to overcome significant challenges. The market is executing a multifaceted brand recovery campaign, which is designed to rebuild the brand trust and strengthen quality and affordability perceptions. While we know these actions will win back customers, history tells us that these efforts would take time to resonate, so we expect continued volatility in the market through most of 2015. 
2015 will be a year of regaining momentum globally. We expect further growth amid the pockets of success we're already seeing. However, it will take time, especially in our larger markets, for customers to the comprehensive changes that are underway. So our internal projections assume continued sales and earnings pressure and volatility in the business, particularly in the first half of the year.
In light of continuing headwinds, we made thoughtful adjustments to our 2015 plans, pulling back in some areas to fund key growth initiatives focused on delivering greater customer relevance, broader consumer for each and better restaurant execution. For example, we've reduced capital expenditures by paring back our new store openings in markets that are experiencing significant near-term challenges including China, Russia, Germany and the United States. And we're redirecting G&A from the U.S. business and corporate to priority initiatives that will drive our growth. We're committed to committing necessary actions to improve performance and position McDonald's for enduring, profitable growth into the future.
As we embark on a new year, we maintain high expectations of our sales and for our brand. I remain confident in our prospects, both in the near and long term. We're keenly focused on the opportunities that exists within our global growth priorities to serve our customers' favorite food and drink, to create memorable experiences, to offer unparalleled convenience and to become an even more trusted brand. We're changing, and we're doing it aggressively. We know that some tactics will be different from market to market and region to region around the world. And that's why our plans are supported by comprehensive and localized execution approaches that rely on our franchisees, our company employees and suppliers to satisfy customer expectations and drive stronger business results.
Thanks again for being on the call, everyone, and I'll now turn it over to Pete."

Our results were impacted on a variety of fronts and across each of our geographic segments. Today I'd like to spend a few minutes putting our 2014 performance",1730,"Thanks, Don, and hi, everyone. 2014 was a challenging year for McDonald's all around the world. Our results were impacted on a variety of fronts and across each of our geographic segments. Today I'd like to spend a few minutes putting our 2014 performance into perspective, providing details on some key fourth quarter numbers and outlining the critical components of our 2015 financial plan.  I'll begin by reviewing our results for the quarter and full year, highlighting the 3 factors that had a notable impact on performance in each of our major geographic segments. 
First is the underperformance of our U.S. business. For 2014, our results reflect the impact of ongoing broad-based challenges, including operating in an increasingly competitive marketplace amid sluggish industry growth. For the year, the segment's operating income declined $257 million or 7%, partly due to negative comparable sales and guest counts for the year, which contributed to margin declines. U.S. results were also impacted by higher G&A spending and other operating expenses associated with positioning the U.S. business for the future, including the segment's events marketing approach and development of the new brand love campaign. We expect to incur additional U.S. restructuring costs in the first quarter.
The second significant item that affected our global results was the APMEA supplier issue. The total impact from lost sales and expenses associated with our customer recovery efforts was approximately $110 million or $0.09 per share for the quarter and $290 million or $0.23 per share for the full year. The markets most affected by this issue China, Japan and Hong Kong.  Prior to the supplier issue, these markets collectively represented about 10% of global system-wide sales and 5% of global operating income.  
In APMEA, our results were also pressured by ongoing performance issues in Japan.  For the full year, APMEA's operating income declined 28% or 25% in constant currencies, $413 million. Japan's contribution to APMEA's operating income includes royalties and the company's share of McDonald's Japan after-tax results.
A third significant impact on McDonald's global results for 2014 in Russia and the Ukraine. During 2014, McDonald's Europe experienced significant declines significant declines in company-operated margins, driven by weakening currencies and economic slowdown and store closures in these 2 markets. 
For the year, Europe reported a $90 million decrease in operating income, a 2% decline in constant currencies with the segment's company-operated margins weighing heavily on results. The entire operating income decline for the year was solely driven by Russia and the the Ukraine company-operated margin results. Over half of this margin decline reflects the significant impact of weakening currencies company on imported commodity costs in these 2 markets.  We expect this currency impact to significantly pressure the segment's company-operated margins again in 2015, especially in the first half.
While we expect to move beyond some of these unique events of last year, certain challenges remain. In the U.S, our turnaround initiatives to reignite momentum are in progress. Mike Andres and the U.S. leadership team are implementing a new, more nimble enabled organizational structure that places decision-making back in the hands of the local market teams. The U.S. business is working aggressively to implement these changes, but it will take time before we see the benefits in the segment's overall financial results. campaign. 
In Russia, while all of our restaurants impacted by the temporary closures are back in operation, the market remains in a recession and economic outlook is weak. More broadly, consumer confidence across most of Europe is forecasted to remain low throughout 2015.
In APMEA, in response to the supplier issue, customer recovery efforts initiated in September in each of our impacted markets. While sales trends in China showed signs of improvement during the fourth quarter, our best estimate is that it will take at least 3 to 6 more months for our business in China to return to a normalized level.
For McDonald's Japan, recovery from the supplier issue has not has not been as strong. At the same time, new customer perception issues have emerged, which have further depressed sales and profitability. We expect these issues to impact results for the foreseeable future. Japan remains on our priority markets list.
Next, I want to provide a 2014 update and a 2015 preview for some of our key financial items: commodities, pricing, G&A and currencies. I'll start with commodity costs for the U.S. and Europe. For the fourth quarter, U.S. commodity costs rose approximately 3.5%, primarily due to higher beef prices. For the full year, commodity costs added up about 3%, which was the upper end of our forecast as reductions in other commodities were more than offset by increases in beef. Commodity costs pressure is expected to continue into 2015 with a full year increase projected at 1.5% to 2.5%, again, driven primarily by beef. Excluding currency, Europe's commodity costs were up 1% for the fourth quarter and were relatively flat for the full year.  For 2015, our full year outlook is for Europe's grocery basket to also reflect an increase of 1.5% to 2.5%.
Now to offset this pressure, we have taken some price increases. The U.S. ended 2014 with pricing up roughly 1.8%, notably lower than the 2013 increase of about 3% and lower than food-away-from-home inflation, which ended the year at 3%. During the second half of the year, we consciously did not completely offset the prior year price increases that rolled off. This further pressured our margins during the third and fourth quarters. And based on where we stand at the start of 2015, we expect this pressure to continue in the near term.  Our price increases in Europe varied by market with the overall segment, excluding Russia, averaging about 2% year-over-year.
Consolidated G&A increased 9% in constant currencies for the fourth quarter and 5% in constant currencies for the year. For the quarter, these increases were driven largely by costs associated with positioning our U.S. business for the future as well as costs related to our long-term growth initiatives. As I've mentioned in October, during 2014, we identified $100 million of G&A savings in the U.S. and corporate. The savings are being redirected toward our critical long-term growth initiatives in 2015.  Our review of the corporate G&A spending was completed in December. We are nearing the completion of our full G&A review of the U.S. and will provide more details on these efforts later this quarter. 
While our G&A increased for both periods in 2014, I want to emphasize an important point. McDonald's operates in a pay-for-performance culture. As such, short-term incentive payouts for 2014 were 0 for all corporate and U.S. employees. In addition, 2014 performance negatively impacted all management long-term incentive compensation. We expect 2015 G&A to increase 7% to 8% in constant currencies, primarily due to the restoration of incentive pay. Excluding incremental incentive-based compensation, 2015 G&A is expected to increase 1% to 2%. More than 100% of this remaining increase relates to costs associated with the expansion of our strategic growth initiatives, including Experience of the Future and our digital strategy.
Foreign currencies proved to be another headwind in 2014, with translation negatively impacting fourth quarter EPS by $0.08 and full year EPS by $0.12. Given the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar against virtually all major foreign currencies, we expect a negative translation on first quarter 2015 of $0.08 to $0.10 per share and a full year impact of $0.35 to $0.40 per share. As usual, take this as directional guidance only because rates will change as we move throughout the year.
Finally, I'd like to share our current capital expenditure and restaurant opening plans for the upcoming year. Our plan for 2015 capital expenditure budget is approximately $2 billion, nearly $1 billion less than our initial capital expenditure plan last year. The decrease in our 2015 capital expenditures is driven primarily by an $800 million decrease in capital allocated to new restaurant openings. The most notable reductions will take place in markets experiencing the greatest challenges: China, Russia, Germany and the U.S.
Our $2 billion capital budget is divided relatively evenly, with approximately 1/2 earmarked for new restaurant openings and the remaining $1 billion dedicated to the investments. We continue to rigorously screen new restaurant opportunities to determine where they will generate the most attractive returns, given each market's potential and competitive environment and current industry dynamics.  In 2015, we do expect to open more than 1,000 McDonald's restaurants, primarily in China, the U.S., Russia and France. This compares with about 1,300 restaurant openings in 2014. On a net basis, we expect 600 to 700 additions for the year compared with approximately 800 in 2014.  
The majority of our reinvestment dollars are slated for the U.S. and Europe. Expansion of the Create Your Taste burger platform in up 2,000 restaurants in the U.S. and continued rollout of Experience of the Future in Europe accounts for majority of the reinvestment dollars. 
Earlier this year, we outlined plans to pursue additional opportunities to enhance shareholder value for the by optimizing our capital and ownership structures and scrutinizing our G&A spending. As we close out the first year of our 3-year plan, I'd like to update you on our progress.
During 2014, we re-franchised over 400 restaurants against our 3-year target of at least 1,500. In the area of G&A, we identified and redirected nearly $100 million in savings for 2015 for our future long-term growth initiatives such as the digital strategy and the McDonald's Experience of the Future. And as always, we continue to explore additional savings opportunities.
As we move into 2015, we remain on track to deliver against our 3-year target to return $18 billion to $20 billion to shareholders between 2014 and 2016 in the form of dividends and share repurchases, having returned $6.4 billion to shareholders last year.
We're moving forward aggressively to regain business momentum. Together, our strategy, strength and structure provide the capability and opportunity for us to change the trajectory of the business and our financial performance. We're on the right path. We've made tough decisions, are holding ourselves to rigorous standards of performance and are doing more with less. As a system, our charge over the coming years to accelerate the pace of change and elevate the overall McDonald's experience in the eyes of our customers. 
Thanks. Now I'll turn it over to Chris to begin the Q&A."

And the, the related question, I guess, is on Create Your Taste. I think when we visited the restaurant with you, your in December, that was the sixth restaurant with Create Your Taste.

I'm going to respond a little bit to the Create Your Taste piece. And then, I'm going to ask Mike to speak a little bit to some of those initiatives and actions that are actually in the near term, because I think that was really your question. Relative to Create Your Taste, please keep this in mind. We have been modeling out looking at Create Your Taste, Build Your Burger now for over 3 years. We started this in the Innovation Center. We moved it to test restaurant in Romeoville. As you know, Joe, when we look at something, we look at all aspects of the implementation from not only the production side, the service side to crew interactions to consumer relevance. And so we've been doing quite a bit in the prior years. Then we've had this in a restaurant in test in California area in the SoCal area. We added it in test for about another year plus. Also keep in mind we've had similar initiatives in markets outside of the U.S, markets like France on the service side of this. We've been looking at some of the digital application pieces of this in markets like Sweden. So these, all of these things have come together into what we today call Create Your Taste. So as we move forward now, this is not about just having had one restaurant. This is about having 3-plus, 4-odd years of looking at a concept and various pieces of that concept coming together. Create Your Taste is not just about the food from a customization or personalization perspective. It's also about the digital engagement in the direction of customers by kiosk or mobile ordering. It's also about a change relative to the interaction with our restaurant employees and how they engage and embrace the customers. It's also about the physical changes within the restaurant as well as how we present our food, so that you can understand the freshness of the produce the quality of our proteins. So this is a much broader piece then simply about the food itself. It is about the overall experience. So hopefully, that answers that question. I'll ask Mike to speak a little bit through some of the things taking place in the U.S. because there are quite a few relative to the near term."

In the near term, this is a market share gain. It's always going to be a market share gain. So we are -- we trust and we expect to see our more customized approach from our Owner/Operators. And in terms of a owner/operator driven business plan, locally, it's based on the customer insights in the unique competitive set in the marketplace. And these plans are going to be multilayered in nature. You'll see disruptive value. You'll see new product news. You'll see service initiatives. And then, our regional management and our new structure is empowered to commit the resources to make these plans come to life. I don't think it can be underestimated the power of ownership by Owner/Operators of their own plans, execute on it and get results that we expect to get from those marketplaces. We're also looking at our marketing approach and making sure that we're leveraging the power of kind of the 3 layers of marketing. Clearly, we've got our local co-ops. We've got our national, and we also have local store marketing. And we're looking at a revamped marketing approach that coordinate specific roles and the deliverables of our co-op marketing plans, using more sophisticated analytics and data to understand the best way to approach. Certainly, our national messaging comes on top of it to help build our brand. We have unique relationship with our customers. And recent advertising is rekindling that relationship in a way that we've been used over the years and we've enjoyed. And then, the local market aspect of it is that we -- it has been our heritage, Owner/Operators and McDonald's being the hub of their local communities, very important to our turnaround plan as well as the local marketing store, the things they're doing to combat the guy across the street from them. That's kind of the key to that. Then we're looking at how we address this is the simplicity or the complexity, I should say, of our menu. We've simplified our menu. As we've talked about last month, that's going into place as a matter of fact, this week. It this includes production in the EVMs, other menu items. Our test market results, which included faster order times, faster total times in the drive-thru, continue to see performance above the controls. So no single initiative is going to drive improvements, but it's all of these working together and things that will create a differentiated customer experience that our customers will notice. So we're looking at the U.S. as 22 different regions. As you know, there's multiple markets within those regions. We're already seeing some pockets of success and expect those pockets of success to grow. And then, thirdly, after the short term, we're looking the longer term refining our plans to plans to make a branded changes that create an enhanced experience for customers and continue to differentiate McDonald's from the other QSRs. So Don talked about CYT. You asked about it. That is only one element of this refined experience. It is comprehensive in nature. We are calling it the Experience of the Future. We're co-creating this with our Owner/Operators. And we will present plan to all of our Owner/Operators at a national meeting in March. And Right after that, we'll start aggressively expanding that up into 2,000 stores in 2015."

And even if the commodity outlook into '15 is fairly muted, we are starting to see, sort of on a more macro level, some of QSR wages re-inflating. Is that something you're also seeing in your system? And assuming that is a factor in 2015, how should we think about on the company's philosophy accepting that pressure versus passing it on? And then, and then, on the franchise side, really, their ability to affect that pressure versus need to pass it on?"

As we've talked a lot over these last couple of years, markets are such a top line game for us. So very critical in the market area that the plans and initiatives that Mike talked about, especially the U.S, start to gain momentum and get that traction back on the top line. Having said that, we are in a relatively low inflation environment. So pricing, as I noted in my commentary, pricing will still be probably below our average, if you assume the low inflationary environment continues. At the same time, multiple states are increasing minimum wages. We've got national health care impacting 2015 for the first time. That's going to hit the McOpCo margin for about 20 basis points. So I think the margin in the U.S. will continue to be a little bit pressured by the combination of less price flexibility and a few of these costs. But long term, as the sales get back on track and start to grow, that is what will allow us to start to see the margin leverage. And the same kind of the dynamics are impacting franchisees' restaurants as well. As to grow guest counts and cash flow, they will start offset some of these pressures."

Some of the positives are in 2015, we'll see -- if you look globally around the system first, you'll see some good growth. There's parts of Europe where we'll see a little bit of IEO. I.e. Germany will see a bit projected in '15, the U.K. will see a bit. France is a more difficult market. Francis actually projected to have some IEO decline. We have been gaining market share in both France and the U.K., despite some of the difficult broader business or macroenvironment. Germany, we lost some share, and we talked about Germany as a priority market. What I will tell you is that as a priority market, there were a number of changes that Germany has implemented, some of those I spoke to relative to the actual team that we have there, our marketing leadership there. Actually, our agency, we changed out the agency Germany. We're seeing a collaboration with the franchisees that is much stronger. So we're making some positive moves in our marketing plans, our menu plans and we're seeing some changes relative to how we're addressing the consumer in those markets. So I'm feeling as if -- I mentioned Germany have a -- seems to be we're seeing some recovery in Germany. We're conscious as we see it because they are some challenges across Europe, as we all know right now, relative to the euro itself. But we are seeing some positive things there. What I would tell you is broadly economic in many of the markets, with the exception of Germany, where we have some things to do in terms of our own internal plan. But for many of the other markets, we're gaining share or we're at a point where our businesses are continuing to compete on par with our competition there. There.

We said at least 1,500 restaurants, and we feel comfortable in being able to accomplish that over the next 3 years. I'll tell you, the dialogue with the presidents has increased around re-franchising and the benefits that, that can bring to the overall business. So we're not committing to a new target by any means. But we also said that after that 3-year period, franchising will continue to be something that we look at and go after. So 100% will never be, but certainly the ability to continue to increase that franchise percentage over time is something that we will look at. On the G&A side, I think we've been fairly consistent since we announced our plans for the savings that we believe there are significant growth opportunities available in this McDonald's Experience of the Future. And in fact, as we first started talking about it, we've gotten a little bit more aggressive in our plans to go after that in 2015. So for the short term, you've heard us say we don't think we can cut our way to growth in the G&A area, and we recognize these are fairly significant amount of resources we're reinvesting. But we believe that it's right for the long-term benefit of the business, as Mike said, to kind of change the customer experience in the McDonald's restaurants.

So we have made substantial investments there. Our focus now is to focus on that in-restaurant experience of our existing base. So we can improve upon that, whether that's digital engagement, the physical assets themselves, the way the restaurants look, the placement of kiosks in the restaurants, our food offerings in the restaurants, that is where we're making substantial investments. This is not that much different than when we decided we were to focus on McCafé at one point, pull back some of the new store capital at that time and reinvest it back into existing restaurants. So we're doing something very similar as we look at the digital strategies, the in-restaurant experience and the Create Your Taste and food experiences in the restaurant. So as we look at this, we will continue to look at our expenditures, both internally and externally.

And I guess -- and then, the second question I wanted to ask was a follow-up on the -- when you and you're talking about the quality, halo and the provenance. When I look at a competitive set, what I would call traditional QSRs, there are some that are doing quite well without any of that with I think just sort of a core competency around speed and service. Mike, maybe you can talk about diagnosing that, why some of your very direct competitors seem to be doing well even in the absence of -- sitting in with some of these trends about quality and provenance and sort of the fast casual direction?"

On the first part, relative to Create Your Taste in different dynamics, or better yet, yes, Experience of the Future in different dynamics. Because what France is doing is not an implementation of Create Your Taste at this point. They have implemented multiple order points. And you can place an order in that web ordering, et cetera, mobile ordering. And when you look at the table service in France, yes, there is the strongest to in-store versus drive-thru. However, I will tell you this. What we do is look at things like we will tailor those based upon the market that we're implementing in. So we already noted in the U.S., with the restaurants that are implementing Create Your Taste, that we've seen very positive results. Therefore, what we're doing is pulling customers who have a little bit more time and want to experience the restaurant inside to come inside the restaurant. We've made tremendous investments in terms of reimaging. And actually, we have customers that are seeing those investments in this environment and with the offering of Create Your Taste. So these will be -- they will be modeled for the various markets around the world based upon what is going to go to customers the most. France will not be implementing Create Your Taste at the same pace that say, Australia has. Australia is additive point with regard to, say, web ordering than France has been. So we'll take -- we'll learn from all of those things as we bring those forward. But, nonetheless, Create Your Taste, table service in France, kiosk applications across Europe, all of those things have been successful for us. And really, the Experience of the Future aspect pulls them all together. And so you're going to see some variations across markets but clearly, we'll look into the performance metrics to make sure we're moving more effectively. This is not unlike, again, McCafé was very different in Australia than it is the way U.S, yet still McCafé has for them for them both. On the other side relative positional QSRs, I would offer this. No one is really shining that pretty relative to the traditional QSRs base. I think what we're talking about at McDonald's is appealing more to the consumers that are out there that are ideal customers. So it's not about a QSR thing or a fast casual thing. It's about good tasting food, high-yield it's about affordability, it is about transparency as event, it's about a great service experience that gives them choice. Those are the things that we're putting in place and those are the things that will help us propel this business and move the move it forward. So we're not gauging ourselves my other QSRs, if you would. We're gauging ourselves by the market opportunity, and we want to do that. It's -- I would also tell you that as we look forward at the markets around the world, each of those markets, as we said today, is very different and at different places. So they will be able to bring the Experience of the Future to life in their markets relative to their customer bases. But we are not skipping over the existing execution of the core products that we have, the core menu that we have, core service expectations, quality service cleanliness, those things are important in every single market around we have around the world today."

I have to tell you the last couple of years, years, as we see it, it's been difficult. But as a global system, all of our system has experienced quite a bit and endured many adjusting changes at the local markets. But at the same time, we began to implement a stronger pathway for future growth. I couldn't be more proud of the franchisees we have around the world. They own and operate 81% of our restaurants. And without them, we would not have been able to endure those things that we have over the last couple of years. Well the best geopolitical issues and food related issues, our franchisees come along with employees and suppliers, have done a tremendous job and it's that strip that's going to propel us forward. It's that I mentioned strength, if you but, that we don't often talk about when we talk about the financials but it's one of the things that has made McDonald's special and it's one of the things that will fuel our growth as we move forward. I want to thank all of you for joining us on the call today. 2015, as we said, will be a year from gaining momentum. We're making progress as we move even closer to our customers and as we change to be more relevant it more progressive. Modern service, hospitality, personal engagement, more relevant, customize menus and a brand that people can trust, truly trust. This is the McDonald's Experience of the Future. It is the fact that we're forging, and I will tell you that the future is already on its way. Our confidence in our brand and the competitive advantages and strength of our system are truly reflection of our ability to learn from our past which is also be purposeful and agile in the present and to strategically plan and evolve with changing customers perception, attitude and desires as we move into the future.

But it was also a building year. As we entered 2014, we were well aware of the obstacles that we faced in terms of growing comparable sales and margins amid ongoing broad-based challenges and cost pressures throughout our P&L. 
Now while some of the challenges were anticipated, others were not, like the supplier issue in Asia Pacific, Middle East and Africa, and the volatile operating environment in Russia and the Ukraine. And we experienced shortfalls in our internal plans, particularly in key markets such as the U.S. 
In response to these shortfalls, we took a number of important steps to lay the foundation for our turnaround. We're acting with a sense of urgency as these steps are critical to addressing current performance and to advancing our longer-term strategies.
Specifically, we renewed our focus on our customers with the evolution of our strategic plan. We brought in new talent in several major markets around the world to provide innovative thinking and fresh perspectives. We announced the changes that we're making to the U.S. organization to put decision-making and accountability closer to the customer. We redefined menu choice and personalization with the introduction of the Create Your Taste platform in Australia and the U.S. We focused on the service experience through an increased emphasis on operations excellence and the initiation of our global digital strategy. And we did more to bolster trust in brand McDonald's because we know that when our customers feel good about us and about eating at McDonald's, they visit us more often.
Now let's turn to 2014 results. In constant currencies, operating income was down 15% for the fourth quarter and 8% for the year. Earnings per share was down 14% for the quarter and 11% for the full year, both in constant currencies. Excluding the impact of the higher tax rate and the supplier issue in APMEA, earnings per share for the year would have been down 1% in constant currencies.
For the full year, global system-wide sales grew 1% in constant currencies, and global comparable sales were down 1%. Comparable sales were down 90 basis points for the quarter. Looking to January, comparable sales are expected to be negative due in part to the shifting Chinese New Year and consumer perception issues in Japan.
The changes we're making are designed to refocus our system on those areas that matter most to our customers today and for the future. And that starts with deepening our relationship with customers to increase relevance, drive traffic and position McDonald's for longer-term growth. Our actions are guided by our 4 strategic growth priorities, which are broad enough that markets adapt and focus on those elements most relevant to the local customer bases.
Beyond our existing menu, we're asserting McDonald's burger leadership by offering greater customization and choice. Not only does Create Your Taste provide new menu news that excites consumers, it has the potential to lift sales of core classics by bringing more customers into our restaurants. At the same time, we're strengthening the menu pipeline to create greater choice at the local level that reflect attributes like taste preferences and demographics and those things that make each market unique. Greater localization enables us to take advantage of both attributes and tailor our menu and our marketing efforts to strengthen our relevance and appeal to customers in those regions. 
You'll also see changes in our customer service models as we work to create more memorable experiences and to deliver unparalleled convenience. For example, multiple order point strategies include self-order kiosks, table service or mobile order and payment. We'll modernize how customers interact with our brand and quite simply, make it easier to get McDonald's their way, whatever that might be. 
We're also strengthening the value proposition. We're strategically evaluating pricing relationships across the entry level, core and premium tiers of our menu. At the same time, we're thinking differently about how to encourage customers to bundle products and use add-on purchases to create a satisfying, affordable meal.
You'll also see a shift in the way we engage our customers and consumers in general. We're being bold and direct as we talk about what matters most to customers, especially the quality of our menu ingredients with multifaceted efforts like Our Food. Your Questions., in markets including the U.S., Canada and Australia. Collectively, these changes create the McDonald's Experience of the Future, which brings the work that's happening within each strategic priority together to deliver changes our customers will notice. It builds on the investments we've already made in technology, reimaging our restaurants and operations improvement, with an increased emphasis on tangible customer-centric innovations for menu and service to profitably grow the business.
We have enduring competitive advantages that have served us well over time and those advantages are even more relevant today. Our size and geographically diversified restaurant portfolio allow us to test new products and concepts at a local level and then, broadly scale those that are successful, like we've done with the past of beverages and like we're currently doing with Create Your Taste. McDonald's operates as one single brand, allowing us to focus our energy and resources on evolving the customer experience and changing the way we engage with consumers, while also leveraging the equity inherent in our iconic core products. Our global infrastructure enables us to tap into a variety of perspectives and expertise. Our franchisees are an integral part of the communities in which they do business. Suppliers bring innovation and their disciplines and company employees focused on strategic direction to complement day-to-day execution in our restaurants. And finally, our strong financial foundation, which is supported by industry-leading average unit volumes, it enables us to pursue our global growth priorities in every type of operating environment while returning significant amounts of cash to shareholders each year.
Now on our July call, we outlined the steps required over a 12 to 18-month period to strengthen our foundation and enhance our relevance and appeal to customers. Having reached the 6-month mark, we're beginning to see signs of progress in some of our priority markets. While specifics vary across the market, the underlying formula has been very consistent. In 2014, these markets brought in fresh leadership with new perspectives on how to get customers back in the restaurants. They strengthened franchisee alignment in those relationships and reemphasized value and reenergized our marketing approaches. 
We're already seeing a shift in Australia, which has over 900 restaurants. It started with fundamental improvements in our marketing efforts and across our entire menu, and it was enabled by much stronger alignment with our franchisees. We're building on this strong foundation with plans to roll Create Your Taste across the majority of our restaurants by the end of this year. It's the first of our priority markets to demonstrate signs of recovery, with positive comparable sales and guest counts since September.
It will take longer to see an uptick in the U.S., which has more than 14,000 restaurants across 22 different regions. The changes we announced last year to create a flatter, more nimble organization have opened the door for decisions to be made closer to the customer. Mike Andres is on the call today, and he can share more during the Q&A about the work that's being done to take shape around our menu, marketing and service, which will enhance our relevance and appeal to customers.
Now over to Germany. Negative trends are beginning to moderate, with the month of December marking the highest comparable sales performance in more than 2 years. While we expect an uneven recovery as market dynamics remain challenging in the near term, we are focused on driving sales and guest counts by strengthening value offers, highlighting the quality of both core and premium products in our marketing messages and aggressively pursuing growth opportunities within the family and breakfast businesses. Our position in Australia, the U.S. and Germany is much like what the U.K. experienced in the early 2000s. We can and we will turn around these markets with a balanced approach. 
Russia and China are also key markets that are in a recovery mode. While the specific tactics are different, both markets are focused on enhancing our brand image and winning customers back by emphasizing food quality and also celebrating the many reasons to choose McDonald's, such as convenience and affordability.  Fourth quarter comparable sales in China were negative 6.7% due to the lingering impact of the supplier issue. Each month of the quarter showed sequential improvement, reflecting the positive impact of our ongoing customer recovery efforts in the market.
Finally, in Japan, the team continues to work to overcome significant challenges. The market is executing a multifaceted brand recovery campaign, which is designed to rebuild brand trust and strengthen quality and affordability perceptions. While we know these actions will win back customers, history tells us that these efforts would take time to resonate, so we expect continued volatility in the market through most of 2015. 
2015 will be a year of regaining momentum globally. We expect further growth amid the pockets of success we're already seeing. However, it will take time, especially in our larger markets, for customers to notice the comprehensive changes that are underway. So our internal projections assume continued sales and earnings pressure and volatility in the business, particularly in the first half of the year.
In light of continuing headwinds, we made thoughtful adjustments to our 2015 plans, pulling back in some areas to fund key growth initiatives focused on delivering greater customer relevance, broader consumer reach and better restaurant execution. For example, we've reduced capital expenditures by paring back on new store openings in markets that are experiencing significant near-term challenges, including China, Russia, Germany and the United States. And we're redirecting G&A from the U.S. business and corporate to priority initiatives that will drive our growth. We're committed to taking necessary actions to improve performance and position McDonald's for enduring profitable growth into the future.
As we embark on a new year, we maintain high expectations of our sales and for our brand. I remain confident in our prospects, both in the near and long term. We're keenly focused on the opportunities that exists within our global growth priorities to serve our customers' favorite food and drink, to create memorable experiences, to offer unparalleled convenience and to become an even more trusted brand. We're changing, and we're doing it aggressively. We know that some tactics will be different from market to market and region to region around the world, and that's why our plans are supported by comprehensive and localized execution approaches that rely on our franchisees, our company employees and suppliers to satisfy customer expectations and drive stronger business results.
Thanks again for being on the call, everyone, and I'll now turn it over to Pete."

Our results were impacted on a variety of fronts and across each of our geographic segments.

Our results were impacted on a variety of fronts and across each of our geographic segments. Today, I'd like to spend a few minutes putting our 2014 performance into perspective, providing details on some key fourth quarter numbers and outlining the critical components of our 2015 financial plan. I'll begin by reviewing our results for the quarter and full year, highlighting the 3 factors that had a notable impact on performance in each of our major geographic segments. 
First is the underperformance of our U.S. business. Throughout 2014, our results reflect the impact of ongoing broad-based challenges, including operating in an increasingly competitive marketplace amid sluggish industry growth. For the year, the segment's operating income declined $257 million or 7%, partly due to negative comparable sales and guest counts, which contributed to margin declines. U.S. results were also impacted by higher G&A spending and other operating expenses associated with positioning the U.S. business for the future, including the segment's revamped marketing approach and development of the new brand love campaign. We expect to incur additional U.S. restructuring costs in the first quarter.
The second significant item that affected our global results was the APMEA supplier issue. The total impact from lost sales and expenses associated with our customer recovery efforts was approximately $110 million or $0.09 per share for the quarter and $290 million or $0.23 per share for the full year. The markets most affected by this issue include China, Japan and Hong Kong.  Prior to the supplier issue, these markets collectively represented about 10% of global system-wide sales and 5% of global operating income.  
In APMEA, our results were also pressured by ongoing performance issues in Japan. For the full year, APMEA's operating income declined 28% or 25% in constant currencies, $413 million. Japan's contribution to APMEA's operating income includes royalties and the company's share of McDonald's Japan after-tax results.
The third significant impact on McDonald's global results for 2014 was in Russia and the Ukraine. During 2014, McDonald's Europe experienced significant declines in company-operated margins, driven by weakening currencies and economic slowdown and store closures in these 2 markets. 
For the year, Europe reported a $90 million decrease in operating income, a 2% decline in constant currencies, with the segment's company-operated margins weighing heavily on results. The entire operating income decline for the year was solely driven by Russia and the Ukraine company-operated margin results. Over half of this margin decline reflects the significant impact of weakening currencies on imported commodity costs in these 2 markets. We expect this currency impact to significantly pressure the segment's company-operated margins again in 2015, especially in the first half.
While we expect to move beyond some of these unique events of last year, certain challenges remain. In the U.S, our turnaround initiatives to reignite momentum are in progress. Mike Andres and the U.S. leadership team are implementing a new, more nimble organizational structure that places decision-making back in the hands of the local market teams. The U.S. business is working aggressively to implement these changes, but it will take time before we see the benefits in the segment's overall financial results. 
In Russia, while all of our restaurants impacted by the temporary closures are back in operation, the market remains in a recession and the economic outlook is weak. More broadly, consumer confidence across most of Europe is forecasted to remain low throughout 2015.
In APMEA, in response to the supplier issue, customer recovery efforts initiated in September in each of our impacted markets. While sales trends in China showed signs of improvement during the fourth quarter, our best estimate is that it will take at least 3 to 6 more months for our business in China to return to a normalized level.
For McDonald's Japan, recovery from the supplier issue has not been as strong. At the same time, new customer perception issues have emerged, which have further depressed sales and profitability. We expect these issues to impact results for the foreseeable future. Japan remains on our priority market list.
Next, I want to provide a 2014 update and a 2015 preview for some of our key financial items: commodities, pricing, G&A and currencies. I'll start with commodity costs for the U.S. and Europe. For the fourth quarter, U.S. commodity costs rose approximately 3.5%, primarily due to higher beef prices. For the full year, commodity costs added up about 3%, which was the upper end of our forecast as reductions in other commodities were more than offset by increases in beef. Commodity costs pressure is expected to continue into 2015 with a full year increase projected at 1.5% to 2.5%, again, driven primarily by beef. Excluding currency, Europe's commodity costs were up 1% for the fourth quarter and were relatively flat for the full year. For 2015, our full year outlook is for Europe's grocery basket to also reflect an increase of 1.5% to 2.5%.
Now to offset this pressure, we have taken some price increases. The U.S. ended 2014 with pricing up roughly 1.8%, notably lower than the 2013 increase of about 3% and lower than food-away-from-home inflation, which ended the year at 3%. During the second half of the year, we consciously did not completely offset the prior year price increases that rolled off. This further pressured our margins during the third and fourth quarters. And based on where we stand at the start of 2015, we expect this pressure to continue in the near term. Our price increases in Europe varied by market with the overall segment, excluding Russia, averaging about 2% year-over-year.
Consolidated G&A increased 9% in constant currencies for the fourth quarter and 5% in constant currencies for the year. For the quarter, these increases were driven largely by costs associated with positioning our U.S. business for the future as well as costs related to our long-term growth initiatives. As I've mentioned in October, during 2014, we identified $100 million of G&A savings in the U.S. and corporate. These savings are being redirected toward our critical long-term growth initiatives in 2015. Our review of the corporate G&A spending was completed in December. We are nearing the completion of our full G&A review of the U.S. and will provide more details on these efforts later this quarter. 
While our G&A increased for both periods in 2014, I want to emphasize an important point. McDonald's operates in a pay-for-performance culture. As such, short-term incentive payouts for 2014 were 0 for all corporate and U.S. employees. In addition, 2014 performance negatively impacted management's long-term incentive compensation. We expect 2015 G&A to increase 7% to 8% in constant currencies, primarily due to the restoration of incentive pay. Excluding incremental incentive-based compensation, 2015 G&A is expected to increase 1% to 2%. More than 100% of this remaining increase relates to costs associated with the expansion of our strategic growth initiatives, including Experience of the Future and our digital strategy.
Foreign currencies proved to be another headwind in 2014, with translation negatively impacting fourth quarter EPS by $0.08 and full year EPS by $0.12. Given the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar against virtually all major foreign currencies, we expect a negative translation on first quarter 2015 of $0.08 to $0.10 per share and a full year impact of $0.35 to $0.40 per share. As usual, take this as directional guidance only because rates will change as we move throughout the year.
Finally, I'd like to share our current capital expenditure and restaurant opening plans for the upcoming year. Our plan for 2015 capital expenditure budget is approximately $2 billion, nearly $1 billion less than our initial capital expenditure plan last year. The decrease in our 2015 capital expenditures is driven primarily by an $800 million decrease in capital allocated to new restaurant openings. The most notable reductions will take place in markets experiencing the greatest challenges: China, Russia, Germany and the U.S.
Our $2 billion capital budget is divided relatively evenly, with approximately 1/2 earmarked for new restaurant openings and the remaining $1 billion dedicated to reinvestments. We continue to rigorously screen new restaurant opportunities to determine where they will generate the most attractive returns, given each market's potential, competitive environment and current industry dynamics. In 2015, we do expect to open more than 1,000 McDonald's restaurants, primarily in China, the U.S., Russia and France. This compares with about 1,300 restaurant openings in 2014. On a net basis, we expect 600 to 700 additions for the year compared with approximately 800 in 2014.  
The majority of our reinvestment dollars are slated for the U.S. and Europe. Expansion of the Create Your Taste burger platform in up to 2,000 restaurants in the U.S. and continued rollout of Experience of the Future in Europe accounts for majority of the reinvestment dollars. 
Earlier this year, we outlined plans to pursue additional opportunities to enhance shareholder value by optimizing our capital and ownership structures and scrutinizing our G&A spending. As we close out the first year of our 3-year plan, I'd like to update you on our progress.
During 2014, we re-franchised over 400 restaurants against our 3-year target of at least 1,500. In the area of G&A, we identified and redirected nearly $100 million in savings for 2015 toward future long-term growth initiatives such as the digital strategy and the McDonald's Experience of the Future. And as always, we continue to explore additional savings opportunities.
As we move into 2015, we remain on track to deliver against our 3-year target to return $18 billion to $20 billion to shareholders between 2014 and 2016 in the form of dividends and share repurchases, having returned $6.4 billion to shareholders last year.
We're moving forward aggressively to regain business momentum. Together, our strategy, strength and structure provide the capability and opportunity for us to change the trajectory of the business and our financial performance. We're on the right path. We've made tough decisions, are holding ourselves to rigorous standards of performance and are doing more with less. As a system, are charged over the coming years to accelerate the pace of change and elevate the overall McDonald's experience in the eyes of our customers.

What I'll do, I'll respond a little bit to the Create Your Taste piece. And then, I'm going to ask Mike to speak a little bit to some of those initiatives and actions that are actually in the near term, because I think that was really your question. Relative to Create Your Taste, please keep this in mind, we have been modeling out looking at Create Your Taste, Build Your Burger now for over 3 years. We started this in the Innovation Center. We moved it to a restaurant in Romeoville. As you know, Joe, when we look at something, we look at all aspects of the implementation from not only the production side and the service side, to crew interactions to consumer relevance. And so we've been doing quite a bit in the prior years. Then we've had this in a restaurant in test in California area, in the SoCal area. We added in test for about another year plus. Also keep in mind that we've had similar initiatives in markets outside of the U.S., markets like France on the service side of this. We've been looking at some of the digital application pieces of this in markets like Sweden. So these, all of these things have come together into what we today call Create Your Taste. So as we move forward now, this is not about just having had one restaurant. This is about having 3-plus, 4-odd years of looking at a concept and various pieces of that concept coming together. Create Your Taste is not just about the food from a customization or personalization perspective. It's also about the digital engagement and interaction of customers via kiosk or mobile ordering. It's also about a change relative to the interaction with our restaurant employees and how they engage and embrace the customers. It's also about the physical changes within the restaurant as well as how we present our food so that you can understand the freshness of the produce and the quality of our proteins. So this is a much broader piece than simply about the food itself. It is about the overall experience. So hopefully, that answers that question. I'll ask Mike to speak a little bit through some of the things taking place in the U.S. because there are quite a few relative to the near-term."

In the near-term, this is a market share gain. It's always going to be a market share gain. So we are -- we trust and we expect to see our more customized approach from our owner/operators. And in terms of a owner/operator-driven business plan, locally, it's based on the customer insights and the unique competitive sets in the marketplace. And these plans are going to be multilayered in nature. You'll see disruptive value. You'll see new product news. You'll see service initiatives. And then, our regional management and our new structure is empowered to commit the resources to make these plans come to life. I don't think it can be underestimated the power of ownership by owner/operators of their own plan, to execute it and own it and get results that we expect to get from those marketplaces. We're also looking at our marketing approach and making sure that we're leveraging the power of kind of the 3 layers of marketing. Clearly, we've got our local co-ops, we've got our national and we also have local store marketing. And we're looking at a revamped marketing approach that better coordinates the specific roles and the deliverables of our co-op marketing plans, using more sophisticated analytics and data to understand the best way to approach. Certainly, our national messaging is -- comes on top of it to help build our brand. We have unique relationship with our customers. And the recent advertising is rekindling that relationship in a way that we've been used to over the years and we've enjoyed. And then, the local market aspect of it is that we -- it's been our heritage, owner/operators and McDonald's being the hub of their local communities, very important to our turnaround plan as well as the local marketing store, the things that they're doing to combat the guy across the street from them. That's kind of the key to that. Then we're looking at how we address the simplicity, or the complexity, I should say, of our menu. We've simplified our menu. As we've talked about last month, that's going into place, as a matter of fact, this week. It this includes reduction in the EVMs, other menu items. Our test market results, which included faster order times and faster total times in the drive-thru continue to see performance above the controls. So no single initiative is going to drive the improvements, but it's all these working together and things that will create a differentiated customer experience that our customers will notice. So we're looking at the U.S. as 22 different regions. As you know, there's multiple markets within those regions. We're already seeing pockets of success and expect those pockets of success to grow. And then, parallel to this short term, we're looking at a longer-term of refining our plans to make comprehensive changes that create an enhanced experience for the customers and continue and differentiate McDonald's from the other QSRs. So Don talked about CYT. You asked about it. That is only one element of this refined experience. It is comprehensive in nature. We are calling it Experience of the Future. We're co-creating this with our owner/operators. And we will present the plan to all of our owner/operators at a national meeting in March. And right after that, we'll start aggressively expanding that up to 2,000 stores in 2015."

As we've talked a lot over these last couple of years, margins are such a top line game for us. So very critical in the margin area that the plans and initiatives that Mike talked about, especially in the U.S., start to gain momentum and get that traction back on the top line. Having said that, we are in a relatively low inflation environment. So pricing, as I noted in my commentary, pricing will still be probably below our average, if you assume the low inflationary environment continues. At the same time, multiple states are increasing minimum wages. We've got national health care impacting 2015 for the first time. That's going to hit the McOpCo margin for about 20 basis points. So I think, the margin in the U.S. will continue to be a little bit pressured by the combination of less price flexibility and a few of these costs. But long term, as the sales get back on track and start to grow, that is what will allow us to start to see the margin leverage. And the same kind of dynamics are impacting franchisees' restaurants as well. As they start to grow guest counts and cash flow, they will start to offset some of these pressures."

There's some positives and then, there's some challenges relative to our business in Europe. Some of the positives are in 2015, we'll see -- if you look globally around the system first, you'll see some good IEO growth. There's parts of Europe where we'll see a little bit of IEO growth, i.e., Germany will see a bit projected in '15, the U.K. will see a bit. France is a more difficult market. France is actually projected to have some IEO decline. We have been gaining market share in both France and the U.K., despite some of the difficult broader business or macro environment. Germany, we've lost some share, and we've talked about Germany as a priority market. What I will tell you is that as a priority market, there were a number of changes that Germany has implemented, some of those I spoke to relative to the actual team that we have there, our marketing leadership there. Actually, our agency, we changed out the agency in Germany. We're seeing a collaboration with the franchisees that is much stronger. So we're making some positive moves in our marketing plans, our menu plans and we're seeing some changes relative to how we're addressing the consumer in those markets. So I'm feeling as if -- I mentioned Germany have a -- seems to be we're seeing some recovery in Germany. We're conscious as we say it because there are some challenges across Europe, as we all know right now, relative to the euro itself. But we are seeing some positive things there. What I would tell you is broadly economic in many of the markets, with the exception of Germany, where we have some things to do in terms of our own internal plan. But for many of the other markets, we're gaining share or we're at a point where our businesses are continuing to compete on par with our competition there. So it will be primarily an economic piece relative to Europe."

So we're not committing to a new target by any means. But we also said that after that 3-year period, franchising will continue to be something that we look at and go after. So 100% will never be, but certainly the ability to continue to increase that franchise percentage over time is something that we will look at. On the G&A side, I think we've been fairly consistent since we announced our plans for the savings that we believe there are significant growth opportunities available in this McDonald's Experience of the Future. And in fact, as we first started talking about it, we've gotten a little bit more aggressive in our plans to go after that in 2015. So for the short term, you've heard u say, we don't think we can cut our way to growth in the G&A area, and we recognize these are fairly significant amount of resources we're reinvesting, but we believe that it's right for the long-term benefit of the business, as Mike said, to kind of change the customer experience in the McDonald's restaurants.

So as we embarked upon the digital strategy, we knew we were embarking upon something that was going to require us to make substantial investments to get it up to par, to be able to have mobile ordering and mobile payment, to be able to have promotional offerings that really, really were relevant to customers today across all age ranges. And so we have made substantial investments there. Our focus now is to focus on that in-restaurant experience of our existing base. So we can improve upon that, whether that's digital engagement, the physical assets themselves, the way the restaurants look, the placement of kiosks in the restaurants, our food offerings in the restaurants, that is where we're making substantial investments. This is not that much different than when we decided that we were going to focus on McCafé at one point, pull back some of the new store capital at that time and reinvest it back in existing restaurants. And so we're doing something very similar as we look at the digital strategies, the in-restaurant experience and the Create Your Taste and food experiences in the restaurant. So as we look at this, we will continue to look at our expenditures, both internally and externally, but we'll also be mindful where we have opportunities in some of the markets to grow as those markets return to the level of growth and the level of, I'll say, stability that we think is going to be needed for us to be able to continue our new development strategies in some of those markets.

I did not speak specifically about pricing, but I did speak about value and that the markets are clearly more targeted in terms of their efforts around value and competitive threats within the marketplaces. So we are seeing more aggressive, disruptive value offers in the marketplace. As a matter of fact, we're moving to a strategy of more flexibility for the local markets to price Dollar Menu & More, which is complementing their other value messages so that the level of aggressiveness and the tactics can be more reflective of the customer expectations, the specific competitive activity and the economic realities of each market."

We've got some outside consultants who bring a fresh and forward-thinking perspective on our menu vision. We've got -- looking at educating America on our food. So this conversation about Our Food. Your Question., giving them facts, we've seen 20 million hits on YouTube, 4.1 billion earned media impressions, so that's resonating with our consumers and all about the quality story. We have to make sure that our quality aligns with the consumers' definition of quality moving forward. And so we're going to be very aggressive in that area looking at -- we're working with our owner/operators to revise our product vision for a very different future as led by the consumer, from the provenance, to the label ingredients, to the processes we use to bring the food from farm to table. We have opportunities to clean up our ingredient list and enhance the taste. And as you mentioned, a lot of innovation going on, including Create Your Taste, we're evolving our menu in response to a lot of the consumer trends. We're launching new products at a national level this year and we're complementing that on differentiated products at a local level. As I mentioned, allowing the marketplaces to address the specific and regional taste that exists out there today. So a lot of new product news to see in the coming year and news on our food in general."

Of course, that gap varies by marketplace. We have markets that actually have a positive comp gap. And so, obviously, we're learning from the things that are happening in those markets.

We have Australia at a point that by year-end, they will have implemented nearly 900 restaurants on the platform. Again, it is a much more integrated platform. So it encompasses service. It encompasses multiple order points. So the kiosk applications, mobile applications, those things as well as being able to still approach the business in a traditional sense from -- through the front counter or through drive-thru. We are looking at all aspects of how we bring this new food offering and customer choice and customization to all the customers who want to experience McDonald's. And so we are seeing some positives in the markets clearly, otherwise, we would not be implementing this. I would tell you that from a service perspective, no matter what you implement throughout the years in the McDonald's system initially, what you're going to see is a slight service increase or decrease, I'd say, in terms of the effectiveness of us being able to serve in the initial month or 2. And then, that should come right back and we should be able to be even more efficient. That's the same thing that we've seen with Create Your Taste thus far. So thus far, we're very positive on Create Your Taste, but we're also mindful that we need to do this the right way. So we're not rushing to try to implement the U.S. over a 1 or 2-year period. We're looking at the applications to make sure that they get the impact that we want from a guest count, sales and an average check perspective, which is also a huge aspect, as well as the halo around the freshness of our food and all of our produce. So we're excited about what we see thus far, but we're also cautious about how we continue to implement this across the year."

The first is on Create Your Taste and what you're seeing in Australia. I think, one of the differences, certainly, for example, with France, where we've had some very nice success with some of these initiatives is the dine-in traffic. The dine-in is a much smaller portion in the U.S. So I guess, the first question is, are these kinds of initiatives less relevant in the U.S. because just the mix of your business, so much of it goes to drive-thru or even carry out. And I guess -- and then, the second question I wanted to ask was a follow-up on the -- when you're talking about improving the quality halo and the provenance. When I look at the competitive set, what I would call traditional QSRs, there are some that are doing quite well without any of that with, I think, just sort of a core competency around speed and service. Mike, maybe you could talk about diagnosing that, why some of your very direct competitors seem to be doing well even in the absence of -- sitting in with some of these trends about quality and provenance and sort of the fast casual direction?"

On the first part, relative to Create Your Taste in different dynamics, or better yet, Experience of the Future in different dynamics. Because what France is doing is not an implementation of Create Your Taste at this point. They have implemented multiple order points. And now, you can place an order through the kiosk, front counter, table service, Web ordering, et cetera, mobile ordering. And when you look at the table service in France, yes, there is a strongest queue to in-store versus drive-thru. However, I would tell you this. What we do is look at things like that and we will tailor those based upon the market that we're implementing in. So we already know that in the U.S., with the restaurants that are implementing Create Your Taste, that we've seen very positive results. Therefore, what we're doing is pulling customers who have a little bit more time and want to experience the restaurant inside to come inside the restaurant. We've made tremendous investments in terms of reimaging. And actually, we have more customers that are seeing those investments in this environment and with the offering of Create Your Taste. So these will be -- they will be modeled for the various markets around the world based upon what is going to appeal to customers the most. France will not be implementing Create Your Taste at the same pace that, say, Australia has. Australia is at a different point with regard to, say, Web ordering than France has been. So we'll take -- we'll learn from all of those things as we bring this forward. But nonetheless, Create Your Taste, table service in France, kiosk applications across Europe, all of those things have been successful for us. And really, the Experience of the Future aspect pulls them all together. And so you're going to see some variations across markets, but clearly, we'll look at the performance metrics to make sure we're moving forward effectively. This is not unlike, again, McCafé was very different in Australia than it is in way U.S., yet, still, McCafé has worked in both. On the other side relative to traditional QSRs, I would offer this, no one is really shining there brightly relative to the traditional QSRs base. I think, what we're talking about at McDonald's is appealing more to the consumers that are out there that are IEO customers. So it's not about a QSR thing or a fast casual thing, it's about good-tasting food, it's about affordability, it is about transparency as a brand, it's about a great service experience that gives them choice. Those are the things that we're putting in place and those are the things that will help us propel this business in moving forward. So we're not gauging ourselves my other QSRs, if you would. We're gauging ourselves by the market opportunity, and we want to do that. It's -- I would also tell you that as we look forward at the markets around the world, each of those markets, as we said today, is very different and at different places. So they will be able to bring the Experience of the Future to life in their markets relative to their customer bases. But we are not skipping over the existing execution of the core products that we have, the core menu that we have, core service expectations, quality service cleanliness, those things are important in every single market we have around the world today."

I have to tell you, the last couple of years, as we said, have been difficult, but as a global system, all of our system has experienced quite a bit and endured many unforeseen changes in the local markets. But at the same time, we've charted and began to implement a stronger pathway for future growth. I couldn't be more proud of the franchisees we have around the world. They own and operate 81% of our restaurants. And without them, we would not have been able to endure those things, which we have over the last couple of years. While there was geopolitical issues and food-related issues, our franchisees, along with the employees and suppliers, have done a tremendous job and it's that strength that is going to propel us forward. It's that unmentioned strength, if you would, that we don't often talk about when we talk about the financials but it's one of the things that has made McDonald's special and it's one of the things that will fuel our growth as we move forward.

It is the path that we're forging, and I will tell you that the future is already on its way.

But it was also a building year. As we entered 2014, we were well aware of the obstacles that we faced in terms of growing comparable sales and margins amid ongoing broad-based challenges and cost pressures throughout our P&L. 
Now while some of the challenges were anticipated, others were not, like the supplier issue in Asia Pacific, Middle East and Africa, and the volatile operating environment in Russia and the Ukraine. And we experienced shortfalls in our internal plans, particularly in key markets such as the U.S. 
In response to these shortfalls, we took a number of important steps to lay the foundation for our turnaround. We're acting with a sense of urgency as these steps are critical to addressing current performance and to advancing our longer-term strategies.
Specifically, we renewed our focus on our customers with the evolution of our strategic plan. We brought in new talent in several major markets around the world to provide innovative thinking and fresh perspectives. We announced the changes that we're making to the U.S. organization to put decision-making and accountability closer to the customer. We redefined menu choice and personalization with the introduction of the Create Your Taste platform in Australia and the U.S. We focused on the service experience through an increased emphasis on operations excellence and the initiation of our global digital strategy. And we did more to bolster trust in brand McDonald's because we know that when our customers feel good about us and about eating at McDonald's, they visit us more often.
Now let's turn to 2014 results. In constant currencies, operating income was down 15% for the fourth quarter and 8% for the year. Earnings per share was down 14% for the quarter and 11% for the full year, both in constant currencies. Excluding the impact of the higher tax rate and the supplier issue in APMEA, earnings per share for the year would have been down 1% in constant currencies.
For the full year global system-wide sales grew 1% in constant currencies, and global comparable sales were down 1%. Comparable sales were down 90 basis points for the quarter. Looking to January, comparable sales are expected to be negative, due in part to the shift in Chinese New Year and consumer perception issues in Japan.
The changes we're making are designed to refocus our system on those areas that matter most to our customers today and for the future. And that starts with deepening our relationship with customers to increase relevance, drive traffic and position McDonald's for longer-term growth. Our actions are guided by our 4 strategic growth priorities, which are broad enough that markets adapt and focus on those elements most relevant to their
Beyond our existing menu, we're asserting McDonald's burger leadership by offering greater customization and choice. Not only does Create Your Taste provide new menu news that excites consumers, it has the potential to lift sales of core classics by bringing more customers into our restaurants. At the same time, we're strengthening the menu pipeline to create greater choice at the local level that reflect attributes like taste preferences and demographics and those things that make each market unique. Greater localization enables us to take advantage of those attributes and tailor our menu and our marketing efforts to strengthen our relevance and appeal to customers in those regions. 
You'll also see changes in our customer service models, as we work to create more memorable experiences and to deliver unparalleled convenience. For example, multiple order point strategies include self-order kiosks, table service or mobile order and payment will modernize how customers interact with our brand and, quite simply, make it easier to get McDonald's their way, whatever that might be. 
We're also strengthening the value proposition. We're strategically evaluating pricing relationships across the entry level, core and premium tiers of our menu. At the same time, we're thinking differently about how to encourage customers to bundle products and use add-on purchases to create a satisfying, affordable meal.
You'll also see a shift in the way we engage our customers and consumers in general. We're being bold and direct as we talk about what matters most to customers, especially the quality of our menu ingredients with multifaceted efforts like ""Our Food. Your Questions."" in markets including the U.S., Canada and Australia. Collectively these changes create the McDonald's Experience of the Future, which brings the work that's happening within each strategic priority together to deliver changes our customers will notice. It builds on the investments we've already made in technology, reimaging our restaurants and operations improvement, with an increased emphasis on tangible customer-centric innovations for menu and service, to profitably grow the business.
We have enduring competitive advantages that have served us well over time. And those advantages are even more relevant today. Our size and geographically diversified restaurant portfolio allow us to test new products and concepts at a local level, and then broadly scale those that are successful, like we've done in the past with beverages, and like we're currently doing with Create Your Taste. McDonald's operates as one single brand, allowing us to focus our energy and resources on evolving the customer experience and changing the way we engage with consumers, while also leveraging the equity inherent in our iconic core products. Our global infrastructure enables us to tap into a variety of perspectives and expertise. Our franchisees are an integral part of the communities in which they do business. Suppliers bring innovation in their disciplines, and company employees focus on strategic direction to complement day-to-day execution in our restaurants. And finally, our strong financial foundation, which is supported by industry-leading average unit volumes, it enables us to pursue our global growth priorities in every type of operating environment while returning significant amounts of cash to shareholders each year.
Now on our July call, we outlined the steps required over a 12- to 18-month period to strengthen our foundation and enhance our relevance and appeal to customers. Having reached the 6-month mark, we're beginning to see signs of progress in some of our priority markets. While specifics vary across the markets, the underlying formula has been very consistent. In 2014, these markets brought in fresh leadership with new perspectives on how to get customers back in the restaurants. They strengthened franchisee alignment and those relationships and reemphasized value and reenergized our marketing approaches. 
We're already seeing a shift in Australia, which has over 900 restaurants. It started with fundamental improvements in our marketing efforts and across our entire menu. And it was enabled by much stronger alignment with our franchisees. We're building on this strong foundation with plans to roll Create Your Taste across the majority of our restaurants by the end of this year. It's the first of our priority markets to demonstrate signs of recovery with positive comparable sales and guest counts since September.
It will take longer to see an uptick in the U.S., which has more than 14,000 restaurants across 22 different regions. The changes we announced last year to create a flatter, more nimble organization have opened the door for decisions to be made closer to the customer. Mike Andres is on the call today, and he can share more during the Q&A about the work that's being done to take shape around our menu, marketing and service, which will enhance our relevance and appeal to customers.
Now over to Germany. Negative trends are beginning to moderate, with the month of December marking the highest comparable sales performance in more than 2 years. While we expect an uneven recovery as market dynamics remain challenging in the near term, we are focused on driving sales and guest counts by strengthening value offers, highlighting the quality of both core and premium products in our marketing messages and aggressively pursuing growth opportunities within the family and breakfast businesses. Our position in Australia, the U.S. and Germany is much like what the U.K. experienced in the early 2000s. We can and we will turn around these markets with a balanced approach. 
Russia and China are also key markets that are in a recovery mode. While the specific tactics are different, both markets are focused on enhancing our brand image and winning customers back by emphasizing food quality and also celebrating the many reasons to choose McDonald's, such as convenience and affordability.  Fourth quarter comparable sales in China were negative 6.7%, due to the lingering impact of the supplier issue. Each month of the quarter showed sequential improvement, reflecting the positive impact of our ongoing customer recovery efforts in the market.
Finally, in Japan the team continues to work to overcome significant challenges. The market is executing a multifaceted brand recovery campaign, which is designed to rebuild brand trust and strengthen quality and affordability perceptions. While we know these actions will win back customers, history tells us that these efforts will take time to resonate, so we expect continued volatility in the market through most of 2015. 
2015 will be a year of regaining momentum globally. We expect further growth amid the pockets of success we're already seeing. However, it will take time, especially in our larger markets, for customers to notice the comprehensive changes that are underway. So our internal projections assume continued sales and earnings pressure and volatility in the business, particularly in the first half of the year.
In light of continuing headwinds, we made thoughtful adjustments to our 2015 plans, pulling back in some areas to fund key growth initiatives focused on delivering greater customer relevance, broader consumer reach and better restaurant execution. For example, we've reduced capital expenditures by paring back on new store openings in markets that are experiencing significant near-term challenges, including China, Russia, Germany and the United States. And we're redirecting G&A from the U.S. business and corporate to priority initiatives that will drive our growth. We're committed to taking necessary actions to improve performance and position McDonald's for enduring profitable growth into the future.
As we embark on a new year, we maintain high expectations of our sales and for our brand. I remain confident in our prospects, both in the near and long term. We're keenly focused on the opportunities that exist within our global growth priorities to serve our customers' favorite food and drink, to create memorable experiences, to offer unparalleled convenience and to become an even more trusted brand. We're changing, and we're doing it aggressively. We know that some tactics will be different from market to market and region to region around the world. And that's why our plans are supported by comprehensive and localized execution approaches that rely on our franchisees, our company employees and suppliers to satisfy customer expectations and drive stronger business results.
Thanks again for being on the call, everyone, and I'll now turn it over to Pete."

Our results were impacted on a variety of fronts and across each of our geographic segments.

Our results were impacted on a variety of fronts and across each of our geographic segments. Today, I'd like to spend a few minutes putting our 2014 performance into perspective, providing details on some key fourth quarter numbers and outlining the critical components of our 2015 financial plan. I'll begin by reviewing our results for the quarter and full year, highlighting the 3 factors that had a notable impact on performance in each of our major geographic segments. 
First is the underperformance of our U.S. business. Throughout 2014, our results reflect the impact of ongoing broad-based challenges, including operating in an increasingly competitive marketplace amid sluggish industry growth. For the year the segment's operating income declined $257 million or 7%, partly due to negative comparable sales and guest counts, which contributed to margin declines. U.S. results were also impacted by higher G&A spending and other operating expenses associated with positioning the U.S. business for the future, including the segment's revamped marketing approach and development of the new Brand Love campaign. We expect to incur additional U.S. restructuring costs in the first quarter.
The second significant item that affected our global results was the APMEA supplier issue. The total impact from lost sales and expenses associated with our customer recovery efforts was approximately $110 million or $0.09 per share for the quarter, and $290 million or $0.23 per share for the full year. The markets most affected by this issue include China, Japan and Hong Kong.  Prior to the supplier issue, these markets collectively represented about 10% of global system-wide sales and 5% of global operating income.  
In APMEA, our results were also pressured by ongoing performance issues in Japan. For the full year, APMEA's operating income declined 28%, or 25% in constant currencies, $413 million. Japan's contribution to APMEA's operating income includes royalties and the company's share of McDonald's Japan after-tax results.
The third significant impact on McDonald's global results for 2014 was in Russia and the Ukraine. During 2014 McDonald's Europe experienced significant declines in company-operated margins, driven by weakening currencies and economic slowdown and store closures in these 2 markets. 
For the year, Europe reported a $90 million decrease in operating income, a 2% decline in constant currencies, with the segment's company-operated margins weighing heavily on results. The entire operating income decline for the year was solely driven by Russia and the Ukraine company-operated margin results. Over half of this margin decline reflects the significant impact of weakening currencies on imported commodity costs in these 2 markets. We expect this currency impact to significantly pressure the segment's company-operated margins again in 2015, especially in the first half.
While we expect to move beyond some of these unique events of last year, certain challenges remain. In the U.S, our turnaround initiatives to reignite momentum are in progress. Mike Andres and the U.S. leadership team are implementing a new, more nimble organizational structure that places decision-making back in the hands of the local market teams. The U.S. business is working aggressively to implement these changes, but it will take time before we see the benefits in the segment's overall financial results. 
In Russia, while all of our restaurants impacted by the temporary closures are back in operation, the market remains in a recession and the economic outlook is weak. More broadly, consumer confidence across most of Europe is forecasted to remain low throughout 2015.
In APMEA, in response to the supplier issue, customer recovery efforts initiated in September in each of our impacted markets. While sales trends in China showed signs of improvement during the fourth quarter, our best estimate is that it will take at least 3 to 6 more months for our business in China to return to a normalized level.
For McDonald's Japan, recovery from the supplier issue has not been as strong. At the same time, new consumer perception issues have emerged, which have further depressed sales and profitability. We expect these issues to impact results for the foreseeable future. Japan remains on our priority market list.
Next, I want to provide a 2014 update and a 2015 preview for some of our key financial items: commodities, pricing, G&A and currencies. I'll start with commodity costs for the U.S. and Europe. For the fourth quarter, U.S. commodity costs rose approximately 3.5%, primarily due to higher beef prices. For the full year, commodity costs ended up about 3%, which was the upper end of our forecast, as reductions in other commodities were more than offset by increases in beef. Commodity cost pressure is expected to continue into 2015 with a full year increase projected at 1.5% to 2.5%, again, driven primarily by beef. Excluding currency, Europe's commodity costs were up 1% for the fourth quarter and were relatively flat for the full year. For 2015, our full year outlook is for Europe's grocery basket to also reflect an increase of 1.5% to 2.5%.
To help offset this pressure we have taken some price increases. The U.S. ended 2014 with pricing up roughly 1.8%, notably lower than the 2013 increase of about 3% and lower than food-away-from-home inflation, which ended the year at 3%. During the second half of the year, we consciously did not completely offset the prior year price increases that rolled off. This further pressured our margins during the third and fourth quarters. And based on where we stand at the start of 2015, we expect this pressure to continue in the near term. Our price increases in Europe varied by market with the overall segment, excluding Russia, averaging about 2% year-over-year.
Consolidated G&A increased 9% in constant currencies for the fourth quarter and 5% in constant currencies for the year. For the quarter, these increases were driven largely by costs associated with positioning our U.S. business for the future, as well as costs related to our long-term growth initiatives. As I've mentioned in October, during 2014 we identified $100 million of G&A savings in the U.S. and corporate. These savings are being redirected toward our critical long-term growth initiatives in 2015. Our review of the corporate G&A spending was completed in December. We are nearing the completion of our full G&A review of the U.S. and will provide more details on these efforts later this quarter. 
While our G&A increased for both periods in 2014, I want to emphasize an important point. McDonald's operates in a pay-for-performance culture. As such, short-term incentive payouts for 2014 were 0 for all corporate and U.S. employees. In addition, 2014 performance negatively impacted management's long-term incentive compensation. We expect 2015 G&A to increase 7% to 8% in constant currencies, primarily due to the restoration of incentive pay. Excluding incremental incentive-based compensation, 2015 G&A is expected to increase 1% to 2%. More than 100% of this remaining increase relates to costs associated with the expansion of our strategic growth initiatives, including Experience of the Future and our digital strategy.
Foreign currencies proved to be another headwind in 2014, with translation negatively impacting fourth quarter EPS by $0.08 and full year EPS by $0.12. Given the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar against virtually all major foreign currencies, we expect a negative translation on first quarter 2015 of $0.08 to $0.10 per share and a full year impact of $0.35 to $0.40 per share. As usual, take this as directional guidance only because rates will change as we move throughout the year.
Finally, I'd like to share our current capital expenditure and restaurant opening plans for the upcoming year. Our plan for 2015 capital expenditure budget is approximately $2 billion, nearly $1 billion less than our initial capital expenditure plan last year. The decrease in our 2015 capital expenditures is driven primarily by an $800 million decrease in capital allocated to new restaurant openings. The most notable reductions will take place in markets experiencing the greatest challenges: China, Russia, Germany and the U.S.
Our $2 billion capital budget is divided relatively evenly, with approximately 1/2 earmarked for new restaurant openings and the remaining $1 billion dedicated to reinvestments. We continue to rigorously screen new restaurant opportunities to determine where they will generate the most attractive returns, given each market's potential, competitive environment and current industry dynamics. In 2015, we do expect to open more than 1,000 McDonald's restaurants, primarily in China, the U.S., Russia and France. This compares with about 1,300 restaurant openings in 2014. On a net basis, we expect 600 to 700 additions for the year compared with approximately 800 in 2014.  
The majority of our reinvestment dollars are slated for the U.S. and Europe. Expansion of the Create Your Taste burger platform in up to 2,000 restaurants in the U.S. and continued rollout of Experience of the Future in Europe accounts for a majority of the reinvestment dollars. 
Earlier this year, we outlined plans to pursue additional opportunities to enhance shareholder value by optimizing our capital and ownership structures and scrutinizing our G&A spending. As we close out the first year of our 3-year plan, I'd like to update you on our progress.
During 2014, we re-franchised over 400 restaurants against our 3-year target of at least 1,500. In the area of G&A, we identified and redirected nearly $100 million in savings for 2015 toward future long-term growth initiatives, such as the digital strategy and the McDonald's Experience of the Future. And as always we continue to explore additional savings opportunities.
As we move into 2015 we remain on track to deliver against our 3-year target to return $18 billion to $20 billion to shareholders between 2014 and 2016 in the form of dividends and share repurchases, having returned $6.4 billion to shareholders last year.
We're moving forward aggressively to regain business momentum. Together our strategy, strength and structure provide the capability and opportunity for us to change the trajectory of the business and our financial performance. We're on the right path. We've made tough decisions, are holding ourselves to rigorous standards of performance and are doing more with less. As a system, our charge over the coming year is to accelerate the pace of change and elevate the overall McDonald's experience in the eyes of our customers. 
Thanks. Now I'll turn it over to Chris to begin the Q&A."

And then, I'm going to ask Mike to speak a little bit to some of those initiatives and actions that are actually in the nearer term, because I think that was really your question. Relative to Create Your Taste, please keep this in mind, we have been modeling out looking at Create Your Taste, Build Your Burger now for over 3 years. We started this in the Innovation Center. We moved it to a test restaurant in Romeoville. As you know, Joe, when we look at something, we look at all aspects of the implementation, from not only the production side and the service side, to crew interactions to consumer relevance. And so we've been doing quite a bit in the prior years. Then we've had this in a restaurant in test in the California area, in the SoCal area. We had it in test for about another year plus. Also keep in mind that we've had similar initiatives in markets outside of the U.S., markets like France on the service side of this. We've been looking at some of the digital application pieces of this in markets like Sweden. So these, all of these things have come together into what we today call Create Your Taste. So as we move forward now, this is not about just having had one restaurant. This is about having 3-plus, 4-odd years of looking at a concept and various pieces of that concept coming together. Create Your Taste is not just about the food from a customization or personalization perspective. It's also about the digital engagement and interaction of customers via kiosk or mobile ordering. It's also about a change relative to the interaction with our restaurant employees and how they engage and embrace the customers. It's also about the physical changes within the restaurant as well as how we present our food so that you can understand and see the freshness of the produce and the quality of our proteins. So this is a much broader piece than simply about the food itself. It is about the overall experience. So hopefully that answers that question. I'll ask Mike to speak a little bit to some of the things taking place in the U.S. because there are quite a few relative to the near-term."

In the nearer term, this is a market share game. It's always going to be a market share game. So we are -- we trust and we expect to see our more customized approach from our owner/operators. And in terms of a owner/operator-driven business plan, locally, it's based on the customer insights and the unique competitive sets in the marketplace. And these plans are going to be multi-layered in nature. You'll see disruptive value. You'll see new product news. You'll see service initiatives. And then our regional management in our new structure is empowered to commit the resources to make these plans come to life. I don't think it can be underestimated the power of ownership by owner/operators of their own plan, to execute it and own it and get results that we expect to get from those marketplaces. We're also looking at our marketing approach and making sure that we're leveraging the power of kind of the 3 layers of marketing. Clearly, we've got our local co-ops, we've got our national, and we also have local store marketing. And we're looking at a revamped marketing approach that better coordinates the specific roles and the deliverables of our co-op marketing plans, using more sophisticated analytics and data to understand the best way to approach. Certainly our national messaging is -- comes on top of it to help build our brand. We have unique relationship with our customers. And the recent advertising is rekindling that relationship in a way that we've been used to over the years and we've enjoyed. And then, the local market aspect of it is that we -- it's been our heritage, owner/operators and McDonald's being the hub of their local communities, very important to our turnaround plan as well as the local marketing store, the things that they're doing to combat the guy across the street from them. That's kind of the key to that. Then we're looking at how we address the simplicity -- or the complexity, I should say -- of our menu. We've simplified our menu, as we've talked about last month. That's going into place, as a matter of fact, this week. It includes reduction in the EVMs, other menu items. Our test market results, which included faster order times and faster total times in the drive-thru continue to see performance above the controls. So no single initiative is going to drive the improvements, but it's all these working together and things that will create a differentiated customer experience that our customers will notice. So we're looking at the U.S. as 22 different regions. As you know, there's multiple markets within those regions. We're already seeing pockets of success and expect those pockets of success to grow. And then, parallel to this short term, we're looking at a longer-term of refining our plans to make comprehensive changes that create an enhanced experience for the customers and continue and differentiate McDonald's from the other QSRs. So Don talked about CYT. You asked about it. That is only one element of this refined experience. It is comprehensive in nature. We are calling it the Experience of the Future. We're co-creating this with our owner/operators. And we will present the plan to all of our owner/operators at a national meeting in March. And right after that, we'll start aggressively expanding that up to 2,000 stores in 2015."

As we've talked a lot over these last couple of years, margins are such a top line game for us. So very critical in the margin area that the plans and initiatives that Mike talked about, especially in the U.S., start to gain momentum and get that traction back on the top line. Having said that, we are in a relatively low inflation environment. So pricing, as I noted in my commentary, pricing will still be probably below our average, if you assume the low inflationary environment continues. At the same time, multiple states are increasing minimum wages. We've got national health care impacting 2015 for the first time. That's going to hit the McOpCo margin for about 20 basis points. So I think, the margin in the U.S. will continue to be a little bit pressured by the combination of less price flexibility and a few of these costs. But long term, as the sales get back on track and start to grow, that is what will allow us to start to see the margin leverage. And the same kind of dynamics are impacting franchisees' restaurants as well. As they start to grow guest counts and cash flow, they will start to offset some of these pressures."

There's some positives and then, there's some challenges relative to our business in Europe. Some of the positives are in 2015, we'll see -- if you look globally around the system first, you'll see some good IEO growth. There's parts of Europe where we'll see a little bit of IEO growth, i.e., Germany will see a bit projected in '15, the U.K. will see a bit. France is a more difficult market. France is actually projected to have some IEO decline. We have been gaining market share in both France and the U.K., despite some of the difficult broader business or macro environments. Germany, we've lost some share, and we've talked about Germany as a priority market. What I will tell you is that, as a priority market there were a number of changes that Germany has implemented, some of those I spoke to relative to the actual team that we have there, our marketing leadership there. Actually, our agency, we changed out the agency in Germany. We're seeing a collaboration with the franchisees that is much stronger. So we're making some positive moves in our marketing plans, our menu plans, and we're seeing some changes relative to how we're addressing the consumer in those markets. So I'm feeling as if -- I mentioned Germany had a -- it seems to be we're seeing some recovery in Germany. We're cautious as we say it because there are some challenges across Europe, as we all know right now, relative to the euro itself. But we are seeing some positive things there. What I would tell you is broadly economic in many of the markets, with the exception of Germany, where we have some things to do in terms of our own internal plan. But for many of the other markets, we're gaining share or we're at a point where our businesses are continuing to compete on par with our competition there.

On the G&A side, I think we've been fairly consistent since we announced our plans for the savings that we believe there are significant growth opportunities available in this McDonald's Experience of the Future. And in fact, since we first started talking about it, we've gotten a little bit more aggressive in our plans to go after that in 2015.

We firmly believe, based upon the strength of our business and the reach of our business -- as you all know, we touch about 70 million customers a day. One of the things that we've not leveraged as strongly has been the whole digital engagement aspect. So as we embarked upon the digital strategy, we knew we were embarking upon something that was going to require us to make substantial investments to get it up to par, to be able to have mobile ordering and mobile payment, to be able to have promotional offerings that really, really were relevant to customers today across all age ranges. And so we have made substantial investments there. Our focus now is to focus on that in-restaurant experience of our existing base. So if we can improve upon that, whether that's digital engagement, the physical assets themselves, the way the restaurants look, the placement of kiosks in the restaurants, our food offerings in the restaurants, that is where we're making substantial investments. This is not that much different than when we decided that we were going to focus on McCafé at one point, pull back some of the new store capital at that time and reinvested it back in existing restaurants. And so we're doing something very similar as we look at the digital strategies, the in-restaurant experience and the Create Your Taste and food experiences in the restaurant. So as we look at this, we will continue to look at our expenditures, both internally and externally, but we'll also be mindful where we have opportunities in some of the markets to grow as those markets return to the level of growth and the level of, I'll say, stability that we think is going to be needed for us to be able to continue our new development strategies in some of those markets. Mike, if you would, a little bit on menu?"

So John, the menu rationalization that is being rolled out as we speak, we are expecting to see the same results that we saw in the test markets, which included -- obviously would be a throughput improvement because we're making it easier to order for our customers, less complexity on the kitchen, so the time to get the food out of the kitchen and to the windows increases (sic). So we're seeing improved sales results against the control markets on our tests. We expect to see that happen in the rest of the country. I did not speak specifically about pricing, but I did speak about value and that the markets are clearly more targeted in terms of their efforts around value and competitive threats within the marketplaces. So we are seeing more aggressive, disruptive value offers in the marketplace. As a matter of fact, we're moving to a strategy of more flexibility for the local markets to price Dollar Menu & More, which is complementing their other value messages so that the level of aggressiveness and the tactics can be more reflective of the customer expectations, the specific competitive activity and the economic realities of each market."

So it takes some of the pressure off of a lot of the other menu items that we would have on -- showing on the menu at any given time. In terms of the overall menu pipeline and what we're looking at it today. Obviously food is a high priority. For me personally I think that's the foundation of where we're taking the business moving forward and what the expectations of the consumer are. So we're seeing this localization of more locally relevant products that are being drawn or pulled from the marketplace as they get into the customer insights. We're looking at building our culinary talent. To support our talented U.S. chefs we're including our supplier team of chefs. We've got some outside consultants who bring a fresh and forward-thinking perspective on our menu vision. We've got -- looking at educating America on our food. So this conversation about ""Our Food. Your Questions."" giving them facts. We've seen 20 million hits on YouTube, 4.1 billion earned media impressions. So that's resonating with our consumers. And all about the quality story -- we have to make sure that our quality aligns with the consumers' definition of quality moving forward. And so we're going to be very aggressive in that area looking at -- we're working with our owner/operators to revise our product vision for a very different future as led by the consumer, from the provenance, to the label ingredients, to the processes we use to bring the food from farm to table. We have opportunities to clean up our ingredient list and enhance the taste. And as you mentioned, a lot of innovation going on, including Create Your Taste, we're evolving our menu in response to a lot of the consumer trends. We're launching new products at a national level this year, and we're complementing that on differentiated products at a local level. As I mentioned, allowing the marketplaces to address the specific and regional taste that exists out there today. So a lot of new product news to see in the coming year and news on our food in general."

We have Australia at a point that by year-end, they will have implemented nearly 900 restaurants on the platform. Again, it is a much more integrated platform. So it encompasses service. It encompasses multiple order points. So the kiosk applications, mobile applications, those things as well as being able to still approach the business in a traditional sense from -- through the front counter or through drive-thru. We are looking at all aspects of how we bring this new food offering and customer choice and customization to all the customers who want to experience McDonald's. And so we are seeing some positives in the markets, clearly, otherwise we would not be implementing this. I would tell you that from a service perspective, no matter what you implement throughout the years in the McDonald's system, initially what you're going to see is a slight service increase -- or decrease, I'd say, in terms of the effectiveness of us being able to serve in the initial month or 2. And then that should come right back, and we should be able to be even more efficient. That's the same thing that we've seen with Create Your Taste thus far. So thus far, we're very positive on Create Your Taste, but we're also mindful that we need to do this the right way. So we're not rushing to try to implement the U.S. over a 1- or 2-year period. We're looking at the applications to make sure that they get the impact that we want from a guest count, a sales and an average check perspective, which is also a huge aspect, as well as the halo around the freshness of our food and all of our produce. So we're excited about what we see thus far, but we're also cautious about how we continue to implement this across the year."

And I guess -- and then, the second question I wanted to ask was a follow-up on the -- when you're talking about improving the quality halo and the provenance. When I look at the competitive set, what I would call traditional QSRs, there are some that are doing quite well without any of that with, I think, just sort of a core competency around speed and service. Mike, maybe you could talk about diagnosing that, why some of your very direct competitors seem to be doing well even in the absence of fitting in with some of these trends about quality and provenance and the sort of the fast casual direction?"

On the first part, relative to Create Your Taste in different dynamics, or better yet, Experience of the Future in different dynamics. Because what France is doing is not an implementation of Create Your Taste at this point. They have implemented multiple order points. And now, you can place an order through the kiosk, front counter, table service, Web ordering, et cetera, mobile ordering. And when you look at the table service in France, yes, there is a stronger skew to in-store versus drive-thru. However, I would tell you this. What we do is look at things like that, and we will tailor those based upon the market that we're implementing in. So we already know that in the U.S., with the restaurants that are implementing Create Your Taste, that we've seen very positive results. Therefore, what we're doing is pulling customers who have a little bit more time and want to experience the restaurant inside to come inside the restaurant. We've made tremendous investments in terms of reimaging. And actually we have more customers that are seeing those investments in this environment and with the offering of Create Your Taste. So these will be -- they will be modeled for the various markets around the world based upon what is going to appeal to customers the most. France will not be implementing Create Your Taste at the same pace that, say, Australia has. Australia is at a different point with regard to, say, Web ordering than France has been. So we'll take -- we'll learn from all of those things as we bring this forward. But nonetheless, Create Your Taste, table service in France, kiosk applications across Europe, all of those things have been successful for us. And really, the Experience of the Future aspect pulls them all together. And so you're going to see some variations across markets. But clearly we'll look at the performance metrics to make sure we're moving forward effectively. This is not unlike, again, McCafé was very different in Australia than it is in the U.S. Yet and still, McCafé has worked in both. On the other side relative to traditional QSRs, I would offer this. No one is really shining that brightly relative to the traditional QSRs space. I think, what we're talking about at McDonald's is appealing more to the consumers that are out there that are IEO customers. So it's not about a QSR thing or a fast casual thing, it's about good-tasting food, it's about affordability, it is about transparency as a brand, it's about a great service experience that gives me choice. Those are the things that we're putting in place, and those are the things that will help us propel this business and move it forward. So we're not gauging ourselves by other QSRs, if you would. We're gauging ourselves by the market opportunity, and we want to do that. It's -- I would also tell you that as we look forward at the markets around the world, each of those markets, as we said today, is very different and at different places. So they will be able to bring the Experience of the Future to life in their markets relative to their customer bases. But we are not skipping over the existing execution of the core products that we have, the core menu that we have, core service expectations, quality, service, cleanliness, those things are important in every single market we have around the world today."

But as a global system, all of our system has experienced quite a bit and endured many unforeseen changes in the local markets. But at the same time, we've charted and began to implement a stronger pathway for future growth. I couldn't be more proud of the franchisees we have around the world. They own and operate 81% of our restaurants. And without them, we would not have been able to endure those things, which we have over the last couple of years.

But it was also a building year. As we entered 2014, we were well aware of the obstacles that we faced in terms of growing comparable sales and margins amid ongoing broad-based challenges and cost pressures throughout our P&L. 
Now while some of the challenges were anticipated, others were not, like the supplier issue in Asia Pacific, Middle East and Africa, and the volatile operating environment in Russia and the Ukraine. And we experienced shortfalls in our internal plans, particularly in key markets such as the U.S. 
In response to these shortfalls, we took a number of important steps to lay the foundation for our turnaround. We're acting with a sense of urgency as these steps are critical to addressing current performance and to advancing our longer-term strategies.
Specifically, we renewed our focus on our customers with the evolution of our strategic plan. We brought in new talent in several major markets around the world to provide innovative thinking and fresh perspectives. We announced the changes that we're making to the U.S. organization to put decision-making and accountability closer to the customer. We redefined menu choice and personalization with the introduction of the Create Your Taste platform in Australia and the U.S. We focused on the service experience through an increased emphasis on operations excellence and the initiation of our global digital strategy. And we did more to bolster trust in brand McDonald's because we know that when our customers feel good about us and about eating at McDonald's, they visit us more often.
Now let's turn to 2014 results. In constant currencies, operating income was down 15% for the fourth quarter and 8% for the year. Earnings per share was down 14% for the quarter and 11% for the full year, both in constant currencies. Excluding the impact of the higher tax rate and the supplier issue in APMEA, earnings per share for the year would have been down 1% in constant currencies.
For the full year global system-wide sales grew 1% in constant currencies, and global comparable sales were down 1%. Comparable sales were down 90 basis points for the quarter. Looking to January, comparable sales are expected to be negative, due in part to the shift in Chinese New Year and consumer perception issues in Japan.
The changes we're making are designed to refocus our system on those areas that matter most to our customers today and for the future. And that starts with deepening our relationship with customers to increase relevance, drive traffic and position McDonald's for longer-term growth. Our actions are guided by our 4 strategic growth priorities, which are broad enough that markets adapt and focus on those elements most relevant to their local customer bases.
Beyond our existing menu, we're asserting McDonald's burger leadership by offering greater customization and choice. Not only does Create Your Taste provide new menu news that excites consumers, it has the potential to lift sales of core classics by bringing more customers into our restaurants. At the same time, we're strengthening the menu pipeline to create greater choice at the local level that reflect attributes like taste preferences and demographics and those things that make each market unique. Greater localization enables us to take advantage of those attributes and tailor our menu and our marketing efforts to strengthen our relevance and appeal to customers in those regions. 
You'll also see changes in our customer service models, as we work to create more memorable experiences and to deliver unparalleled convenience. For example, multiple order point strategies include self-order kiosks, table service or mobile order and payment will modernize how customers interact with our brand and, quite simply, make it easier to get McDonald's their way, whatever that might be. 
We're also strengthening the value proposition. We're strategically evaluating pricing relationships across the entry level, core and premium tiers of our menu. At the same time, we're thinking differently about how to encourage customers to bundle products and use add-on purchases to create a satisfying, affordable meal.
You'll also see a shift in the way we engage our customers and consumers in general. We're being bold and direct as we talk about what matters most to customers, especially the quality of our menu ingredients with multifaceted efforts like ""Our Food. Your Questions."" in markets including the U.S., Canada and Australia. Collectively these changes create the McDonald's Experience of the Future, which brings the work that's happening within each strategic priority together to deliver changes our customers will notice. It builds on the investments we've already made in technology, reimaging our restaurants and operations improvement, with an increased emphasis on tangible customer-centric innovations for menu and service, to profitably grow the business.
We have enduring competitive advantages that have served us well over time. And those advantages are even more relevant today. Our size and geographically diversified restaurant portfolio allow us to test new products and concepts at a local level, and then broadly scale those that are successful, like we've done in the past with beverages, and like we're currently doing with Create Your Taste. McDonald's operates as one single brand, allowing us to focus our energy and resources on evolving the customer experience and changing the way we engage with consumers, while also leveraging the equity inherent in our iconic core products. Our global infrastructure enables us to tap into a variety of perspectives and expertise. Our franchisees are an integral part of the communities in which they do business. Suppliers bring innovation in their disciplines, and company employees focus on strategic direction to complement day-to-day execution in our restaurants. And finally, our strong financial foundation, which is supported by industry-leading average unit volumes, it enables us to pursue our global growth priorities in every type of operating environment while returning significant amounts of cash to shareholders each year.
Now on our July call, we outlined the steps required over a 12- to 18-month period to strengthen our foundation and enhance our relevance and appeal to customers. Having reached the 6-month mark, we're beginning to see signs of progress in some of our priority markets. While specifics vary across the markets, the underlying formula has been very consistent. In 2014, these markets brought in fresh leadership with new perspectives on how to get customers back in the restaurants. They strengthened franchisee alignment and those relationships and reemphasized value and reenergized our marketing approaches. 
We're already seeing a shift in Australia, which has over 900 restaurants. It started with fundamental improvements in our marketing efforts and across our entire menu. And it was enabled by much stronger alignment with our franchisees. We're building on this strong foundation with plans to roll Create Your Taste across the majority of our restaurants by the end of this year. It's the first of our priority markets to demonstrate signs of recovery with positive comparable sales and guest counts since September.
It will take longer to see an uptick in the U.S., which has more than 14,000 restaurants across 22 different regions. The changes we announced last year to create a flatter, more nimble organization have opened the door for decisions to be made closer to the customer. Mike Andres is on the call today, and he can share more during the Q&A about the work that's being done to take shape around our menu, marketing and service, which will enhance our relevance and appeal to customers.
Now over to Germany. Negative trends are beginning to moderate, with the month of December marking the highest comparable sales performance in more than 2 years. While we expect an uneven recovery as market dynamics remain challenging in the near term, we are focused on driving sales and guest counts by strengthening value offers, highlighting the quality of both core and premium products in our marketing messages and aggressively pursuing growth opportunities within the family and breakfast businesses. Our position in Australia, the U.S. and Germany is much like what the U.K. experienced in the early 2000s. We can and we will turn around these markets with a balanced approach. 
Russia and China are also key markets that are in a recovery mode. While the specific tactics are different, both markets are focused on enhancing our brand image and winning customers back by emphasizing food quality and also celebrating the many reasons to choose McDonald's, such as convenience and affordability.  Fourth quarter comparable sales in China were negative 6.7%, due to the lingering impact of the supplier issue. Each month of the quarter showed sequential improvement, reflecting the positive impact of our ongoing customer recovery efforts in the market.
Finally, in Japan the team continues to work to overcome significant challenges. The market is executing a multifaceted brand recovery campaign, which is designed to rebuild brand trust and strengthen quality and affordability perceptions. While we know these actions will win back customers, history tells us that these efforts will take time to resonate, so we expect continued volatility in the market through most of 2015. 
2015 will be a year of regaining momentum globally. We expect further growth amid the pockets of success we're already seeing. However, it will take time, especially in our larger markets, for customers to notice the comprehensive changes that are underway. So our internal projections assume continued sales and earnings pressure and volatility in the business, particularly in the first half of the year.
In light of continuing headwinds, we made thoughtful adjustments to our 2015 plans, pulling back in some areas to fund key growth initiatives focused on delivering greater customer relevance, broader consumer reach and better restaurant execution. For example, we've reduced capital expenditures by paring back on new store openings in markets that are experiencing significant near-term challenges, including China, Russia, Germany and the United States. And we're redirecting G&A from the U.S. business and corporate to priority initiatives that will drive our growth. We're committed to taking necessary actions to improve performance and position McDonald's for enduring profitable growth into the future.
As we embark on a new year, we maintain high expectations of our sales and for our brand. I remain confident in our prospects, both in the near and long term. We're keenly focused on the opportunities that exist within our global growth priorities to serve our customers' favorite food and drink, to create memorable experiences, to offer unparalleled convenience and to become an even more trusted brand. We're changing, and we're doing it aggressively. We know that some tactics will be different from market to market and region to region around the world. And that's why our plans are supported by comprehensive and localized execution approaches that rely on our franchisees, our company employees and suppliers to satisfy customer expectations and drive stronger business results.
Thanks again for being on the call, everyone, and I'll now turn it over to Pete."
139488,279351861,748729,"McDonald's Corp., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Jan 23, 2015",2015-01-23,"Earnings Calls","McDonald's Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Don, and hi, everyone. 2014 was a challenging year for McDonald's all around the world.

Our results were impacted on a variety of fronts and across each of our geographic segments. Today, I'd like to spend a few minutes putting our 2014 performance into perspective, providing details on some key fourth quarter numbers and outlining the critical components of our 2015 financial plan. I'll begin by reviewing our results for the quarter and full year, highlighting the 3 factors that had a notable impact on performance in each of our major geographic segments. 
First is the underperformance of our U.S. business. Throughout 2014, our results reflect the impact of ongoing broad-based challenges, including operating in an increasingly competitive marketplace amid sluggish industry growth. For the year the segment's operating income declined $257 million or 7%, partly due to negative comparable sales and guest counts, which contributed to margin declines. U.S. results were also impacted by higher G&A spending and other operating expenses associated with positioning the U.S. business for the future, including the segment's revamped marketing approach and development of the new Brand Love campaign. We expect to incur additional U.S. restructuring costs in the first quarter.
The second significant item that affected our global results was the APMEA supplier issue. The total impact from lost sales and expenses associated with our customer recovery efforts was approximately $110 million or $0.09 per share for the quarter, and $290 million or $0.23 per share for the full year. The markets most affected by this issue include China, Japan and Hong Kong.  Prior to the supplier issue, these markets collectively represented about 10% of global system-wide sales and 5% of global operating income.  
In APMEA, our results were also pressured by ongoing performance issues in Japan. For the full year, APMEA's operating income declined 28%, or 25% in constant currencies, $413 million. Japan's contribution to APMEA's operating income includes royalties and the company's share of McDonald's Japan after-tax results.
The third significant impact on McDonald's global results for 2014 was in Russia and the Ukraine. During 2014 McDonald's Europe experienced significant declines in company-operated margins, driven by weakening currencies and economic slowdown and store closures in these 2 markets. 
For the year, Europe reported a $90 million decrease in operating income, a 2% decline in constant currencies, with the segment's company-operated margins weighing heavily on results. The entire operating income decline for the year was solely driven by Russia and the Ukraine company-operated margin results. Over half of this margin decline reflects the significant impact of weakening currencies on imported commodity costs in these 2 markets. We expect this currency impact to significantly pressure the segment's company-operated margins again in 2015, especially in the first half.
While we expect to move beyond some of these unique events of last year, certain challenges remain. In the U.S, our turnaround initiatives to reignite momentum are in progress. Mike Andres and the U.S. leadership team are implementing a new, more nimble organizational structure that places decision-making back in the hands of the local market teams. The U.S. business is working aggressively to implement these changes, but it will take time before we see the benefits in the segment's overall financial results. 
In Russia, while all of our restaurants impacted by the temporary closures are back in operation, the market remains in a recession and the economic outlook is weak. More broadly, consumer confidence across most of Europe is forecasted to remain low throughout 2015.
In APMEA, in response to the supplier issue, customer recovery efforts initiated in September in each of our impacted markets. While sales trends in China showed signs of improvement during the fourth quarter, our best estimate is that it will take at least 3 to 6 more months for our business in China to return to a normalized level.
For McDonald's Japan, recovery from the supplier issue has not been as strong. At the same time, new consumer perception issues have emerged, which have further depressed sales and profitability. We expect these issues to impact results for the foreseeable future. Japan remains on our priority market list.
Next, I want to provide a 2014 update and a 2015 preview for some of our key financial items: commodities, pricing, G&A and currencies. I'll start with commodity costs for the U.S. and Europe. For the fourth quarter, U.S. commodity costs rose approximately 3.5%, primarily due to higher beef prices. For the full year, commodity costs ended up about 3%, which was the upper end of our forecast, as reductions in other commodities were more than offset by increases in beef. Commodity cost pressure is expected to continue into 2015 with a full year increase projected at 1.5% to 2.5%, again, driven primarily by beef. Excluding currency, Europe's commodity costs were up 1% for the fourth quarter and were relatively flat for the full year. For 2015, our full year outlook is for Europe's grocery basket to also reflect an increase of 1.5% to 2.5%.
To help offset this pressure we have taken some price increases. The U.S. ended 2014 with pricing up roughly 1.8%, notably lower than the 2013 increase of about 3% and lower than food-away-from-home inflation, which ended the year at 3%. During the second half of the year, we consciously did not completely offset the prior year price increases that rolled off. This further pressured our margins during the third and fourth quarters. And based on where we stand at the start of 2015, we expect this pressure to continue in the near term. Our price increases in Europe varied by market with the overall segment, excluding Russia, averaging about 2% year-over-year.
Consolidated G&A increased 9% in constant currencies for the fourth quarter and 5% in constant currencies for the year. For the quarter, these increases were driven largely by costs associated with positioning our U.S. business for the future, as well as costs related to our long-term growth initiatives. As I've mentioned in October, during 2014 we identified $100 million of G&A savings in the U.S. and corporate. These savings are being redirected toward our critical long-term growth initiatives in 2015. Our review of the corporate G&A spending was completed in December. We are nearing the completion of our full G&A review of the U.S. and will provide more details on these efforts later this quarter. 
While our G&A increased for both periods in 2014, I want to emphasize an important point. McDonald's operates in a pay-for-performance culture. As such, short-term incentive payouts for 2014 were 0 for all corporate and U.S. employees. In addition, 2014 performance negatively impacted management's long-term incentive compensation. We expect 2015 G&A to increase 7% to 8% in constant currencies, primarily due to the restoration of incentive pay. Excluding incremental incentive-based compensation, 2015 G&A is expected to increase 1% to 2%. More than 100% of this remaining increase relates to costs associated with the expansion of our strategic growth initiatives, including Experience of the Future and our digital strategy.
Foreign currencies proved to be another headwind in 2014, with translation negatively impacting fourth quarter EPS by $0.08 and full year EPS by $0.12. Given the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar against virtually all major foreign currencies, we expect a negative translation on first quarter 2015 of $0.08 to $0.10 per share and a full year impact of $0.35 to $0.40 per share. As usual, take this as directional guidance only because rates will change as we move throughout the year.
Finally, I'd like to share our current capital expenditure and restaurant opening plans for the upcoming year. Our plan for 2015 capital expenditure budget is approximately $2 billion, nearly $1 billion less than our initial capital expenditure plan last year. The decrease in our 2015 capital expenditures is driven primarily by an $800 million decrease in capital allocated to new restaurant openings. The most notable reductions will take place in markets experiencing the greatest challenges: China, Russia, Germany and the U.S.
Our $2 billion capital budget is divided relatively evenly, with approximately 1/2 earmarked for new restaurant openings and the remaining $1 billion dedicated to reinvestments. We continue to rigorously screen new restaurant opportunities to determine where they will generate the most attractive returns, given each market's potential, competitive environment and current industry dynamics. In 2015, we do expect to open more than 1,000 McDonald's restaurants, primarily in China, the U.S., Russia and France. This compares with about 1,300 restaurant openings in 2014. On a net basis, we expect 600 to 700 additions for the year compared with approximately 800 in 2014.  
The majority of our reinvestment dollars are slated for the U.S. and Europe. Expansion of the Create Your Taste burger platform in up to 2,000 restaurants in the U.S. and continued rollout of Experience of the Future in Europe accounts for a majority of the reinvestment dollars. 
Earlier this year, we outlined plans to pursue additional opportunities to enhance shareholder value by optimizing our capital and ownership structures and scrutinizing our G&A spending. As we close out the first year of our 3-year plan, I'd like to update you on our progress.
During 2014, we re-franchised over 400 restaurants against our 3-year target of at least 1,500. In the area of G&A, we identified and redirected nearly $100 million in savings for 2015 toward future long-term growth initiatives, such as the digital strategy and the McDonald's Experience of the Future. And as always we continue to explore additional savings opportunities.
As we move into 2015 we remain on track to deliver against our 3-year target to return $18 billion to $20 billion to shareholders between 2014 and 2016 in the form of dividends and share repurchases, having returned $6.4 billion to shareholders last year.
We're moving forward aggressively to regain business momentum. Together our strategy, strength and structure provide the capability and opportunity for us to change the trajectory of the business and our financial performance. We're on the right path. We've made tough decisions, are holding ourselves to rigorous standards of performance and are doing more with less. As a system, our charge over the coming year is to accelerate the pace of change and elevate the overall McDonald's experience in the eyes of our customers. 
Thanks. Now I'll turn it over to Chris to begin the Q&A."

I guess, I'm curious what the plan is to change the trajectory of sales? And then, the related question, I guess, is on Create Your Taste. I think, when we visited the restaurant with you, your meeting in December, that was the sixth restaurant with Create Your Taste. Now you're talking about 2,000. What is making you accelerate this from a financial standpoint? How confident are you that it works? And what are the economics of Create Your Taste, I guess, is the basic question?"

What I'll do, is I'll respond a little bit to the Create Your Taste piece. And then, I'm going to ask Mike to speak a little bit to some of those initiatives and actions that are actually in the nearer term, because I think that was really your question. Relative to Create Your Taste, please keep this in mind, we have been modeling out looking at Create Your Taste, Build Your Burger now for over 3 years. We started this in the Innovation Center. We moved it to a test restaurant in Romeoville. As you know, Joe, when we look at something, we look at all aspects of the implementation, from not only the production side and the service side, to crew interactions to consumer relevance. And so we've been doing quite a bit in the prior years. Then we've had this in a restaurant in test in the California area, in the SoCal area. We had it in test for about another year plus. Also keep in mind that we've had similar initiatives in markets outside of the U.S., markets like France on the service side of this. We've been looking at some of the digital application pieces of this in markets like Sweden. So these, all of these things have come together into what we today call Create Your Taste. So as we move forward now, this is not about just having had one restaurant. This is about having 3-plus, 4-odd years of looking at a concept and various pieces of that concept coming together. Create Your Taste is not just about the food from a customization or personalization perspective. It's also about the digital engagement and interaction of customers via kiosk or mobile ordering. It's also about a change relative to the interaction with our restaurant employees and how they engage and embrace the customers. It's also about the physical changes within the restaurant as well as how we present our food so that you can understand and see the freshness of the produce and the quality of our proteins. So this is a much broader piece than simply about the food itself. It is about the overall experience. So hopefully that answers that question. I'll ask Mike to speak a little bit to some of the things taking place in the U.S. because there are quite a few relative to the near-term."

In the nearer term, this is a market share game. It's always going to be a market share game. So we are -- we trust and we expect to see our more customized approach from our owner/operators. And in terms of a owner/operator-driven business plan, locally, it's based on the customer insights and the unique competitive sets in the marketplace. And these plans are going to be multi-layered in nature. You'll see disruptive value. You'll see new product news. You'll see service initiatives. And then our regional management in our new structure is empowered to commit the resources to make these plans come to life. I don't think it can be underestimated the power of ownership by owner/operators of their own plan, to execute it and own it and get results that we expect to get from those marketplaces. We're also looking at our marketing approach and making sure that we're leveraging the power of kind of the 3 layers of marketing. Clearly, we've got our local co-ops, we've got our national, and we also have local store marketing. And we're looking at a revamped marketing approach that better coordinates the specific roles and the deliverables of our co-op marketing plans, using more sophisticated analytics and data to understand the best way to approach. Certainly our national messaging is -- comes on top of it to help build our brand. We have unique relationship with our customers. And the recent advertising is rekindling that relationship in a way that we've been used to over the years and we've enjoyed. And then, the local market aspect of it is that we -- it's been our heritage, owner/operators and McDonald's being the hub of their local communities, very important to our turnaround plan as well as the local marketing store, the things that they're doing to combat the guy across the street from them. That's kind of the key to that. Then we're looking at how we address the simplicity -- or the complexity, I should say -- of our menu. We've simplified our menu, as we've talked about last month. That's going into place, as a matter of fact, this week. It includes reduction in the EVMs, other menu items. Our test market results, which included faster order times and faster total times in the drive-thru continue to see performance above the controls. So no single initiative is going to drive the improvements, but it's all these working together and things that will create a differentiated customer experience that our customers will notice. So we're looking at the U.S. as 22 different regions. As you know, there's multiple markets within those regions. We're already seeing pockets of success and expect those pockets of success to grow. And then, parallel to this short term, we're looking at a longer-term of refining our plans to make comprehensive changes that create an enhanced experience for the customers and continue and differentiate McDonald's from the other QSRs. So Don talked about CYT. You asked about it. That is only one element of this refined experience. It is comprehensive in nature. We are calling it the Experience of the Future. We're co-creating this with our owner/operators. And we will present the plan to all of our owner/operators at a national meeting in March. And right after that, we'll start aggressively expanding that up to 2,000 stores in 2015."

As we've talked a lot over these last couple of years, margins are such a top line game for us. So very critical in the margin area that the plans and initiatives that Mike talked about, especially in the U.S., start to gain momentum and get that traction back on the top line. Having said that, we are in a relatively low inflation environment. So pricing, as I noted in my commentary, pricing will still be probably below our average, if you assume the low inflationary environment continues. At the same time, multiple states are increasing minimum wages. We've got national health care impacting 2015 for the first time. That's going to hit the McOpCo margin for about 20 basis points. So I think, the margin in the U.S. will continue to be a little bit pressured by the combination of less price flexibility and a few of these costs. But long term, as the sales get back on track and start to grow, that is what will allow us to start to see the margin leverage. And the same kind of dynamics are impacting franchisees' restaurants as well. As they start to grow guest counts and cash flow, they will start to offset some of these pressures."

France is actually projected to have some IEO decline. We have been gaining market share in both France and the U.K., despite some of the difficult broader business or macro environments. Germany, we've lost some share, and we've talked about Germany as a priority market. What I will tell you is that, as a priority market there were a number of changes that Germany has implemented, some of those I spoke to relative to the actual team that we have there, our marketing leadership there. Actually, our agency, we changed out the agency in Germany. We're seeing a collaboration with the franchisees that is much stronger. So we're making some positive moves in our marketing plans, our menu plans, and we're seeing some changes relative to how we're addressing the consumer in those markets. So I'm feeling as if -- I mentioned Germany had a -- it seems to be we're seeing some recovery in Germany. We're cautious as we say it because there are some challenges across Europe, as we all know right now, relative to the euro itself. But we are seeing some positive things there. What I would tell you is broadly economic in many of the markets, with the exception of Germany, where we have some things to do in terms of our own internal plan. But for many of the other markets, we're gaining share or we're at a point where our businesses are continuing to compete on par with our competition there.

And I guess, first, as you get into the re-franchising program that you mentioned, are you finding opportunities to potentially go deeper? And I guess, the big picture question is, could you take the system to a much higher franchise percentage over time, say, into the 90s, or even approaching 100%, is that even practical? Or are you thinking about it differently? And then, maybe a second part of the financial question would be, are there ways to go deeper on some of the G&A cuts? I know you're reallocating $100 million. But are there other opportunities that you're seeing that might be able to sort of limit the increases that you'll see this year and into next year?"

And we feel comfortable in being able to accomplish that over the next 3 years. I'll tell you, the dialogue with the Area of the World presidents has increased around re-franchising and the benefits that, that can bring to the overall business. So we're not committing to a new target by any means. But we also said that after that 3-year period, franchising will continue to be something that we look at and go after. So 100% will never be, but certainly the ability to continue to increase that franchise percentage over time is something that we will look at. On the G&A side, I think we've been fairly consistent since we announced our plans for the savings that we believe there are significant growth opportunities available in this McDonald's Experience of the Future. And in fact, since we first started talking about it, we've gotten a little bit more aggressive in our plans to go after that in 2015. So for the short term, you've heard us say, we don't think we can cut our way to growth in the G&A area, and we recognize these are fairly significant amount of resources we're reinvesting. But we believe that it's right for the long-term benefit of the business, as Mike said, to kind of change the customer experience in the McDonald's restaurants. And as we think about reallocating kind of growth resources by cutting over $800 million of capital allocated to new restaurant openings and kind of redirecting it towards the McDonald's Experience of the Future, we think that's an appropriate and prudent thing to do in this environment."

We firmly believe, based upon the strength of our business and the reach of our business -- as you all know, we touch about 70 million customers a day. One of the things that we've not leveraged as strongly has been the whole digital engagement aspect. So as we embarked upon the digital strategy, we knew we were embarking upon something that was going to require us to make substantial investments to get it up to par, to be able to have mobile ordering and mobile payment, to be able to have promotional offerings that really, really were relevant to customers today across all age ranges. And so we have made substantial investments there. Our focus now is to focus on that in-restaurant experience of our existing base. So if we can improve upon that, whether that's digital engagement, the physical assets themselves, the way the restaurants look, the placement of kiosks in the restaurants, our food offerings in the restaurants, that is where we're making substantial investments. This is not that much different than when we decided that we were going to focus on McCafé at one point, pull back some of the new store capital at that time and reinvested it back in existing restaurants. And so we're doing something very similar as we look at the digital strategies, the in-restaurant experience and the Create Your Taste and food experiences in the restaurant. So as we look at this, we will continue to look at our expenditures, both internally and externally, but we'll also be mindful where we have opportunities in some of the markets to grow as those markets return to the level of growth and the level of, I'll say, stability that we think is going to be needed for us to be able to continue our new development strategies in some of those markets.

So John, the menu rationalization that is being rolled out as we speak, we are expecting to see the same results that we saw in the test markets, which included -- obviously would be a throughput improvement because we're making it easier to order for our customers, less complexity on the kitchen, so the time to get the food out of the kitchen and to the windows increases (sic). So we're seeing improved sales results against the control markets on our tests. We expect to see that happen in the rest of the country. I did not speak specifically about pricing, but I did speak about value and that the markets are clearly more targeted in terms of their efforts around value and competitive threats within the marketplaces. So we are seeing more aggressive, disruptive value offers in the marketplace. As a matter of fact, we're moving to a strategy of more flexibility for the local markets to price Dollar Menu & More, which is complementing their other value messages so that the level of aggressiveness and the tactics can be more reflective of the customer expectations, the specific competitive activity and the economic realities of each market."

So it takes some of the pressure off of a lot of the other menu items that we would have on -- showing on the menu at any given time. In terms of the overall menu pipeline and what we're looking at it today. Obviously food is a high priority. For me personally I think that's the foundation of where we're taking the business moving forward and what the expectations of the consumer are. So we're seeing this localization of more locally relevant products that are being drawn or pulled from the marketplace as they get into the customer insights. We're looking at building our culinary talent. To support our talented U.S. chefs we're including our supplier team of chefs. We've got some outside consultants who bring a fresh and forward-thinking perspective on our menu vision. We've got -- looking at educating America on our food. So this conversation about ""Our Food. Your Questions."" giving them facts. We've seen 20 million hits on YouTube, 4.1 billion earned media impressions. So that's resonating with our consumers. And all about the quality story -- we have to make sure that our quality aligns with the consumers' definition of quality moving forward. And so we're going to be very aggressive in that area looking at -- we're working with our owner/operators to revise our product vision for a very different future as led by the consumer, from the provenance, to the label ingredients, to the processes we use to bring the food from farm to table. We have opportunities to clean up our ingredient list and enhance the taste. And as you mentioned, a lot of innovation going on, including Create Your Taste, we're evolving our menu in response to a lot of the consumer trends. We're launching new products at a national level this year, and we're complementing that on differentiated products at a local level. As I mentioned, allowing the marketplaces to address the specific and regional taste that exists out there today. So a lot of new product news to see in the coming year and news on our food in general."

We have Australia at a point that by year-end, they will have implemented nearly 900 restaurants on the platform. Again, it is a much more integrated platform. So it encompasses service.

So the kiosk applications, mobile applications, those things as well as being able to still approach the business in a traditional sense from -- through the front counter or through drive-thru. We are looking at all aspects of how we bring this new food offering and customer choice and customization to all the customers who want to experience McDonald's. And so we are seeing some positives in the markets, clearly, otherwise we would not be implementing this. I would tell you that from a service perspective, no matter what you implement throughout the years in the McDonald's system, initially what you're going to see is a slight service increase -- or decrease, I'd say, in terms of the effectiveness of us being able to serve in the initial month or 2. And then that should come right back, and we should be able to be even more efficient. That's the same thing that we've seen with Create Your Taste thus far. So thus far, we're very positive on Create Your Taste, but we're also mindful that we need to do this the right way. So we're not rushing to try to implement the U.S. over a 1- or 2-year period. We're looking at the applications to make sure that they get the impact that we want from a guest count, a sales and an average check perspective, which is also a huge aspect, as well as the halo around the freshness of our food and all of our produce. So we're excited about what we see thus far, but we're also cautious about how we continue to implement this across the year."

And I guess -- and then, the second question I wanted to ask was a follow-up on the -- when you're talking about improving the quality halo and the provenance. When I look at the competitive set, what I would call traditional QSRs, there are some that are doing quite well without any of that with, I think, just sort of a core competency around speed and service. Mike, maybe you could talk about diagnosing that, why some of your very direct competitors seem to be doing well even in the absence of fitting in with some of these trends about quality and provenance and the sort of the fast casual direction?"

On the first part, relative to Create Your Taste in different dynamics, or better yet, Experience of the Future in different dynamics. Because what France is doing is not an implementation of Create Your Taste at this point. They have implemented multiple order points. And now, you can place an order through the kiosk, front counter, table service, Web ordering, et cetera, mobile ordering. And when you look at the table service in France, yes, there is a stronger skew to in-store versus drive-thru. However, I would tell you this. What we do is look at things like that, and we will tailor those based upon the market that we're implementing in. So we already know that in the U.S., with the restaurants that are implementing Create Your Taste, that we've seen very positive results. Therefore, what we're doing is pulling customers who have a little bit more time and want to experience the restaurant inside to come inside the restaurant. We've made tremendous investments in terms of reimaging. And actually we have more customers that are seeing those investments in this environment and with the offering of Create Your Taste. So these will be -- they will be modeled for the various markets around the world based upon what is going to appeal to customers the most. France will not be implementing Create Your Taste at the same pace that, say, Australia has. Australia is at a different point with regard to, say, Web ordering than France has been. So we'll take -- we'll learn from all of those things as we bring this forward. But nonetheless, Create Your Taste, table service in France, kiosk applications across Europe, all of those things have been successful for us. And really, the Experience of the Future aspect pulls them all together. And so you're going to see some variations across markets. But clearly we'll look at the performance metrics to make sure we're moving forward effectively. This is not unlike, again, McCafé was very different in Australia than it is in the U.S. Yet and still, McCafé has worked in both. On the other side relative to traditional QSRs, I would offer this. No one is really shining that brightly relative to the traditional QSRs space. I think, what we're talking about at McDonald's is appealing more to the consumers that are out there that are IEO customers. So it's not about a QSR thing or a fast casual thing, it's about good-tasting food, it's about affordability, it is about transparency as a brand, it's about a great service experience that gives me choice. Those are the things that we're putting in place, and those are the things that will help us propel this business and move it forward. So we're not gauging ourselves by other QSRs, if you would. We're gauging ourselves by the market opportunity, and we want to do that. It's -- I would also tell you that as we look forward at the markets around the world, each of those markets, as we said today, is very different and at different places. So they will be able to bring the Experience of the Future to life in their markets relative to their customer bases. But we are not skipping over the existing execution of the core products that we have, the core menu that we have, core service expectations, quality, service, cleanliness, those things are important in every single market we have around the world today."

They own and operate 81% of our restaurants. And without them, we would not have been able to endure those things, which we have over the last couple of years.

Since stepping into this role nearly 3 months ago, I've been relentlessly focused on assessing current plans, challenging our people and seeing some differently about what we're doing and how we're doing it and working with senior leadership to determine the best path forward. As we announced this morning, we've scheduled a separate call on the 4th of May to share the initial details of our turnaround plan. We appreciate your focus -- sorry, your patience as we focus today on our first quarter results and the overall approach we're taking as we develop plans to reimage the business. 
First quarter performance reinforces our ability to stabilize and improve our underlying business performance. Let me start by sharing an overview of recent performance across the top 9 markets that contribute most of our overall consolidated results, starting with Australia, the U.K. and Canada, which are trending positive. Australia is in the early changes of turning around its business through a multifaceted approach to enhance brand appeal for consumers. This encouraged meaningful enhancements to our menu, including both core and new menu items across several categories, value platforms and pent-up restaurant operations. The U.K. continues its strong track record of positive performance with first quarter comparable sales representing the market's 36th consecutive quarter of growth. These results reflect the market's diligent execution of this customer-centric plan that span multiple initiatives including food choice and food quality, marketing and promotions and enhancements to the service experience such as expanding drive-thru capacity during peak periods and building the overnight experience. In addition, in Canada, strong promotional performance and new menus drove average check and positive comparable sales performance for the quarter. 
Next are Germany and China, 2 markets that have shown recent signs of improvement. In Germany, negative comparable sales trends have moderated the last 2 quarters. The market has strengthened its value platform and, at the same time, promoted premium products and add-on purchases to the average check. We expect recovery in these markets to remain uneven, however, as reflected in markets weaker comparable sales performance. China continues to recover from last year's supplier issue. [indiscernible] regained brand trust are working and the market remains on track to return to a normalized level of performance by midyear.
And finally, the U.S., France, Russia and Japan, where challenges persist. U.S. results remain disappointing. Recent actions taken by Mike and his leadership team, including implementing a more efficient operating structure, simplifying the menu and holding the U.S. turnaround summit with operators in March, are helping to create a renewed sense of energy and focus around better delivery of local customer needs.
In both France and Russia, consumer confidence remains low end challenging macroeconomic conditions continue to negatively impact results. Despite a declining IEO industry, France continues to maintain market share with efforts to strengthen the value platform and enhance the customer service experience on differentiating the brand in the market. Amidst external pressures in Russia, the team remains focused on driving sales through strong product and promotional offers, growing the breakfast business and initiatives that focus on rebuilding brand trust to consumers in the market.
Japan's recovery from the supply issue has not been as strong as China, and subsequent consumer perception issues have further depressed sales and profitability. As evidenced by last week's announcement of the business revitalization plan, the Japanese and APMEA teams are intensely focused on addressing the significant challenges in this market. So we expect results will continue to be negatively impacted for the foreseeable future, and Kevin will provide more details around our first quarter results in a moment. 
Let me shift gears now and discuss the approach I'm taking to take McDonald's into the future, my operating principles, if you will. First is a greater emphasis on personal accountability [indiscernible] honest and fair but don't dispense forced kindness. Where we need to fix the fundamentals, we need to act now. And where we need to make an impact I'm now looking for incremental steps. We intend to make meaningful impact with customers and how they perceive our brand and our food. I hold people accountable for tangible actions and outputs. I'm not going to show you, and I hold myself accountable with the same high standards.
My second operating principle is grounded in the customer. As a retail business, we must be even more customer-centric. This means deeper understanding, better listening, better segmentation, genuine sharp insights regarding what our customers wants and need and where they want it as determined from the smart user meter and analytics. We need to be the best in knowing what matters most to customers, and we will focus our best talent and prioritize spending where it will ultimately support our turnaround.
Our third philosophy is progress over perfection. We will try new things, move faster what works and even faster from what doesn't. And when we find winning plays, we will be more nimble, much likely with the rollout of Apple just last fall. For close contact we're going live for 12 weeks, we can make meaningful changes for customers in weeks. We just have to do it more often. 
My final approach to leading is by champion complicity with simplifying, a greater transparency, accountability and speed. We're making the business more responsive to market conditions by using our scale advantage more effectively. We cannot afford to carry legacy attitudes and legacy thinking, and we won't.
Our overall vision is McDonald's to be seen as a model progressive for the company delivering a contemporary customer experience. [indiscernible] is about getting the brand to where we need to be today and progressive is about doing what it takes to being McDonald's our customers will expect tomorrow. We're already moving more assertively in this direction, with actions that delight our customers and energize our brand. For example, we recently committed to enhance the benefits to employees at company-owned restaurants in the U.S., including a wage increase and paid time-off for full and part-time employees. In March, we announced in the U.S. that we will stop using antibiotics that are important to human medicine and that chicken supply chain within the next 2 years. And there are plans to feature 100% sirloin burgers for a limited time in the U.S. along with the current assessment of all-day breakfast. 
We also [indiscernible] a significant effort to excite our customers and bring the world together virtually I'm loving it 24. About 70,000 [ph] people participate in the events, which included 24 hours of McDonald's-inspired disruptive creativity in major cities around the world, and they garnered more than 2 billion impressions across public relations stories and social media interactions. 
Last month, the German team opened a new 500-seat flagship restaurant in Frankfurt showcasing our most modern digital and service amenities. And just yesterday, we announced our global commitments on deforestation which conserves our aspiration to end deforestation throughout our supply chain. 
We are harnessing the power inherent in the McDonald's brand and in our network of value franchisees, employees and supplier partners to make this great brand even greater. One of the advantages of my broad experience within McDonald's and running other restaurant chains is seeing other cultures, different structures, different models. Through this experience, I see McDonald's and its fundamental advantages, challenges and opportunities much more clearly. It is this perspective that's helping me look objectively at the business and make decisions to position McDonald's to deliver enduring profitable growth for shareholders and the system. Thank you for joining us this morning. And now I'd like to turn it over to Kevin."

We begin 2015 taking action to lay the foundation for McDonald's turnaround as we work to address the significant internal and external headwinds that are impacting our business. Today, I'd like to begin by discussing the performance factors that impacted our first quarter results including the strategic charges taken in the quarter. Then I'll provide updates on key financial metrics and close with some final thoughts about our path to realizing our long-term potential. 
Our financial model and, therefore, my remarks start with top line sales. First quarter comparable sales were down 2.3%, reflecting negative guest traffic across all of our geographic segments. APMEA's first quarter comp sales decline of 8.3% has the largest impact on our global performance, with Japan and China posting declines of 32.3% and 4.8%, respectively. While these results are partly due to the lingering impact of the APMEA supplier issue, Japan's performance reflects the broad-based consumer perception challenges that the market is working to overcome. Japan accounts for the lion's share of this segment's quarterly comparable sales decline. Sales trend in China continued to show sequential improvement as we move through the quarter. And Australia remains a bright spot, posting its third consecutive quarter of positive comparable sales.
In the U.S., comparable sales were down 2.6% for the quarter as the segment's slightly positive breakfast day parts was offset by weakness across all other day parts. We are working to enhance the customer experience with locally relevant taste, a simplified menu and compelling value offerings. Europe comparable sales ended the quarter down 0.6% with positive performance in the U.K. more than offset by weak results in France and Russia. Looking ahead to April, global comparable sales are expected to be negative.
This weak top line performance accounted for about half of the constant currency decline in operating income for the first quarter. The other half of the decline in operating income is attributable to the $195 million of strategic charges taken in the quarter to optimize the business. The first component of the charges totaling $85 million includes the asset write-offs related to our refranchising initiative as we made decisions to sell certain restaurants to develop licensees. 
The next component of these charges is related to the strategic decisions to close about 350 underperforming restaurants primarily in Japan, the U.S. and China. These restaurant closings are in addition to the 350 global restaurant closings originally planned for 2015. The total charge for asset write-offs related to these incremental closings was approximately $72 million. Most of these restaurants were not contributing to our overall profitability or cash flow, and we'll continue to review our restaurant portfolio with the intent of optimizing our asset base around the world. 
The final component of the charges was $38 million related to restructuring costs for our U.S. business. This amount consists primarily of employee severance and other related costs. Earnings per share for the quarter was down $0.37, which includes $0.17 related to the strategic charges and $0.09 in negative foreign currency impact. Excluding the impact of the charges and foreign currency translation, earnings per share for the quarter was down $0.11 or 9%. 
From an operating perspective, with 81% of our global restaurants franchised, the largest driver of operating income continues to be our franchise margins, which declined $152 million to $1.6 billion, a 1% decrease in constant currencies. Global company-operated margin dollars declined $164 million to $560 million for the quarter, a 13% decrease in constant currencies. The company-operated margin percent decreased 180 basis points to 14.3%, reflecting negative comparable guest counts across all segments as well as higher commodity and labor costs. 
Next I want to provide an update on our commodities, pricing, foreign currency impact and cash return to shareholders. I'll start with commodity costs for the U.S. and Europe. For the first quarter, U.S. commodity costs rose approximately 2% primarily due to higher beef prices. To help offset this pressure, we took some price increases. Our first quarter pricing in the U.S. year-over-year was up roughly 2%, which was below food-away-from-home inflation of around 3%. The current projected increase in food-away-from-home inflation for the full year is 2% to 3%. Excluding currency, Europe's commodity costs were relatively flat in the first quarter. Our price increases in Europe vary by market with the overall segment, excluding Russia, averaging about 2% year-over-year.
Now turning to foreign currency impact. The U.S. dollar has strengthened dramatically against nearly all of the world's other major currencies. During the last 8 months, the dollar has experienced its fastest rise in 40 years. At these levels, foreign currency translation is having a significant impact on our reported results as evidenced by the $700 million impact to our first quarter reported revenues and a $0.09 impact to our first quarter reported EPS. Based on current exchange rates, we now expect foreign currency translation to negatively impact our results by $0.13 to $0.14 in the second quarter and $0.40 to $0.45 for the full year. As usual, take the directional guidance only because rates will change as we move throughout the year, and keep in mind, this is an accounting translation impact more than a cash impact.
Despite our top line and margin pressures, our business continues to generate significant cash flow. In addition to reinvesting in the business to drive future growth, we returned $1.4 billion to our shareholders in dividends and share repurchases in the first quarter. 
As Steve mentioned, we're taking a close look at our organization, challenging ourselves and the status quo. Our goal is to position the company for enduring profitable growth. We must get back to better leveraging the benefits of our business model, including the entrepreneurial spirit of our franchisees. We must utilize our considerable resources more efficiently and we must meet our customers' evolving needs more consistently. I'm energized by the challenges before us, and I look forward to working with Steve, Pete and the broader McDonald's System to bring our vision to reality. Thank you. Now I'll turn it back to Chris to begin our Q&A."

In the U.S., I've heard a lot over the last few months about the need for more simplicity, needing to improve speed, which I think suggest a diagnosis of a throughput problem. But when you look at the underperformance in the comps versus the industry and on an absolute basis, it does suggest a bigger, more pure demand issue. And so the question is, what's going on over the next couple months to really drive resurgence in guest counts that may be more dramatic than simplification? I guess I've already extended breakfast is going well. What's the plan there? As far as new products being rolled out more rapidly like you guys just you did the chicken sandwich, is that something we're going to see more? If you could just talk about that altogether, that will be great."

So you're absolutely right, there is no one single solution to getting any of our business moving. We have strong plans in place. I guess if I can dissect that question of yours, one is how we're going to drive demand and secondly how we're going to manage demand private. The driving demand is going to be driven through both national and local menu, so we have some strong -- some exciting product pipeline ahead. So most recently, we've announced the sirloin burger, which we believe will be a favorite with customers and have broad resonance, but we also are liberating the creativity and, I guess, the insights of our local markets to develop local food menu items that better resonate with the local customer base. So the demand driving, I believe, that we can operate at 2 levels. That said and done, we're still going to make the entire McDonald's experience a little easier for our customers and a little easier for our crew, and that's where the simplification piece comes in. And it's not simply the menu simplification. It's what else can we take off the workload of our teams in their restaurants to enable them to focus on what really matters, which is taking care of customers. So menu simplification will certainly help, but as with the initial phase of that from January where I've not seen a significant sales uplift from it, but we have seen, it provided us with easing of operational complexity. There will be further moves on menu simplification coming up now because we have a number of tests in place and we can share those with you as the results become clearer. But also there's other things we can do to take workload out of the restaurants and just simplifying the job of our managers and crews in the front line and always taking care of customers. So 2 things, driving demand and then meeting demand, and we've got actions on both."

So we referred to one of the pieces of the charge as cost related to write-offs as we made decisions to sell restaurants to developmental licensees. That's being consistent with our past practice as we make decisions to sell whether it's restaurants or countries to somebody, we need to look and see what -- how it's valued and what we believe we can get in return to selling those restaurants. And as we make a decision and evaluate kind of the fair value versus what we have recorded on our books, it requires us to potentially write down the net book value to get to the cost -- the selling price we're going to realize. That's what those amounts relate to. It will be consistent with prior practice. We made some decisions to actually sell some restaurants to developmental licensees and we need to now record the cost of it. It equals what we expect to realize went we realized those restaurants."

So the initial app that we'll be launching will be focusing primarily on the experience, just trying to make that customer experience smoother and more convenient and then future iterations which we are already building up the pipeline I got to say, will further enhance that experience and introduce more [indiscernible] of fun to it . So I would not really be -- personally, we are not building in a sales build in relationship to this by 2015, but we do see it as a big business driver as we look out."

So looking back 3 to 4 years, rather than anything we missed through consumer insight, I think perhaps the challenge we let ourselves where we had 4 or 5 growth initiatives working together really through the 2 [indiscernible]. So from '03 to about 2010, 2011, we had a number of different growth platforms that worked and they worked around the world, different markets [indiscernible] them in different orders. But everything from delivering great quality coffee, which for breakfast business, going to extend it now as our store reimaging program, for example, just to name 3. Perhaps what we didn't foresee and not respond as good as we could on ourselves is to create that future pipeline of growing platforms. But sometimes the consumer were going through that, but sometimes we're going to take that into our own hands, and that is probably perhaps something as we look back through our history we wish we could have done a little better. The one trend I would say we're working hard to address now is general consumer desire to be part of something big for this individual, and that's where the whole personalization piece comes in. Whether that's the way we engage and communicate with customers, which is I believe technology will help us get there where we have a much more personal relationship kind of level the customers are happy with, but also on the menu side. That's where the customization of food comes in and then on to your second point of the Create Your Taste. One of the pieces we have there is we have an ability to test these things out and learn. So Create Your Taste, for example, is [indiscernible] within our broader McDonald's experience in the future of ambition. We have really concerted [indiscernible] in Australia and we will have 1 or 2 markets up and running within the U.S., and we will be able to see consumers respond to that pretty quickly how that in-store experience builds out and plays out and then, again, in relation to your second point, how that work through the drive-thru. And so I would tell, we have a number of other ways that we can perhaps customize our menu, personalize our menu that we are also working on. We have test sales going on around the country and around the world to better learn how we can best meet. The consumer need is around personalization. It is powerful. We believe we can deliver against it. Our confidence is, when we start to really connect on that level and unlock the benefits of personalization of 69 million customers a day that will have a significant and drive long-term sustaining growth."

So when I talk about legacy thinking and legacy attitude, I mean we have been phenomenally successful for 60 years, and there's so many good reasons for that. And much of that I would not ever wish to change on challenges, very precious to us and withstand this -- in good stead for the next 60 years. However, there's a certain conservatism and incrementalism that builds into that. And again, as a company, that has not necessarily been a bad thing. But when you do need to make a step change, our organization doesn't naturally go there. It needs to be led there. But in my experience at McDonald's, whenever we've made substantial decisions and substantial changes, we are 1 to 3 adaptable, one step has been spelled out. But we wouldn't naturally take ourselves there as an organization. So with the team around me, we're challenging some of the conventional thinking on multiple fronts and some of that we're going to share with you over time. With regards to whether 7 weeks will get people into the state of readiness, I think there's a hunger and an interest in our business to embrace change. So I mean I hear it as I get into the markets, hear it from the other operators. And I think there's a pull and a hunger in the field for what are we going to stand for, where we're heading and how are we going to get there. And I'm not new to most of the McDonald's System. I'm new in position. I totally recognize that, and different expectations and accountabilities come with that, but I think our track record and my history in the McDonald's is relatively well around the place.

Since stepping into this role nearly 3 months ago, I've been relentlessly focused on assessing current plans, challenging our people and teams to think differently about what we're doing and how we're doing it and working with senior leadership to determine the best path forward. As we announced this morning, we've scheduled a separate call on the 4th of May to share the initial details of our turnaround plan. We appreciate your focus -- sorry, your patience as we focus today on our first quarter results and the overall approach we're taking as we develop plans to reenergize the business. 
First quarter performance reinforces our imperative to stabilize and improve our underlying business performance. Let me start by sharing an overview of recent performance across the top 9 markets that contribute most of our overall consolidated results, starting with Australia, the U.K. and Canada, which are trending positive. Australia is in the early changes of turning around its business through a multifaceted approach to enhance brand appeal for consumers. This encourage meaningful enhancements to our menu, including both core and new menu items across several categories, value platforms and better restaurant operations. The U.K. continues its strong track record of positive performance with first quarter comparable sales representing the market's 36th consecutive quarter of growth. These results reflect the market's diligent execution of its customer-centric plan that span multiple initiatives, including food choice and food quality, marketing and promotions and enhancements to the service experience such as expanding drive-thru capacity during peak periods and building the overnight experience. In addition, in Canada, strong promotional performance and new menus drove average check and positive comparable sales performance for the quarter. 
Next are Germany and China, 2 markets that have shown recent signs of improvement. In Germany, negative comparable sales trends have moderated the last 2 quarters. The market has strengthened its value platform and at the same time, promoted premium products and add-on purchases to the average check. We expect recovery in this market to remain uneven, however, as reflected in March's weak comparable sales performance. China continues to recover from last year's supplier issue. Efforts to regain brand trust are working and the market remains on track to return to a normalized level of performance by midyear.
And finally, the U.S., France, Russia and Japan, where challenges persist. U.S. results remain disappointing. Recent actions taken by Mike and his leadership team, including implementing a more efficient operating structure, simplifying the menu and holding the U.S. turnaround summit with operators in March, are helping to create a renewed sense of energy and focus around better delivery of local customer needs.
In both France and Russia, consumer confidence remains low and challenging macroeconomic conditions continue to negatively impact results. Despite a declining IEO industry, France continues to maintain market share with efforts to strengthen the value platform and enhance the customer service experience on differentiating the brand in the market. Amidst external pressures in Russia, the team remains focused on driving sales through strong product and promotional offers, growing the breakfast business and initiatives that focus on rebuilding brand trust with consumers in the market.
Japan's recovery from the supply issue has not been as strong as China, and subsequent consumer perception issues have further depressed sales and profitability. As evidenced by last week's announcement of the business revitalization plan, the Japanese and APMEA teams are intensely focused on addressing the significant challenges in this market. So we expect results will continue to be negatively impacted for the foreseeable future, and Kevin will provide more details around our first quarter results in a moment. 
Let me shift gears now and discuss the approach I'm taking to lead McDonald's into the future, my operating principles, if you will. First is a greater emphasis on personal accountability. I'm honest and fair but I don't dispense forced kindness. Where we need to fix the fundamentals, we need to act now. And where we need to make an impact, I'm now looking for incremental steps. We intend to make meaningful impact with customers and how they perceive our brand and our food. I hold people accountable for tangible actions and outputs, and I can assure you that I hold myself accountable with these same high standards.
My second operating principle is grounded in the customer. As a retail business, we must be even more customer-centric. This means deeper understanding, better listening, better segmentation, genuine sharp insights regarding what our customers want and need and when they want it as determined from the smart use of data and analytics. We need to be the best at knowing what matters most to customers, and we will focus our best talent and prioritize spending where it will optimally support our turnaround.
Our third philosophy is progress over perfection. We will try new things, move fast with what works and even faster from what doesn't. And when we find winning plays, we will be more nimble, much like we did with the rollout of Apple Pay this last fall. For the first contact to going live took 12 weeks. We can make meaningful changes for customers in weeks, we just have to do it more often. 
My final approach to leading is by champion simplicity with simplifying, a greater transparency, accountability and speed. We're making the business more responsive to market conditions by using our scale advantage more effectively. We cannot afford to carry legacy attitudes and legacy thinking, and we won't.
My overall vision is for McDonald's to be seen as a modern progressive burger company delivering a contemporary customer experience. Modern is about getting the brand to where we need to be today, and progressive is about doing what it takes to be the McDonald's our customers will expect tomorrow. We're already moving more assertively in this direction, with actions that delight our customers and energize our brand. For example, we recently committed to enhance the benefits to employees at company-owned restaurants in the U.S., including a wage increase and paid time-off for full and part-time crew employees. In March, we announced in the U.S. that we will stop using antibiotics that are important to human medicine in our chicken supply chain within the next 2 years. And there are plans to feature 100% sirloin burgers for a limited time in the U.S., along with a current zest on all-day breakfast. 
We also undertook a significant effort to excite our customers and bring the world together virtually with I'm Lovin' It 24. About 70,000 people participate in the events, which included 24 hours of McDonald's-inspired disruptive creativity in major cities around the world, and it garnered more than 2 billion impressions across public relation stories and social media interactions. 
Last month, the German team opened a new 500-seat flagship restaurant in Frankfurt showcasing our most modern digital and service amenities. And just yesterday, we announced our global commitment on deforestation, which conserves our aspiration to end deforestation throughout our supply chain. 
We are harnessing the power inherent in the McDonald's brand and in our network of valued franchisees, employees and supplier partners to make this great brand even greater. One of the advantages of my broad experience within McDonald's and running other restaurant chains is seeing other cultures, different structures, different models. Through this experience, I see McDonald's and its fundamental advantages, challenges and opportunities much more clearly. It is this perspective that's helping me look objectively at the business and make decisions to position McDonald's to deliver enduring profitable growth for shareholders and the system. Thank you for joining us this morning. And now I'd like to turn it over to Kevin."

We begin 2015 taking action to lay the foundation for McDonald's turnaround as we work to address the significant internal and external headwinds that are impacting our business. Today, I'd like to begin by discussing t",1017,"Thanks, Steve, and hello, everyone. We begin 2015 taking action to lay the foundation for McDonald's turnaround as we work to address the significant internal and external headwinds that are impacting our business. Today, I'd like to begin by discussing the performance factors that impacted our first quarter results, including the strategic charges taken in the quarter. Then I'll provide updates on key financial metrics and close with some final thoughts about our path to realizing our long-term potential. 
Our financial model and therefore, my remarks start with top line sales. First quarter comparable sales were down 2.3%, reflecting negative guest traffic across all of our geographic segments. APMEA's first quarter comp sales decline of 8.3% has the largest impact on our global performance, with Japan and China posting declines of 32.3% and 4.8%, respectively. While these results are partly due to the lingering impact of the APMEA supplier issue, Japan's performance reflects the broad-based consumer perception challenges that the market is working to overcome. Japan accounts for the lion's share of this segment's quarterly comparable sales decline. Sales trends in China continue to show sequential improvement as we move through the quarter. And Australia remains a bright spot, posting its third consecutive quarter of positive comparable sales.
In the U.S., comparable sales were down 2.6% for the quarter as the segment's slightly positive breakfast day parts was offset by weakness across all other day parts. We are working to enhance the customer experience with locally relevant taste, a simplified menu and compelling value offerings. Europe comparable sales ended the quarter down 0.6% with positive performance in the U.K. more than offset by weak results in France and Russia. Looking ahead to April, global comparable sales are expected to be negative.
This weak top line performance accounted for about half of the constant currency decline in operating income for the first quarter. The other half of the decline in operating income is attributable to the $195 million of strategic charges taken in the quarter to optimize the business. The first component of the charges totaling $85 million includes the asset write-offs related to our refranchising initiative as we made decisions to sell certain restaurants to developmental licensees. 
The next component of these charges is related to the strategic decisions to close about 350 underperforming restaurants primarily in Japan, the U.S. and China. These restaurant closings are in addition to the 350 global restaurant closings originally planned for 2015. The total charge for asset write-offs related to these incremental closings was approximately $72 million. Most of these restaurants were not contributing to our overall profitability or cash flow, and we'll continue to review our restaurant portfolio with the intent of optimizing our asset base around the world. 
The final component of the charges was $38 million related to restructuring costs for our U.S. business. This amount consists primarily of employee severance and other related costs. Earnings per share for the quarter was down $0.37, which includes $0.17 related to the strategic charges and $0.09 in negative foreign currency impact. Excluding the impact of the charges and foreign currency translation, earnings per share for the quarter was down $0.11 or 9%. 
From an operating perspective, with 81% of our global restaurants franchised, the largest driver of operating income continues to be our franchise margins, which declined $152 million to $1.6 billion, a 1% decrease in constant currencies. Global company-operated margin dollars declined $164 million to $560 million for the quarter, a 13% decrease in constant currencies. The company-operated margin percent decreased 180 basis points to 14.3%, reflecting negative comparable guest counts across all segments as well as higher commodity and labor costs. 
Next, I want to provide an update on our commodities, pricing, foreign currency impact and cash return to shareholders. I'll start with commodity costs for the U.S. and Europe. For the first quarter, U.S. commodity costs rose approximately 2% primarily due to higher beef prices. To help offset this pressure, we took some price increases. Our first quarter pricing in the U.S. year-over-year was up roughly 2%, which was below food-away-from-home inflation of around 3%. The current projected increase in food-away-from-home inflation for the full year is 2% to 3%. Excluding currency, Europe's commodity costs were relatively flat in the first quarter. Our price increases in Europe vary by market with the overall segment, excluding Russia, averaging about 2% year-over-year.
Now turning to foreign currency impact. The U.S. dollar has strengthened dramatically against nearly all of the world's other major currencies. During the last 8 months, the dollar has experienced its fastest rise in 40 years. At these levels, foreign currency translation is having a significant impact on our reported results as evidenced by the $700 million impact to our first quarter reported revenues and a $0.09 impact to our first quarter reported EPS. Based on current exchange rates, we now expect foreign currency translation to negatively impact our results by $0.13 to $0.14 in the second quarter and $0.40 to $0.45 for the full year. As usual, take this as directional guidance only because rates will change as we move throughout the year, and keep in mind, this is an accounting translation impact more than a cash impact.
Despite our top line and margin pressures, our business continues to generate significant cash flow. In addition to reinvesting in the business to drive future growth, we returned $1.4 billion to our shareholders in dividends and share repurchases in the first quarter. 
As Steve mentioned, we're taking a close look at our organization, challenging ourselves and the status quo. Our goal is to position the company for enduring profitable growth. We must get back to better leveraging the benefits of our business model, including the entrepreneurial spirit of our franchisees. We must utilize our considerable resources more efficiently and we must meet our customers' evolving needs more consistently. I'm energized by the challenges before us, and I look forward to working with Steve, Pete and the broader McDonald's System to bring our vision to reality. Thank you. Now I'll turn it back to Chris to begin our Q&A."

In the U.S., I've heard a lot over the last few months about the need for more simplicity, needing to improve speed, which I think suggests a diagnosis of a throughput problem. But when you look at the underperformance in the comps versus the industry and on an absolute basis, it does suggest a bigger, more pure demand issue. And so the question is, what's going to be going on over the next couple months to really drive a resurgence in guest counts that may be more dramatic than simplification? I guess like already extended breakfast has going well. What's the plan there? As far as new products being rolled out more rapidly like you guys just you did the chicken sandwich, is that something we're going to see more of? If you could just kind of talk about that altogether, that will be great."

We have a strong plan in place. I guess if I can dissect that question of yours. One is how are we going to drive demand and then secondly, how are we going to manage that demand. The driving demand is going to be driven through both national and local menu news, so we have some strong -- some exciting product pipelines ahead. So most recently, we've announced the sirloin burger, which we believe will be a favorite with customers and have broad resonance, but also, we are liberating the creativity and I guess, the insights of our local markets to develop local food menu items that better resonate with the local customer base. So the demand driving, I believe, can operate at 2 levels. That said and done, we've still got to make the entire McDonald's experience just a little easier for our customers and a little easier for our crew, and that's where the simplification piece comes in. And it's not simply the menu simplification. It's what else can we take off the workload of our teams in their restaurants to enable them to focus on what really matters, which is taking care of customers. So menu simplification will certainly help, that has been the initial phase of that from January where we have not seen a significant sales uplift from it, but we have seen, it provide us with easing of operational complexity. There will be further moves on menu simplification coming up now because we have a number of tests in place and we can share those with you as the results become clearer. But also, there's other things we can do to take workload out of the restaurants and just simplifying the job for our managers and crews so they can focus on their frontline role, which is taking care of customers. So 2 things, driving demand and then meeting demand, and we've got actions on both."

First related to expansion, you saw we took everything out from the outlook. Obviously, we're still opening restaurants but we'll update all the kind of outlook pieces, including expansion on our call on May 4. Related to the charges, a couple of things. So we referred to one of the pieces of the charge as cost related to write-offs as we made decisions to sell restaurants to developmental licensees. That would be consistent with our past practice as we make decisions to sell whether it's restaurants or countries to somebody, we need to look and see what -- how it's valued and what we believe we can get in return for selling that -- those restaurants. And as we make a decision and evaluate kind of the fair value versus what we have recorded on our books, it requires us to potentially write down the net book value to get to the cost -- the selling price we're going to realize. That's what that -- those amounts relate to. It will be consistent with prior practice. We made some decisions to actually sell some restaurants to developmental licensees and we need to now record the cost of it. It equals what we expect to realize when we tell those restaurants."

On one hand, it would seem like your franchisees are probably among the most successful in quick service, whether it's from a sales or a profit standpoint. But at the same time, you can imagine the recent weakness doesn't drive some frustration. So I'm just wondering with that kind of as a backdrop, what's the greatest pushback or perhaps just maybe suggestions you get from franchisees in terms of turning around, at least the U.S. business? That will be one thing because I'm guessing they have some pretty good insights. And secondly, do you typically discuss the initiatives and plans for the system with them ahead of time, for example, like the turnaround presentation, early May they get kind of an advanced look or do they apply it on the initiatives that you plan on putting out there?"

When business is a little tough like it is at the moment in the U.S. with cash flows being challenged, yes, frustrations do arise, as you'd expect. The wonderful thing about the relation we have with the operators is there's a really open dialogue. Their views and our views we share openly as we build these plans together so -- and I don't think that will change. As you go through turnarounds, I'm going to tell you from my experience in the past in other markets, they are a little bumpy by nature. It isn't just a straight line growth curve, and that will require -- it does require some bold and decisive decision-making, which on occasions can lead to 1 or 2 friction points and there's 1 or 2 things we can learn from 1 or 2 decisions we've made, but it doesn't mean the decisions we're making are wrong, far from it. I'm confident with the decisions that Mike's making in the U.S. and I'm making at a global level. And the ultimate objective from this clearly is, as you know with our business model of the three-legged store is that our supplier partners are owner-operated and the company succeed together, and I would love that to be an operator-led success as well. Nothing would thrill me more. With regards to what we're looking towards on May 4. There's been a number of measures we'll talk to, some which, clearly, you wouldn't expect me to talk to now some of which we'll be able to share some broader operating plans at the markets with the broader audience.

It's something we are excited about here, I've got to say. As you probably know my previous role, I was responsible for trying to establish our digital team in the region here, and we've built a highly skilled and capable group who are managing that for us. We are moving, without a doubt, from a world of mass marketing to what I describe as mass personalization, and clearly, technology allows us to do that now which allows us to build a much more meaningful relationship with our customers to shift from a transactional relationship into a far more engaging and meaningful purposeful relationship where we can understand their needs on an individual basis rather than a generic basis. We are building a what we call our global mobile app. We will be launching it in the U.S. in the second half of this year. And there are 2 elements to our digital vision. One is the experience side and the other is the engagement side. The experience is what -- how can we use technology just to make the day-to-day customer experience easier and more convenient, and the engagement side is really more about the fun part of the brand. So the initial app that we'll be launching will be focusing primarily on the experience, just trying to make the day-to-day customer experience smoother and more convenient and then future iterations, which we are already building up the pipeline, I've got to say, will further enhance that experience and introduce more elements of fun to it.

You can only absorb so many new permanent items because then that's a -- clearly they demand a permanent place on menu boards, and that does -- can typically add additional complexity. LTO can provide some funds. So you're talking 4- or 5- or 6-week promotional activity around things that could be around World Cup soccer. Or it could be around the Olympics. It could be around the time of year and the seasonal events. That just makes yourself interesting. That rewards existing customers who -- they want to try something different for a little while and then return to their favorites. So that's always a balance. It's part of what we're working on with our marketing leads, certainly in the major markets, is to understand how that best balance works. If we lurch too far one way and streamline it, we don't have enough new and enticing news out there. If we go the other way, it becomes a little frenetic and customers can't follow and the restaurants find it hard to execute. But there's not a size for this but all 3 are important but primarily core meaningful new menu additions and then introducing some fun on occasion through LTO's just to spice up the market a little bit."

I don't have to pay out, to be honest, for it. And where we're on our game and we have all elements of our business working well, our service experience, our digital engagement, the cost account and quality and new food news, then all those components really do add value to the customer experience. And their perception, their assessment of us. So yes, there's room for it. We have to be competitive in the marketplace, but we can bring great quality. So for example, taking -- removing the antibiotics out of our chicken supply chain across the next 2 years, if they move the customers value because we can bring to them quality ingredients and quality menu items at the McDonald's affordable prices and may encourage us to do more of that. And we will continue, particularly here in the U.S., as Mike brings to life the food agenda that he has as part of his vision for the business. We will continue to make moves such as that to bring premium quality food on everyday prices. And again, the sirloin burger is a great example of that, it's a premium beef cut at McDonald's prices.

So looking back 3 to 4 years, I -- rather than anything we missed through consumer insight, I think, perhaps the challenge we let ourselves with, we had 4 or 5 growth initiatives working together really through the 2 sour bonds. So from '03 to about 2010, 2011, we had a number of different growth platforms that worked and they worked around the world, different markets, sequenced them in different orders. But everything from delivering great quality coffee, which then for our breakfast business, going to extend it now as the reimaging program, for example, just to name 3. Perhaps what we didn't foresee and respond as well as we could have done ourselves is to create that future pipeline of growing platforms. Sometimes the consumer will guide you there, but sometimes, you've got to take that into your own hands, and that was probably perhaps something that, as we look back through our history, we wish we could have done a little better. The one trend that I would say we're working hard to address now is general consumer desire to be part of something big to be treated as an individual, and that's where the whole personalization piece comes in. Whether that's the way we engage and communicate with customers, which is, I believe, technology will help us get there where we can have a much more personal relationship kind of level the customers are happy with, but also on the menu side. And that's where the customization of food comes in and then on to your second point of Create Your Taste. One of the pieces we have here is we have an ability to test these things out and learn. So Create Your Taste, for example, is an option within our broader McDonald's experience in the future ambition. We have a really concerted push on this in Australia and we will have 1 or 2 markets up and running within the U.S., and we will respond -- we will be able to see from consumers' response to that pretty quickly how that in-store experience builds out and plays out. And then, again, in relation to your second point, how that then works through the drive-thru. And time will tell, but we have a number of other ways that we can, perhaps, customize our menu, or personalize our menu that we're also working on. We have test sales going on around the country and around the world to better learn how we can best meet. That consumer need is around personalization. It is powerful. We believe we can deliver against it. And our confidence is, when we start to really connect on that level and unlock the benefits of personalization of 69 million customers a day that will have a significant impact and drive long-term sustaining growth."

And there's much of that I would not ever wish to change on challenges, very precious to us and withstand this -- in good stead for the next 60 years. However, there is a certain conservatism and incrementalism that builds into that. And again, as a company, that has not necessarily been a bad thing. But when you do need to make a step change, our organization doesn't naturally go there. It needs to be led there. But in my experience at McDonald's, whenever we've made substantial decisions and substantial changes, we are 1 to 3 adaptable once that has been spelled out. But we wouldn't naturally take ourselves there as an organization. So yes, with the team around me, we're challenging some of the conventional thinking on multiple fronts and some of that we'll rather share with you over time. With regards to whether several weeks we'll get people into a state of readiness, I think there's a hunger and an interest in our business to embrace change. So I mean I hear it as I get into the markets, hear it from the other operators. And I think there's a pull and a hunger in the field for what are we going to stand for, where are we heading and how are we going to get there. And I'm not new to most of the McDonald's System. I'm new in position, I totally recognize that, and different expectations and accountabilities come with that, but I think my track record and my history in McDonald's is relatively well known around the place.

Since stepping into this role nearly 2 months ago, I've been relentlessly focused on assessing current plans, challenging our people and teams to think differently about what we're doing and how we're doing it an",1282,"Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Since stepping into this role nearly 2 months ago, I've been relentlessly focused on assessing current plans, challenging our people and teams to think differently about what we're doing and how we're doing it and working with senior leadership to determine the best path forward. As we announced this morning, we've scheduled a separate call on the 4th of May to share the initial details of our turnaround plan. We appreciate your focus -- sorry, your patience as we focus today on our first quarter results and the overall approach we're taking as we develop plans to reenergize the business. 
First quarter performance reinforces our imperative to stabilize and improve our underlying business performance. Let me start by sharing an overview of recent performance across the top 9 markets that contribute most of our overall consolidated results, starting with Australia, the U.K. and Canada, which are trending positive. Australia is in the early stages of turning around its business through a multifaceted approach to enhance brand appeal for consumers. This includes meaningful enhancements to our menu, including both core and new menu items across several categories; value platforms and better restaurant operations. The U.K. continues its strong track record of positive performance with first quarter comparable sales representing the market's 36th consecutive quarter of growth. These results reflect the market's diligent execution of its customer-centric plan that span multiple initiatives, including food choice and food quality, marketing and promotions and enhancements to the service experience such as expanding drive-thru capacity during peak periods and building the overnight experience. In addition, in Canada, strong promotional performance and new menu news drove average check and positive comparable sales performance for the quarter. 
Next are Germany and China, 2 markets that have shown recent signs of improvement. In Germany, negative comparable sales trends have moderated the last 2 quarters. The market has strengthened its value platform and, at the same time, promoted premium products and add-on purchases to the average check. We expect recovery in this market to remain uneven, however, as reflected in March's weak comparable sales performance. China continues to recover from last year's supplier issue. Efforts to regain brand trust are working, and the market remains on track to return to a normalized level of performance by midyear.
And finally, the U.S., France, Russia and Japan, where challenges persist. U.S. results remain disappointing. Recent actions taken by Mike and his leadership team, including implementing a more efficient operating structure, simplifying the menu and holding the U.S. turnaround summit with operators in March, are helping to create a renewed sense of energy and focus around better delivery of local customer needs.
In both France and Russia, consumer confidence remains low and challenging macroeconomic conditions continue to negatively impact results. Despite a declining IEO industry, France continues to maintain market share as efforts to strengthen the value platform and enhance the customer service experience are differentiating the brand in the market. Amidst external pressures in Russia, the team remains focused on driving sales through strong product and promotional offers, growing the breakfast business and initiatives that focus on rebuilding brand trust with consumers in the market.
Japan's recovery from the supply issue has not been as strong as China, and subsequent consumer perception issues have further depressed sales and profitability. As evidenced by last week's announcement of the business revitalization plan, the Japanese and APMEA teams are intensely focused on addressing the significant challenges in this market, though we expect results will continue to be negatively impacted for the foreseeable future. And Kevin will provide more details around our first quarter results in a moment. 
Let me shift gears now and discuss the approach I'm taking to lead McDonald's into the future, my operating principles, if you will. First is a greater emphasis on personal accountability. I'm honest and fair, but I don't dispense forced kindness. Where we need to fix the fundamentals, we need to act now. And where we need to make an impact, I'm not looking for incremental steps. We intend to make meaningful impact with customers and how they perceive our brand and our food. I hold people accountable for tangible actions and outputs, and I can assure you that I hold myself accountable to these same high standards.
My second operating principle is grounded in the customer. As a retail business, we must be even more customer-centric. This means deeper understanding, better listening, better segmentation, genuine sharp insights regarding what our customers want and need and when they want it as determined from the smart use of data and analytics. We need to be the best at knowing what matters most to consumers, and we will focus our best talent and prioritize spending where it will optimally support our turnaround.
Our third philosophy is progress over perfection. We will try new things, move fast with what works and even faster from what doesn't. And when we find winning plays, we will be more nimble, much like we did with the rollout of Apple Pay this last fall. From first contact to going live took 12 weeks. We can make meaningful changes for customers in weeks, we just have to do it more often. 
My final approach to leading is by championed simplicity with simplifying, a greater transparency, accountability and speed. We're making the business more responsive to market conditions by using our scale advantage more effectively. We cannot afford to carry legacy attitudes and legacy thinking, and we won't.
My overall vision is for McDonald's to be seen as a modern progressive burger company delivering a contemporary customer experience. Modern is about getting the brand to where we need to be today, and progressive is about doing what it takes to be the McDonald's our customers will expect tomorrow. We're already moving more assertively in this direction, with actions that delight our customers and energize our brand. For example, we recently committed to enhance the benefits to employees at company-owned restaurants in the U.S., including a wage increase and paid time off for full and part-time crew employees. In March, we announced in the U.S. that we will stop using antibiotics that are important to human medicine in our chicken supply chain within the next 2 years. And there are plans to feature 100% sirloin burgers for a limited time in the U.S., along with a current test on all-day breakfast. 
We also undertook a significant effort to excite our customers and bring the world together virtually with I'm Lovin' It 24. About 70,000 people participated in the events, which included 24 hours of McDonald's-inspired disruptive creativity in major cities around the world, and it garnered more than 2 billion impressions across public relation stories and social media interactions. 
Last month, the German team opened a new 500-seat flagship restaurant in Frankfurt showcasing our most modern digital and service amenities. And just yesterday, we announced our global commitment on deforestation, which conserves our aspiration to end deforestation throughout our supply chain. 
We are harnessing the power inherent in the McDonald's brand and in our network of valued franchisees, employees and supplier partners to make this great brand even greater. One of the advantages of my broad experience within McDonald's and running other restaurant chains is seeing other cultures, different structures, different models. Through this experience, I see McDonald's and its fundamental advantages, challenges and opportunities much more clearly. It is this perspective that's helping me look objectively at the business and make decisions to position McDonald's to deliver enduring profitable growth for shareholders and the system. Thank you for joining us this morning. And now I'd like to turn it over to Kevin."

We begin 2015 taking action to lay the foundation for McDonald's turnaround as we work to address the significant internal and external headwinds that are impacting our business. Today, I'd like to begin by discussing t",1017,"Thanks, Steve, and hello, everyone. We begin 2015 taking action to lay the foundation for McDonald's turnaround as we work to address the significant internal and external headwinds that are impacting our business. Today, I'd like to begin by discussing the performance factors that impacted our first quarter results, including the strategic charges taken in the quarter. Then I'll provide updates on key financial metrics and close with some final thoughts about our path to realizing our long-term potential. 
Our financial model and therefore, my remarks, start with top line sales. First quarter comparable sales were down 2.3%, reflecting negative guest traffic across all of our geographic segments. APMEA's first quarter comp sales decline of 8.3% had the largest impact on our global performance, with Japan and China posting declines of 32.3% and 4.8%, respectively. While these results are partly due to the lingering impact of the APMEA supplier issue, Japan's performance reflects the broad-based consumer perception challenges that the market is working to overcome. Japan accounts for the lion's share of this segment's quarterly comparable sales decline. Sales trends in China continued to show sequential improvement as we moved through the quarter. And Australia remains a bright spot, posting its third consecutive quarter of positive comparable sales.
In the U.S., comparable sales were down 2.6% for the quarter, as the segment's slightly positive breakfast day part was offset by weakness across all other day parts. We are working to enhance the customer experience with locally relevant tastes, a simplified menu and compelling value offerings. Europe comparable sales ended the quarter down 0.6%, with positive performance in the U.K. more than offset by weak results in France and Russia. Looking ahead to April, global comparable sales are expected to be negative.
This weak top line performance accounted for about half of the constant currency decline in operating income for the first quarter. The other half of the decline in operating income is attributable to the $195 million of strategic charges taken in the quarter to optimize the business. The first component of the charges, totaling $85 million, includes the asset write-offs related to our refranchising initiative as we made decisions to sell certain restaurants to developmental licensees. 
The next component of these charges is related to the strategic decisions to close about 350 underperforming restaurants, primarily in Japan, the U.S. and China. These restaurant closings are in addition to the 350 global restaurant closings originally planned for 2015. The total charge for asset write-offs related to these incremental closings was approximately $72 million. Most of these restaurants were not contributing to our overall profitability or cash flow, and we'll continue to review our restaurant portfolio with the intent of optimizing our asset base around the world. 
The final component of the charges was $38 million related to restructuring costs for our U.S. business. This amount consists primarily of employee severance and other related costs. Earnings per share for the quarter was down $0.37, which includes $0.17 related to the strategic charges and $0.09 in negative foreign currency impact. Excluding the impact of the charges and foreign currency translation, earnings per share for the quarter was down $0.11 or 9%. 
From an operating perspective, with 81% of our global restaurants franchised, the largest driver of operating income continues to be our franchise margins, which declined $152 million to $1.6 billion, a 1% decrease in constant currencies. Global company-operated margin dollars declined $164 million to $560 million for the quarter, a 13% decrease in constant currencies. The company-operated margin percent decreased 180 basis points to 14.3%, reflecting negative comparable guest counts across all segments as well as higher commodity and labor costs. 
Next, I want to provide an update on our commodities, pricing, foreign currency impact and cash return to shareholders. I'll start with commodity costs for the U.S. and Europe. For the first quarter, U.S. commodity costs rose approximately 2%, primarily due to higher beef prices. To help offset this pressure, we took some price increases. Our first quarter pricing in the U.S. year-over-year was up roughly 2%, which was below food-away-from-home inflation of around 3%. The current projected increase in food-away-from-home inflation for the full year is 2% to 3%. Excluding currency, Europe's commodity costs were relatively flat in the first quarter. Our price increases in Europe vary by market, with the overall segment, excluding Russia, averaging about 2% year-over-year.
Now turning to foreign currency impact. The U.S. dollar has strengthened dramatically against nearly all of the world's other major currencies. During the last 8 months, the dollar has experienced its fastest rise in 40 years. At these levels, foreign currency translation is having a significant impact on our reported results, as evidenced by the $700 million impact to our first quarter reported revenues and the $0.09 impact to our first quarter reported EPS. Based on current exchange rates, we now expect foreign currency translation to negatively impact our results by $0.13 to $0.14 in the second quarter and $0.40 to $0.45 for the full year. As usual, take this as directional guidance only, because rates will change as we move throughout the year. And keep in mind, this is an accounting translation impact more than a cash impact.
Despite our top line and margin pressures, our business continues to generate significant cash flow. In addition to reinvesting in the business to drive future growth, we returned $1.4 billion to our shareholders in dividends and share repurchases in the first quarter. 
As Steve mentioned, we're taking a close look at our organization, challenging ourselves and the status quo. Our goal is to position the company for enduring profitable growth. We must get back to better leveraging the benefits of our business model, including the entrepreneurial spirit of our franchisees. We must utilize our considerable resources more efficiently, and we must meet our customers' evolving needs more consistently. I'm energized by the challenges before us, and I look forward to working with Steve, Pete and the broader McDonald's System to bring our vision to reality. Thank you. Now I'll turn it back to Chris to begin our Q&A."

In the U.S., I've heard a lot over the last few months about the need for more simplicity, needing to improve speed, which I think suggests a diagnosis of a throughput problem. But when you look at the underperformance in the comps versus the industry and on an absolute basis, it does suggest a bigger, more pure demand issue. And so the question is, what's going to be going on over the next couple months to really drive a resurgence in guest counts that may be more dramatic than simplification? I guess like already extended breakfast tests going well. What's the plan there? As far as new products being rolled out more rapidly, like you guys just did the chicken sandwich, is that something we're going to see more of? If you could just kind of talk about that altogether, that will be great."

We have a strong plan in place. I guess if I can dissect that question of yours. One is how are we going to drive demand, and then secondly, how are we going to manage that demand. The driving demand is going to be driven through both national and local menu news, so we have some strong -- some exciting product pipelines ahead. So most recently, we've announced the sirloin burger, which we believe will be a favorite with customers and have broad resonance, but also, we are liberating the creativity and I guess, the insights of our local markets to develop local food menu items that better resonate with the local customer base. So the demand driving, I believe, can operate at 2 levels. That said and done, we've still got to make the entire McDonald's experience just a little easier for our customers and a little easier for our crew, and that's where the simplification piece comes in. And it's not simply the menu simplification. It's what else can we take off the workload of our teams in our restaurants to enable them to focus on what really matters, which is taking care of customers. So menu simplification will certainly help. There has been the initial phase of that from January, where we have not seen a significant sales uplift from it. But we have seen -- it provides us with easing of operational complexity. There will be further moves on menu simplification coming up now because we have a number of tests in place, and we can share those with you as the results become clearer. But also, there's other things we can do to take workload out of the restaurants and just simplifying the job for our managers and crews so they can focus on their frontline role, which is taking care of customers. So 2 things, driving demand and then meeting demand, and we've got actions on both."

So we referred to one of the pieces of the charge as cost related to write-offs as we made decisions to sell restaurants to developmental licensees. That would be consistent with our past practice. As we make decisions to sell, whether it's restaurants or countries to somebody, we need to look and see what -- how it's valued and what we believe we can get in return for selling that -- those restaurants. And as we make a decision and evaluate kind of the fair value versus what we have recorded on our books, it requires us to potentially write down the net book value to get to the cost -- the selling price we're going to realize. That's what that -- those amounts relate to. It will be consistent with prior practice. We made some decisions to actually sell some restaurants to developmental licensees, and we need to now record the cost of it. It equals what we expect to realize when we sell those restaurants."

So I'm just wondering, with that kind of as a backdrop, what's the greatest pushback or perhaps just maybe suggestions you get from franchisees in terms of turning around, at least the U.S. business. That will be one thing because I'm guessing they have some pretty good insights. And secondly, do you typically discuss the initiatives and plans for the system with them ahead of time, for example, like the turnaround presentation, early May they get kind of an advanced look or do they opine on the initiatives that you plan on putting out there?"

Their views and our views we share openly as we build these plans together so -- and I don't think that will change. As you go through turnarounds, I'm going to tell you from my experience in the past in other markets, they are a little bumpy by nature. It isn't just a straight line growth curve, and that will require -- it does require some bold and decisive decision-making, which on occasion can lead to 1 or 2 friction points and there's 1 or 2 things we can learn from 1 or 2 of the decisions we've made, but it doesn't mean the decisions we're making are wrong, far from it. I'm confident with the decisions that Mike's making in the U.S. and I'm making at a global level.

As you probably know, my previous role, I was responsible for trying to establish our digital team and vision here, and we've built a highly skilled and capable group who are managing that for us. We are moving, without a doubt, from a world of mass marketing to what I describe as mass personalization, and clearly, technology allows us to do that now, which allows us to build a much more meaningful relationship with our customers, to shift from a transactional relationship into a far more engaging and meaningful purposeful relationship, where we can understand their needs on an individual basis rather than a generic basis. We are building what we call our global mobile app. We will be launching it in the U.S. in the second half of this year. And there are 2 elements to our digital vision. One is the experience side and the other is the engagement side. The experience is what -- how can we use technology just to make the day-to-day customer experience easier and more convenient, and the engagement side is really more about the fun part of the brand. So the initial app that we'll be launching will be focusing primarily on the experience, just trying to make the day-to-day customer experience smoother and more convenient.

It very, very much differs region by region. So there will be a balance at play on value. We haven't quite found that equation yet, but we know we're working hard to unlock it. In terms of quality, our benchmark is ourselves. What we're working on now and what Mike and the menu team is working on is how we deliver a better McDonald's menu. So we're very proud of our core products, what can we do to enhance the quality, both direct quality and also the quality perception as we develop new items?

So that review resulted in this decision to close the 350 underperforming restaurants, primarily in Japan, U.S. and China. In China, a lot of those openings were, I'll say, between 2009 and 2012, where they've been consistently underperforming. Our sales estimation processes probably weren't as great during those years, but we now have better tools and better processes so that our sales estimation processes have been better. Japan, they're generally heavy lossmaker restaurants that we're closing. So that will help the portfolio. And we're pretty much complete with that review.

So we are working hard to reinvigorate consumers' love and demand for that. On the new items, 2 elements. Some is launching permanent new items and some is just using LTOs. Again, they both play a different role. You can only absorb so many new permanent items because then that's a -- clearly they demand a permanent place on menu boards, and that does -- can typically add additional complexity. LTO can provide some fun. So you're talking 4- or 5- or 6-week promotional activity around themed events. It could be around World Cup soccer, or it could be around the Olympics. It could be around the time of year and a seasonal event. That just makes yourself interesting. That rewards existing customers who may want to try something different for a little while and then return to their favorites. So that's always a balance. It's -- part of what we're working on with our marketing leads, certainly in the major markets, is to understand how that best balance works. If we lurch too far one way and streamline it, we don't have enough new and enticing news out there. If we go the other way, it becomes a little frenetic and customers can't follow, and the restaurants find it hard to execute. But there's not a science to this, but all 3 are important.

Thanks, John. So looking back 3 to 4 years, I -- rather than anything we missed through consumer insight, I think, perhaps the challenge we left ourselves with, we had 4 or 5 growth initiatives working together really through the 2 sour bonds [ph]. So from '03 to about 2010, 2011, we had a number of different growth platforms that worked and they worked around the world. Different markets sequenced them in different orders, but everything from delivering great quality coffee, which then drove breakfast business; going to extended hours; the reimaging program, for example, just to name 3. Perhaps what we didn't foresee and respond as well as we could have done ourselves is to create that future pipeline of growth platforms. Sometimes the consumer will guide you there, but sometimes, you've got to take that into your own hands, and that was probably perhaps something that, as we look back through our history, we wish we could have done a little better. The one trend that I would say we're working hard to address now is general consumer desire to be part of something big but to be treated as an individual, and that's where the whole personalization piece comes in. Whether that's the way we engage and communicate with customers, which is, I believe technology will help us get there, where we can have a much more personal relationship at a level the customers are happy with, but also on the menu side. And that's where the customization of food comes in and then on to your second point of Create Your Taste. One of the beauties we have here is we have an ability to test these things out and learn. So Create Your Taste, for example, is an option within our broader McDonald's Experience of the Future ambition. We have a really concerted push on this in Australia, and we will have 1 or 2 markets up and running within the U.S., and we will respond -- we will be able to see from consumers' response to that pretty quickly how that in-store experience builds out and plays out. And then, again, in relation to your second point, how that then works through the drive-thru. And time will tell, but we have a number of other ways that we can, perhaps, customize our menu, or personalize our menu that we're also working on. We have test cells going on around the country and around the world to better learn how we can best meet -- that consumer need is around personalization. It is powerful. We believe we can deliver against it. And our confidence is, when we start to really connect on that level and unlock the benefits of personalization of 69 million customers a day that will have a significant impact and drive long-term sustaining growth."

And there's much of that I would not ever wish to change or challenge. It's very precious to us and will stand us in good stead for the next 60 years. However, there is a certain conservatism and incrementalism that builds into that. And again, as a company, that has not necessarily been a bad thing. But when you do need to make a step change, our organization doesn't naturally go there. It needs to be led there. But in my experience at McDonald's, whenever we've made substantial decisions and substantial changes, we are wonderfully adaptable once that has been spelled out. But we wouldn't naturally take ourselves there as an organization. So yes, with the team around me, we're challenging some of the conventional thinking on multiple fronts, and some of that we'll be able to share with you over time. With regards to whether several weeks will get people into a state of readiness, I think there's a hunger and an interest in our business to embrace change. So I mean I hear it as I get into the markets, hear it from the other operators. And I think there's a pull and a hunger in the field for what are we going to stand for, where are we heading and how are we going to get there. And I'm not new to most of the McDonald's System. I'm new in the position, I totally recognize that, and different expectations and accountabilities come with that, but I think my track record and my history in McDonald's is relatively well known around the place. And therefore, I don't come as a complete surprise. So I look forward to sharing more on May 4 and ongoing."

In May, I shared initial steps we're taking to fundamentally reset McDonald's business and reassert our leadership. Today, I will share the progress we've made since then. Our turnaround plan represents a sign",1982,"Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. In May, I shared initial steps we're taking to fundamentally reset McDonald's business and reassert our leadership. Today, I will share the progress we've made since then. Our turnaround plan represents a significant step change in McDonald's and establishes the foundation for our transformation as we grow toward becoming a modern progressive burger company. Our #1 priority is to return critical markets to sustainable growth by retaining customers' trust and loyalty. These efforts must be led by the markets, local management and franchisees working together to deliver what people want from McDonald's, great-tasting quality food at a value, delivered with a better service each and every time they visit. 
Our focus over the last several months has been execution, transformation and challenging the organization to evolve more quickly, taking bold steps to change the way we think and operate, starting first with our structure. We made a fundamental shift in a way our business is organized effective July 1 to eliminate redundancies, maximize talent and create a greater sense of urgency amongst company and operator leadership staff as well as with our suppliers. This restructure arguably represents the biggest organizational change in our history, yet from inception to an institution, we completed it in just 2 months. It requires significant change inside the company, and we're already realizing some of the benefits, stronger [indiscernible], sharper customer focus, a more acute sense of urgency and a deeper understanding of what legacy thinking and actions to challenge and how. 
For example, market teams in Australia and Hong Kong have recognized and acted upon the needs of a greater choice in personalization with our hallmark product, burgers. We're aggressively deploying elements of experience in the future and seeing encouraging results. And in Germany, our brand relaunch highlighting new taste and a better overall restaurant experience is giving customers reasons to think differently about McDonald's. 
We've also recruited fresh outside perspectives as part of this restructure. our new Chief Communications Officer, Robert Gibbs; and Chief Marketing Officer, Silvia Lagnado, are highly respected talented leaders who will bring a wealth of experience and outside perspective. In the next several months, we're about taking further action and reasserting our leadership. We must operate better restaurants. That's why we're recommitting to operations excellence, which, frankly, has been lacking in some markets. Simply speaking, we need to be better serving [indiscernible] fresh food, providing fast and friendly service in a contemporary restaurant at a value of McDonald's. 
Today I'll highlight steps we're taking and the progress we've made. While financial results remained disappointing in the second quarter, we are seeing early signs of momentum. Looking ahead to the third quarter, we expect positive global comparable sales, led by growth in our newly created international lead market segment and China's continuing recovery in the 2014 APMEA supplier issue. 
Before we turn to the U.S., let me briefly highlight the progress we're making in some of our most significant markets around the world. I'm energized that the actions our markets are taking and the impact it had on our results. As we translate our progress into the context of our new organizational structure, I can say with confidence that the international lead market segments, which represents approximately 40% of our business, is moving in the right direction. Australia, Canada and the U.K. continued to deliver strong performance. Germany is starting to turn and France is gaining share despite the challenging headwinds. This segment will be a strong catalyst for our business.
Let's start with Australia. By June marks 10 consecutive months of positive comparable sales and guest counts. The business has turned in Australia and the market is focused on sustaining positive performance. The combined solutions deployed last year, such as relaunching everyday value with the loose change menu and offering customers barista cups in McCafé beverages and the [indiscernible] established foundation, and Australia has successfully layered on incremental initiatives to sustain that growth. Value breakfast was introduced early this year, and we began national advertising for great taste customized burgers as part of our efforts to develop the customer experience in the future.
The U.K. also continues to grow, with 37 consecutive quarters of positive comparable sales performance. Both full initiatives contributed to growth and market share gains across all day parts. For example, we gave customers more reason to visit our restaurants while featuring products such as the chicken legend and Big Tasty and the reflective marketing and promotional efforts including Monopoly. Strong growth in breakfast was fueled by the market's first ever promotional breakfast item the sausage and bacon sandwich. And the team is improving the service experience while aggressively deploying experience in the future. 150 restaurants we converted so far, and plans are in place to double that number by the end of 2015.
Let's now shift to Canada led where positive comparable sales performance continues. The team is driving growth while focusing on convenience including the ongoing rollout of APMEA's, with [indiscernible] which improve the speed of service to customers particularly during our busiest times. The market is also benefiting from strong breakfast growth firming up on a successful free coffee offer earlier this year, along with additional enhancements to the core menu including new salads. 
We're also seeing signs of progress in Germany. This was the market's first quarter of positive comparable sales since the second quarter 2012. Customers are responding to the steps we've taken to improve the taste and variety of core and premium products such as of the new premium bacon club house range and the [indiscernible] culture promotion, that feature locally sourced and seasonal ingredients. 
And I'm excited to announce today of our developmental licensee agreements with auto barn tank and rise. This agreement gives us the opportunity to develop more than 100 new sites in fuel and service stations across the lucrative motorway service station network in Germany, with no capital investment acquired by McDonald's. The first new restaurants we expect to open this year with the majority are between 2016 and 2019.
Moving to China, one of our high-growth markets, recovery continues largely as a fire issue. Comparable sales remained negative in the second quarter at minus 3%. However, the top 5 cities, which represents about 50% of sales, are leading the recovery at flat comparable sales for the quarter. Lower key cities are not recovering as quickly, driven primarily by weaker macroeconomic conditions in those outlying areas. China is strengthening everyday value with a specific focus on the midtier price points, continuing to enhance convenience to our customers through delivery kiosks and elevating the quality of [indiscernible] our burgers by piloting customization through experience in the future. We're on track to return to a normalized level of performance in China in the second half of the year. In fact, prior to the anniversary of last year's APMEA supplier issue, the market has already returned to positive comparable sales performance in the first part of this month.
Let's now transition to the U.S., which represents over 40% of our business. Results here have been disappointing. We're committed to changing the trajectory of the business and are resting the nearly 3 years of decline. We're working to promote discipline back in the business, adapt more quickly to changing trends, offer more competitive value across the menu, adding new energy and tenacity to simply running better restaurants. 
The localized structure implemented later this year was an important first step. It's designed to liberate market teams to be more responsive to local consumers and we've seen pockets of success. The Northwest region, for example, was the country's top-performing region in 2014 and continues to generate positive results year-to-date here. A strong restaurant operations culture, coupled with an aggressive promotions by any size soft drink or coffee for $1, is generating incremental traffic. The Heartland region, which includes Kansas City, is also delivering comparable sales and discount performance above U.S. averages. There, a heavy breakfast focus, coupled with a modernized restaurant base, has fueled momentum.
And Boston, which is coming back from the worst winter in its history has deployed combination of regional products like the lobster roll, a $2..99 Happy Meal for -- families and beverage value to drive sales and guest counts. The U.S.'s focus on creating a better experience for customers by concentrating on value, service and menu. These are not headline-grabbing moves but they could give returned to running better restaurants. 
So first, getting back to winning on value. Having aligned with our franchisees on the need for national price pointed value platform, we're now making adjustments to our current offer through the rest of the summer. This includes better marketing support and a stronger coordination with local messages. We're also evaluating options for longer-term national value platform. 
Next, we're enhancing the customer service experience. This starts with the basics. We've reduced the number of menu items in restaurants to make it easier for teams to deliver better service. We improved the speed of our drive-thrus with simplified menu boards. We've cut the number of items displayed by about 1/3, yet still highlight the items to deliver 80% or more of drive-thru sales. We're addressing order accuracy with new operational procedures and training programs already in almost half of our restaurants, and we're increasing the number of fuel and drive-thrus to deliver faster service to our customers during the busiest times of the day. 
I will be launching our mobile app in the U.S. in the third quarter. This is part of our global digital strategy that,  over time, is designed to streamline and improve the entire customer service experience. The initial version of the app will make it easy for consumer to receive value when they choose McDonald's through features like [indiscernible] offers that are easy to redeem and rewards for regular purchases of their favorite McCafé beverages. And at the same side, the team is already hard at work, developing additional features to [indiscernible] the shift from mass communication to personal one-to-one engagement with customers in the future. 
And finally, menu. This starts with our core products that define our brands. We've implemented new cooking methods in our restaurants, searching [indiscernible] changing how we sear and grill our beef to deliver hotter, juicier sandwiches. And we're looking to further improve performance during our most successful dayparts. For example, our all-day breakfast trial have gone well,l so we expanded those tests to better gauge customer response. I believe we're making the right moves to begin to stabilize the U.S. business. But there is no silver bullet. No one move will turn a business that's been in decline for nearly 3 years and more recovery will be used a bumpy and constantly moving in the right direction.
While our primary focus is on actions that will drive operating growth, we have also taken steps to unlock financial value. On May 4, we identified key areas of focus to unlock that financial value. In just 2 months, we've made good progress toward all our targets including G&A, refranchising and cash return. Kevin will provide more details specific to those in a moment.
In closing, I remain confident in the power of our brand and our network of franchisees, employees and suppliers to capitalize on the growth opportunities before us. It's not enough to say that we want to be an emboldened progressive burger company. Consumers need to see us that way. Shifting deep-seated perceptions the longer-term proposition it requires us to move past legacy barriers and embrace behaviors of a true global leader. We have made significant progress in a short amount of time, and I'm confident the changes we are making are the right ones will position us to grow the business profitably for our system and our shareholders for the long term. 
Thank you, and I'll now turn it over to Kevin."

I'd like to begin by discussing the factors that impacted our second quarter performance. Then I'll review some key components of our full year outlook and provide an update on the financial elements of our turnaround p",1410,"Thanks, Steve, and hello, everyone. I'd like to begin by discussing the factors that impacted our second quarter performance. Then I'll review some key components of our full year outlook and provide an update on the financial elements of our turnaround plan. 
Let's begin by reviewing the major drivers of our second quarter results. Our overall financial performance continues to be largely reflective of our top line results. For the second quarter, comparable sales were down 0.7%, reflecting negative guess traffic across all of our geographic segments with the largest impact coming from the U.S. and Japan. For perspective, operating income for the quarter totaled $1.8 billion, down $127 million or 6% in constant currency. The U.S. and Japan accounted for over 80% of the quarters overall operating income decline. 
With more than 80% of our global restaurants franchised, the largest driver of operating income continues to be our franchise margins, which totaled $1.8 billion, a 2% increase in constant currencies. The growth in franchise margins was driven primarily by restaurant expansion in Europe and strong comparable sales in Australia. Global company operating margin dollars declined 8% in constant currencies to $665 million for the quarter, reflecting weakness across our major geographic segments. The U.S., Russia and China accounted for substantially all of the margin declines for the quarter.
Second quarter cost pressures were relatively consistent with our expectations. In the U.S., labor cost increased primarily due to planned minimum wage increases in several states and commodity costs rose approximately 1% primarily due to higher beef prices. Effective July 1, U.S. company's operating margins will also reflect our decisions to raise wages and provide paid time-off for employees at our company operated restaurants, along with providing educational assistance for all restaurant employees. We expect the total impact from incremental labor costs to be approximately 200 basis points on U.S. company operating margins for the full year further pressuring margins for the second half of 2015.
To help offset cost pressures, throughout our P&L and remain in line with food inflation, we took a price increase at the end of May. Our U.S. second quarter pricing year-over-year was up over 2%, which remains below food-away-from-home inflation of around 3%. The current projected increase in the food-away-from-home inflation for the full year remains at 2% to 3%.
Excluding currency, Europe's commodity costs were up about 2% in the second quarter. Our price increases in Europe vary by markets with the overall segment excluding Russia averaging about 1.5% year-over-year.
For the quarter, we also recorded nearly $50 million of other operating expense, primarily due to $45 million of severance charges in connection with the restructuring of our global operations. About half of these charges were incurred within our corporate functions and the other half in Europe and APMEA as we move to a flatter, more nimble organizational structure.
Moving down the P&L, it's worth noting our second quarter effective tax rate of 29.8%, which was helped by lower tax costs associated with the company's ongoing foreign cash repatriation, we continue to expect the full year tax rate to be at the high end of our existing 31% to 33% range.
Earnings per share for the quarter was $1.26, which included a significant negative impact of $0.13 from foreign currency. Looking beyond the second quarter, currency translation is expected to be a headwind throughout 2015 as the U.S. dollar remained strong against nearly all of the world's other major currencies. At these levels, we now expect foreign currency translation to negatively impact our results by $0.14 to $0.16 in the third quarter and about $0.45 for the full year. As usual, take that as directional guidance only because rates will change as we move throughout the year.
Let me switch gears now for an update on the financial elements of our turnaround plan. In May, we announced our intent to accelerate our cash return to shareholders in 2015. During second quarter, we returned $2.5 billion through dividend and share repurchases. This brings our total cash return to shareholders through June  to $3.9 billion, and we remain on track to meet our target of $8 billion to $9 billion for the full year. 
During the quarter, we took advantage of favorable interest rates and increased overall debt by issuing $4.3 billion of U.S. dollar and euro-denominated medium-term notes, with an average tenure of over 10 years and an average interest rate of just over 2%. Our overall philosophy on use of cash has changed. Our first priority is to reinvest in our business to drive future growth. After that, we expect to return all of our free cash flow over the long term to investors through our combination of dividend and share repurchases.
As we execute the initial steps of our turnaround plan, we're actively evaluating our capital allocation decisions including our dividend as part of our broader strategic planning process. As a result, we're targeting our annual dividend announcement in November this year, a slight change in timing from our typical September update.
one of the key areas of focus for the turnaround is better leveraging our business model including the benefits of franchising. In conjunction with our goal to refranchise about 3,500 restaurants by the end of 2018 and increase the global franchise percentage to about 90%, we are already moving forward in several markets including Taiwan where we recently announced our intent to pursue a developmental licensee structure. Taiwan is a well-established market, with more than 400 restaurants. The vast majority of which our company operated. While we are in the early stages of the process, the conversion of this market to a developmental laces will mark a meaningful step towards our overall refranchising goals.
The structural changes the organization and our ownership mix not only better position us for future growth. They will also deliver savings to our bottom line. Earlier this month, we made important changes in our corporate and segment support teams, which included the elimination of some international and home office positions. While these types of changes are never easy, they were right for the business and will result in a leaner, more agile organization that can better respond to market conditions and, most importantly, our customers. The rapid execution of these resourcing decisions is an example of our sense of urgency to reset our business and changes the trajectory of our financial performance. 
When we share the initial details of our turnaround plan in May, we established a target to achieve $300 million of net annual G&A savings. We expect to achieve about half of those overall savings by the end of next year with the remainder realized by the end of 2017. Our planned refranchising activity is contributing towards these G&A savings due to the less resource-intensive support structure inherent in a more heavily franchise model. Importantly, we are not stopping there. We're moving to the next phase of our analysis relative to each of the financial areas of opportunity including ownership strategies, asset optimization and overall spending. We plan to provide an update on all of these areas at the November investor meeting.
The July 1 reorganization of our business into the new segment structure is an important first step in our global turnaround. In conjunction with these changes, we will be providing recapped financial information that reflects results under this new structure. We expect to further furnish our recapped summary financial information toward the end of the third quarter for the years 2010 through 2014. Quarterly details will be provided for 2014 and year-to-date June 2015.
In closing, let me reiterate that we are fundamentally shifting the way we operate and approach our business to get back in step with consumers. McDonald's success has always been fueled by outstanding operations, compelling marketing and great tasting food. We operate under a unique business model that benefits from a highly collaborative relationship among the company, independent franchisees and third-party suppliers, all who take pride in their businesses. We need all of these elements working together to provide a world-class experience that makes our customers feel welcome and valued. Our turnaround plan is designed to fortify these fundamental cornerstones of our business. And our operational growth turnaround will also be supported by a comprehensive approach to financial management that's focused on driving value for our system and our shareholders today and into the future. 
Thanks, and now I'll turn it over to Chris to begin our Q&A."

We lost the value foothold that's important to our business and we have been created compelling energetic brands with our operators in a way that we like to do when we've gone through full throttle. So similarities heading into the turnaround are somewhat similar. What I would call out Australia for and incredible credit to the team and the younger operators there, is the pace with which they moved mostly galvanize themselves to get around initiatives. They've gone for a small number of big moves and they've gone quickly and they've gone together and that's created visible change in the restaurants, visible benefits to consumers and the traction is very, very encouraging. And by the way, with the new structure that we have, with effectively 6 global markets, our ability to transfer that knowledge from market to market is that much quicker. So I know Mike and the team and the other operators in the U.S. are very familiar with the U.S. -- sorry, with the Australian story, with the U.K. turnaround story, with what the German team would be doing and that was shamelessly and adapt to the market."

That could be much more nimble shorter-term relevant to the local consumer demographic and taste and flavor. So I think it was in 2 levels. There will be not a frenzied activity.

As you look at the 5 lead markets, first of all, really strong local management team and strong alignment of the operator is a consistency across all 5. That is a fantastic foundation, but there are peculiarities among each and every one of them. If you go to France, the advancements they've made with technology, for example, on how they have totally reappraised the customer journey is fantastic to see. So let me be specific say that, they now have self order chaos in all of their restaurants. They're taking upward of 40% of the transactions through the busy hours through the self order kiosks, and the reason that's exciting is probably 3 reasons I guess. One, for the first time, we give customers a choice and they just welcome choice. Two, it takes on the stress away from the front counter, and therefore, you divide some of the pressure, some of the load during the busiest times. And three, from a commercial perspective, we see higher average checks because customers spend little time ordering. They can browse the menu for a little bit longer, feel a little less pressure and they just tend to spend. So we're getting a lot of learnings from that. If you go to Germany, for example, which is earlier stages of a turnaround, the brand has got its mojo back. And when you do that, you start to attract attention for the right reasons. The new agreement we just raised to have a license agreement with [indiscernible] is a fantastic agreement for us because if anyone knows the travel infrastructure, transport infrastructure in Germany, you'll know that autobahns play a huge role. That's helping people typically get from city to city. And therefore, to have roadside presence in up to 100 sites effectively from a capital perspective that's what happens when a brand in a market gets its mojo back. You start to track the partners you want to be doing business with. Australia, progressing they've become our lead market in what we call Create Your Taste. Now all of our markets are building out the broader umbrella, which is a good experience in the future. Many components to that. There is technology, the visual menu boards, the new service procedures, the self-order kiosks and customizable personalization of food. The Create Your Taste group that the Australian team have gone down, they rolled out marketwide in a little over 6 or 7 months to never [indiscernible] where they can out nationally advertise it. They're going to learn a lot about that works. Its an in-store solution currently. Can we drive traffic in-store, can we increase the time, can we -- just the table service that goes along with that matter to customers and our ability and our visibility for market to market on each of these initiatives. I believe, if that's when McDonald's is at its best when we have test cells actively pushing the boundaries, and when something worth we can transport it from market to market at pace. And again I don't want to minimize the number of things the U.S. team are working on.. I mean the U.S. is our lead market for the mobile app. We recognize we're a little behind some others where there's enough [indiscernible] in broader retail, but let me put line to things. We're one of the best execution companies in the world. The U.S. will start with an app with fairly modest capabilities, but the infrastructure is built so we can actually and transfer it from market to market at pace. So that is where I guess my energy, my confidence comes from is that kind of connective momentum, and you start to spur each other on."

So it's important we get this right and we'll save G&A and capital as we do this. We'll certainly get a little bit more stable revenue stream. On an EBITDA basis, it'd be difficult to generalize on what that means in total for the company because it's going to be pretty lumpy over the next couple of years as we have specific transactions getting there."

So what we want to do -- and people say why can't you move faster with all-day breakfast, for example, there were a number of moving parts to this. So what we're going to need to do is, a prove out the consumer facing business case, but also come up with how a little tracking work, such that the next impact is net simplification. I think one thing, I'm taking one thing off is not simplification. So what we want to do is simplify the operation in sufficient other ways. But even if we were to go in all-day breakfast, the net impact on the [indiscernible] is one of simplification. Let me give you some ideas around that and what that really means. Some of that is around simplifying the menu. Go deeper into some of the restaurant [indiscernible] there's other way to doing it than just the menu. Operational procedures. we have a team with operators and some of our exposed national operations team here in the U.S. looking at other procedures that we can simplify in the restaurant whether it's the way we assemble menu items when we work, whether it's the way we have the packaging laid out, whether it's the way we use technology to be able to get orders to the back of the kitchen just to take out steps and workloads. So we also have just around the entire process of how to reduce the amount of noise. One intended noise that goes into our restaurant that managers have to deal with on service facing customers. So when you put all those work streams together, and you would've built a compelling business, if you were to believe all-day breakfast is sufficient sales driver that is worth making other complementary changes on simplification, the net-net has to be simplification and it will only be on that basis that we would be moving forward."

And so we're doing that as long as the playing field is level across industry, we believe we can compete competitively in the long run. And so our hope is that any of the regulations that are logged have come through deal with all the industries similarly and then we'll all have to deal with the same concerns."

The Create Your Taste element having that type of in-store is more where you place technology to offer a better experience to the customer. So if you're going to introduce some order kiosks, clearly that's going to create a very  different environment in the store. They have a cellphone at kiosk. For drive-thru you maybe order ahead. You get to use the app and some of the technology that we can introduce to that, but they would order ahead, get geolocation, get recognized in the drive-thru lane, [indiscernible] their order off to the back to the kitchen before they even have to place the order.

In May, I shared initial steps we're taking to fundamentally reset the McDonald's business and reassert our leadership. Today, I will share the progress we've made since then. Our turnaround plan represents a significant step change in McDonald's and establishes the foundation for our transformation as we work toward becoming a modern, progressive burger company. Our #1 priority is to return critical markets to sustainable growth by regaining customers' trust and loyalty. These efforts must be led by the markets, local management and franchisees working together to deliver what people want from McDonald's, great-tasting quality food at a value delivered with a better service each and every time they visit.
Our focus over the last several months has been execution, transformation and challenging the organization to evolve more quickly, taking bold steps to change the way we think and operate, starting first with our structure. We made a fundamental shift in the way our business is organized, effective July 1, to eliminate redundancies, maximize talent and create a greater sense of urgency amongst company and operator leadership staff as well as with our suppliers. This restructure arguably represented the biggest organizational change in our history, yet from inception to execution, we completed it in just 2 months. It required significant change inside the company, and we're already realizing some of the benefits: stronger discipline, sharper customer focus, a more acute sense of urgency and a deeper understanding of what legacy thinking and actions to challenge and how. For example, market teams in Australia and Hong Kong have recognized and acted upon the needs of a greater choice in personalization with our hallmark product, burgers. They're aggressively deploying elements of experience in the future and seeing encouraging results. And in Germany, our brand relaunch highlighting new taste and a better overall restaurant experience is giving customers reasons to think differently about McDonald's.
We've also recruited fresh outside perspectives as part of this restructure. Our new Chief Communications Officer, Robert Gibbs; and Chief Marketing Officer, Silvia Lagnado, are highly respected, talented leaders who will bring a wealth of experience and outside perspective. The next several months are about taking further action and reasserting our leadership.
We must operate better restaurants. That's why we are recommitting to operations excellence, which frankly has been lacking in some markets. Simply speaking, we need to be better serving whole, fresh food; providing fast and friendly service in a contemporary restaurant at the value of McDonald's.
Today, I will highlight the steps we're taking and the progress we've made. While financial results remained disappointing in the second quarter, we are seeing early signs of momentum. Looking ahead to the third quarter, we expect positive global comparable sales led by growth in our newly created International Lead Market segment and China's continuing recovery from the 2014 APMEA supplier issue.
Before we turn to the U.S., let me briefly highlight the progress we're making in some of our most significant markets around the world. I'm energized about the actions our markets are taking and the impact that have on results. As we translate our progress into the context of our new organizational structure, I can say with confidence that the International Lead Market segment, which represents approximately 40% of our business, is moving in the right direction. Australia, Canada and the U.K. continued to deliver strong performance. Germany is starting to turn, and France is gaining share despite the challenging headwinds. This segment will be a strong catalyst for our business.
Let's start with Australia, where June marked 10 consecutive months of positive comparable sales and guest counts. The business has turned in Australia, and the market is focused on sustaining positive performance. The combined solutions deployed last year, such as relaunching everyday value with the Loose Change menu and offering customers barista cups in McCafé beverages and the drive-thru, established the foundation, and Australia has successfully layered on incremental initiatives to sustain that growth. Value breakfast was introduced early this year. And we began national advertising for Create Your Taste customized burgers as part of our efforts to develop the customer experience of the future.
The U.K. also continues to grow, with 37 consecutive quarters of positive comparable sales performance. Most of our initiatives contributed to growth and market share gains across all dayparts. For example, we gave customers more reasons to visit our restaurants by featuring premium products such as the Chicken Legend and Big Tasty and through reflective marketing and promotional efforts including Monopoly. Strong growth in breakfast was fueled by the market's first-ever promotional breakfast item, the Sausage & Bacon Sandwich. And the team is improving the service experience while aggressively deploying experience of the future. 150 restaurants have been converted, so far, and plans are in place to double that number by the end of 2015.
Let's now shift to Canada, where positive comparable sales performance continues. The team is driving growth while focusing on convenience, including the ongoing rollout of dual-lane drive-thrus, which improve the speed of service for customers particularly during our busiest times. The market is also benefiting from strong breakfast growth, building upon a successful free coffee offer earlier this year; along with additional enhancements to the core menu, including new salads.
We're also seeing signs of progress in Germany. This was the market's first quarter of positive comparable sales since the second quarter of 2012. Customers are responding to the steps we've taken to improve the taste and variety of core and premium products such as the new premium Bacon Clubhouse range and the Wilde Küche promotion that feature locally sourced and seasonal ingredients. And I'm excited to announce today -- about the announcement today of our developmental licensee agreement with Autobahn Tank & Rast. This agreement gives us the opportunity to develop more than 100 new sites in fuel and service stations across the lucrative motorway service station network in Germany, with no capital investment required by McDonald's. The first new restaurants, we expected to open this year, but the majority are being between 2016 and 2019.
Moving to China, one of our high-growth markets. Recovery continues from last year's supplier issue. Comparable sales remained negative in the second quarter at minus 3%. However, the top 5 cities, which represent about 50% of sales, are leading the recovery at -- with flat comparable sales for the quarter. Lower key cities are not recovering as quickly, driven primarily by weaker macroeconomic conditions in those outlying areas. China is strengthening everyday value with a specific focus on the mid-tier price points, continuing to enhance convenience for our customers through delivery and kiosks and elevating the quality perceptions of our burgers by piloting customization through experience in the future. We're on track to return to a normalized level of performance in China at the second half of the year. In fact, prior to the anniversary of last year's APMEA supplier issue, the market has already returned to positive comparable sales performance in the first part of this month.
Let's now transition to the U.S., which represents over 40% of our business. Results here have been disappointing. We're committed to changing the trajectory of the business and arresting the nearly 3 years of decline. We are working to promote discipline back into the business; adapt more quickly to changing trends; offer more compelling value across the menu; and from a new energy and tenacity, to simply running better restaurants.
The localized structure implemented early this year was an important first step. It's designed to liberate market teams to be more responsive to local consumers, and we've seen pockets of success. The Northwest region, for example, was the country's top-performing region in 2014 and continues to generate positive results year-to-date here. A strong restaurant operations culture, coupled with an aggressive promotions like any-size soft drink or coffee for $1, is generating incremental traffic. The Heartland region, which includes Kansas City, is also delivering comparable sales and guest count performance above U.S. averages. There a heavy breakfast focus, coupled with a modernized restaurant base, has fueled momentum. And Boston, which is coming back from the worst winter in its history, has deployed a combination of regional products, like the lobster roll, a $2.99 Happy Meal to attract families and beverage value, to drive sales and guest counts. The U.S. is focused on creating a better experience for customers by concentrating on value, service and menu. These are not headline-grabbing moves, but they could give the returns for running better restaurants.
So first, getting back to winning on value. Having aligned with our franchisees on the need for a national price points and value platform, we're now making adjustments to our current offer for the rest of the summer. This includes better marketing support and stronger coordination with local messages. We're also evaluating options for longer-term national value platform.
Next we're enhancing the customer service experience. This starts with the basics. We have reduced the number of menu items in restaurants to make it easier for teams to deliver better service. We're improving the speed of our drive-thrus with simplified menu boards. We have cut the number of items displayed by about 1/3 yet still highlight the items that deliver 80% or more of drive-thru sales. We're addressing order accuracy with new operational procedures and training programs already in almost half of our restaurants. And we're increasing the number of dual-lane drive-thrus to deliver faster service to our customers during the busiest time of the day.
And we'll be launching our mobile app in the U.S. in the third quarter. This is part of our global digital strategy that, over time, is designed to streamline and improve the entire customer service experience. The initial version of the app will make it easy for consumers to receive value when they choose McDonald's through features like tailored offers that are easy to redeem and rewards for regular purchases of their favorite McCafé beverages. And at the same time, the team is already hard at work developing additional features to hasten the shift from mass communication to personal one-to-one engagement with customers in the future.
And finally, menu. This starts with our core products that define our brands. We've implemented new cooking methods in our restaurant, tossing our buns longer, changing how we sear and grill our beef, to deliver hotter, juicier sandwiches. And we're looking to further improve performance during our most successful dayparts. For example, our all-day breakfast trials have gone well, so we've expanded those tests to better gauge customer response.
I believe we are making the right moves to begin to stabilize the U.S. business, but there is no silver bullet. No one move will turn a business that's been in decline for nearly 3 years. And while recovery will be bumpy, I'm confident we are moving in the right direction.
While our primary focus is on actions that will drive operating growth, we have also taken steps to unlock financial value. On May 4, we identified key areas of focus to unlock that financial value. In just 2 months, we've made good progress toward all our targets, including G&A, refranchising and cash return. Kevin will provide more details specific to those in a moment.
In closing, I remain confident in the power of our brand and our network of franchisees, employees and suppliers to capitalize on the growth opportunities before us. It's not enough to say that we want to be a modern, progressive burger company. Consumers need to see us that way: shifting deep-seated perceptions, the longer-term proposition. It requires us to move past legacy barriers and embrace behaviors of a true global leader. We have made significant progress in a short amount of time, and I'm confident the changes we are making are the right ones and will position us to grow the business profitably for our system and our shareholders for the long term.
Thank you, and I'll now turn over to Kevin."

And hello, everyone.I'd like to begin by discussing the factors that impacted our second quarter performance, then I'll review some key components of our full year outlook and provide an update on the financial elements of our turnaround",1406,"Thanks, Steve. And hello, everyone.
I'd like to begin by discussing the factors that impacted our second quarter performance, then I'll review some key components of our full year outlook and provide an update on the financial elements of our turnaround plan. Let's begin by reviewing the major drivers of our second quarter results.
Our overall financial performance continues to be largely reflective of our top line results. For the second quarter, comparable sales were down 0.7%, reflecting negative guest traffic across all of our geographic segments, with the largest impact coming from the U.S. and Japan. For a perspective, operating income for the quarter totaled $1.8 billion, down $127 million or 6% in constant currency. The U.S. and Japan accounted for over 80% of the quarter's overall operating income decline.
With more than 80% of our global restaurants franchised, the largest driver of operating income continues to be our franchise margins, which totaled $1.8 billion, a 2% increase in constant currencies. The growth in franchise margins was driven primarily by restaurant expansion in Europe and strong comparable sales in Australia. Global company-operated margin dollars declined 8% in constant currencies to $665 million for the quarter, reflecting weakness across our major geographic segments. The U.S., Russia and China accounted for substantially all of the margin decline for the quarter.
Second quarter cost pressures were relatively consistent with our expectations. In the U.S., labor cost increased primarily due to planned minimum wage increases in several states. And commodity costs rose approximately 1%, primarily due to higher beef prices. Effective July 1, U.S. company-operated margins will also reflect our decisions to raise wages and provide paid time-off for employees at our company-operated restaurants, along with providing educational assistance for all restaurant employees. We expect the total impact from these incremental labor costs to be approximately 200 basis points on U.S. company-operated margins for the full year, further pressuring margins for the second half of 2015. To help offset cost pressures throughout our P&L and remain in line with food inflation, we took a price increase at the end of May. Our U.S. second quarter pricing year-over-year was up over 2%, which remains below food-away-from-home inflation of around 3%. The current projected increase in food-away-from-home inflation for the full year remains at 2% to 3%.
Excluding currency, Europe's commodity costs were up about 2% in the second quarter. Our price increases in Europe vary by market, with the overall segment, excluding Russia, averaging about 1.5% year-over-year.
For the quarter, we also recorded nearly $50 million of other operating expense, primarily due to $45 million of severance charges in connection with the restructuring of our global operations. About half of these charges were incurred within our corporate functions; and the other half in Europe and APMEA as we move to a flatter, more nimble organizational structure.
Moving down the P&L, it's worth noting our second quarter effective tax rate of 29.8%, which was helped by lower tax costs associated with the company's ongoing foreign cash repatriation. We continue to expect the full year tax rate to be at the high end of our existing 31% to 33% range.
Earnings per share for the quarter was $1.26, which included a significant negative impact of $0.13 from foreign currency. Looking beyond the second quarter, currency translation is expected to be a headwind throughout 2015, as the U.S. dollar remained strong against nearly all of the world's other major currencies. At these levels, we now expect foreign currency translation to negatively impact our results by $0.14 to $0.16 in the third quarter and about $0.45 for the full year. As usual, take that as directional guidance only because rates will change as we move throughout the year.
Let me switch gears now for an update on the financial elements of our turnaround plan.
In May, we announced our intent to accelerate our cash return to shareholders in 2015. During second quarter, we returned $2.5 billion through dividends and share repurchases. This brings our total cash return to shareholders through June to $3.9 billion, and we remain on track to meet our target of $8 billion to $9 billion for the full year.
During the quarter, we took advantage of favorable interest rates and increased overall debt by issuing $4.3 billion of U.S. dollar- and euro-denominated medium-term notes with an average tenure of over 10 years and an average interest rate of just over 2%. Our overall philosophy on use of cash has not changed. Our first priority is to reinvest in our business to drive future growth. After that, we expect to return all of our free cash flow over the long term to investors through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. As we execute the initial steps of our turnaround plan, we're actively evaluating our capital allocation decisions, including our dividend, as part of our broader strategic planning process. As a result, we're targeting our annual dividend announcement in November this year, a slight change in timing from our typical September update.
One of the key areas of focus for the turnaround is better leveraging our business model, including the benefits of franchising. In conjunction with our goal to refranchise about 3,500 restaurants by the end of 2018 and increase the global franchise percentage to above 90%, we are already moving forward in several markets, including Taiwan where we recently announced our intent to pursue a developmental licensee structure. Taiwan is a well-established market with more than 400 restaurants, the vast majority of which are company operated. While we are in the early stages of the process, the conversion of this market to a developmental license will mark a meaningful step towards our overall refranchising goal.
The structural changes to our organization and our ownership mix not only better position us for future growth. They will also deliver savings to our bottom line. Earlier this month, we made important changes in our corporate and segment support teams, which included the elimination of some international and home office positions. While these types of changes are never easy, they were right for the business and will result in a leaner, more agile organization that can better respond to market conditions and most importantly our customers. The rapid execution of these resourcing decisions is an example of our sense of urgency to reset our business and change the trajectory of our financial performance.
When we shared the initial details of our turnaround plan in May, we established a target to achieve $300 million of net annual G&A savings. We expect to achieve about half of those overall savings by the end of next year, with the remainder realized by the end of 2017. Our planned refranchising activity is contributing towards these G&A savings due to the less-resource-intensive support structure inherent in a more heavily franchise model. Importantly, we are not stopping there. We're moving to the next phase of our analysis relative to each of the financial areas of opportunity, including ownership strategies, asset optimization and overall spending. We plan to provide an update on all of these areas at the November investor meeting.
The July 1 reorganization of our business into the new segment structure is an important first step in our global turnaround. In conjunction with these changes, we will be providing recast financial information that reflects results under this new structure. We expect to furnish our recast summary financial information toward the end of the third quarter, for the years 2010 through 2014. Quarterly details will be provided for 2014 and year-to-date June 2015.
In closing, let me reiterate that we are fundamentally shifting the way we operate and approach our business to get back in step with consumers. McDonald's success has always been fueled by outstanding operations, compelling marketing and great-tasting food. We operate under a unique business model that benefits from a highly collaborative relationship among the company, independent franchisees and third-party suppliers, all who take pride in their businesses. We need all of these elements working together to provide a world-class experience that makes our customers feel welcome and valued. Our turnaround plan is designed to fortify these fundamental cornerstones of our business. And our operational growth-led turnaround will also be supported by a comprehensive approach to financial management that's focused on driving value for our system and our shareholders today and into the future.
Thanks, and now I'll turn it over to Chris to begin our Q&A."

We've lost the value foothold that's so important to our business. And we haven't created compelling, energetic plans with our operators in a way that we like to do when we're going full throttle.

What I would call out Australia for, and incredible credit to the team and the Owner/Operators there, is the pace with which they've moved whilst they galvanize them to get -- galvanize themselves to get around big initiatives. They've gone for a small number of big moves, and they've gone quickly and they've gone together. And that's created visible change in the restaurants, visible benefits to consumers, and the traction is very, very encouraging. And by the way, with the new structure we have with effectively 6 global major markets, our ability to transfer that knowledge from market to market is that much quicker.

So I don't want us to lose sight of the fact that, tossing of buns, better searing of beef, taking care of the dressings and the packaging and the rest of it, that gets noticed by customers. With regards to -- and to the, if you like, new product development, I would say, at a national level, we'll be looking at, if you like, quality over quantity. It's not about having lots of national LTOs because that does complicate the business. It gets confusing to message right, so we will be looking at fewer higher-impact items going out. And our team with Chef Dan and his team are working hard on that. And then you will also see the localized options. I called out the lobster roll in Boston, for example. That could be much more nimble, shorter term, relevant to the local consumer demographic in taste and flavors. So I think you will see there are 2 levels. There will be not a frenzied activity. It will be calm, measured and higher impact with fewer rides international. And then locally, there'll be some energy on a local basis. But don't miss out -- honestly, don't miss out the benefit of continually improving our core menu as well."

As you look at the 5 lead markets, first of all, really strong local management teams and strong alignment of the operators is a consistency across all 5. That is a fantastic foundation, but there are peculiarities and merits amongst each and every 1 of them. If you go to France, the advancements they've made with technology, for example, and how they have totally reappraised the customer journey is fantastic to see. So let me be specific: They now have self-order kiosks in all of their restaurants. They're taking upward of 40% of the transactions, through the busy hours, through the self-order kiosks. And the reason that's exciting is probably 3 reasons, I guess. One, for the first time, we give customers a choice, and they just welcome choice. Two, it takes some of the stress away from the front counter, and therefore you divide some of the pressure, some of the load during the busiest times. And three, from a commercial perspective, we see higher average checks because customers spend little time ordering. They can browse the menu for a little bit longer, feel a little less pressured; and they just tend to spend more. So we're getting a lot of learnings from that. If you go to Germany, for example, which is earlier stages of a turnaround, the brand has got its mojo back. And when you do that, you start to attract attention for the right reasons. And the new agreement we just reached, the development license agreement, with Tank & Rast is a fantastic agreement for us because, if anyone knows the travel infrastructure, transport infrastructure in Germany, you will know that Autobahn's play a huge role. And that's help people typically get from city to city, and therefore, to have roadside presence in up to 100 sites for -- effectively for no capital, from our perspective, that's what happens when a brand in a market gets its mojo back. You start to attract these sort of partners that you want to be doing business with. Australia are progressing. Actually, they've become our lead market in what we call Create Your Taste. Now all of our markets are building out the broader umbrella, which is called experience in the future, many components to that. There is technology, the visual menu boards, those new service procedures, the self-order kiosks and customizable personalization of food. The Create Your Taste route that the Australian team have gone down, they've rolled out marketwide in a little over 6 or 7 months to a level where they can now nationally advertise it. They're going to learn a lot of how that works. It's an in-store solution currently. Can we drive traffic in-store? Can we increase dwell time? Can we -- there's the table service that goes along with that, matter to customers; and our ability and our visibility from market to market on each of these initiatives. I believe that is when McDonald's is at its best, when we have test sells actively pushing the boundaries. And when something works, we can then transport it from market to market at pace. And again, I don't want to minimize the number of things the U.S. team are working on. I mean the U.S. is our lead market for the mobile app. Now we recognize we're a little behind some others, whether it's in our sets or in broader retail, but when we put our mind to things, we're one of the best-execution companies in the world. The U.S. will start with an app with fairly modest capabilities, but the infrastructure is built so we can add to it and transfer it from market to market at pace. So that is where I guess my energy and my confidence comes from. It's that kind of connected momentum, and you start to spur each other on."

And we'll save G&A and capital as we do this. We'll certainly get a little bit more stable revenue stream.

So the -- as we explore different initiatives to drive the business, clearly, all-day breakfast is one of those. So initially, the Owner/Operator group, they took a fairly pioneering approach down in San Diego. And actually, I was in Forks [ph]. And I went down to visit them just 2 or 3 weeks ago and spent time with the operators in their restaurants, understanding what it really meant. So we're trying to prove out and are proving out the consumer business case, consumer demand for all-day breakfast, but to your point, you can't talk simplification and add. To the meantime, what we're working on is part of multiple ways to reduce complexity and streamline the job for our restaurant managers and enable them to be on and accommodate this. So what we want to do -- and people say, ""Well, why can't you move faster with all-day breakfast?"" for example. There are a number of moving parts to this, so what we're going to need to do is, a, prove out the consumer-facing business case; but also come up with parallel tracking work such that the net impact is net simplification. Adding one thing and taking one thing off is not simplification, so what we want to do is simplify the operation in sufficient other ways that even if we were to go with an all-day breakfast, the net impact on the restaurant is one of simplification. So let me give you some ideas around that and what that really means: Some of that is around simplifying the menu, go deeper into some of the rationalization taking some items off. There's way -- other ways of doing it than just the menu. Operational procedures. We've got a team with operators and are -- and some of -- are exposed in our national operations team here in the U.S., looking at other procedures that we can simplify in a restaurant, whether it's the way we assemble menu items where we work, whether it's the way we have the packaging laid out, whether it's the way we use technology to be able to get orders to the back of the kitchen just to take out steps and workloads. But we also have ideas just around the entire process of how do we reduce the amount of noise, well-intended noise that goes into our restaurant that managers have to deal with; and really of on service and facing the customers.

What we have done since the structure has been implemented is really identify. Rather than trying to have generic U.S.-like consumer metrics, it's the few of the regions with that type of information and insight for them to make sharper decisions. So in some areas, there was a stronger economic recovery than others. In others, the competition is different and in terms of the dynamics and demographics are different, so what we've been doing -- and the markets where we're seeing a greater success are those that are using those consumer insights and responding quickest to the needs of consumers and what else is happening in the marketplace.

In several states, as you know, minimum wage has increased. For us, margins essentially are a top line game, so we need to grow sales. Certainly, we need to grow comp sales in order to grow margins. And the specific labor moves that we've taken are what we believe we should be doing as a business to make sure that we attract, recruit and retain the best employees we can for our business. And so we're doing that. As long as -- in our mind, as long as the playing field is level across industries, we believe we can compete competitively in the long run.

I know the team are looking at that as we speak. In terms of the drive-thru moves that didn't start, I think the important piece to realize this is less the Create Your Taste element. And having that type in-store is more where you place technology to offer a better experience to the customer. So if you're going to introduce self-order kiosks, clearly that's going to create a very different environment in the store. You're not going to have a cellphone and kiosk for drive-thru, but you maybe got to have -- order ahead. You maybe either use the app and some of the technology that we can introduce to that, but they will order ahead, get geolocation, get recognized in the drive-thru lane. It provides their order off to the back of the kitchen before they'd even have to place the order. So I think technology will be a differentiator to give us different service models, but it'll still be a McDonald's, still enjoy the McDonald's experience but just in different ways.

In May, I shared initial steps we're taking to fundamentally reset the McDonald's business and reassert our leadership. Today, I will share the progress we've made since then. Our turnaround plan represents a significant step change in McDonald's and establishes the foundation for our transformation as we work toward becoming a modern, progressive burger company. Our #1 priority is to return critical markets to sustainable growth by regaining customers' trust and loyalty. These efforts must be led by the markets, local management and franchisees working together to deliver what people want from McDonald's, great-tasting quality food at a value delivered with a better service each and every time they visit.
Our focus over the last several months has been execution, transformation and challenging the organization to evolve more quickly, taking bold steps to change the way we think and operate, starting first with our structure. We made a fundamental shift in the way our business is organized, effective July 1, to eliminate redundancies, maximize talent and create a greater sense of urgency amongst company and operator leadership staff as well as with our suppliers. This restructure arguably represented the biggest organizational change in our history, yet from inception to execution, we completed it in just 2 months. It required significant change inside the company, and we're already realizing some of the benefits: stronger discipline, sharper customer focus, a more acute sense of urgency and a deeper understanding of what legacy thinking and actions to challenge and how. For example, market teams in Australia and Hong Kong have recognized and acted upon the needs of a greater choice in personalization with our hallmark product, burgers. They're aggressively deploying elements of Experience of the Future and seeing encouraging results. And in Germany, our brand relaunch highlighting new taste and a better overall restaurant experience is giving customers reasons to think differently about McDonald's.
We've also recruited fresh outside perspectives as part of this restructure. Our new Chief Communications Officer, Robert Gibbs; and Chief Marketing Officer, Silvia Lagnado, are highly respected, talented leaders who will bring a wealth of experience and outside perspective. The next several months are about taking further action and reasserting our leadership.
We must operate better restaurants. That's why we are recommitting to operations excellence, which frankly has been lacking in some markets. Simply speaking, we need to be better serving hot, fresh food; providing fast and friendly service in a contemporary restaurant at the value of McDonald's.
Today, I will highlight the steps we're taking and the progress we've made. While financial results remained disappointing in the second quarter, we are seeing early signs of momentum. Looking ahead to third quarter, we expect positive global comparable sales led by growth in our newly created International Lead Market segment and China's continuing recovery from the 2014 APMEA supplier issue.
Before we turn to the U.S., let me briefly highlight the progress we're making in some of our most significant markets around the world. I'm energized about the actions our markets are taking and the impact they have on results. As we translate our progress into the context of our new organizational structure, I can say with confidence that the International Lead Market segment, which represents approximately 40% of our business, is moving in the right direction. Australia, Canada and the U.K. continued to deliver strong performance. Germany is starting to turn, and France is gaining share despite the challenging headwinds. This segment will be a strong catalyst for our business.
Let's start with Australia, where June marked 10 consecutive months of positive comparable sales and guest counts. The business has turned in Australia, and the market is focused on sustaining positive performance. The combined solutions deployed last year, such as relaunching everyday value with the Loose Change menu and offering customers barista craft and McCafé beverages in the drive-thru, established the foundation, and Australia has successfully layered on incremental initiatives to sustain that growth. Value breakfast was introduced early this year. And we began national advertising for Create Your Taste customized burgers as part of our efforts to develop the customer experience of the future.
The U.K. also continues to grow, with 37 consecutive quarters of positive comparable sales performance. Multiple initiatives contributed to growth and market share gains across all dayparts. For example, we gave customers more reasons to visit our restaurants by featuring premium products such as the Chicken Legend and Big Tasty and through reflective marketing and promotional efforts including Monopoly. Strong growth in breakfast was fueled by the market's first-ever promotional breakfast item, the Sausage & Bacon Sandwich. And the team is improving the service experience while aggressively deploying Experience of the Future. 150 restaurants have been converted so far, and plans are in place to double that number by the end of 2015.
Let's now shift to Canada, where positive comparable sales performance continues. The team is driving growth while focusing on convenience, including the ongoing rollout of dual-lane drive-thrus, which improve the speed of service for customers particularly during our busiest times. The market is also benefiting from strong breakfast growth, building upon a successful free coffee offer earlier this year; along with additional enhancements to the core menu, including new salads.
We're also seeing signs of progress in Germany. This was the market's first quarter of positive comparable sales since the second quarter of 2012. Customers are responding to the steps we've taken to improve the taste and variety of core and premium products such as the new premium Bacon Clubhouse range and the Wilde Küche promotion that feature locally sourced and seasonal ingredients. And I'm excited to announce today -- about the announcement today of our developmental licensee agreements with Autobahn Tank & Rast. This agreement gives us the opportunity to develop more than 100 new sites in fuel and service stations across the lucrative motorway service station network in Germany, with no capital investment required by McDonald's. The first new restaurants, we expected to open this year, but the majority open between 2016 and 2019.
Moving to China, one of our high-growth markets. Recovery continues from last year's supplier issue. Comparable sales remained negative in the second quarter at minus 3%. However, the top 5 cities, which represent about 50% of sales, are leading the recovery at -- with flat comparable sales for the quarter. Lower tier cities are not recovering as quickly, driven primarily by weaker macroeconomic conditions in those outlying areas. China is strengthening everyday value with a specific focus on the mid-tier price points, continuing to enhance convenience for our customers through delivery and kiosks and elevating the quality perceptions of our burgers by piloting customization through Experience of the Future. We're on track to return to a normalized level of performance in China at the second half of the year. In fact, prior to the anniversary of last year's APMEA supplier issue, the market has already returned to positive comparable sales performance in the first part of this month.
Let's now transition to the U.S., which represents over 40% of our business. Results here have been disappointing. We're committed to changing the trajectory of the business and arresting the nearly 3 years of decline. We are working to promote discipline back into the business; adapt more quickly to changing trends; offer more compelling value across the menu; and bring a new energy and tenacity to simply running better restaurants.
The localized structure implemented early this year was an important first step. It's designed to liberate market teams to be more responsive to local consumers, and we've seen pockets of success. The Northwest region, for example, was the country's top-performing region in 2014 and continues to generate positive results year-to-date June. A strong restaurant operations culture, coupled within aggressive promotions like any-size soft drink or coffee for $1, is generating incremental traffic. The Heartland region, which includes Kansas City, is also delivering comparable sales and guest count performance above U.S. averages. There a heavy breakfast focus, coupled with a modernized restaurant base, has fueled momentum. And Boston, which is coming back from the worst winter in its history, has deployed a combination of regional products, like the lobster roll, a $2.99 Happy Meal to attract families and beverage value to drive sales and guest counts. The U.S. is focused on creating a better experience for customers by concentrating on value, service and menu. These are not headline-grabbing moves, but they begin the return to running better restaurants.
So first, getting back to winning on value. Having aligned with our franchisees on the need for a national price pointed value platform, we're now making adjustments to our current offer for the rest of the summer. This includes better marketing support and stronger coordination with local messages. We're also evaluating options for longer-term national value platform.
Next we're enhancing the customer service experience. This starts with the basics. We have reduced the number of menu items in restaurants to make it easier for teams to deliver better service. We're improving the speed of our drive-thrus with simplified menu boards. We have cut the number of items displayed by about 1/3 yet still highlight the items that deliver 80% or more of drive-thru sales. We're addressing order accuracy with new operational procedures and training programs already in almost half of our restaurants. And we're increasing the number of dual-lane drive-thrus to deliver faster service to our customers during the busiest time of the day.
And we'll be launching our mobile app in the U.S. in the third quarter. This is part of our global digital strategy that, over time, is designed to streamline and improve the entire customer service experience. The initial version of the app will make it easy for consumers to receive value when they choose McDonald's through features like tailored offers that are easy to redeem and rewards for regular purchases of their favorite McCafé beverages. And at the same time, the team is already hard at work developing additional features to hasten the shift from mass communication to personal one-to-one engagement with customers in the future.
And finally, menu. This starts with our core products that define our brands. We've implemented new cooking methods in our restaurant, toasting our buns longer, changing how we sear and grill our beef, to deliver hotter, juicier sandwiches. And we're looking to further improve performance during our most successful dayparts. For example, our all-day breakfast trials have gone well, so we've expanded those tests to better gauge customer response.
I believe we are making the right moves to begin to stabilize the U.S. business, but there is no silver bullet. No one move will turn a business that's been in decline for nearly 3 years. And while recovery will be bumpy, I'm confident we are moving in the right direction.
While our primary focus is on actions that will drive operating growth, we have also taken steps to unlock financial value. On May 4, we identified key areas of focus to unlock that financial value. In just 2 months, we've made good progress toward all our targets, including G&A, refranchising and cash return. Kevin will provide more details specific to those in a moment.
In closing, I remain confident in the power of our brand and our network of franchisees, employees and suppliers to capitalize on the growth opportunities before us. It's not enough to say that we want to be a modern, progressive burger company. Consumers need to see us that way: shifting deep-seated perceptions, the longer-term proposition. It requires us to move past legacy barriers and embrace behaviors of a true global leader. We have made significant progress in a short amount of time, and I'm confident the changes we are making are the right ones and will position us to grow the business profitably for our system and our shareholders for the long term.
Thank you, and I'll now turn over to Kevin."

And hello, everyone.I'd like to begin by discussing the factors that impacted our second quarter performance, then I'll review some key components of our full year outlook and provide an update on the financial elements of our turnaround",1405,"Thanks, Steve. And hello, everyone.
I'd like to begin by discussing the factors that impacted our second quarter performance, then I'll review some key components of our full year outlook and provide an update on the financial elements of our turnaround plan. Let's begin by reviewing the major drivers of our second quarter results.
Our overall financial performance continues to be largely reflective of our top line results. For the second quarter, comparable sales were down 0.7%, reflecting negative guest traffic across all of our geographic segments, with the largest impact coming from the U.S. and Japan. For perspective, operating income for the quarter totaled $1.8 billion, down $127 million or 6% in constant currencies. The U.S. and Japan accounted for over 80% of the quarter's overall operating income decline.
With more than 80% of our global restaurants franchised, the largest driver of operating income continues to be our franchise margins, which totaled $1.8 billion, a 2% increase in constant currencies. The growth in franchise margins was driven primarily by restaurant expansion in Europe and strong comparable sales in Australia. Global company-operated margin dollars declined 8% in constant currencies to $665 million for the quarter, reflecting weakness across our major geographic segments. The U.S., Russia and China accounted for substantially all of the margin decline for the quarter.
Second quarter cost pressures were relatively consistent with our expectations. In the U.S., labor cost increased primarily due to planned minimum wage increases in several states. And commodity costs rose approximately 1%, primarily due to higher beef prices. Effective July 1, U.S. company-operated margins will also reflect our decisions to raise wages and provide paid time-off for employees at our company-operated restaurants, along with providing educational assistance for all restaurant employees. We expect the total impact from these incremental labor costs to be approximately 200 basis points on U.S. company-operated margins for the full year, further pressuring margins for the second half of 2015. To help offset cost pressures throughout our P&L and remain in line with food inflation, we took a price increase at the end of May. Our U.S. second quarter pricing year-over-year was up over 2%, which remains below food-away-from-home inflation of around 3%. The current projected increase in food-away-from-home inflation for the full year remains at 2% to 3%.
Excluding currency, Europe's commodity costs were up about 2% in the second quarter. Our price increases in Europe vary by market, with the overall segment, excluding Russia, averaging about 1.5% year-over-year.
For the quarter, we also recorded nearly $50 million of other operating expense, primarily due to $45 million of severance charges in connection with the restructuring of our global operations. About half of these charges were incurred within our corporate functions; and the other half in Europe and APMEA as we move to a flatter, more nimble organizational structure.
Moving down the P&L, it's worth noting our second quarter effective tax rate of 29.8%, which was helped by lower tax costs associated with the company's ongoing foreign cash repatriation. We continue to expect the full year tax rate to be at the high end of our existing 31% to 33% range.
Earnings per share for the quarter was $1.26, which included a significant negative impact of $0.13 from foreign currency. Looking beyond the second quarter, currency translation is expected to be a headwind throughout 2015, as the U.S. dollar remained strong against nearly all of the world's other major currencies. At these levels, we now expect foreign currency translation to negatively impact our results by $0.14 to $0.16 in the third quarter and about $0.45 for the full year. As usual, take this as directional guidance only because rates will change as we move throughout the year.
Let me switch gears now for an update on the financial elements of our turnaround plan.
In May, we announced our intent to accelerate our cash return to shareholders in 2015. During second quarter, we returned $2.5 billion through dividends and share repurchases. This brings our total cash return to shareholders through June to $3.9 billion, and we remain on track to meet our target of $8 billion to $9 billion for the full year.
During the quarter, we took advantage of favorable interest rates and increased overall debt by issuing $4.3 billion of U.S. dollar- and euro-denominated medium-term notes with an average tenure of over 10 years and an average interest rate of just over 2%. Our overall philosophy on use of cash has not changed. Our first priority is to reinvest in our business to drive future growth. After that, we expect to return all of our free cash flow over the long term to investors through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. As we execute the initial steps of our turnaround plan, we're actively evaluating our capital allocation decisions, including our dividend, as part of our broader strategic planning process. As a result, we're targeting our annual dividend announcement in November this year, a slight change in timing from our typical September update.
One of the key areas of focus for the turnaround is better leveraging our business model, including the benefits of franchising. In conjunction with our goal to refranchise about 3,500 restaurants by the end of 2018 and increase the global franchise percentage to about 90%, we are already moving forward in several markets, including Taiwan where we recently announced our intent to pursue a developmental licensee structure. Taiwan is a well-established market with more than 400 restaurants, the vast majority of which are company operated. While we are in the early stages of the process, the conversion of this market to a developmental license will mark a meaningful step towards our overall refranchising goal.
The structural changes to our organization and our ownership mix not only better position us for future growth. They will also deliver savings to our bottom line. Earlier this month, we made important changes in our corporate and segment support teams, which included the elimination of some international and home office positions. While these types of changes are never easy, they were right for the business and will result in a leaner, more agile organization that can better respond to market conditions and most importantly our customers. The rapid execution of these resourcing decisions is an example of our sense of urgency to reset our business and change the trajectory of our financial performance.
When we shared the initial details of our turnaround plan in May, we established a target to achieve $300 million of net annual G&A savings. We expect to achieve about half of those overall savings by the end of next year, with the remainder realized by the end of 2017. Our planned refranchising activity is contributing towards these G&A savings due to the less-resource-intensive support structure inherent in a more heavily franchised model. Importantly, we are not stopping there. We're moving to the next phase of our analysis relative to each of the financial areas of opportunity, including ownership strategies, asset optimization and overall spending. We plan to provide an update on all of these areas at the November investor meeting.
The July 1 reorganization of our business into the new segment structure is an important first step in our global turnaround. In conjunction with these changes, we will be providing recast financial information that reflects results under this new structure. We expect to furnish our recast summary financial information toward the end of the third quarter, for the years 2010 through 2014. Quarterly details will be provided for 2014 and year-to-date June 2015.
In closing, let me reiterate that we are fundamentally shifting the way we operate and approach our business to get back in step with consumers. McDonald's success has always been fueled by outstanding operations, compelling marketing and great-tasting food. We operate under a unique business model that benefits from a highly collaborative relationship among the company, independent franchisees and third-party suppliers, all who take pride in their businesses. We need all of these elements working together to provide a world-class experience that makes our customers feel welcome and valued. Our turnaround plan is designed to fortify these fundamental cornerstones of our business. And our operational growth-led turnaround will also be supported by a comprehensive approach to financial management that's focused on driving value for our system and our shareholders today and into the future.
Thanks, and now I'll turn it over to Chris to begin our Q&A."

We are seeing it more across the international lead markets, which isn't just Europe. We're seeing that collective group of France, Germany, U.K., Canada and Australia are gathering momentum as a collective group, which is great. The U.S, what we're working hard to do is minimize -- currently, the U.S. is a little bit of a drag. We're looking just to narrow that gap and return that business to growth, but we're not putting in anything significant for growth into it in the third quarter but we're working hard towards getting it by the end of the year."

For the drive-thru menu boards, unequivocally positive from a consumer perspective and also from a -- for the restaurants and the teams to deliver better service. So again, neither are going to be seismic changes to the trajectory of our business. They're both positive moves, and we're working hard in executing them both.

They've gone for a small number of big moves, and they've gone quickly and they've gone together.

With regards to -- and to the, if you like, new product development, I would say, at a national level, we'll be looking at, if you like, quality over quantity. It's not about having lots of national LTOs because that does complicate the business. It gets confusing to message right, so we would be looking at fewer higher-impact items going out. And our team with Chef Dan and his team are working hard on that. And then you will also see the localized options. I called out the lobster roll in Boston, for example. That could be much more nimble, shorter term, relevant to the local consumer demographic in taste and flavors. So I think you will see there are 2 levels. There will be not a frenzied activity. It will be a calm, measured and higher impact with fewer rides international. And then locally, there'll be some energy on a local basis. But don't miss out -- honestly, don't miss out the benefit of continually improving our core menu as well."

Two, it takes some of the stress away from the front counter, and therefore you divide some of the pressure, some of the load during the busiest times. And three, from a commercial perspective, we see higher average checks because customers spend little time ordering. They can browse the menu for a little bit longer, feel a little less pressured; and they just tend to spend more. So we're getting a lot of learnings from that. If you go to Germany, for example, which is earlier stages of a turnaround, the brand has got its mojo back. And when you do that, you start to attract attention for the right reasons. And the new agreement we just reached, development license agreement, with Tank & Rast is a fantastic agreement for us because, if anyone knows the travel infrastructure, transport infrastructure in Germany, you will know that Autobahns play a huge role. And that's how people typically get from city to city, and therefore, to have roadside presence in up to 100 sites for -- effectively for no capital, from our perspective, that's what happens when a brand in a market gets its mojo back. You start to attract the sort of partners that you want to be doing business with. Australia are progressing. Actually, they've become our lead market in what we call Create Your Taste. Now all of our markets are building out the broader umbrella, which is called Experience of the Future, many components to that. There is technology, there's visual menu boards, the new service procedures, the self-order kiosks and customizable personalization of food. The Create Your Taste route that the Australian team have gone down, they've rolled out marketwide in a little over 6 or 7 months to a level where they can now nationally advertise it. We're going to learn a lot of how that works. It's an in-store solution currently. Can we drive traffic in-store? Can we increase dwell time? Can we -- there's the table service that goes along with that, matter to customers; and our ability and our visibility from market to market on each of these initiatives. I believe that is when McDonald's is at its best, when we have test sells actively pushing the boundaries. And when something works, we can then transport it from market to market at pace. And again, I don't want to minimize the number of things the U.S. team are working on. I mean, the U.S. is our lead market for the mobile app. Now we recognize we're a little behind some others, whether it's in our sets or in broader retail, but when we put our mind to things, we're one of the best-execution companies in the world. The U.S. will start with an app with fairly modest capabilities, but the infrastructure is built so we can add to it and transfer it from market to market at pace. So that is where I guess my energy and my confidence comes from. It's that kind of connected momentum, and you start to spur each other on."

So the strategy and timing will probably vary across our different segments and even within markets. Some markets will be completely franchised or converted to a developmental license, while others will just have more conventional franchising, so it's difficult to estimate exact timing or exact financial implications of each of those. As you can imagine, these are long-term decisions that we're making generally for at least 20 years or so with right licensees and operators, so it's important we get this right. And we'll save G&A and capital as we do this. We'll certainly get a little bit more stable revenue stream. On an EBITDA basis, it'd be difficult to generalize on what that means in total for the company because it's going to be pretty lumpy over the next couple of years, as we have specific transactions getting there."

So the -- as we explore different initiatives to drive the business, clearly, all-day breakfast is one of those. So initially, the Owner/Operator group, they took a fairly pioneering approach down in San Diego. And actually, I was fortunate. I went down to visit them just 2 or 3 weeks ago and spent time with the operators in their restaurants, understanding what it really meant. So we're trying to prove out and are proving out the consumer business case, consumer demand for all-day breakfast, but to your point, you can't talk simplification and add. To the meantime, what we're working on is, are there multiple ways to reduce complexity and streamline the job for our restaurant managers and enable them to be able to accommodate this? So what we want to do -- and people say, ""Well, why can't you move faster with all-day breakfast?"" for example. There are a number of moving parts to this, so what we're going to need to do is, a, prove out the consumer-facing business case; but also come up with parallel tracking work such that the net impact is net simplification. Adding one thing and taking one thing off is not simplification, so what we want to do is simplify the operation in sufficient other ways that even if we were to go with an all-day breakfast, the net impact on the restaurant is one of simplification. So let me give you some ideas around that and what that really means: Some of that is around simplifying the menu, go deeper into some of the rationalization taking some items off. There's way -- other ways of doing it than just the menu. Operational procedures. We've got a team with operators and are -- and some of our experts in our national operations team here in the U.S., looking at other procedures that we can simplify in a restaurant, whether it's the way we assemble menu items where we work, whether it's the way we have the packaging laid out, whether it's the way we use technology to be able to get orders to the back of the kitchen just to take out steps and workloads. But we also have ideas just around the entire process of how do we reduce the amount of noise, well-intended noise that goes into our restaurant that managers have to deal with; and really of on service and facing the customers. So when you put all those work streams together, you will -- and if we look to build a compelling business case, we -- if we were to believe all-day breakfast is sufficient sales driver, that is worth making other complementary changes on simplification, the net-net has to be simplification. And it will only be upon that basis that we would be moving forward."

What we have done since the structure has been implemented is really identify.

You maybe got to use the app and some of the technology that we can introduce to that, but they will order ahead, get geolocation, get recognized in the drive-thru lane and provide their order off to the back of the kitchen before they'd even have to place the order. So I think technology will be a differentiator to give us different service models, but it'll still be a McDonald's, still enjoy the McDonald's experience but just in different ways. But I think technology is a differentiator rather than a different 2-tier strategy."

It's been 8 months since I stepped into the position of CEO. Since then, we made meaningful progress to fuel our turnarounds and begin repositioning McDonald's as the modern progressive burger company. 
Our turnaround is operationally led. It's grounded in running great restaurants, which is the first step to enhance customer experience. People have more choices than ever about where to dine. We want to give them more reasons to dine in McDonald's by recommitting to half fresh food, cost friendly service, contemporary restaurant experience, all at the value of McDonald's.
Our #1 priority is to return critical markets to sustainable revenue and income growth. To do so, we must be customer centric in our planning and our decision-making. We must have the best talent in the most critical positions. And our system must be aligned around the actions we are taking to consistently run great restaurants. And we must execute initiatives that's ultimately enhance our bill in the areas that matter most to consumers, to great tasting high quality food, convenience and value.
Whilst we're still in the early phases, our turnaround plan is working. Customers are beginning to respond to the actions we're taking, and this progress is reflected in our third quarter results. As we discussed previously, the U.S. and international lead market segments generate over 80% of global operating income. For third quarter, 5 of our 6 most significant markets drove positive comparable sales growth with France's comparable sales being marginally negative. We also grew consolidated margins, operating income and earnings per share on a constant currency basis.
These results do, in part, reflect the benefits from comparisons to 2014 China supplier issue and the prior year's increasing tax reserves. However, operating results for the quarter were still up modestly when you exclude these items and take into consideration the significant currency headwinds.
Looking ahead, as we begin fourth quarter, global comparable sales are expected to be positive in all segments. Every market face a significant role in our global turnaround. Some markets, like Canada, Australia and the U.K. are further along and they continue to deliver strong, sustained growth.
That said, all markets have adjusted how they think and how they operate to ensure their actions and decisions are grounded in satisfying customers in their local markets today and for the long term.
The U.S. business remains brand centric, given its fundamental importance to overall consolidated results. It shift to positive comparable sales in the third quarter, the first quarterly comparable sales increase in the U.S. in 2 years. It's a tangible sign your progress and reflects the initial steps we've taken in areas that matter most to our customers: Great tasting, high quality foods, convenience and value. In the area of Food, we made progress towards enhancing the taste of our products and improving consumer perceptions of quality.
Our call classics define the McDonald's brand. That's why we've been hardest operational procedures, we're toasting buns longer, changing how we sear and grow burger patties to bring out the best in our menu and server hotter, juicier service to our customers.
We transition back to the original recipe for our Egg McMuffin, using butter instead of margarine to deliver an even tastier sandwich. Customers appreciated the change and we saw double-digit increase in the number of Egg McMuffin's sold immediately following the rollout.
In August, we introduced the buttermilk chicken sandwich made with 100% chicken breast meat and real buttermilk. This new product complements our ongoing call menu emphasis and customers have responded favorably. Initial results have exceeded the high end of our expectations.
And at the start of the fourth quarter, we rolled out all-day breakfast across the U.S. Customers have been asking for this for years, and we challenged ourselves to move past legacy barriers to deliver, and we did. Our ability to move the one market in May to all for 14,000 restaurants, speaks to the commitment and alignment of franchisees and our entire system have been customer lead in our decisions and our actions.
We've also taken actions to enhance our convenience and the overall customer experience. Early this year, we implemented operational procedures designed to improve order accuracy, remove some items in the menu and simplifying-ed the drive-through menu boards. Our goal is net simplification. We've established screens to evaluate operational complexity versus of the expected impact of the customer and the business. And ultimately, we want to focus our records on fewer, bigger decisions would generate bigger rewards.
We also took a first step toward enhancing the customer experience digitally with the deployment of the mobile application. To date, there have been over 2 million downloads at the app, and 1.5 million offers redeems. We'll begin national appetizing later this month.
Now from a value standpoint, we're aligned lined with franchisees and the need for national value. The summer $2.50 Double Cheeseburger smooth promotion was the first step. And we remain committed with operators in working towards restoring more permanent national value platform in the future. Customers are noticing the differences. Our customer feedback system, which now tracks approximately 10 million customer touch points each year, reflects consistent improvement in customer feedback scores. We're seeing this across all key categories measured, with the most significant improvement seen in the areas we focus on, namely: Food quality, friendly and fast service and order accuracy. 
Let's now turn to the International Lead Markets segment, starting with Australia. Third quarter marks 4 consecutive quarters of comparable sales and guest counts in Australia. The market turnaround began last year, as the customers responded to the combined initiatives that collectively improved our overall experience. This included a renewed focus on improving operations, the added convenience of offering barista in McCafé beverages through the drive-through and the stronger value platform with that relaunch of the Loose Change menu. This year, we've been giving customers even more reasons to visit our restaurants with the rollout of a new Value Menu of breakfast and through effective marketing and promotional efforts, including monopoly.
National advertising of the Experience The Future, which include self order kiosks, digital menu boards, table service and burger customization through great Create Your Taste began July 1. While early, we're encouraged with initial results and the positive buzz we've created in the market. And with fewer net energy as we add chicken and salad offerings to the Create Your Taste platform later this month.
Let's now turn to Germany, where market showing early signs of a turnaround. Customers are responding to the steps we've taken to enhance the appeal of premium products by emphasizing the problems and sustainability of ingredients. The new clubhouse veggie sandwich in August, along with the rehit of a proven customer favorite [indiscernible] quencher contributed to positive comparable sales in the third quarter. And this month's launch of the book free of premium burger that's made with 100% organic be from farms in Germany and Austria reinforces the quality to our customers. In France, we continue to maintain shared despite the challenging macro economics and former eating out market, experiencing its fourth consecutive year of decline. Customers appreciate actions we've taken strength value at every priced tier. This includes introducing first earlier this year, a 3 item meal combination from under EUR 5 and extending this year across more products categories in day parts. 
In addition, strong marketing campaigns, including the premium and the American summer food events have successfully driven premium sandwich sellers. They're also elevating the service experienced by providing customers with new ways to order and be served in our restaurants. Self-order kiosks are now in more than 90% of French restaurants, and we're now offering table service in more than half.
Strong performance continues in the U.K, Canada. These 2 market's ability to sustain prolonged growth is a direct result of their robust buying process, which directly links actions to the specific consumer needs. Strong quality campaign in both markets are boosting customer perceptions of core classics and successful promotions and new menu news like the Chicken Legend in the U.K. and the new my T in Canada have driven growth in premium products.
Since Russia and China are 2 high growth markets In particular interest, let's spend a moment on them. Both markets posted positive comparable sales from the quarter as they recover from last year's well-documented issues. The team's execution against strong recovery plans with a comprehensive focus around great tasting, high-quality food, convenience and value have successfully restored brand trust scores in both markets. However, we face near-term headwinds, given an economic slowdown in China and continued volatility in Russia.
In addition to the operational elements of the turnaround plan each market is executing around the globe, we continue a regular cadence of meaningful moves consistent with the leadership brand. We believe these moves will ultimately improve consumer perceptions of our brand.
In September, we announced our plans in the U.S. to transition to K 3X over the next 10 years. More recently, we collaborated with a number of global brand leaders to raise awareness for the plight of refugees and the need to support the United Nation's World Food Programme. And earlier this week, we announced our participation in the White House Climate Pledge.
Turning around our business requires a relentless focus on what consumers wants and expect from adult. Our responsibility is to give them reasons to feel good about visiting time and again. Our opportunity is to differentiate McDonald's while delivering what consumers want today, while laying the foundation for what they expect tomorrow, and our commitment is to deliver on both.
I'm pleased with the progress we've made and remain confident in the ability of our talented system of franchisees, employees and suppliers to revitalize our connection with customers as we execute our turnaround plan into 2016.
Thank you. And I'll now hand it over to Kevin."

Today's earnings release marks our first quarterly reporting under the new segment structure. So I want to spend a few minutes outlining the new segments as a lead-in to my discussion of the factors that impacted the company's third quarter performance. 
Effective July 1, we completed an important first step in the company's global turnaround plan. The reorganization of our business from a geographically focused structure to segments that combine markets with similar characteristics and opportunities for growth. Our reporting segments now include the U.S, our largest individual market accounting for over 40% of consolidated operating income; the international lead segment, which includes our established markets of Australia, Canada, France, Germany in the U.K. that collectively account for about 40% of the company's operating income; the high-growth segment, which includes markets with relatively higher restaurant expansion and franchising potential, including China, Italy, Poland, Russia, South Korea, Spain, Switzerland and the Netherlands. Together, these markets account for about 10% of the company's operating income and the foundational and corporate segment that encompasses the remaining markets. Each, of which has the potential to operate under a largely franchised model. These markets are combined with corporate activities for reporting purposes. 
From a business operation standpoint, this new structure brings similar markets together to leverage their collective insights and expertise to deliver a better overall experience for our customers. From a reporting standpoint, the new structure provides greater visibility into the key markets driving the vast majority of the company's underlying financial performance. So let's take a look at the major drivers of our third quarter results. 
Earnings per share for the quarter increased $0.31 to $1.40. In constant currencies, third quarter earnings per share increased $0.48. These results benefited from the comparison against prior year results, which included an increase in our tax reserves and the China supplier issue. These items negatively impacted third quarter 2014 earnings per share by $0.41. Excluding the impact of the unusual prior-year items, third quarter earnings per share would have increased $0.07 or 5% in constant currencies.
Looking beyond the initial prior-year items. Third quarter global comparable sales were up 4%, reflecting positive comparable sales across all segments and positive guest counts in all segments except the U.S. The international lead market segment was the largest contributor to the company's third quarter comparable sales performance, posting an increase of 4.6%, led by strong comparable sales and guest counts in Australia, the U.K. and Canada.
Germany's results were uneven, but encouraging, as the market posted positive comparable sales for the second consecutive quarter. And in France, comparable sales were marginally negative as the market's macroeconomic environment and Informal Eating Out industry remain challenged. The High Growth Markets generated strong comparable sales of 8.9% for the quarter, reflecting sales recovery in both China and Russia. For perspective, China's comparable sales were up 26.8% for the quarter.
The U.S. reported a comparable sales increase from 0.9% for the quarter, supported by the introduction of the new buttermilk crispy chicken sandwich and a return to the classic recipe for our Egg McMuffin. Comparable sales performance improved for the latter part of the quarter.
With more than 80% of our global restaurants franchised, the largest driver of operating income continues to be our franchised margins, which totaled $1.9 billion, a 7% increase in constant currencies for the quarter. The franchise margin percent increased 20 basis points to 82.2%, driven by the positive comparable sales generated by the international segments. Global company operated margin dollars increased 9% in constant currencies to $675 million for the quarter, while the company operated margin percent increased 10 basis points to 15.8%.
China sales recovery accounted for the majority of the margin improvement for the quarter, partly offset by ongoing labor costs in the U.S. The incremental labor cost in the U.S. related primarily to our decision to invest in our people by raising wages and providing paid time off for employees at our company operated restaurants, as well as providing educational assistance to all eligible U.S. restaurant employees effective July 1. 
These costs, along with wage increases mandated by several states during the first half of the year, impacted third quarter U.S. margins by about 400 basis points. For the quarter, U.S. commodity costs rose about 1%, primarily due to higher beef prices. Our U.S. third quarter pricing year-over-year was up about 2%, which remains below Food Away From Home inflation of around 3%. The current projected increase in food away-from-home inflation for the full year remained at 2% to 3%.
Commodity costs for the International Lead Markets segment were up about 0.5% in the quarter. While price increases vary by market, year-over-year increases for these markets average 1% to 2%. Moving down the P&L.
G&A for the third quarter ended at $584 million, up 9% in constant currencies due entirely to higher incentive-based compensation accruals versus the prior year. Despite this unfavorable quarterly comparison, we are making progress against our previously announced savings target.
Looking beyond the third quarter, currency translation is expected to be a headwind for the final quarter of 2015 as the U.S. dollar remained strong against nearly all of the world's other major currencies. Based on current exchange rates, we expect currency translation to negatively impact fourth quarter earnings per share by $0.08 to $0.10.
As usual, take this as directional guidance only because rates will change as we move throughout the quarter.
Before I conclude my remarks, I want to make a comment about our financial outlook for the full year 2015. As you know, each quarter, we typically provide details around our expectations for several key components influencing our financial result in an outlook section. In light of our upcoming November investor meeting, we did not provide an update in our financial outlook in either today's prepared remarks or as part of today's 8-K filing. An update on these components will be provided in conjunction with our investor meeting in a few weeks.
In closing, the transition in both our operating and reporting structure represents a new era for McDonald's as we move toward becoming a more focused and efficient organization. While we are less than 6 months into executing our turnaround plan, our third quarter results demonstrate early signs of progress with both our top and bottom line results.
We are encouraged by this progress, but recognize that there is much more work to be done. As we begin fourth quarter, we're energized by the challenges in front of us. Thanks. And I'll now turn it over to Chris to begin our Q&A."

The Owner/Operators have really embraced this. I mean, to go from a test market in May to a nationwide rollout by October is a significant validation of the alignment the operators behind this. When they approved it, they approved it with a 98% plus approval rating around the country. So there's a lot of unity and alignment behind it. 
And from an operational perspective, having spent a fair bit of time in the markets for the last 2 or 3 weeks, the operators have been really again infused at the fact that this has created. It's been a lot smoother from an operational perspective than perhaps people had feared. 
The reality is the ingredients, the equipment, the procedures is already very, very well-established in the restaurants. And by launching all-day breakfast, whilst at the same time, removing some of them are complex lower sales items at the same time, we have a net simplification in the restaurants, and we have a -- we're driving force.

Since obviously, the large majority of that impact happens in the second half of the year, that implies that the impact on the second half would be substantially more than 200 basis points. So the impacts relatively in line with our expectations. The payback from the investment will take a little time in terms of lowering turnover, having stronger employees deliver a better customer experience, ultimately, driving top line sales. Moving forward, it'll obviously continue to impact margin comparisons for the next 3 quarters until we lap the July 1. But as you know, margins are also significantly impacted by our top line. So if we're able to generate higher comps, that would certainly mitigate some of that impact."

And then we reset, and the performance of the $2.50 double cheese and small fry improved across the summer as the focus got clear and our execution in the restaurant got sharper. So it filled a gap for us. We do have a desire, along with our owner/operators that provide a more sustainable value platform, which we'll be looking to introduce through 2016. But it certainly played a meaningful role across the summer are helping to drive the platform. In terms of the operational sales or just this implication. Just, again, simplification in the way we're looking at this and the way the team in the U.S. is looking at it, is menu is positive, but there's a lot more the can do to help simplify the restaurants on a day-to-day basis, both from a customer perspective, but also, from our managers and our crew. So there's operational simplification, there's training simple inflation. This things we do, which and acing and also in packaging as well.

And because of the taste, because of the quality and the execution of restaurants, their customers really did respond well. As I said earlier, outperformance at the high end of our expectations. But I think we'll see, as we build our calendars out across any of our markets, but certainly here in the U.S, we do want to provide the best value of each level, great value core products, great Valley premium. And probably one of the areas where we're still a little weaker is at that more entry-level, value level. And that's why you've have been hearing about. And that's what -- we're working with the operators on, and the operators are aligning behind what they believe will be strong platform as we enter 2016 to help drive the foothold. Because we know that yes, the top line going into positive territory was encouraging for us. There's no doubt about that. Our ultimate measure of success will be serving more customers than getting the best customer discount as well."

One is around trading hard and particularly trading hard on value. and the second one is restoring brand trust. And actually, in that market now, our trust metrics are higher than they were prior to the supply incidents a year ago. So I think that kind of validate the focus they put on there. As we look forward, there are probably 4 elements that the team working on over across the next couple of quarters, continuing on brand trust, consist everyday value at the entry and midtier levels. They've got a big an exciting play around convenience in particular around digital activation and delivery. So those are 2 drivers that aren't unique to China, but are very material to the consumer in China, digital activation, working with some of main tech partners in China. We got some great relationships there and a very strong delivery business. And the fourth one is just around consumer excitement, just having fun with products and the experience in the restaurants. So we -- I don't want anyone to think that just because we were down last year, you would ultimately bounce back. We've got to work hard for it. The team have worked for it.

I'll start with the cost items and I'll will let Steve talk about kind of the leadership and running the markets typically. A couple of things going on here. One, you may have seen and it may have been a little confusing, but we tried to explain one of the things that's gone on is we're moving a little bit from a very decentralized structure to one that centralizes certain non-customer facing functions and activities. So along with that, some costs that have historically are managed at a segment level now are being managed or will be managed at a central corporate level. So some of the cost that were reflected last year in the segments are now in corporate, about $30 million of those in total of those costs. That doesn't impact consolidated or total G&A. That's more of just a reallocation. At the same time, we obviously talked about saving real consolidated G&A. And as I said, we're making progress on that, and we'll give a further update on those activities and the investor meeting in November."

They are overseen by a team of just 3 people. Now these are 3 very senior, highly talented individuals. But the decision-making and the feasibility in those 5 markets is so much clearer because we remove the layers of that tend to just obscure what's going on. So if those 3 leaders see something work in Australia, our ability to share that with the Canadians, with the U.K, German, France team and vice versa, obviously, is its far clear. So the speed of the decision-making, visibility to what's working, visibility to what's not working and just sharing that knowledge and getting to market quicker with things that work we are already seeing the benefits of that. And that's incredibly encouraging, because we've always had pockets of excellence. I want fewer pockets of excellence, I want a broader base excellence, I believe the structure will help deliver that."

So that's where my kind of my language of that supplication work. So if we're not adding new SKUs into the restaurant for breakfast because all ingredients are already there. They're in the chillers, they're in the freezers, the equipment are already in place. So yes, they're being operational shift running. There's an operational complexity, not an ingredient complexity. In the meantime, around the country, we've -- of the year's team have been very rigorous in their analytics on this in helping provide each and every color with a tool that helps them assess operational complexity versus contribution to product mix and margin. And then as a finalist screen which is around the brand value. So that's else -- actual detail insight and rigor around supporting the cost taking items off. So on average, right, I think you need it at the start of the year, we removed around 7 items from menu. It's probably at least another 7, if not, more on average across of the comes upon the country now. And I know there continuing to spread. As we offer more abilities to customize and personalize food going forward, that we can use another opportunity to actually take for the items on. So I hope that makes sense. The troubled seeing with some locations that means whenever you do add and ship more complex. We're not going to be static. We are going to be energetic. We will innovate. We will have new products. It's fun and that's what customers want. We've got to make sure that we take more than that out of the restaurant complexity. So I hope that makes a little more sense."

It's been 8 months since I stepped into the position of CEO. Since then, we've made meaningful progress to fuel our turnarounds and begin repositioning McDonald's as the modern progressive burger company. 
Our turnaround is operationally led. It's grounded in running great restaurants, which is the first step to enhancing the customer experience. People have more choices than ever about where to dine. We want to give them more reasons to dine in McDonald's by recommitting to hot, fresh food, fast-friendly service, contemporary restaurant experience, all at the value of McDonald's.
Our #1 priority is to return critical markets to sustainable revenue and income growth. To do so, we must be customer centric in our planning and our decision-making. We must have the best talent in the most critical positions. And our system must be aligned around the actions we are taking to consistently run great restaurants. And we must execute initiatives that ultimately enhance our appeal in the areas that matter most to consumers, to great tasting, high quality food, convenience and value.
Whilst we're still in the early phases, our turnaround plan is working. Customers are beginning to respond to the actions we're taking, and this progress is reflected in our third quarter results. As we discussed previously, the U.S. and international lead market segments generate over 80% of global operating income. 
For third quarter, 5 of our 6 most significant markets drove positive comparable sales growth with France's comparable sales being marginally negative. We also grew consolidated margins, operating income and earnings per share on a constant currency basis.  These results do, in part, reflect the benefits from comparisons to 2014 China supplier issue and the prior year's increasing tax reserves. However, operating results for the quarter were still up modestly when you exclude these items and take into consideration the significant currency headwinds.
Looking ahead, as we begin fourth quarter, global comparable sales are expected to be positive in all segments. Every market face a significant role in our global turnaround. Some markets, like Canada, Australia and the U.K. are further along, they continue to deliver strong, sustained growth.
That said, all markets have adjusted how they think and how they operate to ensure their actions and decisions are grounded in satisfying customers in their local markets today and for the long term.
The U.S. business remains strong [indiscernible] , given its fundamental importance to overall consolidated results. It shift to positive comparable sales in the third quarter. The first quarterly comparable sales increased in the U.S. in 2 years is a tangible sign of progress and reflects the initial steps we've taken in areas that matter most to our customers: great tasting, high quality foods, convenience and value. 
In the area of food, we've made progress towards enhancing the taste of our products and improving consumer perceptions of quality.
Our call classics define the McDonald's brand. That's why we've been hardest [ph] operational procedures. We're toasting buns longer, changing how we sear and grow burger patties, to bring out the best in our menu and serve hotter [indiscernible] to our customers.
We transition back to the original recipe for our Egg McMuffin, using butter instead of margarine to deliver an even tastier sandwich. Customers appreciated the change and we saw double-digit increase in the number of Egg McMuffin's sold immediately following the rollout.
In August, we introduced the buttermilk chicken sandwich made with 100% chicken breast meat and real buttermilk. This new product complements our ongoing call menu emphasis and customers have responded favorably. Initial results have exceeded the high end of our expectations.
And at the start of the fourth quarter, we rolled out all-day breakfast across the U.S. Customers have been asking for this for years, and we challenged ourselves to move past legacy barriers to deliver, and we did. Our ability to move the one market in May to all 14,000 restaurants, speak to the commitment and alignment of franchisees and our entire system have been customer led in our decisions and our actions.
We've also taken actions to enhance our convenience and the overall customer experience. Early this year, we implemented operational procedure designed to improve order accuracy, remove some items in the menu and simplified the drive-through menu boards. Our goal is net simplification. We've established screens to evaluate operational complexity versus the expected impact on the customer and the business. And ultimately, we want to focus our records on fewer, bigger decisions that generate bigger rewards.
We also took a first step toward enhancing the customer experience digitally with the deployment of the mobile application. To date, there've been over 2 million downloads of the app, and 1.5 million offers redeems. We'll begin national appetizing later this month.
Now from a value standpoint, we're aligned with franchisees on the need for national value. The summer $2.50 double cheeseburger and small fry promotion was the first step. And we remain committed with operators in working towards restoring more permanent national value platform in the future. 
Customers are noticing the differences. Our customer feedback system, which now tracks approximately 10 million customer touch points each year, reflects consistent improvement in customer feedback scores. We're seeing this across all key categories measured, with the most significant improvement seen in the areas we focused on, namely: food quality, friendly and fast service and order accuracy. 
Let's now turn to the International Lead Markets segment, starting with Australia. Third quarter marks 4 consecutive quarters of comparable sales and guest counts in Australia. The market turnaround began last year, as the customers responded to the combined initiatives that collectively improved our overall experience. This included a renewed focus on improving operations. The added convenience of offering Barista, Kraft [ph] and McCafé beverages through the drive-through and the stronger value platform with that relaunch of the Loose Change menu. This year, we've been giving customers even more reasons to visit our restaurants with the rollout of a new Value Menu of breakfast and through effective marketing and promotional efforts, including monopoly.
National advertising of the Experience of The Future, which include self-order kiosks, digital menu boards, table service and burger customization through Create Your Taste began July 1. While early, we're encouraged with initial results and the positive buzz we've created in the market. And we're fueling the energy as we add chicken and salad offerings to the Create Your Taste platform later this month.
Let's now turn to Germany. Our market showing early signs of a turnaround. Customers are responding to the steps we've taken to enhance the appeal of premium products by emphasizing the problems and sustainability of ingredients. The new clubhouse veggie sandwich in August, along with the rehit of a proven customer favorite, Wilde Küche 3 contributed to positive comparable sales in the third quarter. And this month's launch of the McB, a premium burger that's made with 100% organic beef from farms in Germany and Austria reinforces food quality measures to our customers. 
In France, we continue to maintain share despite the challenging macro environments, and the former eating out market experiencing its fourth consecutive year of decline. Customers appreciate the actions we've taken to strengthen value at every price tier. This includes introducing McFirst earlier this year, a 3 item meal combination for under EUR 5 and extending the [indiscernible] across more product categories in day parts.
In addition, strong marketing campaigns, including the grow on premium and the American summer food events have successfully driven premium sandwich sales. They're also elevating the service experience by providing customers with new ways to order and be served in our restaurants. Self-order kiosks are now in more than 90% of French restaurants, and we're now offering table service in more than half.
Strong performance continues in the U.K and Canada. These 2 markets' ability to sustain prolonged growth is a direct result of their robust planning process, which directly links actions to the specific consumer needs. Strong quality campaign in both markets are boosting customer perceptions of core classics and successful promotions and new menu news like the Chicken Legend in the U.K. and the new Mighty Angus in Canada have driven growth in premium products.
Since Russia and China are 2 high growth markets in particular interest, let's spend a moment on them. Both markets posted positive comparable sales from the quarter as they recover from last year's well-documented issues. The team's execution against strong recovery plans with a comprehensive focus around great tasting, high-quality food, convenience and value have successfully restored brand trust scores in both markets. However, we face near-term headwinds, given an economic slowdown in China and continued volatility in Russia.
In addition to the operational elements of the turnaround plan each market is executing around the globe, we continue a regular cadence of meaningful moves consistent with the leadership brand. We believe these moves will ultimately improve consumer perceptions of our brand.
In September, we announced our plans in the U.S. to transition to [indiscernible] over the next 10 years. More recently, we collaborated with a number of global brand leaders to raise awareness for the plight of refugees and the need to support the United Nation's World Food Programme. And earlier this week, we announced our participation in the White House Climate Pledge.
Turning around our business requires a relentless focus on what consumers wants and expect from McDonald's. Our responsibility is to give them reasons to feel good about visiting time and again. Our opportunity is to differentiate McDonald's while delivering what consumers want today, while laying the foundation for what that expect tomorrow, and our commitment is to deliver on both.
I'm pleased with the progress we've made and remain confident in the ability of our talented system of franchisees, employees and suppliers to revitalize our connection with customers as we execute our turnaround plan into 2016.
Thank you. And I'll now hand it over to Kevin."

Today's earnings release marks our first quarterly reporting under the new segment structure. So I want to spend a few minutes outlining the new segments as a lead-in to my discussion of the factors that impacted the company's third quarter performance. 
Effective July 1, we completed an important first step in the company's global turnaround plan. The reorganization of our business from a geographically focused structure to segment the combine markets with similar characteristics and opportunities for growth. Our reporting segments now include the U.S, our largest individual market accounting for over 40% of consolidated operating income; the international lead segment, which includes our established markets of Australia, Canada, France, Germany and the U.K. that collectively account for about 40% of the company's operating income; the high-growth segment, which includes markets with relatively higher restaurant expansion and franchising potential, including China, Italy, Poland, Russia, South Korea, Spain, Switzerland and the Netherlands. Together, these markets account for about 10% of the company's operating income and the foundational and corporate segment that encompasses the remaining markets, each of which has the potential to operate under a largely franchised model. These markets are combined with corporate activities for reporting purposes. 
From a business operation standpoint, this new structure brings similar markets together to leverage their collective insights and expertise to deliver a better overall experience for our customers. From a reporting standpoint, the new structure provides greater visibility into the key markets driving the vast majority of the company's underlying financial performance. 
So let's take a look at the major drivers of our third quarter results. Earnings per share for the quarter increased $0.31 to $1.40. In constant currencies, third quarter earnings per share increased $0.48. These results benefited from the comparison against prior year results, which included an increase in our tax reserves and the China supplier issue. These items negatively impacted third quarter 2014 earnings per share by $0.41. Excluding the impact of the unusual prior-year items, third quarter earnings per share would have increased $0.07 or 5% in constant currencies.
Looking beyond the unusual prior-year items, third quarter global comparable sales were up 4%, reflecting positive comparable sales across all segments and positive guest counts in all segments except the U.S. The international lead market segment was the largest contributor to the company's third quarter comparable sales performance, posting an increase of 4.6%, led by strong comparable sales and guest counts in Australia, the U.K. and Canada.
Germany's results were uneven, but encouraging, as the market posted positive comparable sales for the second consecutive quarter. And in France, comparable sales were marginally negative as the market's macroeconomic environment and Informal Eating Out industry remain challenged. The high growth markets generated strong comparable sales of 8.9% for the quarter, reflecting sales recovery in both China and Russia. For perspective, China's comparable sales were up 26.8% for the quarter.
The U.S. reported a comparable sales increase from 0.9% for the quarter, supported by the introduction of the new buttermilk crispy chicken sandwich and a return to the classic recipe for our Egg McMuffin. Comparable sales performance improved for the latter part of the quarter.
With more than 80% of our global restaurants franchised, the largest driver of operating income continues to be our franchised margins, which totaled $1.9 billion, a 7% increase in constant currencies for the quarter. The franchise margin percent increased 20 basis points to 82.2%, driven by the positive comparable sales generated by the international segments. Global company operated margin dollars increased 9% in constant currencies to $675 million for the quarter, while the company operated margin percent increased 10 basis points to 15.8%.
China sales recovery accounted for the majority of the margin improvement for the quarter, partly offset by ongoing labor costs in the U.S. The incremental labor cost in the U.S. related primarily to our decision to invest in our people by raising wages and providing paid time off for employees at our company operated restaurants, as well as providing educational assistance to all eligible U.S. restaurant employees effective July 1. These costs, along with wage increases mandated by several states during the first half of the year, impacted third quarter U.S. margins by about 400 basis points. For the quarter, U.S. commodity costs rose about 1%, primarily due to higher beef prices. 
Our U.S. third quarter pricing year-over-year was up about 2%, which remains below food-away-from-home inflation of around 3%. The current projected increase in food-away-from-home inflation for the full year remained at 2% to 3%.
Commodity costs for the International Lead Market segment were up about 0.5% in the quarter. While price increases vary by market, year-over-year increases for these markets average 1% to 2%. 
Moving down the P&L. G&A for the third quarter ended at $584 million, up 9% in constant currencies due entirely to higher incentive-based compensation accruals versus the prior year. Despite this unfavorable quarterly comparison, we are making progress against our previously announced savings target.
Looking beyond the third quarter, currency translation is expected to be a headwind for the final quarter of 2015 as the U.S. dollar remained strong against nearly all of the world's other major currencies. Based on current exchange rates, we expect currency translation to negatively impact fourth quarter earnings per share by $0.08 to $0.10.
As usual, take this as directional guidance only because rates will change as we move throughout the quarter.
Before I conclude my remarks, I want to make a comment about our financial outlook for the full year 2015. As you know, each quarter, we typically provide details around our expectations for several key components influencing our financial result in an outlook section. In light of our upcoming November investor meeting, we did not provide an update on our financial outlook in either today's prepared remarks or as part of today's 8-K filing. An update on these components will be provided in conjunction with our investor meeting in a few weeks.
In closing, the transition in both our operating and reporting structure represents a new era for McDonald's, as we move toward becoming a more focused and efficient organization. While we are less than 6 months into executing our turnaround plan, our third quarter results demonstrate early signs of progress with both our top and bottom line results.
We are encouraged by this progress, but recognize that there is much more work to be done. As we begin fourth quarter, we're energized by the challenges in front of us. Thanks. 
And now I'll turn it over to Chris to begin our Q&A."

The Owner/Operators have really embraced this. I mean, to go from a test market in May to a nationwide rollout by October is a significant validation of the alignment the operators behind this. When they approved it, they approved it with a 98% plus approval rating around the country. So there's a lot of unity and alignment behind it.  And from an operational perspective, having spent a fair bit of time in the markets for the last 2 or 3 weeks, the operators have been really again infused at the fact that this has created -- it's been a lot smoother from operational perspective than perhaps people had feared. 
The reality is the ingredients, the equipment, the training, the procedures is already very, very well established in the restaurants. And by launching all-day breakfast, whilst at the same time, removing some of the more complex lower sales items at the same time, we have a net simplification in the restaurants, and we have a -- we're driving force. So it's early days to give too much read on sales, but we're fairly encouraged. And more importantly, the Owner/Operators are very encouraged about how we kicked off."

And at that time, we indicated that we expected the impact of this, as well as other state-mandated increases, to be about 200 basis points on our margins for the full year this year. Since obviously, the large majority of that impact happens in the second half of the year, that implies that the impact on the second half would be substantially more than 200 basis points. So the impacts relatively in line with our expectations. The payback from the investment will take a little time in terms of lowering turnover, having stronger employees, deliver a better customer experience, ultimately, driving top line sales. Moving forward, it'll obviously continue to impact margin comparisons for the next 3 quarters until we lap the July 1. But as you know, margins are also significantly impacted by our top line. So if we're able to generate higher comps, that would certainly mitigate some of that impact."

So it filled a gap for us. We do have a desire, along with our Owner/Operators of a more sustained value platform, which we'll be looking to introduce through 2016. But it certainly played a meaningful role across the summer are helping to drive the platform. In terms of the operational sales -- in terms of simplification, I just -- again, simplification in the way we're looking at this and the way the team in the U.S. is looking at it, is menu is positive, but there's a lot more we can do to help simplify the restaurants on a day-to-day basis, both from a customer perspective, but also from our managers and our crew. So there's operational simplification, there's training simplification. These things we do at merchandise and to make it easier for customers to navigate the restaurant and also with packaging as well. So the team there were some teams that are addressing each of these areas of opportunity. So yes, menu is one piece, but the whole operational complexity, the training and [indiscernible] and packaging is another. And it's the sum of those parts is what manages that begin to recognize that we are working hard to make their life a little easier so they can just focus on what they love to and just running the restaurants, serving customers."

And probably one of the areas where we're still a little weaker is at that more entry-level, value level. And that's what you've been hearing about, and that's what -- we're working with the operators on, and the operators are aligning behind what they believe will be strong platform as we enter 2016 to help drive the foothold.

One is around trading hard and particularly trading hard on value, and the second one is restoring brand trust. And actually, in that market now, our trust metrics are higher than they were prior to the supply incidents a year ago. So I think that kind of validate the focus they put on there. As we look forward, there are probably 4 elements that the team are working on across the next couple of quarters, continuing on brand trust, consistent everyday value at the entry and mid-tier levels. They've got a big and exciting play around convenience, in particularly around digital activation and delivery. So those are 2 drivers that are unique to China, but are very material to the consumer in China, digital activation, working with some of main tech partners in China. We got some great relationships there and a very strong delivery business. And the fourth one is just around consumer excitement, just having fun with products and the experience in the restaurants.

If you remember from the past, the U.S. undertook a fairly significant structural change itself. Now about a year ago, where we eliminated and they are liberated a little more entrepreneurial spirit in the regions. That takes time to settle down. You can't just hit your stride straightaway. So I think as the regions and the teams in the regions begin to find their feet as it will, that helps. I don't want to underestimate just the investments we're making in food quality, the investments that consumers care about, such as the announcement to go to 3 range eggs, for example, such as the quality cues that you deliver with the buttermilk chicken. I mean, that is getting strong. But underpinning it, and I'll never ever move away from this, any market that's successful around the world is because they're focusing on the day-to-day operation and just delivering at that moment of truth for the customer. That is what McDonald's is all about. What we're seeing in the speed of service? Well, actually, we're seeing greater improvement in the accuracy. So accuracy is probably the strongest metric improvement we're getting, which on the basis that around 70% of the business goes the drive-through, clearly accuracy is particularly important. But we begin to see a few seconds being shaved our average service times as we simplify the menu and shopping up the operations. But it's early days, and we've got -- there's a lot more progress we want to make, I've got to say that."

One, you may have seen and it may have been a little confusing, but we tried to explain one of the things that's gone on is we're moving a little bit from a very decentralized structure to one that centralizes certain noncustomer facing functions and activities. So along with that, some costs that historically are managed at a segment level now are being managed or will be managed at a central corporate level. So some of the cost that were reflected last year in the segments are now in corporate. It's about $30 million of those in total of those costs. That doesn't impact consolidated or total G&A. That's more of just a reallocation. At the same time, we obviously talked about saving real consolidated G&A.

So if those 3 leaders can see something work in Australia, our ability to share that with the Canadians, with the U.K, German, France team and vice versa, obviously, is -- it's far clearer. So speed of the decision-making, visibility into what's working, visibility into what's not working and just sharing that knowledge and getting to market quicker with things that work, we are already seeing the benefits of that.

And then, when we do talk about doing something like an all-day breakfast, people were scratching their head and say, hold on a minute you talk simplification, but now you're acting . So, when I talk about net, I'm saying we've got to take more complexity out to drive decision-making than we ever put in. So that's where my kind of my language of net simplification works. So if we're not adding any new SKUs into the restaurant for breakfast because all the ingredients are already there. They're in the chillers, they're in the freezers, the equipment is already in place. So yes, there is the operational shift running. There's an operational complexity, but not an ingredient complexity. In the meantime, around the country, we've -- the U.S. team has been very rigorous in their analytics on this in helping provide each and every color with a tool that helps them assess operational complexity versus contribution to product mix and margin. And then as a final screen which is around kind of the brand value. So that helps have actual detail insight and rigor around supporting the cost taking items off. So on average, right, I think you knew at the start of the year, we've removed around 7 items from the menu. It's probably at least another 7, if not more, on average across the clubs around the country now. And I know they're continuing on this part and as we offer more abilities to customize and personalize food going forward, that may give us another opportunity to actually take further items off. So I hope that makes sense. The trouble saying simplification is that means whenever you do add anything [indiscernible] future and say hold on a minute that's going to make it more complex. We're not going to be static. We are going to be energetic. We will innovate. We will have new products. It's fun and that's what customers want. We've got to make sure that we take more than that out of the restaurant complexity. So I hope that makes a little more sense."

It's been 8 months since I stepped into the position of CEO. Since then, we've made meaningful progress to fuel our turnaround and begin repositioning McDonald's as a modern, progressive burger company. Our turn",1656,"Thank you, Chris. Good morning, everyone. It's been 8 months since I stepped into the position of CEO. Since then, we've made meaningful progress to fuel our turnaround and begin repositioning McDonald's as a modern, progressive burger company. 
Our turnaround is operationally led. It's grounded in running great restaurants, which is the first step to enhancing the customer experience. People have more choices than ever about where to dine. We want to give them more reasons to dine in McDonald's by recommitting to hot, fresh food, fast friendly service, a contemporary restaurant experience, all at the value of McDonald's.
Our #1 priority is to return critical markets to sustainable revenue and income growth. To do so, we must be customer centric in our planning and our decision-making. We must have the best talent in the most critical positions. And our system must be aligned around the actions we are taking to consistently run great restaurants. And we must execute initiatives that ultimately enhance our appeal in the areas that matter most to consumers, which is great tasting, high quality food, convenience and value.
Whilst we're still in the early phases, our turnaround plan is working. Customers are beginning to respond to the actions we are taking, and this progress is reflected in our third quarter results. As we discussed previously, the U.S. and International Lead Market segments generate over 80% of global operating income. 
For third quarter, 5 of our 6 most significant markets drove positive comparable sales growth with France's comparable sales being marginally negative. We also grew consolidated margins, operating income and earnings per share on a constant currency basis.  These results do, in part, reflect the benefits from comparisons to 2014 China supplier issue and the prior year's increasing tax reserves. However, operating results for the quarter were still up modestly when you exclude these items and take into consideration the significant currency headwinds.
Looking ahead, as we begin fourth quarter, global comparable sales are expected to be positive in all segments. Every market plays a significant role in our global turnaround. Some markets, like Canada, Australia and the U.K. are further along, they continue to deliver strong, sustained growth.
That said, all markets have adjusted how they think and how they operate to ensure their actions and decisions are grounded in satisfying customers in their local markets today and for the long term.
The U.S. business remains front and center, given its fundamental importance to overall consolidated results. It shift to positive comparable sales in the third quarter, the first quarterly comparable sales increased in the U.S. in 2 years, is a tangible sign of progress and reflects the initial steps we've taken in areas that matter most to our customers: great tasting, high quality food, convenience and value. 
In the area of food, we've made progress towards enhancing the taste of our products and improving consumer perceptions of quality.  Our call classics define the McDonald's brand. That's why we've enhanced operational procedures. We're toasting buns longer, changing how we sear and grill burger patties to bring out the best in our menu and serve hotter, juicier sandwiches to our customers.
We transitioned back to the original recipe for our Egg McMuffin, using butter instead of margarine to deliver an even tastier sandwich. Customers appreciated the change and we saw double-digit increase in the number of Egg McMuffin's sold immediately following the rollout.
In August, we introduced the buttermilk chicken sandwich made with 100% chicken breast meat and real buttermilk. This new product complements our ongoing call menu emphasis and customers have responded favorably. Initial results have exceeded the high end of our expectations.
And at the start of the fourth quarter, we rolled out all-day breakfast across the U.S. Customers have been asking for this for years, and we challenged ourselves to move past legacy barriers to deliver, and we did. Our ability to move the one market in May to all 14,000 restaurants, speaks to the commitment and alignment of franchisees and our entire system of being customer-led in our decisions and our actions.
We've also taken action to enhance our convenience and the overall customer experience. Early this year, we implemented operational procedure designed to improve order accuracy, remove some items from the menu and simplified the drive-through menu boards. Our goal is net simplification. We've established screens to evaluate operational complexity versus the expected impact on the customer and the business. And ultimately, we want to focus our efforts on fewer, bigger decisions that generate bigger rewards.
We also took a first step toward enhancing the customer experience digitally with the deployment of the mobile application. To date, there've been over 2 million downloads of the app, and 1.5 million offers redeemed. We'll begin national advertising later this month.
Now from a value standpoint, we're aligning franchisees on the need for national value. The summer $2.50 double cheeseburger and small fry promotion was the first step. And we remain committed with operators in working towards restoring more permanent national value platform in the future. 
Customers are noticing the differences. Our customer feedback system, which now tracks approximately 10 million customer touch points each year, reflects consistent improvement in customer feedback scores. We're seeing this across all key categories measured, with the most significant improvement seen in the areas we focused on, namely: food quality, friendly and fast service and order accuracy. 
Let's now turn to the International Lead Markets segment, starting with Australia. Third quarter marks 4 consecutive quarters of comparable sales and guest counts in Australia. The market turnaround began last year, as the customers responded to the combined initiatives that collectively improved their overall experience. This included a renewed focus on improving operations. The added convenience of offering barista-crafted McCafé beverages through the drive-through and the stronger value platform with that relaunch of the Loose Change menu. This year, we've been giving customers even more reasons to visit our restaurants with the rollout of a new Value Menu at breakfast and through effective marketing and promotional efforts, including Monopoly.
National advertising of the Experience of The Future, which include self-order kiosks, digital menu boards, table service and burger customization through Create Your Taste began July 1. While early, we're encouraged with initial results and the positive buzz we've created in the market. And we're fueling the energy as we add chicken and salad offerings to the Create Your Taste platform later this month.
Let's now turn to Germany, a market showing early signs of a turnaround. Customers are responding to the steps we've taken to enhance the appeal of premium products by emphasizing the provenance and sustainability of ingredients. The new clubhouse veggie sandwich in August, along with a re-hit of a proven customer favorite, Wilde Küche 3 contributed to positive comparable sales in the third quarter. And this month's launch of the McB, a premium burger that's made with 100% organic beef from farms in Germany and Austria reinforces food quality measures to our customers. 
In France, we continue to maintain share despite the challenging macro environment, and an informal eating out market experiencing its fourth consecutive year of decline. Customers appreciate the actions we've taken to strengthen value at every price tier. This includes introducing McFirst earlier this year, a 3-item meal combination for under EUR 5 and extending Petit Plaisir across more product categories and day parts.
In addition, strong marketing campaigns, including the drawn premium and the American summer food events have successfully driven premium sandwich sales. They're also elevating the service experience by providing customers with new ways to order and be served in our restaurants. Self-order kiosks are now in more than 90% of French restaurants, and we're now offering table service in more than half.
Strong performance continues in the U.K. and Canada. These 2 markets' ability to sustain prolonged growth is a direct result of their robust planning process, which directly links actions to the specific consumer needs. Strong quality campaigns in both markets are boosting customer perceptions of core classics and successful promotions and new menu news like the Chicken Legend in the U.K. and the new Mighty Angus in Canada have driven growth in premium products.
Since Russia and China are 2 high growth markets of particular interest, let's spend a moment on them. Both markets posted positive comparable sales for the quarter as they recover from last year's well-documented issues. The team's execution against strong recovery plans with a comprehensive focus around great tasting, high-quality food, convenience and value have successfully restored brand trust scores in both markets. However, we face near-term headwinds, given an economic slowdown in China and continued volatility in Russia.
In addition to the operational elements of the turnaround plan each market is executing around the globe, we continue a regular cadence of meaningful moves consistent with the leadership brand. We believe these moves will ultimately improve consumer perceptions of our brand.
In September, we announced our plans in the U.S. to transition to cage-free eggs over the next 10 years. More recently, we collaborated with a number of global brand leaders to raise awareness for the plight of refugees and the need to support the United Nation's World Food Programme. And earlier this week, we announced our participation in the White House Climate Pledge.
Turning around our business requires a relentless focus on what consumers wants and expect from McDonald's. Our responsibility is to give them reasons to feel good about visiting time and again. Our opportunity is to differentiate McDonald's while delivering what consumers want today, while laying the foundation for what that expect tomorrow, and our commitment is to deliver on both.
I'm pleased with the progress we've made and remain confident in the ability of our talented system of franchisees, employees and suppliers to revitalize our connection with customers as we execute our turnaround plan into 2016.
Thank you. And I'll now hand it over to Kevin."

Today's earnings release marks our first quarterly reporting under the new segment structure. So I want to spend a few minutes outlining the new segments as a lead-in to my discussion of the factors that impacted the company's third quarter performance. 
Effective July 1, we completed an important first step in the company's global turnaround plan. The reorganization of our business from a geographically focused structure to segments that combined markets with similar characteristics and opportunities for growth. Our reporting segments now include the U.S., our largest individual market, accounting for over 40% of consolidated operating income; the International Lead segment, which includes our established markets of Australia, Canada, France, Germany and the U.K. that collectively account for about 40% of the company's operating income; the high-growth segment, which includes markets with relatively higher restaurant expansion and franchising potential, including China, Italy, Poland, Russia, South Korea, Spain, Switzerland and the Netherlands. Together, these markets account for about 10% of the company's operating income; and the foundational and corporate segment that encompasses the remaining markets, each of which has the potential to operate under a largely franchised model. These markets are combined with corporate activities for reporting purposes. 
From a business operation standpoint, this new structure brings similar markets together to leverage their collective insights and expertise to deliver a better overall experience for our customers. From a reporting standpoint, the new structure provides greater visibility into the key markets driving the vast majority of the company's underlying financial performance. 
So let's take a look at the major drivers of our third quarter results. Earnings per share for the quarter increased $0.31 to $1.40. In constant currencies, third quarter earnings per share increased $0.48. These results benefited from the comparison against prior year results, which included an increase in our tax reserves and the China supplier issue. These items negatively impacted third quarter 2014 earnings per share by $0.41. Excluding the impact of the unusual prior-year items, third quarter earnings per share would have increased $0.07 or 5% in constant currency.
Looking beyond the unusual prior-year items, third quarter global comparable sales were up 4%, reflecting positive comparable sales across all segments and positive guest counts in all segments except the U.S. The International Lead Market segment was the largest contributor to the company's third quarter comparable sales performance, posting an increase of 4.6%, led by strong comparable sales and guest counts in Australia, the U.K. and Canada.
Germany's results were uneven, but encouraging, as the market posted positive comparable sales for the second consecutive quarter. And in France, comparable sales were marginally negative as the market's macroeconomic environment and informal eating out industry remain challenged. The high growth markets generated strong comparable sales of 8.9% for the quarter, reflecting sales recovery in both China and Russia. For perspective, China's comparable sales were up 26.8% for the quarter.
The U.S. reported a comparable sales increase from 0.9% for the quarter, supported by the introduction of the new buttermilk crispy chicken sandwich and a return to the classic recipe for our Egg McMuffin. Comparable sales performance improved for the latter part of the quarter.
With more than 80% of our global restaurants franchised, the largest driver of operating income continues to be our franchise margins, which totaled $1.9 billion, a 7% increase in constant currencies for the quarter. The franchise margin percent increased 20 basis points to 82.2%, driven by the positive comparable sales generated by the international segments. Global company operated margin dollars increased 9% in constant currencies to $675 million for the quarter, while the company operated margin percent increased 10 basis points to 15.8%.
China sales recovery accounted for the majority of the margin improvement for the quarter, partly offset by ongoing labor costs in the U.S. The incremental labor cost in the U.S. related primarily to our decision to invest in our people by raising wages and providing paid time off for employees at our company operated restaurants, as well as providing educational assistance to all eligible U.S. restaurant employees effective July 1. These costs, along with wage increases mandated by several states during the first half of the year, impacted third quarter U.S. margins by about 400 basis points. For the quarter, U.S. commodity costs rose about 1%, primarily due to higher beef prices. 
Our U.S. third quarter pricing year-over-year was up about 2%, which remains below food-away-from-home inflation of around 3%. The current projected increase in food-away-from-home inflation for the full year remained at 2% to 3%.
Commodity costs for the International Lead Market segment were up about 0.5% in the quarter. While price increases vary by market, year-over-year increases for these markets averaged 1% to 2%. 
Moving down the P&L. G&A for the third quarter ended at $584 million, up 9% in constant currencies due entirely to higher incentive-based compensation accruals versus the prior year. Despite this unfavorable quarterly comparison, we are making progress against our previously announced savings target.
Looking beyond the third quarter, currency translation is expected to be a headwind for the final quarter of 2015 as the U.S. dollar remained strong against nearly all of the world's other major currencies. Based on current exchange rates, we expect currency translation to negatively impact fourth quarter earnings per share by $0.08 to $0.10.
As usual, take this as directional guidance only because rates will change as we move throughout the quarter.
Before I conclude my remarks, I want to make a comment about our financial outlook for the full year 2015. As you know, each quarter, we typically provide details around our expectations for several key components influencing our financial result in an outlook section. In light of our upcoming November investor meeting, we did not provide an update on our financial outlook in either today's prepared remarks or as part of today's 8-K filing. An update on these components will be provided in conjunction with our investor meeting in a few weeks.
In closing, the transition in both our operating and reporting structure represents a new era for McDonald's, as we move toward becoming a more focused and efficient organization. While we are less than 6 months into executing our turnaround plan, our third quarter results demonstrate early signs of progress with both our top and bottom line results.
We are encouraged by this progress, but recognize that there is much more work to be done. As we begin the fourth quarter, we're energized by the challenges in front of us. Thanks. 
And now I'll turn it over to Chris to begin our Q&A."

So we launched officially nationwide on October 6, and I would say the enthusiasm levels from customers and from our teams in the restaurants are high. It's been a successful rollout. The owner/operators have really embraced this. I mean, to go from a test market in May to a nationwide rollout by October is a significant validation of the alignment of the operators behind this. When they approved it, they approved it with a 98% plus approval rating around the country. So there's a lot of unity and alignment behind it.  And from an operational perspective, having spent a fair bit of time in the markets for the last 2 or 3 weeks, the operators have been really again infused at the fact that this has created -- it's been a lot smoother from operational perspective than perhaps people had feared. 
The reality is the ingredients, the equipment, the training, the procedures is already very, very well established in the restaurants. And by launching all-day breakfast, whilst at the same time, removing some of the more complex lower sales items at the same time, we have a net simplification in the restaurants, and we have a -- we're driving foot fall.

And at that time, we indicated that we expected the impact of this, as well as other state-mandated increases, to be about 200 basis points on our margins for the full year this year. Since obviously, the large majority of that impact happens in the second half of the year, that implies that the impact on the second half would be substantially more than 200 basis points. So the impact's relatively in line with our expectations. The payback from the investment will take a little time in terms of lowering turnover, having stronger employees deliver a better customer experience, ultimately, driving top line sales. Moving forward, it'll obviously continue to impact margin comparisons for the next 3 quarters until we lap the July 1. But as you know, margins are also significantly impacted by our top line. So if we're able to generate higher comps, that would certainly mitigate some of that impact."

So from the value program across the summer, I think on the call last quarter, acknowledged that it got after a little bit of a bumpy start, as we launched it. It was in a way bumping into some of the local value initiatives that each of the regions were driving, which made we -- and then we reset, and the performance of the $2.50 double cheese and small fry improved across the summer as the focus got clearer and our execution in the restaurant got sharper. So it filled a gap for us. We do have a desire, along with our Owner/Operators of a more sustained value platform, which we'll be looking to introduce through 2016. But it certainly played a meaningful role across the summer at helping to drive the foot fall. 
In terms of the operational -- or in terms of simplification, I just -- again, simplification in the way we're looking at this and the way the team in the U.S. is looking at it, is menu is part of it, but there's a lot more we can do to help simplify the restaurants on a day-to-day basis, both from a customer perspective, but also from our managers and our crew. So there's operational simplification, there's training simplification. These things we do with merchandising to make it easier for customers to navigate the restaurant and also with packaging as well. So the teams -- there are sub-teams that are addressing each of these areas of opportunity. So yes, menu is one piece, but the whole operational complexity, the training and merchandising and packaging is another. And it's the sum of those parts is what managers are beginning to recognize that we are working hard to make their life a little easier so they can just focus on what they'd love to and just running the restaurants, serving customers."

But I think you'll see, as we build our calendars out across any of our markets, but certainly here in the U.S., we do want to -- we want to provide the best value of each level, great value core products, great value premium. And probably one of the areas where we're still a little weaker is at that more entry-level, value level. And that's what you've been hearing about, and that's what -- we're working with the operators on, and the operators are aligning behind what they believe will be strong platform as we enter 2016 to help drive the foot fall.

But running better restaurants day in and day out -- and customers are telling us through this kind of very material feedback loop we have now that we are -- they are noting the changes in the areas that matter most to them, which is speed, friendliness and accuracy. 
Through the quarter, it's probably fair to say we ended the quarter just a little stronger than we started. But I wouldn't read too much into that. I mean, it's -- turnarounds are about momentum, and we want to establish momentum over the short-, medium- and long-term. We've got one -- we've put one marker out there.

So China, clearly, took a hit third quarter last year, we expected a return to growth clearly. And we're pleased we did. I've got to say, I'm very proud of the team in China because they were in a very difficult situation a year ago. And they set up a basically a 2-pronged approach to recover the business momentum. One was around trading hard and particularly trading hard on value, and the second one is restoring brand trust. And actually, in that market now, our trust metrics are higher than they were prior to the supplier incidents a year ago. So I think that kind of validates the focus they put on there. As we look forward, there are probably 4 elements that the team are working on across the next couple of quarters, continuing on brand trust, consistent everyday value at the entry and mid-tier levels. They've got a big and exciting play around convenience, and particularly around digital activation and delivery. So those are 2 drivers that aren't unique to China, but are very material to the consumer in China, digital activation, working with some of main tech partners in China. We got some great relationships there and a very strong delivery business. And the fourth one is just around consumer excitement, just having fun with products and the experience in the restaurants. So we -- I don't want anyone to think that just because we were down last year, you would automatically bounce back, you've got to work hard for it. The team have worked for it. And net, net, if you look at the 2-year comp, we were just -- we were slightly up across that 2-year period, which across that quarter, which I think is credit to the team."

Related to franchising. I think we've said in most of our franchising opportunity, certainly, is probably within Asia. So China, certainly, would be a part of that.

Do you think that was more about the new product news that you had or the structural improvements you're making in the restaurants with respect to operations? And then may be as part of your answer to that, if you could touch on what the metrics look like on speed of service now that you've simplified the drive-through menu?"

If you remember from the past, the U.S. undertook a fairly significant structural change itself. Now about a year ago, where we eliminated a layer, liberated a little more entrepreneurial spirit into the regions. That takes time to settle down. You can't just hit your stride straightaway. So I think as the regions and the teams in the regions begin to find their feet, as it were, that helps. I don't want to underestimate just the investments we're making in food quality, the investments that consumers care about, such as the announcement to go to free range eggs, for example, such as the quality cues that you deliver with the buttermilk chicken. I mean, that is getting strong. But underpinning it, and I'll never ever move away from this, any market that's successful around the world is because they're focusing on the day-to-day operation and just delivering at that moment of truth for the customer. That is what McDonald's is all about. What we're seeing with speed of service? Well, actually, we're seeing greater improvement in the accuracy. So accuracy is probably the strongest metric improvement we're getting, which on the basis that around 70% of the business goes through the drive-thru, clearly accuracy is particularly important. But we begin to see a few seconds being shaved off average service time as we've simplified the menu and sharpening up the operations. But it's early days, and we've got -- there's a lot more progress we want to make, I've got to say that."

One, you may have seen and it may have been a little confusing, but we tried to explain one of the things that's gone on is we're moving a little bit from a very decentralized structure to one that centralizes certain noncustomer facing functions and activities. So along with that, some costs that historically were managed at a segment level now are being managed, or will be managed, at a central corporate level. So some of the costs that were reflected last year in the segments are now in corporate. It's about $30 million of those in total of those costs. That doesn't impact consolidated or total G&A. That's more of just a reallocation. At the same time, we obviously talked about saving real consolidated G&A. And as I said, we're making progress on that, and we'll give a further update on those activities in -- at the investor meeting in November."

They are overseen by a team of just 3 people. Now these are 3 very senior, highly talented individuals. But the decision-making is, and the visibility into those 5 markets is so much clearer because we removed the layers that tend to just obscure what's going on. So if those 3 leaders can see something work in Australia, our ability to share that with the Canadians, with the U.K., German, France team and vice versa, obviously, is far clearer. So speed of the decision-making, visibility into what's working, visibility into what's not working and just sharing that knowledge and getting to market quicker with things that work, we are already seeing the benefits of that. And I think that's incredibly encouraging, because we've always had pockets of excellence. I want fewer pockets of excellence, I want a broader base excellence, I believe the structure will help deliver that."

And then, when we do talk about doing something like an all-day breakfast, people were scratching their head and say, ""Well hold on a minute you talk simplification, but now you're adding."" So, when I talk about net, I'm saying we've got to take more complexity out to drive decision-making than we ever put in. So that's where my kind of my language of net simplification works. So if we're not adding any new SKUs into the restaurant for breakfast because all the ingredients are already there. They're in the chillers, they're in the freezers, the equipment is already in place. So yes, there is the operational shift running. There's an operational complexity, but not an ingredient complexity. In the meantime, around the country, we've -- the U.S. team has been very rigorous in their analytics on this in helping provide each and every co-op with a tool that helps them assess operational complexity versus contribution to product mix and margin. And then as a final screen which is around kind of the brand value. So that helps have actual detailed insight and rigor around supporting the cost taking items off. So on average, right, I think you knew at the start of the year, we've removed around 7 items from the menu. There's probably at least another 7, if not more, on average across the co-ops around the country now. And I know they're continuing on this part and as we offer more abilities to customize and personalize food going forward, that may give us another opportunity to actually take further items off. So I hope that makes sense. The trouble with saying simplification is that means whenever you do add anything to the restaurant people turn around and say, ""Hold on a minute that's going to make it more complex."" We're not going to be static. We are going to be energetic. We will innovate. We will have new products. It's fun and that's what customers want. We've got to make sure that we take more than that out of the restaurant complexity. So I hope that makes a little more sense."

And the training that was rolled out across the U.S., which was actually was an operator-led initiative initially, was around something ask-ask-tell. It was a way that we reconfigured our own internal procedures of how we take the orders, confirm the orders and then present the orders. And that has had a positive and noticeable benefit in our accuracy. As we go forward, the more of that heavy lifting that we can get technology to do then the greater our accuracy will become. So whether it's ordering through apps, whether it's ordering through self-order kiosks that we see elsewhere around the world, technology could certainly help us with putting the customer in charge of the ordering process and allowing technology to do the heavy lifting and then we can just prepare the food and serve it in a friendly way.

It's been 8 months since I stepped into the position of CEO. Since then, we've made meaningful progress to fuel our turnaround and begin repositioning McDonald's as a modern, progressive burger company. Our turn",1656,"Thank you, Chris. Good morning, everyone. It's been 8 months since I stepped into the position of CEO. Since then, we've made meaningful progress to fuel our turnaround and begin repositioning McDonald's as a modern, progressive burger company. 
Our turnaround is operationally led. It's grounded in running great restaurants, which is the first step to enhancing the customer experience. People have more choices than ever about where to dine. We want to give them more reasons to dine in McDonald's by recommitting to hot, fresh food, fast friendly service, a contemporary restaurant experience, all at the value of McDonald's.
Our #1 priority is to return critical markets to sustainable revenue and income growth. To do so, we must be customer centric in our planning and our decision-making. We must have the best talent in the most critical positions. And our system must be aligned around the actions we are taking to consistently run great restaurants. And we must execute initiatives that ultimately enhance our appeal in the areas that matter most to consumers, which is great tasting, high quality food, convenience and value.
Whilst we're still in the early phases, our turnaround plan is working. Customers are beginning to respond to the actions we are taking, and this progress is reflected in our third quarter results. As we discussed previously, the U.S. and International Lead Market segments generate over 80% of global operating income. 
For third quarter, 5 of our 6 most significant markets drove positive comparable sales growth with France's comparable sales being marginally negative. We also grew consolidated margins, operating income and earnings per share on a constant currency basis.  These results do, in part, reflect the benefits from comparisons to 2014 China supplier issue and the prior year's increasing tax reserves. However, operating results for the quarter were still up modestly when you exclude these items and take into consideration the significant currency headwinds.
Looking ahead, as we begin fourth quarter, global comparable sales are expected to be positive in all segments. Every market plays a significant role in our global turnaround. Some markets, like Canada, Australia and the U.K. are further along, they continue to deliver strong, sustained growth.
That said, all markets have adjusted how they think and how they operate to ensure their actions and decisions are grounded in satisfying customers in their local markets today and for the long term.
The U.S. business remains front and center, given its fundamental importance to overall consolidated results. It shift to positive comparable sales in the third quarter, the first quarterly comparable sales increased in the U.S. in 2 years, is a tangible sign of progress and reflects the initial steps we've taken in areas that matter most to our customers: great tasting, high quality food, convenience and value. 
In the area of food, we've made progress towards enhancing the taste of our products and improving consumer perceptions of quality.  Our call classics define the McDonald's brand. That's why we've enhanced operational procedures. We're toasting buns longer, changing how we sear and grill burger patties to bring out the best in our menu and serve hotter, juicier sandwiches to our customers.
We transitioned back to the original recipe for our Egg McMuffin, using butter instead of margarine to deliver an even tastier sandwich. Customers appreciated the change and we saw double-digit increase in the number of Egg McMuffin's sold immediately following the rollout.
In August, we introduced the buttermilk chicken sandwich made with 100% chicken breast meat and real buttermilk. This new product complements our ongoing call menu emphasis and customers have responded favorably. Initial results have exceeded the high end of our expectations.
And at the start of the fourth quarter, we rolled out all-day breakfast across the U.S. Customers have been asking for this for years, and we challenged ourselves to move past legacy barriers to deliver, and we did. Our ability to move the one market in May to all 14,000 restaurants, speaks to the commitment and alignment of franchisees and our entire system of being customer-led in our decisions and our actions.
We've also taken action to enhance our convenience and the overall customer experience. Early this year, we implemented operational procedure designed to improve order accuracy, remove some items from the menu and simplified the drive-through menu boards. Our goal is net simplification. We've established screens to evaluate operational complexity versus the expected impact on the customer and the business. And ultimately, we want to focus our efforts on fewer, bigger decisions that generate bigger rewards.
We also took a first step toward enhancing the customer experience digitally with the deployment of the mobile application. To date, there've been over 2 million downloads of the app, and 1.5 million offers redeemed. We'll begin national advertising later this month.
Now from a value standpoint, we're aligning franchisees on the need for national value. The summer $2.50 double cheeseburger and small fry promotion was the first step. And we remain committed with operators in working towards restoring more permanent national value platform in the future. 
Customers are noticing the differences. Our customer feedback system, which now tracks approximately 10 million customer touch points each year, reflects consistent improvement in customer feedback scores. We're seeing this across all key categories measured, with the most significant improvement seen in the areas we focused on, namely: food quality, friendly and fast service and order accuracy. 
Let's now turn to the International Lead Markets segment, starting with Australia. Third quarter marks 4 consecutive quarters of comparable sales and guest counts in Australia. The market turnaround began last year, as the customers responded to the combined initiatives that collectively improved their overall experience. This included a renewed focus on improving operations. The added convenience of offering barista-crafted McCafé beverages through the drive-through and the stronger value platform with that relaunch of the Loose Change menu. This year, we've been giving customers even more reasons to visit our restaurants with the rollout of a new Value Menu at breakfast and through effective marketing and promotional efforts, including Monopoly.
National advertising of the Experience of The Future, which include self-order kiosks, digital menu boards, table service and burger customization through Create Your Taste began July 1. While early, we're encouraged with initial results and the positive buzz we've created in the market. And we're fueling the energy as we add chicken and salad offerings to the Create Your Taste platform later this month.
Let's now turn to Germany, a market showing early signs of a turnaround. Customers are responding to the steps we've taken to enhance the appeal of premium products by emphasizing the provenance and sustainability of ingredients. The new clubhouse veggie sandwich in August, along with a re-hit of a proven customer favorite, Wilde Küche 3 contributed to positive comparable sales in the third quarter. And this month's launch of the McB, a premium burger that's made with 100% organic beef from farms in Germany and Austria reinforces food quality measures to our customers. 
In France, we continue to maintain share despite the challenging macro environment, and an informal eating out market experiencing its fourth consecutive year of decline. Customers appreciate the actions we've taken to strengthen value at every price tier. This includes introducing McFirst earlier this year, a 3-item meal combination for under EUR 5 and extending Petits Plaisir across more product categories and day parts.
In addition, strong marketing campaigns, including the drawn premium and the American summer food events have successfully driven premium sandwich sales. They're also elevating the service experience by providing customers with new ways to order and be served in our restaurants. Self-order kiosks are now in more than 90% of French restaurants, and we're now offering table service in more than half.
Strong performance continues in the U.K. and Canada. These 2 markets' ability to sustain prolonged growth is a direct result of their robust planning process, which directly links actions to the specific consumer needs. Strong quality campaigns in both markets are boosting customer perceptions of core classics and successful promotions and new menu news like the Chicken Legend in the U.K. and the new Mighty Angus in Canada have driven growth in premium products.
Since Russia and China are 2 high growth markets of particular interest, let's spend a moment on them. Both markets posted positive comparable sales for the quarter as they recover from last year's well-documented issues. The team's execution against strong recovery plans with a comprehensive focus around great tasting, high-quality food, convenience and value have successfully restored brand trust scores in both markets. However, we face near-term headwinds, given an economic slowdown in China and continued volatility in Russia.
In addition to the operational elements of the turnaround plan each market is executing around the globe, we continue a regular cadence of meaningful moves consistent with the leadership brand. We believe these moves will ultimately improve consumer perceptions of our brand.
In September, we announced our plans in the U.S. to transition to cage-free eggs over the next 10 years. More recently, we collaborated with a number of global brand leaders to raise awareness for the plight of refugees and the need to support the United Nation's World Food Programme. And earlier this week, we announced our participation in the White House Climate Pledge.
Turning around our business requires a relentless focus on what consumers wants and expect from McDonald's. Our responsibility is to give them reasons to feel good about visiting time and again. Our opportunity is to differentiate McDonald's while delivering what consumers want today, while laying the foundation for what that expect tomorrow, and our commitment is to deliver on both.
I'm pleased with the progress we've made and remain confident in the ability of our talented system of franchisees, employees and suppliers to revitalize our connection with customers as we execute our turnaround plan into 2016.
Thank you. And I'll now hand it over to Kevin."

Today's earnings release marks our first quarterly reporting under the new segment structure. So I want to spend a few minutes outlining the new segments as a lead-in to my discussion of the factors that impacted the company's third quarter performance. 
Effective July 1, we completed an important first step in the company's global turnaround plan, the reorganization of our business from a geographically focused structure to segments that combined markets with similar characteristics and opportunities for growth. Our reporting segments now include the U.S., our largest individual market, accounting for over 40% of consolidated operating income; the International Lead segment, which includes our established markets of Australia, Canada, France, Germany and the U.K. that collectively account for about 40% of the company's operating income; the high-growth segment, which includes markets with relatively higher restaurant expansion and franchising potential, including China, Italy, Poland, Russia, South Korea, Spain, Switzerland and the Netherlands. Together, these markets account for about 10% of the company's operating income; and the foundational and corporate segment that encompasses the remaining markets, each of which has the potential to operate under a largely franchised model. These markets are combined with corporate activities for reporting purposes. 
From a business operation standpoint, this new structure brings similar markets together to leverage their collective insights and expertise to deliver a better overall experience for our customers. From a reporting standpoint, the new structure provides greater visibility into the key markets driving the vast majority of the company's underlying financial performance. 
So let's take a look at the major drivers of our third quarter results. Earnings per share for the quarter increased $0.31 to $1.40. In constant currencies, third quarter earnings per share increased $0.48. These results benefited from the comparison against prior year results, which included an increase in our tax reserves and the China supplier issue. These items negatively impacted third quarter 2014 earnings per share by $0.41. Excluding the impact of the unusual prior-year items, third quarter earnings per share would have increased $0.07 or 5% in constant currency.
Looking beyond the unusual prior-year items, third quarter global comparable sales were up 4%, reflecting positive comparable sales across all segments and positive guest counts in all segments except the U.S. The International Lead Market segment was the largest contributor to the company's third quarter comparable sales performance, posting an increase of 4.6%, led by strong comparable sales and guest counts in Australia, the U.K. and Canada.
Germany's results were uneven, but encouraging, as the market posted positive comparable sales for the second consecutive quarter. And in France, comparable sales were marginally negative as the market's macroeconomic environment and informal eating out industry remain challenged. The high growth markets generated strong comparable sales of 8.9% for the quarter, reflecting sales recovery in both China and Russia. For perspective, China's comparable sales were up 26.8% for the quarter.
The U.S. reported a comparable sales increase from 0.9% for the quarter, supported by the introduction of the new buttermilk crispy chicken sandwich and a return to the classic recipe for our Egg McMuffin. Comparable sales performance improved for the latter part of the quarter.
With more than 80% of our global restaurants franchised, the largest driver of operating income continues to be our franchise margins, which totaled $1.9 billion, a 7% increase in constant currencies for the quarter. The franchise margin percent increased 20 basis points to 82.2%, driven by the positive comparable sales generated by the international segments. Global company operated margin dollars increased 9% in constant currencies to $675 million for the quarter, while the company operated margin percent increased 10 basis points to 15.8%.
China sales recovery accounted for the majority of the margin improvement for the quarter, partly offset by ongoing labor costs in the U.S. The incremental labor cost in the U.S. related primarily to our decision to invest in our people by raising wages and providing paid time off for employees at our company operated restaurants, as well as providing educational assistance to all eligible U.S. restaurant employees effective July 1. These costs, along with wage increases mandated by several states during the first half of the year, impacted third quarter U.S. margins by about 400 basis points. For the quarter, U.S. commodity costs rose about 1%, primarily due to higher beef prices. 
Our U.S. third quarter pricing year-over-year was up about 2%, which remains below food-away-from-home inflation of around 3%. The current projected increase in food-away-from-home inflation for the full year remained at 2% to 3%.
Commodity costs for the International Lead Market segment were up about 0.5% in the quarter. While price increases vary by market, year-over-year increases for these markets averaged 1% to 2%. 
Moving down the P&L. G&A for the third quarter ended at $584 million, up 9% in constant currencies due entirely to higher incentive-based compensation accruals versus the prior year. Despite this unfavorable quarterly comparison, we are making progress against our previously announced savings target.
Looking beyond the third quarter, currency translation is expected to be a headwind for the final quarter of 2015 as the U.S. dollar remained strong against nearly all of the world's other major currencies. Based on current exchange rates, we expect currency translation to negatively impact fourth quarter earnings per share by $0.08 to $0.10.
As usual, take this as directional guidance only because rates will change as we move throughout the quarter.
Before I conclude my remarks, I want to make a comment about our financial outlook for the full year 2015. As you know, each quarter, we typically provide details around our expectations for several key components influencing our financial result in an outlook section. In light of our upcoming November investor meeting, we did not provide an update on our financial outlook in either today's prepared remarks or as part of today's 8-K filing. An update on these components will be provided in conjunction with our investor meeting in a few weeks.
In closing, the transition in both our operating and reporting structure represents a new era for McDonald's, as we move toward becoming a more focused and efficient organization. While we are less than 6 months into executing our turnaround plan, our third quarter results demonstrate early signs of progress with both our top and bottom line results.
We are encouraged by this progress, but recognize that there is much more work to be done. As we begin the fourth quarter, we're energized by the challenges in front of us. Thanks. 
And now I'll turn it over to Chris to begin our Q&A."

So we launched officially nationwide on October 6, and I would say the enthusiasm levels from customers and from our teams in the restaurants are high. It's been a successful rollout. The owner/operators have really embraced this. I mean, to go from a test market in May to a nationwide rollout by October is a significant validation of the alignment of the operators behind this. When they approved it, they approved it with a 98% plus approval rating around the country. So there's a lot of unity and alignment behind it.  And from an operational perspective, having spent a fair bit of time in the markets for the last 2 or 3 weeks, the operators have been really again infused at the fact that this has created -- it's been a lot smoother from operational perspective than perhaps people had feared. 
The reality is the ingredients, the equipment, the training, the procedures is already very, very well established in the restaurants. And by launching all-day breakfast, whilst at the same time, removing some of the more complex lower sales items at the same time, we have a net simplification in the restaurants, and we have a -- we're driving foot fall. So it's early days to give too much read on sales, but we're certainly encouraged. And more importantly, the owner/operators are very encouraged about how we kicked off."

And at that time, we indicated that we expected the impact of this, as well as other state-mandated increases, to be about 200 basis points on our margins for the full year this year. Since obviously, the large majority of that impact happens in the second half of the year, that implies that the impact on the second half would be substantially more than 200 basis points. So the impact's relatively in line with our expectations. The payback from the investment will take a little time in terms of lowering turnover, having stronger employees deliver a better customer experience, ultimately, driving top line sales. Moving forward, it'll obviously continue to impact margin comparisons for the next 3 quarters until we lap the July 1. But as you know, margins are also significantly impacted by our top line. So if we're able to generate higher comps, that would certainly mitigate some of that impact."

So from the value program across the summer, I think on the call last quarter, acknowledged that it got after a little bit of a bumpy start, as we launched it. It was in a way bumping into some of the local value initiatives that each of the regions were driving, which made we -- and then we reset, and the performance of the $2.50 double cheese and small fry improved across the summer as the focus got clearer and our execution in the restaurant got sharper. So it filled a gap for us. We do have a desire, along with our Owner/Operators of a more sustained value platform, which we'll be looking to introduce through 2016. But it certainly played a meaningful role across the summer at helping to drive the foot fall. 
In terms of the operational -- or in terms of simplification, I just -- again, simplification in the way we're looking at this and the way the team in the U.S. is looking at it, is menu is part of it, but there's a lot more we can do to help simplify the restaurants on a day-to-day basis, both from a customer perspective, but also from our managers and our crew. So there's operational simplification, there's training simplification. These things we do with merchandising to make it easier for customers to navigate the restaurant and also with packaging as well. So the teams -- there are sub-teams that are addressing each of these areas of opportunity. So yes, menu is one piece, but the whole operational complexity, the training and merchandising and packaging is another. And it's the sum of those parts is what managers are beginning to recognize that we are working hard to make their life a little easier so they can just focus on what they'd love to and just running the restaurants, serving customers."

Through the quarter, it's probably fair to say we ended the quarter just a little stronger than we started. But I wouldn't read too much into that.

One was around trading hard and particularly trading hard on value, and the second one is restoring brand trust. And actually, in that market now, our trust metrics are higher than they were prior to the supplier incidents a year ago. So I think that kind of validates the focus they put on there. As we look forward, there are probably 4 elements that the team are working on across the next couple of quarters, continuing on brand trust, consistent everyday value at the entry and mid-tier levels. They've got a big and exciting play around convenience, and particularly around digital activation and delivery. So those are 2 drivers that aren't unique to China, but are very material to the consumer in China, digital activation, working with some of main tech partners in China. We got some great relationships there and a very strong delivery business. And the fourth one is just around consumer excitement, just having fun with products and the experience in the restaurants.

Related to margins in that group, a couple of things: one, certainly, China's margins recovered this quarter versus last year as a result of their sales recovery. Russia had currency pressure. We import a chunk of our food and paper in Russia, both in terms of dollar and euro. And so there's still pressure on Russia's margins because of those imported food and paper costs. So that's still putting pressure on the margins within the high-growth segment. 
Related to franchising. I think we've said in most of our franchising opportunity, certainly, is probably within Asia. So China, certainly, would be a part of that. We'll update a little bit more of our detailed franchising plans as we get to the investor meeting in November. But I think it's safe to say that that high-growth segment would certainly have franchising activity going forward."

But you can go into a restaurant mid-afternoon and see a more mature group of people sitting there who can now enjoy the product and have their Egg McMuffin mid-afternoon and aren't having to sort of watch -- clock watch and try to make that 10:30 a.m. deadline. So it just makes life  easier for customers. They don't have to look at the watch and manage too hard their time. So broad appeal, a strong start from an operational perspective, from an execution perspective. And I think the team has done a great job from the marketing launch and just having some fun with it.

If you remember from the past, the U.S. undertook a fairly significant structural change itself. Now about a year ago, where we eliminated a layer, liberated a little more entrepreneurial spirit into the regions. That takes time to settle down. You can't just hit your stride straightaway. So I think as the regions and the teams in the regions begin to find their feet, as it were, that helps. I don't want to underestimate just the investments we're making in food quality, the investments that consumers care about, such as the announcement to go to free range eggs, for example, such as the quality cues that you deliver with the buttermilk chicken. I mean, that is getting strong. But underpinning it, and I'll never ever move away from this, any market that's successful around the world is because they're focusing on the day-to-day operation and just delivering at that moment of truth for the customer. That is what McDonald's is all about. What we're seeing with speed of service? Well, actually, we're seeing greater improvement in the accuracy. So accuracy is probably the strongest metric improvement we're getting, which on the basis that around 70% of the business goes through the drive-thru, clearly accuracy is particularly important. But we begin to see a few seconds being shaved off average service time as we've simplified the menu and sharpening up the operations.

So along with that, some costs that historically were managed at a segment level now are being managed, or will be managed, at a central corporate level. So some of the costs that were reflected last year in the segments are now in corporate. It's about $30 million of those in total of those costs. That doesn't impact consolidated or total G&A. That's more of just a reallocation. At the same time, we obviously talked about saving real consolidated G&A.

And then, when we do talk about doing something like an all-day breakfast, people were scratching their head and say, ""Well hold on a minute you talk simplification, but now you're adding."" So, when I talk about net, I'm saying we've got to take more complexity out to drive decision-making than we ever put in. So that's where my kind of my language of net simplification works. So if we're not adding any new SKUs into the restaurant for breakfast because all the ingredients are already there. They're in the chillers, they're in the freezers, the equipment is already in place. So yes, there is the operational shift running. There's an operational complexity, but not an ingredient complexity. In the meantime, around the country, we've -- the U.S. team has been very rigorous in their analytics on this in helping provide each and every co-op with a tool that helps them assess operational complexity versus contribution to product mix and margin. And then as a final screen which is around kind of the brand value. So that helps have actual detailed insight and rigor around supporting the cost taking items off. So on average, right, I think you knew at the start of the year, we've removed around 7 items from the menu. There's probably at least another 7, if not more, on average across the co-ops around the country now. And I know they're continuing on this part and as we offer more abilities to customize and personalize food going forward, that may give us another opportunity to actually take further items off. So I hope that makes sense. The trouble with saying simplification is that means whenever you do add anything to the restaurant people turn around and say, ""Hold on a minute that's going to make it more complex."" We're not going to be static. We are going to be energetic. We will innovate. We will have new products. It's fun and that's what customers want. We've got to make sure that we take more than that out of the restaurant complexity. So I hope that makes a little more sense."

And the training that was rolled out across the U.S., which was actually was an operator-led initiative initially, was around something ask-ask-tell. It was a way that we reconfigured our own internal procedures of how we take the orders, confirm the orders and then present the orders. And that has had a positive and noticeable benefit in our accuracy. As we go forward, the more of that heavy lifting that we can get technology to do then the greater our accuracy will become. So whether it's ordering through apps, whether it's ordering through self-order kiosks that we see elsewhere around the world, technology could certainly help us with putting the customer in charge of the ordering process and allowing technology to do the heavy lifting and then we can just prepare the food and serve it in a friendly way. So 2-pronged. We'll never get away from day-to-day training. But secondly, we are working hard on the technology to help support this."

The other question was just on, the mention you had of commodity costs. So it sounds like beef isn't that onerous anymore and I think you said the overall basket was only up 1% this past quarter. I'm just wondering what your thoughts are as we look ahead and whether that could actually -- whether you think qualitatively that would impact McDonald's or maybe the industry as you think about promotions and discounting and your new value platform potentially?"

So we are confident in the -- kind of the curve we expect to see of the contribution from all-day breakfast. We're encouraged that there's 30 days. We're sitting here today, 15 or 16 days in. And I can tell you that the unity of the system around this and the response from customers, which is the most important piece, is very positive. We will be able share a bit more in November, obviously. Totally understand the interest in it, but it's just too early. It just wouldn't be fair to give a read on it right now."

In closing, I want to reemphasize our commitment across the entire system to consistently running great restaurants to give our customers even more reasons to dine at McDonald's. We are focusing on executing fewer, bigger initiatives that will ultimately deliver a better experience for our guests around the areas that matter most to them; great-tasting food, fast friendly service, contemporary restaurant experience, all at the value of McDonald's. The progress we've made in a short amount of time gives me confidence that we are making the right moves to turn around our business and reposition McDonald's as a modern progressive burger company.
