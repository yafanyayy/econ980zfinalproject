8740684,281934250,754920,"Under Armour, Inc., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 04, 2015",2015-02-04,"Earnings Calls","Under Armour, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Tom, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, we reported outstanding financial results for 2014. It was a record year in almost every aspect of our business, enabling us to continue our 19 consecutive quarters of revenue growth over 20% and 5 consecu",2930,"Thanks, Tom, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, we reported outstanding financial results for 2014. It was a record year in almost every aspect of our business, enabling us to continue our 19 consecutive quarters of revenue growth over 20% and 5 consecutive quarters of 30-plus percent growth. 
Heading into 2015, the confidence we have in our Apparel and Footwear businesses has never been higher. Our execution, never better, and our ambition, never stronger. 
We also announced the formation of the world's largest digital health and fitness community with the acquisition of Endomondo and MyFitnessPal to supplement our existing MapMyFitness and Under Armour record platforms to create Under Armour Connected Fitness. We believe this positions Under Armour to meaningfully benefit in the role of technology and the health and fitness introspect, great new ways of connecting with athletes, building equity for our brand and additional levels of trust with our consumers. 
So first, I want to spend a few moments covering how our performance this past year will inform how we will grow our business in 2015 and beyond. And then, spend some time in the future state of Under Armour and how the acquisitions we announced earlier this afternoon will help ensure two things: That we reached our consumer in the manner they expect now and in the future; and that we continue to grow our business in the manner our shareholders expect as well. 
Crossing the $3 billion revenue mark in 2014 was an important milestone for our brand and we did so with the most balanced growth in our history. 
And while a lot of today's conversation will be about new growth drivers, we had a tremendous year in our core Apparel business, growing total apparel revenues by more than $0.5 billion. 
The growth was across all categories and genders, across our wholesale and direct services, in new categories, and established ones and also across geographies. 
We brought a new dimension to our brand in 2014 and laid the foundation for continued growth in Women's with our I WILL WHAT I WANT campaign. 
We continue to drive innovation in premium pricing throughout our North American Apparel business with large platforms like ColdGear Infrared, Charged Cotton and Storm and in key categories like training, outdoor, golf and Women's studio. 
We are focused on gaining additional floor space in these categories with our key keep wholesale sporting goods partners to improve merchandising and the initiatives like reinvigorating our core performance training apparel with the introduction of Armour, our reengineered base layer featuring enhanced ventilation. 
In addition, we see growth with our partners in the department store channel as we build out businesses in Women's and kids. 
There are multiple parts to our apparel growth story for 2015, but there are consistent with what we've been planning and executing against for the past 21 quarters.  And in each of them, we've driven 20-plus percent growth in our core Apparel business. 
We will continue to build out the large platforms, drive better assortments and strategically broaden our wholesale distribution in the right businesses. 
Accompanying that growth with our wholesale partners and our continued focus on a Direct-to-Consumer business, where we grew 32%, coming in at just under $1 billion for the full year. 
We saw strong growth in our Factory House stores as we increased our assortment of Footwear and benefited from our new Brand House stores in Tysons Corner, in Soho, in New York. 
In Q1, we are opening our largest Brand House yet on Michigan Avenue in Chicago where we will highlight the innovation, localization and specialization of product that we can only do in a 30,000-square-foot Brand House environment, and you also see our Connected Fitness initiative integrated into the store as well. 
We know from our experience the existing Brand House stores, especially in SoHo, that we are better positioned to sell Footwear stores and we'll expand on that as we build out new doors in 2015 and beyond. 
Our Footwear business helped accelerate our overall growth in 2014 with revenues up 44% for the year to $431 million. 
As we've been discussing on these calls, we're most proud of the foundation and the team we are building in our Footwear category as we continue to gain share and drive innovation in large categories like running and basketball. 
We significantly invested in Footwear leadership in 2014 and the strength of the Under Armour brand continues to bring consumers to our Footwear, while our focus on cushioning and fit is helping drive market share gains. 
Well, this past weekend, Tom Brady won his fourth Super Bowl and third MVP award wearing red and white run and gun Under Armour Clete. 
And next week, the biggest star in Under Armour basketball universe and leading vote getter for the NBA All-Star game, Stephen Curry, will be in New York City to debut his first signature shoe, the Curry 1. We'll be telling the basketball world about it when we introduce our Holiday One commercial next week, staring Stephen and a very special surprise guest. 
This will be the largest campaign in our company's history, so big, in fact, that there will be a second part to it with a campaign to support the introduction of the SpeedForm Gemini running shoe. 
With the Curry One retailing at $120 and the SpeedForm Gemini at $130, we are creating a sustainable platform for growth in Footwear by focusing on premium, innovative products for the best athletes in the world and will look back on 2014 as a pivotal year in the development of what may become our biggest engine for growth. 
The last piece of 2014 that I'll discuss also happens to be the part of our business where we saw the greatest increase in growth, International. 
Revenues grew 96% to $260 million in 2014 as we opened new markets around the globe, expanded our wholesale account base and continued to build out our International Brand House space with 68 Brand House stores opened outside the United States and rolling out www.underarmour.com in multiple new markets and languages. 
As we head into another strong year of growth in our global business, we'll continue to invest about local and global assets like our recent signing of Andy Murray, the #4 ranked tennis player in the world and Australian open finalist. 
We will strategically grow with our wholesale partners around the world, continue to build out the International Brand House stores, going from 18 stores at the end of 2013 to 68 stores in 2014 and adding more than 100 doors this year. 
This growing global presence enables us to bring the full Under Armour story to our consumers outside United States and illustrates the true breadth of our product innovations. 
So summing up the year, 2014 was a period of great accomplishment for the Under Armour team and a great example of what's possible when we're successfully anticipating the needs of our consumers. 
Our focus in 2015, as it has been since Under Armour's inception, is on making all athletes better and going well beyond their expectations. 
That philosophy enables us to focus on what is written on the whiteboard in my office above everything else, ""Do not forget to sell shirts and shoes. "" That is job one for our team in 2015 and will always be the foundation on which we grow the Under Armour brand global footprint. 
That being said, I want to share a vision now and provide some color on how the acquisitions we announced earlier today accomplished 2 very important things. First, the immediate scale we gained by adding Endomondo and MyFitnessPal to the MapMyFitness and UA record platform, positioning Under Armour as the world's largest digital health and fitness community; and second, how this investment will enable us to better anticipate our consumers' needs, drive more informed purchase decisions in authentically build brand loyalty by helping our consumers lead a healthy life. 
So first the facts. Early last month, we purchased Endomondo, the Copenhagen-based company that is built on one of the largest global Connected Fitness communities. With approximately 20 million registered users, most of whom believe in Europe, Endomondo provides the perfect strategic complement to the activity and workout tracking we currently have in our existing digital platform of MapMyFitness and UA record. 
And with today's announcement to acquire MyFitnessPal, we have firmly established our Connected Fitness platform as the leading provider of everything and athlete need to live a healthier lifestyle. 
Based in San Francisco, MyFitnessPal is the leading resource for healthy living and nutrition with over 80 million registered users and world class nutritional resources. 
By bringing this established leader into our Connected Fitness platform, we can offer a full suite of information, activity and workout tracking, as well as nutritional expertise to truly make all athletes better. 
So what have we bought and more importantly, why? For starters, with MyFitnessPal and Endomondo added to our existing platform, we now have the world's largest digital health and fitness community with a combined audience among all our platforms of over 120 million unique people. 
For perspective, there are approximately 20 visual communities in the world with more than 100 million members, so the first thing to note is this year's scale that we now bring to bear. 
To give you a sense of that scale, 1 out of every 5 people in the United States has downloaded one of the apps in our platform. 
Collectively, the 3 sites grew 46% last year, adding 40 million members, and we continue to add over 100,000 registered users every day. 
We have great geographic balance with 57% of our 120 million registered users in North America and the balance, outside the United States. 
We also have 72 million women registered on our platform, providing another great opportunity for us to grow our brand presence with both female athletes and athletic females. 
Second, owning the world's largest digital health and fitness platform provides an incredibly unique opportunity for Under Armour to build a different type of relationship with our consumer over the long-term. 
Health and fitness as a part of your life from childhood onward and our goal in aggregating these 3 platforms is to make you better by making your health and fitness really easy to understand. 
The truth is that you know more about how your car is performing than your own body, and we see the potential to inform and inspire our consumer through these assets. And its impact on our ability to sells shirts and shoes is unparalleled in our industry. 
We've built a $3 billion business by making great product and telling great stories, but there's nothing that says we must follow our competitors playbook, especially when the way consumers digest media and make their purchase decision is undergoing such dramatic shifts. 
The net result of this shift is our consumer is demanding more from athletic brand than just making shirts and shoes. We embrace those higher expectations and believe these investments positions us better than anyone in our industry to truly make all athletes better. 
At the end of the day, the map is pretty simple. The more active someone is, the more likely they are to buy athletic Apparel and Footwear. 
And for the month of January, the 4 sites in our Connected Fitness platform: MapMyFitness, Endomondo, MyFitnessPal, and UA Record recorded more than 100 million workouts and added 4.2 million new unique users. 
So how did we come to this decision to invest in these communities and strategically add another tool in how we interact with our consumer. 
This chapter in the Under Armour story started at the NFL Combine in 2011, where we debuted the Armour39, the first performance apparel that incorporated by biometric measurements and was used to track the performance of top NFL prospects. 
We saw the potential in measuring performance and how our consumers can benefit from it. 
At the same time, a lot of different trackers and wearable technology started to hit the market, and we were quick to realize that our core competencies lied in making shirts and shoes and understanding how to best incorporate technology to improve athletes lives. 
We also realized that for Under Armour it wasn't as much about the hardware as there would always be someone else working in a lab or garage, some one who might crack the code on the next great device. And that we could create the most value by working closely with partners understood the power of the Under Armour brand and our knowledge of the athlete. 
At the same time, we started to understand that the true value for an athletic brand was actually in the community. And that crystallized for us when we started the conversion with Robin that led us to acquiring MapMyFitness in December of December 2013. 
As we started working with Robin Steam in Austin Texas, it only reinforce our belief that the value is in the community, especially one where the user is not just looking at their friends pictures but providing you with data that empowers you to come back to them with an informed point of view to help improve their health and fitness. 
We understood that there was tremendous value in becoming that trusted brand to set out to assemble all of the elements that would enable Under Armour to be the one place to access all of that information. 
From a geographic view, Endomondo was the obvious choice to compliment MapMyFitness. Their community of 20 million users, most of whom are based in Europe, provides a great opportunity for us to learn from and expands our ability to interact with the consumer who's still relatively new to us. 
With MyFitnessPal, their expertise in nutritional space positions us to the complete picture of our athletes and rounds out the data for which we will be able to provide the most important than personalized input on our users health and fitness. 
So how will all these come together? All of the 3 existing platforms: MapMyFitness, Endomondo and MyFitnessPal will live as distinct platforms under the Under Armour Connected Fitness banner, but we have a longer term point of view and vision, and it's found in UA Record, the community we launched last month of the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. 
Over time, we believe UA Record will eventually become the daily destination dashboard, aggregating all you want to know about your general fitness, sleep, steps, activity level and yes, nutrition. We know that we're on the verge of remarkable developments and wearable technology, some of which are being worked on across the street in our own innovation lab right now. 
And our recently announced partnership with HTC will enable us to help to develop statement level product that demonstrate capabilities of UA Record. But by focusing on an open platform and being device agnostic, we believe we are the best positioned among all athletic brand to benefit from the evolution of wearables. 
So let me sum up with this events that will do for Under Armour and why we believe it's critical to our ability to self a shirt and shoes going forward. 
Everything about our consumer is rapidly evolving, the way they digest media, what influences their purchase decision, how and where they buy things. We see that everyday in our own business. 
For example, this past December, we did 77% more E-Commerce business on a mobile device than we did in December of just the year prior in 2013. 
Brands that do not evolve -- that do not offer their consumer something more than a product will be hard for us to compete in 2015 and beyond. 
We fully understand the massive shift in how our consumers will intersect with their favorite brands and these acquisitions firmly position us on the leading-edge of that new paradigm. 
With the world's largest digital health and fitness community, we now have a unique opportunity to build equity and consumer loyalty over the long-term. We will be able to provide the most complete measure of a person's health and fitness and become the trusted brand to help drive not only E-Commerce, but also long-term value for our shareholders. 
Are we ready for this next step? Two years ago, I would have had the answer no. But since that time, we have assembled an incredible pool of talent, led by 3 entrepreneurs who literally helped create the entire category of Connected Fitness: Robin Thurston, the Founder of MapMyFitness; Meta, the Founder and CEO of Endomondo; and Mike Lee, the Founder and CEO of MyFitnessPal. 
Prior to the MapMyFitness acquisition, we had 4 engineers working at our digital team. With the 2 acquisitions announced today, that number is now over 300. 
More important in the sheer numbers, we now have 3 of the best minds in the space all adept at navigating in a rapidly shifting market and all with extensive experience understanding the needs of their communities. 
Robin is going to run our overall Connected Fitness business, and reporting to him will be Meta who will drive our International business and initiatives and Mike Lee who will be running our North American business. 
This breadth of experience will enable our core product leadership to focus on the business of selling shirts and shoes as we build out this new growth platform that will position Under Armour at the center of the world's health and fitness activities for years and years to come. 
And with that, I'll hand it over to Brad."
8740684,281934250,754920,"Under Armour, Inc., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 04, 2015",2015-02-04,"Earnings Calls","Under Armour, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Kevin. And now, I'll spend some time discussing our fourth quarter and full year 2014 financial results, followed by updated outlook for 2015. Our net revenues for the fourth quarter of 2014 increased 31% to $895 million. For the full year, net",2009,"Thanks, Kevin. And now, I'll spend some time discussing our fourth quarter and full year 2014 financial results, followed by updated outlook for 2015. 
Our net revenues for the fourth quarter of 2014 increased 31% to $895 million. For the full year, net revenues increased 32% to $3.08 billion, which compared to our most recent full year guidance of $3.03 billion. 
As Kevin outlined, this $3 billion milestone was comprised of strong results across all of our growth drivers with Apparel, up 30%; Direct-to-Consumer, up 32%; Footwear, up 44%; and International, up 96%. 
Focusing on the fourth quarter, we grew Apparel category 30% to $708 million compared to $546 million in the prior year's quarter. 
Similar to the third quarter, our platform innovations of Storm, ColdGear Infrared and Charged Cotton were key volume drivers across the key category well new innovation like this years showcased our ongoing ability to bring device to the consumer. 
Areas of particular strength in Apparel include training, golf, outdoor and studio. 
Fourth quarter Footwear net revenues increased 55% to $86 million from $55 million in the prior year, representing approximately 10% of net revenues for the period. 
We continue to see success in running Footwear across a broader price spectrum, including the $100 SpeedForm Apollo, driving market share gains within our course sporting goods distribution. 
Basketball, also, gain momentum, most notably around the $125 ClutchFit Drive. These categories, along with our ongoing strength in areas such as cleated and slide positioned Under Armour as the #2 overall Footwear brand in some of our top wholesaler accounts in 2014. 
Our Accessories net revenue during the fourth quarter increased 22% to $79 million from $65 million last year. Growth during the quarter was primarily driven by headwear offerings and gloves. 
Our global Direct-to-Consumer net revenues increased 27% to the quarter, representing approximately 38% of net revenues. 
Within North America, our Factory House square footage grew 17% year-over-year. This growth reflects the total of 125 Factory House stores at the end of the year, up 7% from the end of 2013, as well as the upside in 14 existing locations during the year. 
On the full price remain 5 Brand House stores in North America. 
In our E-Commerce channel, where we continue to see a migration of traffic from desktop to mobile devices, we were encouraged by the conversion improvements from our new response of sight launch at the end of September. 
We also followed up our third quarter launches of local E-Commerce sites in the U.K., Germany and France with the fourth quarter view of our site in Singapore, which is our first site in Southeast Asia. 
International net revenues increased 123% to $82 million in the fourth quarter and represented 9% of total net revenues. 
In the EMEA region, we saw continued strength in our 3 key markets in Europe, the U.K., Germany and France and commenced our new distributors agreement covering the Middle East. 
In Asia Pacific, we remain focused on accelerating growth with both wholesale accounts and distributors, including partner store openings throughout Greater China and Southeast Asia. Finally, in Latin America, our business benefited from the early 2014 conversion of our Mexico distributors to an Under Armour subsidiary and our market expansions into Brazil and Chile.  This included our first American brand, which opened in Santiago, Chile during the fourth quarter. 
Moving on to margins. Fourth quarter gross margins contracted 140 basis points to 49.9% compared with 51.3% in the prior year's quarter. Three primary factors contributed to this performance during the quarter: First, as discussed in our prior call, our sales mix adversely impacted gross margins by approximately 90 basis points for the period, primarily reflecting a higher mix of International net revenues, including the introduction of new lower-margin distributors businesses during the fourth quarter. 
Second, the strengthening of U.S. dollar negatively impacted gross margins by approximately 20 basis points for the period. 
And finally, higher freight costs to better meet consumer demand negatively impacted gross margins by approximately 20 basis points in the period. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues leveraged 330 basis points, 33.6% in the fourth quarter of 2014 from 36.9% in the prior period. 
As a reminder, we incurred higher incentive compensation expenses in last year's fourth quarter, which was a primary contributor of leverage in each of our 4 SG&A buckets. 
Additional SG&A details are as follows: First, marketing costs decreased to 8.4% of net revenues for the quarter from 8.9% in the prior year period; second, selling cost decreased to 11% of net revenues for the quarter from 11.6% in the prior year period; third, product innovation and supply chain cost decreased to 8.4% of net revenues in the quarter from 9% in the prior year period; and finally, corporate services decreased to 5.8% of net revenues for the quarter from 7.4% in the prior period, inclusive of closing costs for the MapMyFitness acquisition in the prior year period. 
Operating income for the fourth quarter increased 49% to $146 million compared with $98 million in the prior year period. 
For the full year, operating income increased 34% to $354 million compared to our most recent guidance of $348 million. 
Operating margin expanded 190 basis points during the quarter to 16.3% compared to 14.4% in the prior year period.  For the full year, operating margin expanded 10 basis points to 11.5% compared to 11.4% in 2013. 
Interest and other expense for the fourth quarter increased to $4 million compared with $1 million in the prior year period, primarily reflecting the negative impact of foreign currency, along with increased interest expense from our additional term debt. 
Our fourth quarter tax rate of 38.3% was unfavorable to the 34% rate last year, primarily driven by the timing of the state tax credits received in the fourth quarter of 2013. 
Our full year effective tax rate of 39.2% was higher than the 37.8% rates in 2013, primarily due to increased International investments and the lacking of the state tax credit. 
Our fourth quarter net income increased 37% to $88 million compared to $64 million in the prior year period. 
Diluted earnings per share increased 35% to $0.40 compared to $0.30 in the prior year period. Full year diluted earnings per share increased to 27% to $0.95 compared to $0.75 in 2013. 
On the balance sheet, total cash and cash equivalents at year-end increased 71% to $593 million compared with $347 million at December 31, 2013.  Total debt increased to $284 million from $153 million at December 31, 2013. 
Both our cash and debt my positions reflecting an additional $100 million term loan drawn during the fourth quarter used primarily for the closing on the $85 million Endomondo acquisition in early January. 
Inventory at year-end increased 14% to $537 million compared to $469 million at December 31, 2013. 
Looking at our cash flows, our investment and capital expenditures was approximately $59 million for the fourth quarter and approximately $145 million for 2014. 
Now moving on to 2015. We have 3 factors driving our updated outlook. First, the impact of the new Connected Fitness businesses we are acquiring; second, the negative impact of the strengthening dollar on our International results; and third, the continued strength of our existing business. 
Starting with revenues. We are maintaining our prior guidance of approximately 22% net revenue growth. It should be noted this is off of a higher number compared to 3 months ago as we exceeded our most recent 2014 target by nearly $55 million. 
This growth rate takes into account the strengthening of the U.S. dollar over the past 90 days, which has negatively impacted our 2015 net revenues forecast by approximately 1 percentage point from our prior guidance. 
However, revenues from the Connected Fitness acquisitions are expected to largely offset this currency impact. As stated in our previous guidance, we expect solid growth in all of our growth drivers led by continued outperformance in our Footwear and International businesses. We expect the year-over-year growth rates across each of the quarters in 2015 to be relatively consistent, except for the fourth quarter, where we will be lacking strong International growth, including new market entries. 
Now moving on to operating income. We are now planning 2015 operating income in the range of $397 million to $407 million, representing growth of 12% to 15%. This change from our prior guidance of operating income growth of 22% is largely due to the impact of our 2 Connected Fitness acquisitions. We estimate that 90 basis points of operating margin dilution from these acquisitions mostly within SG&A offset with a slight gross margin benefit. 
There are 3 components of this: first, one time deal closing cost recorded in the first quarter are expected to impact a full year by approximately 20 basis points; second, operating losses from the operations of the 2 businesses we are acquiring are expected to impact the full year by approximately 40 basis points; and third, the intangible assets generated from the acquisitions will result in noncash amortization charges, which are expected to impact the full year by approximately 30 basis points. 
The recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar also had a negative impact in our 2015 operating income guidance. Specifically in our gross margin line as we purchase the majority of our inventory for International business in U.S. dollars. This has created an incremental 50 basis point impact in operating margin just from the time of our prior guidance. 
We anticipate to offset this currency impact through targeted improvements in gross margin and SG&A. 
Our current guidance assumes no further significant strengthening of the U.S. dollar compared to current exchange rates. 
From a gross margin standpoint, we believe we can still generate a modest improvement from last year's 49% level despite foreign currency headwinds given ongoing supply chain opportunities as the year progresses. 
Relative to timing, we expect this improvement could be generally consistent throughout the year. On SG&A, we expect expense to deleverage, mainly deliver but a Connected Fitness acquisition. The rate of SG&A expense deleverage is expected to gradually ease throughout the year from approximately 200 basis points deleveraged during the first quarter. 
Factors weighing on expenses during the first quarter include higher year-over-year marketing expenses to support our first Brand Holiday of 2015, as well as the one time deal closing cost for the Connected Fitness acquisition. 
Below the operating line, we expect higher year-over-year interest expense for the funding of our Connected Fitness acquisition. We anticipate funding this acquisitions through cash on hand and expanded term loan and revolving credit facility. 
The full year effective tax rate is now expected to be slightly higher than our 2014 effective rate of 39.2%. The impact of a strong dollar on our International result is negatively impacting our 2015 effective tax rate in excess of 100 basis points.  Our 2015 fully diluted share count is expected to be approximately $220 million. 
Finally, as we indicated with our preliminary 2015 guidance in October, we expect elevated capital expenditures during the year. Part of this accelerations includes combined investments of approximately $90 million for our new domestic distribution center and the expansion of our corporate headquarters in Baltimore. 
We also expect elevated capital expenditures tied to our global retail expansion. In total, we are currently planning 2015 capital expenditures in the range of $280 million to $290 million. 
In conclusion, 2015 has developed into an important investment year for our company as we trade the world's largest digital health and fitness community. We believe these investments will enhance and support our growth drivers and drive long-term value for our shareholders. 
Even after factoring in the dilutive impact on 2015, we believe that our forward 3-year operating income CAGR through 2017 will be in line with the 22% growth rate level that we provided in our prior 2015 guidance. We will provide specific long-term guidance at our Investor Day targeted for September 16 of this year.

But I think what you've seen and now, we're in our 10th-year making shoes, our 8 years selling shoes that we've actually gotten pretty good at it, and we can drive premium pricing. Something we've been familiar to us in apparel for a very long time. So I think that we're thoughtful and there's a lot of factors that play with oil and a few other things that are working our way through the system. But we're not seeing number one great squeeze on the manufacturing prices that we're not enjoying and advantages just yet we are feeling some of these currency so I think everybody's trying to figure out, which way is up with that. At the end of today, I'm not sure it's going to be any global our International market that will be dictating what price for Under Armour is, it could be relationship we have with consumer. And I think that will continue to drive, an echo that in everything we do from our branding or marketing and frankly, highlighted today with the 2 acquisition that we announced about a deeper and better understanding of that consumer."

And the pricing side, with the strengthening U.S. dollar, we'll look at the ability to increase prices potentially on the International businesses but obviously, that's probably more of a 2016 conversation at this point. The teams are working through the impact of a strengthening dollar and how they will have on pricing on the International front. On the costing side, kind of the same time frame for the most part is we're about a year ahead of the selling season in locking in fabric pricing. So the locking in of our Spring Summer '15 product and obviously, our Fall/Winter '15 product, too, really occurred 1 year to 8 months ago to some degree when the oil prices were still elevated. So with oil prices coming down, that is one of the input cost obviously that impact our cost. We're locking in spring-summer '16 favorable fabric pricing today and we'll be locking in fall-winter '16 over some of the course of the next 6 months. I think we have a better opportunity in 2016, both from a pricing perspective to the consumer and also the costing perspective from the vendor."

But let me just start first of all, why we thought that could do this. The basic reason is because frankly, our business and our brand have never been stronger. 19 consecutive quarters, 20-plus percent top line growth, including the last, 5 of which we delivered over 30%. The year that we have in 2014, we saw strength across the business from, again, a core Apparel business that grew by $0.5 billion, our Footwear businesses that grew 44% our International business, grew 96%, just to name a few of them. And frankly, at the end of the day, as we said, and you've heard me say, in my whiteboard, there's been a lot of slogans, things that say over promise and deliver, and dictate the Temple and work with the purpose. And the one note that's written in red very simply says, ""Don't forget to sell shirts and shoes. "" The reason that we did what we did today was because we believe ultimately this will help us sell more shirts and shoes and reach more athletes to make them better. So what we really did. This exercise began for us a little more than a year ago in December 13 when we announced acquisition of MapMyFitness, and we paid $150 million for them. It really helped us establish a beachhead in digital and I think as I said in I think in my script you heard me talk about how we didn't really have a presence. I mean, combined between our internal Connected Fitness team and our E-Commerce team, we have less than 50 people in that group. And today, we have roughly 400 people in the group, we'll add another 100 this year. So the world of digital and again, some of the anecdotes that leads to that thinking when you heard me give the stat about 77% more people going to mobile, we also had another stat for you, we had 11% of our orders on Cyber Monday this year. Last year, we saw come across mobile devices. And then just 1 year in 2014, the same day, apples-to-apples, that number grown to 27% of people that placed orders at UA.com or on our mobile devices. So we recognize that having relations there is incredibly important. With this acquisition though, the one thing that we learned is about having additional functionality is we knew what we had dealing with Robin and the team over the last 12, 13 months. We also realized what he didn't have. If our ultimate goal was to build a complete picture of the athlete, there were two things that we're missing. #1, we have an incredibly North American outlook, and so global scale was something that we were looking for. And secondly, something that we thought would be much easier for us to buy than to try to to build was the idea of nutritional expertise. In announcing the purchase of these, 2 of the world's leading platforms, Endomondo in  Copenhagen and MyFitnessPal in San Francisco. I mean, in one sell swoop, we created the world's largest connected health and fitness community with 120 million unique members and the largest by a factor of 2 and arguably, 3. So there is no real person in the second place that we basically aggregate this community all at once. And Just as importantly, it's growing at over 100,000 people a day. And just a little fact. In January, it's obvious a big my particular per people as they start thinking about health and wellness in measuring themselves. We average 136,000 people joining and registering every single day, totaling 4.2 million people in the 31 days of January. And just as impressively, if you heard me mention, over 100 million workouts were logged, 100 million workouts. And so when you talk about the one thing that we emphatically know is that the more someone exercises, the more that they workout, it's less logical that the more Apparel and Footwear they're going to ultimately by. The mission that we have is let's make athletes better. And with that information, people choose to share with our Connected Fitness platforms, we think it creates piece of the puzzle, that going to allow us to have a total complete picture of the athlete. How much they're exercising, how much they're sleeping, how much activity they have, what they're putting in their body, what their nutrition habits are. So with all of that, it basically comes down to why we did it and really what it means for Under Armour. The thing that as I saw it -- look, this was not an easy decision and as we talked about this, we debated this heavily internally, have lots of conversations and at the end of today, we kept coming back with the same thing is that this will help drive our core business. This will help with our 5 core growth drivers. And frankly, the idea of standing here and looking and saying, things should we do it are not, to me, it's the incredibly obvious. It reminded me of when I made that first stretchy T-shirt and looking around saying, ""Has anybody ever done anything like this and why is everyone is still wearing a short-sleeved cotton tee in the summer and a long sleeve cotton tee in the winter? "" And I look and say, no one has aggregated and put all these pieces together and we don't see anything coming. So the ability we have was incredibly new. But while I saw this really white space with what we're doing making T-shirts, the opportunity that we have here is a bit different just because there's so much energy and excitement around wearables and biometric measurement. But the surprise that I have is that frankly no one is leading or adjusting what we are today, the power of a truly connected fitness community. There's this massive shift that's happening on where the consumers are interacting with their favorite brands as the world goes digital, and we don't see anyone appropriately addressing the needs of consumers. So now, when you look and just think about what's happening and frankly, for myself coming back to CES, in 2009, there are roughly 1 billion ""connected things "" in the planet. An estimate, depending on who you listen to, by 2020, that number will be somewhere between 25 billion to 50 billion. So who does the best job up synthesizing that data and making it easier for the consumer to understand are the ones that will when. Activity, sleep, exercise, nutrition and that's the place where we think that we can win particularly with our UA Record dashboard. And again, the vision there is to become the daily dashboard that people check. The same way you check your bank balance, the same way you check the weather, is to the same way that you get an update on the most important asset in your life, your own personal health. So finally, this convergence that we see happening, the digitization of as we look and talk to the people and see that they've forgotten about no one is looking and wondering what's happening in the newspaper, you have one device that a 20-year-old cannot live with today like it is not a magazine and print, it is without question, it is a handheld device. And what we see is what the acceleration of wearables and what's happening there that we feel like we are positioned squarely in the center of what is supposed to happen. Community and platform is a right play and because of the acquisitions that began in December 13, we're sitting in the middle of it. This aggregation provides us with the opportunity to build a long and sustainable relation with our consumers and ultimately, we think we're going to sell a lot more shirts and shoes. I was waiting for that question, Omar, so thank you."

So I think it's a massive opportunity for us and frankly, it's one of those solid businesses that we don't get a lot of credit for, but that we are one of the pure play leaders in the space. Walking to any Cabella's pro shop and the Under Armour presence is overwhelming. And first of all, as I dive into the question on Outdoor, I think just given a nod to the brand it's been established with elasticity that we demonstrate with the same company that can come out with probably most talked about commercial in 2014, featuring Misty Copeland and Gisele in our Women's business for the I WILL WHAT I WANT campaign, Frankly, the same company that has a relationship with Willy from Duck Dynasty. And when you walk in, you see what we have in the Outdoor and the fishing and the mountain business. There is a need for a brand like Under Armour. And I think we're continuing to innovate. We're fresh off the the outdoor retailer show out in Salt Lake and amongst other things, we won best product, most innovative product for a new shoes that we have coming out called the Fat Tire shoe. It's a partnership that we did with Michelin, and it puts us against clearly with a shoe that's fashioned if you see that big oversized bags that ride on snow or can ride on sand. And I think it's another approach that we are taken from a very consumer-centric approach that demonstrates we know what we're doing. From an ability to win there, you're going to start seeing outerwear, which we've been making frankly for the last 7 and 8 years. And among that time we've coursed all the relationship with relationship, understanding them, but we've also built a better relationship with the factories, building better products, taking and incorporating the ethos, the essence that is Under Armour, that makes us special on the athletic playing field, makes us just as special on the ski mountain, just as special in the woods and just as special on saltwater fishing boat. So I think what you're seeing from us is that what gives us the greatest elasticity is the ability to apply the principles that make something so incredibly Under Armour and apply it to a market that makes sense. We have an authentic team here. We have it in the grassroots side, we have it on the product side especially, we have it on the marketing side. And I think that we see a great opportunity with a business now that's clearly well over $300 million for us that surprises people when they hear that number and frankly, growing North of our internal or external growth rate as a company too. So we see great upside there and frankly, with think we can be a player in the Outdoor space for a long time to come and we think that we've got a good relationship now, it just keeps on getting better and better."

If you kind of walk from our 2014, 32% top line growth to our 22% guidance for '15, I think the first place you have to look is our international  business, which grew 96% in 2014 and that really included a lot of new launches into new markets like",391,"Sure. If you kind of walk from our 2014, 32% top line growth to our 22% guidance for '15, I think the first place you have to look is our international  business, which grew 96% in 2014 and that really included a lot of new launches into new markets like Brazil, Chile, Southeast Asia and the Middle East. Most of those launches happening more from the middle to the back half of the year. So although we still anticipate very, very strong growth in International businesses, we will be comping those market entries year-over-year. In addition, on the International side, the foreign currency, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar I mentioned in my prepared remarks 1% decline in revenue just from the last 90 days activity in foreign currency for the full year, it's a 2 percentage points growth with the strengthening dollar full year-over-year for us. So if you take both of those factors the International business comping those market launches and the impact of strengthening dollar, you're probably at more than half of the walk down from 32% to 22%. On the North America side, obviously, we have this planned deceleration of our Factory House growth, we've been planning for over the course of the last few years, we talked about adding a less new doors and focus more on square footage growth. Although we are focusing on square footage growth, that square footage growth year-over-year as you saw in Q4 also a decline in '14 from '13, it will be declining throughout 2015 compared to 2014 also. That's another fact it's really kind of driving us down. And on the wholesale side, I've always been pretty clear, and I'm going to take a look at the information I have today when we give our guidance and forecast going forward. And obviously, we have our Q4 results in, but the data point that I don't have today for the back of '15 is all of our bookings orders on the wholesale side, specifically, again, in our largest business, which is North America wholesale. Don't have those bookings in for a good part of the back of of the year, especially the fourth quarter. So obviously taking a cautious approach to our forecast from that aspect based on the fact that we don't have that data in place right now."

A lot was in that relative to mix and the expectation of mix, but that obviously is an important part of our story from an innovation perspective and obviously, as we innovate, those are mostly coming in at premium price points when we innovate so we'll definitely have a positive impact on our ASPs when we get back and they will continue to the year continue to innovate. But obviously, our price point increase over the course of the last few seasons has been kind of in the low to mid-single digit range so our story is growth is unit growth, it's less about ASP growth.

We're up 123% in the quarter, 96% for the full year, and it's the first year that we saw Europe surpass $100 million and really hats off too our team, in particularly, Matt who is there before, who we pulled out of our Canadian business and send over that to really get the shift, which is a place that we took a lot of hits in Europe for a long time before we figured out how to make things happen. And we've really took one of our own who built an amazing $100-plus million business in Canada and asked to do the same thing in Europe. And then hand the range the last 8 months or so to an industry professional, a guy named Chris has been -- we've got t e leadership established and in place. But yes, there's a lot of things that are in play there because a person foremost is leadership, but I really liked assets that we've been signing and think of the global perspective that we've taken. Things like Tottenham and being in the EPO has been really important for us, continue to double down with athletes and with assets on the outside, being relevant to that consumer. But like anything, Europe does not happen overnight, it takes a little bit longer. So as we sit here in our, I guess, our ninth year doing business over there, it's been a long run. What we're saying though is a partnerships that we have on the wholesale side. A lot of really good things that have been going on. Some of the milestones, again, we said surpass $100 million, it's actually North of $130 million in Europe in '14. And the plans that we have are breakeven for the first time in Europe. We took some -- Europe was difficult for a very long time. So going from not having that negative is actually -- to being a breakeven and actually looking at line of sight to make money is incredibly powerful for us. The aided and unaided brand awareness that we have basically tripled year-over-year in key markets like the U.K. and Germany. The launch of our E-Commerce site for the first time in U.K. made a big deal. Same thing in Germany, same thing in France, and then we expect to add The Netherlands to the EU in 2015. And our market focus provide a visibility, the opportunity to drive deep account connections. We've been in some of the right places. We still have opportunity to become a wholesale standpoint. It's a difficult also environment to say the least in Europe, but we see ourselves, really, driving and moving and frankly, the partnership that we felt from people is that we're now getting recognized Under Armour is an incredibly key brand to have in your store, and you cannot live without and frankly, what we recognized that we can live without them either, which is a very healthy relationship and one that we probably share in the wholesale environment here in the United States. So we're looking to some of those new partnerships that we have. But that global story doesn't stop at that e borders of Europe either. The good news is that what Charlie and the team in the International group have done are really driving Under Armour towards that vision of something we expect in order to find ourselves with a global brand that definition means that more than half of our revenues must come from outside of our home country. So we got a shot, we love the execution that our teams has taken in making that happen, and we've got Andy Murray now. Finalist for the Australian open, so it's a good scout on our team."

But with Brazil right now, we've got over 100 brand and spaces that we opened in 2014. We have more than 250 space in 2015. Obviously, the energy and excitement with the Olympics coming there. Next year is going to be a big deal. Mexico continues to move for us. We got a new master franchise agreement that's going to magnify our distribution approach that we have there, big assets like Toluca and Cruz Azul and the Mexican football league there. And then in Chile, where we announced probably felt like a bit premature, but Coca-Cola, which is one of the top football clubs in Chile, we opened our first Brand House in the fourth quarter and it's doing incredibly bigger than we thought we would do. China is when we've talked about growth opening 100 stores, the majority of those stores will actually come out of China and finding and many of them partner run, but it's not like it makes a difference as we expand from just 2 cities to more than 10 cities across China. We want to get into the roots of the country, and we want to make sure that they understand our authenticity and our commitment to China. But again, China from where it was when we launched in 2008, 2009, China, again, is going to be another International breakeven story for us.

The new Southeast Asia distribution agreement that we came through as well, we have this terrific partner based out of Singapore that have been really incredible, markets that you didn't think of and one of the imagery we show we talk about global growth is when we opened roughly 2,000 square foot store, 200 square meters store in downtown Manila in the Philippines, and there's 700-plus people waiting in line to get into it. So we're seeing that there is a pull and there's an absolute demand for our brand. And throughout Asia, our partners in Japan continue to move and grow. Currencies been a struggle with them, but on an apples-to-apples basis, their business is incredibly healthy and growing in a real rate. And the last thing I'd like to say just about I think International growth and expansion and tying it back to the announcements that we made today. With frankly 52 million people outside of North America that now have Under Armour's Connected Fitness, one of our Connected Fitness platforms on their mobile, their digital device, it's the opportunity for us to have a different type of introduction with this consumer, it's a different type of handshake that we're going to introduce the Under Armour brand to them. And we think we can do it incredibly digital way, but we think is going to give us the opportunity to tell an incredibly complete story of who we are and just as importantly, where this brand is headed. So a lot of energy and excitement around what's happening with Under Armour on a global basis to the point where people here are not knocking on my door and saying, can I go move to Australia, can I move to China, can I move to these other markets. So I think it's a lot of energy excitement I think that vision depending on global brand is something we expect to bring to life."

I think part of it was looking up some opportunities that really driven by the impact of the strengthening dollar to some degree. So a lot of our initiatives are focused on things in the supply chain. So the fact that the dollar strengthened pretty significantly here in the last 60 days, really, I think gives us some opportunities potentially within the supply chain to take advantage of some of that, especially towards the back half of this year. Obviously, the front half of this year is locked in. So I part of that hard-earned initiative there is to look at ways to get some money out of the supply chain because of the strengthening dollar. Obviously, you kind of have some offset in SG&A with the strengthening dollar to an International business from across perspective too, it just kind of come naturally. And there's just thing that self as we did the acquisitions, there are some things that made sense to scale back a little bit because we felt investment and the acquisitions was a complementary thing to be doing some of the things that we're planning on doing initially any way so some synergies there to some degree. So although it seems like a big items that offset most of them are pretty natural because of the strengthening dollar. Some synergies and the acquisitions that we're doing compared to some other investments we were going to make and some things naturally just SG&A make sense for us to kind of go after again just from a bottom line perspective."

But again, if you think about our overall growth as a company in 2014 of 32% and in our International growth of 96%, there's an even 3x number basically there of International versus overall company growth. Obviously, as we talked about, again, lapping some of those market entries last year, again, the impact of foreign currency on International revenues, that growth rate will come down much more. So instead of a 3x number, it might look more like a 2x number or something like that. But again, I'm painting more directionally here versus giving you an exact number. On the DTC side, the real change here is going to be on the Factory House side. That real change is, again, planned business, we've been talking all along the last couple of years of the ability to really focus more on our Brand House initiatives and our E-Commerce business as growth drivers and really planning on taking out especially North America Factory House growth down as we started to limit our new door growth and focus on square footage growth. So I think that's going to be a piece that if you look at DCC growing 32% this year, you would expect with Factory House being the largest portion of that, you would expect that growth rate to come below 30% to some degree."

And first of all, that starts with my original partner, Kip,  who's been driving Footwear for the last several years and Kip is really one of the heart and soul of this company and I think what we're always looking for is for the heart and soul the come out through our product, something that we've been proud of in our Apparel but something I think that the consumer is seeing come out and really articulate in the voice of our Footwear product too. So a lot of big stories, a lot of good things to build on. I mean launching the SpeedForm platform is one of our leading launches that we had and best debut runners world and I think a lot of accolades that made us all incredibly proud of what we did last year. The Highlight Cleat, I feel like I always get caught up talking about success in cleats but that is really a big deal from where we began all the way back in 2006 till today, we are clearly the #2 player in the market with somewhere in the mid-30s in terms of market share. And Orlando Side  being the #1 football cleat in North America. And we say that from a standpoint of, if it bleeds, we can kill it. And what we heard that we never had ability to be successful in these markets, we could never, we could never and all we've done is come back with better product every single year, winning consumers that are choosing our brand. So what you're seeing happen and play out in our longest innings and Footwear was American football cleats, it's happening the same way in baseball cleats, it's happening the same way in training shoes, in running shoes and in basketball shoes right now. So the big place that we're looking for is -- again, one thing I definitely want to say is when it comes to Footwear, we have a solid Footwear company. I mean, with the growth that we saw, the 44% growth that we saw, we're over $400 million today and going at an incredibly healthy pace, we're the #2 market share in overall Footwear at several of our key accounts. So there are lots of places around this country and frankly, places we're working on around the world that Under Armour is absolutely winning in Footwear. And then also things like anecdotally doubling our basketball footwear business the season, led by things like that ClutchFit Drive that you saw. 3 of the teams we have in the top 25 in the AP Men's pool and I think 3 of the top 5 in the Women's AP poll as well. So Under Armour makes great quality shoes and -- especially when you talk about things like basketball, we have the leading vote getter by 40,000 votes for the MVP -- for the NBA All-Star game. Like Stephen Curry has been an unbelievable human being to begin with, but his play on the quarter is something that is flat out aspirational. Some we're incredibly proud of what that means. In addition, with Kip, we talked about Peter joining the team, so you're bringing a professional in, you're bringing an absolute vet, who comes in, who's basically seen the big movie before and someone who can help us as we start guiding ourselves through that where the long big number starts laying in. And I don't see the growth rates swelling in Footwear, and I'll temper myself when I say that. But I think that we have an opportunity as impressive as 44 percentage. I'd say that opportunity is much, much larger than that. In 2014 alone, we added 60 teammates to our team. We really reinforced our office in Portland and some place that we'll  continue to add talent and bring toward, as well as bring Peter, the new SVP of Footwear. The 25 years of industry experience that Peter brings is something that compliments, really, the brand knowledge that Kip has, plus the expertise that we built here. And beyond that, just a really great team and really positive energy in Under Armour Footwear. So with the cleat, we'll continue to lead and attack their football, baseball, all these categories. SpeedForm is actually a product in a apply from that we're taking into our cleated businesses as a whole. The highlight continues to be the top-selling premium product sold at key accounts like Eastbay and frankly places where kids shop. Go to a football field, and you'll find our products showing up there. Our running is really the next chapter for us. It's a place that we really focus. The SpeedForm, that debuted last year was pretty impressive. The Gemini, what you'll  hear from people, it's not only the best running shoes that Under Armour has ever built, it could be one of the best running shoes ever. It is that good of a product that has $130, we're really reinforcing ourselves by thing is a premium player and what we're seeing from some of the special key accounts that we have and the specialty shop getting refills and things that kind of reaction we haven't had an Under Armour in a very long time. Basketball, we mentioned it. Stephen is a signature shoe, kind of an individual and as I said in my script earlier, that Stephen will be -- we'll be featuring him next week at the NBA All-Star game where we're launching a new commercial of the new Stephen Curry One, a lot of energy and expectation around that and I think that campaign is one of the best that we've done in our history. And as I mentioned in an earlier question as well like Footwear is having that stops and sporting goods either. What we're doing in the outdoor space -- our Outdoor Footwear line is one of the most impressive, frankly, anywhere in the world. And that shoe that we won best new product and best innovation at the outdoor retailer, the flat tire shoe, that thing is cool. You should get one for your kids, they're going to go crazy for it. But I think it also demonstrates our ability to start leveraging our partnerships with people like Michelin and people like the of the world that we don't have to do all the heavy lifting ourselves and that we're taking this platform that we have as a consumer wants our brand by making sure that we just put the best around it all the time. So from lastly, from other services standpoint and Footwear, we're going to continue to broaden our Footwear business inside of our existing terrific partners that we have. We don't believe that we need necessarily new doors today as much as we just need to be excellent in the doors where we're doing business. And for us, that begins with sporting goods. It also means expanding some of our key partners at places like Finish Line and Foot Locker. And one quick note as well just to support that we felt from the executive team at Foot Locker and particularly, Ken, I've been wishing him well in his retirement and welcoming Dick Johnson, who is the first person who bought about Under Armour back at Eastbay when he ran that in 1999. So long story, we've been at this for a long time. We feel pretty proud of what we've done and frankly, we think we're just getting started."

I think the one thing we should take into account is that fact that we have been investing in the connected business over the last couple of years even before these 2 acquisitions. So the reality is that our operating margin has been relatively flat over the last couple of years, that 11.4, 11.5 range. The reality is the mix of that is Connected Fitness, obviously, has been an investment and increasing investment over the last couple of years even for these acquisitions and then on top of that obviously adding a 90 basis points dilutive impact in 2015. So the reality is the last couple of years we have been leveraging kind of our core business even though we are investing in places like International, in innovation, in product creation, in Footwear, we're still seeing some levers across other points in our existing business and Connected Fitness has been an investment perspective. So as you look going forward, I think what you expect to see his continued investment in basic like I just mentioned. International, although becoming profitable and although leveraging within the business community itself, it's still really an overall investment point in the overall company. Things like Brand House is a kind of just kind of getting off the ground, whether it be Brand House on the International front or specifically Brand House here in North America it's definitely an investment mode for us. And then I think Connected Fitness it with acquisitions on top of the existing model will be investment mode. So I think what your you're seeing is kind of continuation of leverage in our core business and the places you would expect us to leverage and balancing that leverage with needed investment to continue to drive long-term sustainable growth program."

Today, we reported outstanding financial results for 2014. It was a record year in almost every aspect of our business, enabling us to continue our streak of now 19 consecutive quarters of revenue growth over 20%",2943,"Thanks, Tom, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, we reported outstanding financial results for 2014. It was a record year in almost every aspect of our business, enabling us to continue our streak of now 19 consecutive quarters of revenue growth over 20% and 5 consecutive quarters of 30-plus percent growth. 
Heading into 2015, the confidence we have in our Apparel and Footwear businesses has never been higher. Our execution, never better; and our ambition, never stronger. 
We also announced the formation of the world's largest digital health and fitness community with the acquisition of Endomondo and MyFitnessPal to supplement our existing MapMyFitness and Under Armour Record platforms to create Under Armour Connected Fitness. We believe this positions Under Armour to meaningfully benefit as the world of technology and health and fitness intersect, creating new ways of connecting with athletes, building equity for our brand and additional levels of trust with our consumers. 
So first, I want to spend a few moments covering how our performance this past year will inform how we will grow our business in 2015 and beyond and then spend some time on the future state of Under Armour and how the acquisitions we announced earlier this afternoon will help ensure two things: that we reach our consumer in a manner they expect now and in the future; and that we continue to grow our business in the manner our shareholders expect as well. 
Crossing the $3 billion revenue mark in 2014 was an important milestone for our brand, and we did so with the most balanced growth in our history. And while a lot of today's conversation will be about new growth drivers, we had a tremendous year in our core Apparel business, growing total Apparel revenues by more than $0.5 billion. 
The growth was across all categories and genders, across our wholesale and direct businesses, in new categories and established ones and also across geographies. 
We brought a new dimension to our brand in 2014 and laid the foundation for continued growth in Women's with our I WILL WHAT I WANT campaign. We continue to drive innovation and premium pricing throughout our North American Apparel business with large platforms like ColdGear Infrared, Charged Cotton and Storm and in key categories like training, outdoor, golf and Women's Studio. 
We are focused on gaining additional floor space in these categories with our key wholesale sporting goods partners through improved merchandising and key initiatives like reinvigorating our core performance training apparel with the introduction of Armour, our reengineered base layer featuring enhanced ventilation. In addition, we see growth with our partners in the department store channel as we build out broader businesses there in women's and kids. 
There are multiple parts to our apparel growth story for 2015, but they are consistent with what we've been planning and executing against for the past 21 quarters.  And in each of them, we've driven 20-plus percent growth in our core Apparel business. We will continue to build out the large platforms, drive better assortments and strategically broaden our wholesale distribution in the right businesses. 
Accompanying that growth was our wholesale partners and our continued focus on our Direct-to-Consumer business, where we grew 32%, coming in at just under $1 billion for the full year. 
We saw strong growth in our Factory House stores as we increased our assortment of Footwear and benefited from our new Brand House stores in Tysons Corner in SoHo in New York. In Q1, we are opening our largest Brand House yet on Michigan Avenue in Chicago where we will highlight the innovation, localization and specialization of product that we can only do in a 30,000-square-foot Brand House environment. And you'll also see our Connected Fitness initiative integrated into the store as well. We know from our experience in the existing Brand House stores, especially in SoHo, that we are better positioned to tell great Footwear stories, and we'll expand on that as we build out new doors in 2015 and beyond. 
Our Footwear business helped accelerate our overall growth in 2014 with revenues up 44% for the year to $431 million. As we've been discussing on these calls, we are most proud of the foundation and the team we are building in our Footwear category as we continue to gain share and drive innovation in large categories like running and basketball. We significantly invested in Footwear leadership in 2014, and the strength of the Under Armour brand continues to bring consumers to our Footwear, while our focus on cushioning and fit is helping drive market share gains. 
Well, this past weekend, Tom Brady won his fourth Super Bowl and third MVP award wearing red and white Run 'N Gun Under Armour Cleat.
And next week, the biggest star in Under Armour's basketball universe and leading vote getter for the NBA All-Star game, Stephen Curry, will be in New York City to debut his first signature shoe, the Curry One. We'll be telling the basketball world about it when we introduce our Holiday One commercial next week starring Stephen and a very special surprise guest. This will be the largest campaign in our company's history, so big, in fact, that there will be a second part to it with a campaign to support the introduction of the SpeedForm Gemini running shoe. 
With the Curry One retailing at $120 and the SpeedForm Gemini at $130, we are creating a sustainable platform for growth in Footwear by focusing on premium, innovative products for the best athletes in the world, and we'll look back on 2014 as a pivotal year in the development of what may become our biggest engine for growth. 
The last piece of 2014 that I'll discuss also happens to be the part of our business where we saw the greatest increase in growth, International. Revenues grew 96% to $260 million in 2014 as we opened new markets around the globe, expanded our wholesale account base and continued to build out our international Brand House space with 68 Brand House stores opened outside the United States and rolling out underarmour.com in multiple new markets and languages. 
As we head into another strong year of growth in our global business, we'll continue to invest in both local and global assets like our recent signing of Andy Murray, the #4 ranked tennis player in the world and Australian Open finalist. We will strategically grow with our wholesale partners around the world, continue to build out the international Brand House stores, going from 18 stores at the end of 2013 to 68 stores in 2014 and adding more than 100 doors this year. This growing global presence enables us to bring the full Under Armour story to our consumers outside United States and illustrates the true breadth of our product innovations. 
So summing up the year, 2014 was a period of great accomplishment for the Under Armour team and a great example of what's possible when we're successfully anticipating the needs of our consumers. 
Our focus in 2015, as it has been since Under Armour's inception, is on making all athletes better and going well beyond their expectations. That philosophy enables us to focus on what is written on the whiteboard in my office above everything else,""Do not forget to sell shirts and shoes."" That is job 1 for our team in 2015 and will always be the foundation on which we grow the Under Armour brand global footprint. 
That being said, I want to share a vision now and provide some color on how the acquisitions we announced earlier today accomplished 2 very important things: first, the immediate scale we gained by adding Endomondo and MyFitnessPal to the MapMyFitness and UA Record platform, positioning Under Armour as the world's largest digital health and fitness community; and second, how this investment will enable us to better anticipate our consumers' needs, drive more informed purchase decisions and authentically build brand loyalty by helping our consumers lead a healthy life. 
So first, the facts. Early last month, we purchased Endomondo, a Copenhagen-based company that has built one of the largest global connected fitness communities. With approximately 20 million registered users, most of whom live in Europe, Endomondo provides the perfect strategic complement to the activity and workout tracking we currently have in our existing digital platform of MapMyFitness and UA Record. 
And with today's announcement to acquire MyFitnessPal, we have firmly established our Connected Fitness platform as the leading provider of everything an athlete needs to live a healthier lifestyle. Based in San Francisco, MyFitnessPal is the leading resource for healthy living and nutrition with over 80 million registered users and world-class nutritional resources. By bringing this established leader into our Connected Fitness platform, we can offer the full suite of information, activity and workout tracking, as well as nutritional expertise to truly make all athletes better. 
So what have we bought, and more importantly, why? For starters, with MyFitnessPal and Endomondo added to our existing platform, we now have the world's largest digital health and fitness community with a combined audience among all our platforms of over 120 million unique people. For perspective, there are approximately 20 digital communities in the world with more than 100 million members, so the first thing to note is this year's scale that we now bring to bear. 
To give you a sense of that scale, 1 out of every 5 people in the United States has downloaded one of the apps in our platform. Collectively, the 3 sites grew 46% last year, adding 40 million members, and we continue to add over 100,000 registered users every day. We have great geographic balance with 57% of our 120 million registered users in North America and the balance outside the United States. We also have 72 million women registered on our platform, providing another great opportunity for us to grow our brand presence with both female athletes and athletic females. 
Second, owning the world's largest digital health and fitness platform provides an incredibly unique opportunity for Under Armour to build a different type of relationship with our consumer over the long term. Health and fitness is a part of your life from childhood onward, and our goal in aggregating these 3 platforms is to make you better by making your health and fitness really easy to understand. The truth is that you know more about how your car is performing than your own body, and we see the potential to inform and inspire our consumer through these assets and its impact on our ability to sells shirts and shoes as unparalleled in our industry. 
We've built a $3 billion business by making great product and telling great stories, but there's nothing that says we must follow our competitor's playbook, especially when the way consumers digest media and make their purchase decision is undergoing such dramatic shifts. The net result of this shift is that our consumer is demanding more from athletic brands than just making shirts and shoes. We embrace those higher expectations and believe these investments position us better than anyone in our industry to truly make all athletes better. 
At the end of the day, the map is pretty simple. The more active someone is, the more likely they are to buy athletic apparel and footwear. And for the month of January, the 4 sites in our Connected Fitness platform, MapMyFitness, Endomondo, MyFitnessPal, and UA Record recorded more than 100 million workouts and added 4.2 million new unique users. 
So how did we come to the decision to invest in these communities and strategically add another tool in how we interact with our consumer? This chapter in the Under Armour story started at the NFL Combine in 2011 where we debuted the Armour39, the first performance apparel that incorporated biometric measurements and was used to track the performance of top NFL prospects. We saw the potential in measuring performance and how our consumers could benefit from it. 
At the same time, a lot of different trackers and wearable technology started to hit the market, and we were quick to realize that our core competencies lied in making shirts and shoes and understanding how to best incorporate technology to improve athletes' lives. We also realized that for Under Armour, it wasn't as much about the hardware as there would always be someone else working in a lab or a garage, someone who might crack the code on the next great device and that we could create the most value by working closely with partners who understood the power of the Under Armour brand and our knowledge of the athlete. 
At the same time, we started to understand that the true value for an athletic brand was actually in the community. And that crystallized for us when we started the conversion with Robin Thurston that led us to acquiring MapMyFitness in December of 2013. As we started working with Robin and his team in Austin, Texas, it only reinforced our belief that the value is in the community, especially one where the user is not just looking at their friends' pictures, but providing you with data that empowers you to come back to them with an informed point of view to help improve their health and fitness. We understood that there was tremendous value in becoming that trusted brand to set out to assemble all the elements that would enable Under Armour to be the one place to access all of that information. 
From a geographic view, Endomondo was the obvious choice to complement MapMyFitness. Their community of 20 million users, most of whom are based in Europe, provides a great opportunity for us to learn from and expands our ability to interact with the consumer who is still relatively new to us. With MyFitnessPal, their expertise in nutritional space positions us to have a complete picture of our athletes and rounds out the data from which we will be able to provide the most informed and personalized input on our users' health and fitness. 
So how will all of these come together? All of the 3 existing platforms, MapMyFitness, Endomondo and MyFitnessPal, will live as distinct platforms under the Under Armour Connected Fitness banner. But we have a longer term point of view and vision, and it's found in UA Record, the community we launched last month at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. 
Over time, we believe UA Record will eventually become the daily destination dashboard, aggregating all you want to know about your general fitness, sleep, steps, activity level, and yes, nutrition. We know that we are on the verge of remarkable developments on wearable technology, some of which are being worked on across the street in our own innovation lab right now. And our recently announced partnership with HTC will enable us to help to develop statement-level products that demonstrate the full capabilities of UA Record. But by focusing on an open platform and being device agnostic, we believe we are the best positioned among all athletic brands to benefit from the evolution of wearables. 
So let me sum up what this investment will do for Under Armour and why we believe it's critical to our ability to sell shirts and shoes going forward. Everything about our consumer is rapidly evolving, the way they digest media, what influences their purchase decision, how and where they buy things. We see that every day in our own business. 
For example, this past December, we did 77% more E-Commerce business on a mobile device than we did in December of just the year prior in 2013. Brands that do not evolve -- that do not offer their consumers something more than a product will be hard for us to compete in 2015 and beyond. We fully understand the massive shift in how our consumer will intersect with their favorite brands, and these acquisitions firmly position us on the leading-edge of that new paradigm. 
With the world's largest digital health and fitness community, we now have a unique opportunity to build equity and consumer loyalty over the long term. We will be able to provide the most complete measure of a person's health and fitness and become the trusted brand that will help drive not only E-Commerce but also long-term value for our shareholders. 
Are we ready for this next step? Two years ago, I would have had to answer no. But since that time, we have assembled an incredible pool of talent led by 3 entrepreneurs who literally helped create the entire category of Connected Fitness: Robin Thurston, the Founder of MapMyFitness; Mette Lykke, the Founder and CEO of Endomondo; and Mike Lee, the Founder and CEO of MyFitnessPal. Prior to the MapMyFitness acquisition, we had 4 engineers working in our digital team. With the 2 acquisitions announced today, that number is now over 300. 
More important than the sheer numbers, we now have 3 of the best minds in the space all adept at navigating in a rapidly shifting market and all with extensive experience understanding the needs of their communities. Robin is going to run our overall Connected Fitness business. And reporting to him will be Mette, who will drive our International business and initiatives; and Mike Lee, who will be running our North American business. This breadth of experience will enable our core product leadership to focus on the business of selling shirts and shoes as we build out this new growth platform that will position Under Armour at the center of the world's health and fitness activities for years and years to come. 
And with that, I'll hand it over to Brad."
8740684,281934250,755066,"Under Armour, Inc., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 04, 2015",2015-02-04,"Earnings Calls","Under Armour, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Kevin. I'll now spend some time discussing our fourth quarter and full year 2014 financial results, followed by updated outlook for 2015. Our net revenues for the fourth quarter of 2014 increased 31% to $895 million. For the full year, net reven",2014,"Thanks, Kevin. I'll now spend some time discussing our fourth quarter and full year 2014 financial results, followed by updated outlook for 2015. 
Our net revenues for the fourth quarter of 2014 increased 31% to $895 million. For the full year, net revenues increased 32% to $3.08 billion, which compared to our most recent full year guidance of $3.03 billion. As Kevin outlined, this $3 billion milestone was comprised of strong results across all of our growth drivers, with Apparel up 30%; Direct-to-Consumer, up 32%; Footwear, up 44%; and International, up 96%. 
Focusing on the fourth quarter, we grew Apparel category 30% to $708 million compared to $546 million in the prior year's quarter. Similar to the third quarter, our platform innovations of Storm, ColdGear Infrared and Charged Cotton were key volume drivers across the key category, while new innovation like this year's MagZip showcased our ongoing ability to bring value to the consumer. Areas of particular strength in Apparel include training, golf, outdoor and Studio. 
Fourth quarter Footwear net revenues increased 55% to $86 million from $55 million in the prior year, representing approximately 10% of net revenues for the period. We continue to see success in running Footwear across a broader price spectrum, including the $100 SpeedForm Apollo, driving market share gains within our core sporting goods distribution. Basketball also continued to gain momentum, most notably around the $125 ClutchFit Drive. These categories, along with our ongoing strength in areas such as cleated and slide, positioned Under Armour as the #2 overall footwear brand in some of our top wholesale accounts in 2014. 
Our Accessories net revenues during the fourth quarter increased 22% to $79 million from $65 million last year. Growth during the quarter was primarily driven by headwear offerings and gloves. 
Our global Direct-to-Consumer net revenues increased 27% for the quarter, representing approximately 38% of net revenues. 
Within North America, our Factory House square footage grew 17% year-over-year. This growth reflects the total of 125 Factory House stores at the end of the year, up 7% from the end of 2013, as well as the upsizing of 14 existing locations during the year. On the full-price side, we remained at 5 Brand House stores in North America. 
In our E-Commerce channel, where we continue to see a migration of traffic from desktop to mobile devices, we were encouraged by the conversion improvements from our new responsive site launch at the end of September. We also followed up our third quarter launches of local E-Commerce sites in the U.K., Germany and France with a fourth quarter debut of our site in Singapore, which is our first site in Southeast Asia. 
International net revenues increased 123% to $82 million in the fourth quarter and represented 9% of total net revenues. In the EMEA region, we saw continued strength in our 3 key markets in Europe, the U.K., Germany and France, and commenced our new distributor agreement covering the Middle East. In Asia Pacific, we remain focused on accelerating growth at both wholesale accounts and distributors, including partner store openings throughout Greater China and Southeast Asia. Finally, in Latin America, our business benefited from the early 2014 conversion of our Mexico distributor to an Under Armour subsidiary and our market expansions into Brazil and Chile. This included our first South American brand House Store, which opened in Santiago, Chile during the fourth quarter. 
Moving on to margins. Fourth quarter gross margins contracted 140 basis points to 49.9% compared with 51.3% in the prior year's quarter. Three primary factors contributed to this performance during the quarter: first, as discussed in our prior call, our sales mix adversely impacted gross margins by approximately 90 basis points for the period, primarily reflecting a higher mix of International net revenues, including the introduction of new lower-margin distributor businesses during the fourth quarter; second, the strengthening of U.S. dollar negatively impacted gross margins by approximately 20 basis points for the period; and finally, higher freight costs to better meet consumer demand negatively impacted gross margins by approximately 20 basis points in the period. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues leveraged 330 basis points, 33.6% in the fourth quarter of 2014 from 36.9% in the prior year's period. As a reminder, we incurred higher incentive compensation expenses in the last year's fourth quarter, which was a primary contributor of leverage in each of our 4 SG&A buckets. 
Additional SG&A details are as follows: first, marketing costs decreased to 8.4% of net revenues for the quarter from 8.9% in the prior year period; second, selling cost decreased to 11% of net revenues for the quarter from 11.6% in the prior year period; third, product innovation and supply chain cost decreased to 8.4% of net revenues for the quarter from 9% in the prior year period; and finally, corporate services decreased to 5.8% of net revenues for the quarter from 7.4% in the prior period, inclusive of closing costs for the MapMyFitness acquisition in the prior year period. 
Operating income for the fourth quarter increased 49% to $146 million compared with $98 million in the prior year period. For the full year, operating income increased 34% to $354 million compared to our most recent guidance of $348 million. 
Operating margin expanded 190 basis points during the quarter to 16.3% compared to 14.4% in the prior year period.  For the full year, operating margin expanded 10 basis points to 11.5% compared to 11.4% in 2013. 
Interest and other expense for the fourth quarter increased to $4 million compared with $1 million in the prior year period, primarily reflecting the negative impact of foreign currency, along with increased interest expense from our additional term debt. 
Our fourth quarter tax rate of 38.3% was unfavorable to the 34% rate last year, primarily driven by the timing of the state tax credits received in the fourth quarter of 2013. 
Our full year effective tax rate of 39.2% was higher than the 37.8% rate in 2013, primarily due to increased international investments and the lapping of the state tax credit. 
Our fourth quarter net income increased 37% to $88 million compared to $64 million in the prior year period. 
Diluted earnings per share increased 35% to $0.40 compared to $0.30 in the prior year period. Full year diluted earnings per share increased 27% to $0.95 compared to $0.75 in 2013. 
On the balance sheet, total cash and cash equivalents at year-end increased 71% to $593 million compared with $347 million at December 31, 2013.  Total debt increased to $284 million from $153 million at December 31, 2013. Both our cash and debt positions reflect an additional $100 million term loan drawn during the fourth quarter used primarily for the closing on the $85 million Endomondo acquisition in early January. 
Inventory at year-end increased 14% to $537 million compared to $469 million at December 31, 2013. 
Looking at our cash flows. Our investment and capital expenditures was approximately $59 million for the fourth quarter and approximately $145 million for 2014. 
Now moving on to 2015. We have 3 factors driving our updated outlook: first, the impact of the 2 new Connected Fitness businesses we are acquiring; second, the negative impact of the strengthening dollar on our International results; and third, the continued strength of our existing business. 
Starting with revenues. We are maintaining our prior guidance of approximately 22% net revenue growth. It should be noted this is off of a higher number compared to 3 months ago as we exceeded our most recent 2014 target by nearly $55 million. This growth rate takes into account the strengthening of the U.S. dollar over the past 90 days, which has negatively impacted our 2015 net revenues forecast by approximately 1 percentage point from our prior guidance. However, revenues from the Connected Fitness acquisitions are expected to largely offset this currency impact. As stated in our previous guidance, we expect solid growth across all of our growth drivers led by continued outperformance in our Footwear and International businesses. We expect the year-over-year growth rates across each of the quarters in 2015 to be relatively consistent, except for the fourth quarter where we will be lapping strong International growth, including new market entries. 
Now moving on to operating income. We are now planning 2015 operating income in the range of $397 million to $407 million, representing growth of 12% to 15%. This change from our prior guidance of operating income growth of 22% is largely due to the impact of our 2 Connected Fitness acquisitions. We estimate 90 basis points of operating margin dilution from these acquisitions, mostly within SG&A, offset with a slight gross margin benefit. 
There are 3 components of this: first, onetime deal closing costs recorded in the first quarter are expected to impact the full year by approximately 20 basis points; second, operating losses from the operations of the 2 businesses we are acquiring are expected to impact the full year by approximately 40 basis points; and third, the intangible assets generated from the acquisitions will result in noncash amortization charges, which are expected to impact the full year by approximately 30 basis points. 
The recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar also had a negative impact on our 2015 operating income guidance, specifically in our gross margin line as we purchase the majority of our inventory for our International businesses in U.S. dollars. This has created an incremental 50 basis point impact to operating margin just from the time of our prior guidance. We anticipate to offset this currency impact through targeted improvements in gross margin and SG&A. 
Our current guidance assumes no further significant strengthening of the U.S. dollar compared to current exchange rates. 
From a gross margin standpoint, we believe we can still generate a modest improvement from last year's 49% level despite foreign currency headwinds given the ongoing supply chain opportunities as the year progresses. Relative to timing, we expect this improvement could be generally consistent throughout the year. 
On SG&A, we expect expense deleverage mainly driven by the Connected Fitness acquisition. The rate of SG&A expense deleverage is expected to gradually ease throughout the year from approximately 200 basis points deleveraged during the first quarter. 
Factors weighing on expenses during the first quarter include higher year-over-year marketing expenses to support our first Brand Holiday of 2015, as well as the onetime deal closing cost for the Connected Fitness acquisitions. Below the operating line, we expect higher year-over-year interest expense for the funding of our Connected Fitness acquisitions. We anticipate funding these acquisitions through cash on hand and expanded term loan and revolving credit facility. 
The full year effective tax rate is now expected to be slightly higher than our 2014 effective rate of 39.2%. The impact of the strong dollar on our International results is negatively impacting our 2015 effective tax rate in excess of 100 basis points.  Our 2015 fully diluted share count is expected to be approximately $220 million. 
Finally, as we indicated with our preliminary 2015 guidance in October, we expect elevated capital expenditures during the year. Part of this acceleration includes combined investments of approximately $90 million for our new domestic distribution center and the expansion of our corporate headquarters in Baltimore. We also expect elevated capital expenditures tied to our global retail expansion. In total, we are currently planning 2015 capital expenditures in the range of $280 million to $290 million. 
In conclusion, 2015 has developed into an important investment year for our company as we create the world's largest digital health and fitness community. We believe these investments will enhance and support our growth drivers and drive long-term value for our shareholders. Even after factoring in the dilutive impact on 2015, we believe that our forward 3-year operating income CAGR through 2017 will be in line with the 22% growth rate level that we provided in our prior 2015 guidance. We will provide specific long-term guidance at our Investor Day targeted for September 16 of this year.

But I think what you've seen, and now we're in our 10th year of making shoes, our 8th year of selling shoes, is that we've actually gotten pretty good at it and we can drive premium pricing. It's something that's been familiar to us in apparel for a very long time. So I think that we're thoughtful and there's a lot of factors that play with oil and a few other things that are still working their way through the system. But we're not seeing, number one, a great squeeze on the manufacturing prices that were not enjoying any advantages just yet. We are feeling some of these currency [indiscernible], but I think everybody's trying to figure out which way is up with that. At the end of the day, I'm not sure it's going to be any global or international market that will be dictating what price for Under Armour is. It's going to be the relationship that we have with the consumer. And I think that we'll continue to drive that and echo that in everything we do from our branding, our marketing, and frankly, highlighted today with the 2 acquisitions that we announced about a deeper and better understanding of that consumer."

On the pricing side, obviously, with the strengthening U.S. dollar, we'll look at the ability to increase prices potentially on the International businesses. But obviously, that's probably more of a 2016 conversation at this point. And the teams are working through the impact of a strengthening dollar and how that will help on pricing on the International front. On the costing side, kind of the same time frame for the most part is we're about a year ahead of the selling season in locking in fabric pricing. So the locking in of our Spring/Summer '15 product, and obviously, our Fall/Winter '15 product, too, really occurred 1 year to 8 months ago to some degree when the oil prices were still elevated. So with oil prices coming down, that is one of the input costs, obviously, that impact our cost. We're locking in Spring/Summer '16 favorable fabric pricing today, and we'll be locking in Fall/Winter '16 over some of the course of the next 6 months. I think we have a better opportunity in 2016 both from a pricing perspective to the consumer and also the costing perspective from the vendor."

But let me just start with, first of all, why we thought that we could do this. The basic reason is because, frankly, our business and our brand have never been stronger. 19 consecutive quarters, 20-plus percent top line growth, including the last 5 of which we delivered over 30%. The year that we had in 2014, we saw strength across the business from, again, a core Apparel business that grew by $0.5 billion, our Footwear businesses that grew 44%, our International business grew 96%, just to name a few of them. And frankly, at the end of the day, as we said, and you've heard me say, in my whiteboard, there sit lots of slogans, things that say like, ""Overpromise and deliver, "" and ""Dictate the tempo "" and ""Walk with a purpose."" And the one note that's written in red very simply says, ""Don't forget to sell shirts and shoes."" The reason that we did what we did today was because we believe ultimately this will help us sell more shirts and shoes and reach more athletes to make them better. So what we really did. This exercise began for us a little more than a year ago in December 13 when we announced the acquisition of MapMyFitness and we paid $150 million for them. It really helped us establish a beachhead in digital. And as I said, I think, in my script, you heard me talk about how we didn't really have a presence. I mean, combined between our internal Connected Fitness team and our E-Commerce team, we had less than 50 people in that group. And today, we have roughly 400 people in the group, and we'll add another 100 this year. So the world of digital, and again, some of the anecdotes that leads to that thinking, and you heard me give the stat about 77% more people going to mobile, we also had another stat for you. We had 11% of our orders on Cyber Monday this year we saw come -- or last year we saw come across mobile devices. And then just 1 year in 2014, the same day, apples-to-apples, that number has grown to 27% of people that placed orders at ua.com or on mobile devices. So we recognize that having relations there is incredibly important. With this acquisition though, the one thing that we learned was about having additional functionality was we knew what we had dealing with Robin and the team over the last 12, 13 months. But also, we realized what we didn't have. If our ultimate goal was to build a complete picture of the athlete, there were two things that we're missing: number one, we have an incredibly North American outlook, and so global scale was something that we were looking for; and secondly, something that we thought would be much easier for us to buy than to try to build was the idea of nutritional expertise. In announcing the purchase of these, 2 of the world's leading platforms, Endomondo in Copenhagen and MyFitnessPal in San Francisco, I mean, in one sale swoop, we created the world's largest connected health and fitness community with 120 million unique members and the largest by a factor of 2 and arguably 3. So there is no real person in second place that we basically aggregated this community all at once. And just as importantly, it's growing at over 100,000 people a day. And just a little fact. In January, it's obviously a big month, particularly for people, as they start thinking about health and wellness and measuring themselves. We average 136,000 people joining and registering every single day, totaling 4.2 million people in the 31 days of January. And just as impressively, if you heard me mention, over 100 million workouts were logged, 100 million workouts. And so when you talk about the one thing that we emphatically know is that the more someone exercises, the more that they work out, it's just logical that the more Apparel and Footwear they are going to ultimately buy. The mission that we have says, ""Let's make athletes better."" And with that information, people choose to share with our Connected Fitness platforms, we think it creates piece of the puzzle that's going to allow us to have that total complete picture of the athlete, how much they're exercising, how much they're sleeping, how much activity they have, what they're putting in their body, what their nutrition habits are. So with all of that, it basically comes down to why we did it and really what it means for Under Armour. The thing that as I saw it -- and look, this was not an easy decision. And as we talked about this, we debated this heavily internally, have lots of conversations, and at the end of today, we kept coming back to the same thing, is that this will help drive our core business. This will help with our 5 core growth drivers. And frankly, the idea of standing here and looking and saying, ""Should we do it or not?"" To me, it felt incredibly obvious. It reminded me of when I made that first stretchy T-shirt and looking around saying, ""Has anybody ever done anything like this and why is everyone is still wearing a short-sleeved cotton tee in the summer and a long-sleeved cotton tee in the winter? "" And I look and say, ""No one has aggregated and put all of these pieces together."" And we don't see anything coming. So the ability we have was incredibly new. But what I saw in this really white space with what we're doing making T-shirts, the opportunity that we have here is a bit different just because there's so much energy and excitement around wearables and biometric measurement. But the surprise that I have is that, frankly, no one is leading or adjusting what we are today, the power of a truly connected fitness community. There's this massive shift that's happening on where the consumers are interacting with their favorite brands as the world goes digital, and we don't see anyone appropriately addressing the needs of consumers. So now when you look and just think about what's happening, and frankly, for myself coming back from CES, in 2009, there were roughly 1 billion ""connected things"" in the planet. An estimate, depending on who you listen to, by 2020, that number will be somewhere between 25 billion to 50 billion. So who does the best job of synthesizing that data and making it easier for the consumer to understand are the ones that will win. Activity, sleep, exercise, nutrition, and that's the place where we think that we can win, particularly with our UA Record dashboard. And again, the vision there is to become the daily dashboard that people check, the same way you check your bank balance, the same way you check the weather. It's the same way that you get an update on the most important aspect in your life, your own personal health. So finally, this convergence that we see happening, the digitization of kids as we look and we talk to the people and see that they've forgotten about no one is looking and wondering what's happening in the newspaper. If you have one device that a 20-year-old cannot live with today, like it is not a magazine and print, it is -- without question, it is a handheld device. And what we see is with the acceleration of wearables and what's happening there, that we feel like we are positioned squarely in the center of what is supposed to happen. Community and platform is a right play, and because of the acquisitions that began in December 13, we're sitting in the middle of it. This aggregation provides us with the opportunity to build a long and sustainable relationship with our consumer, and ultimately, we think we're going to sell a lot more shirts and shoes. That would be -- I was waiting for that question, Omar, so thank you."

And frankly, it's one of those silent businesses that we don't get a lot of credit for but that we are one of the pure play leaders in the space. Walk in to any Cabela's, Bass Pro Shop, and the Under Armour presence is overwhelming. And first of all, as I dive into the question on Outdoor, I think just given a nod, I think, to the brand that's been established with the elasticity that we demonstrate with the same company that can come out with probably one of the most talked about commercial in 2014 featuring Misty Copeland and Gisele in our Women's business for the I WILL WHAT I WANT campaign is frankly the same company that has a relationship with Willie from Duck Dynasty. And when you walk in and you see what we have in the Outdoor and the fishing and the mountain business, there is a need for a brand like Under Armour. And I think we're continuing to innovate. We're fresh off the Outdoor Retailer show out in Salt Lake, and amongst other things, we won best product, most innovative product for a new shoe that we have coming out called the Fat Tire shoe. It's a partnership that we did with Michelin, and it puts us against squarely with a shoe that's fashioned, if you've seen those big, oversized bikes that ride on snow or can ride on sand. And I think it's just another approach that we're taking from a very consumer-centric approach that demonstrates we know what we're doing. From ability for win there, you're going to start seeing our outerwear, which we've been making, frankly, for the last 7 and 8 years. And among that time, we've, of course, built a better relationship with the consumer, understanding them, but we've also built a better relationship with the factories, building better products, taking and incorporating the ethos, the essence that is Under Armour, that makes us special on an athletic playing field, makes us just as special on the ski mountain, just as special in the woods and just as special on a saltwater fishing boat. So I think what you're seeing from us is that what gives us the greatest elasticity is the ability to apply the principles that make something so incredibly Under Armour and apply it to a market that makes sense. We have an authentic team here. We have it on the grassroots side. We have it on the product side especially. We have it on the marketing side. And I think that we see a great opportunity with a business now that's clearly well over $300 million for us that surprises people when they hear that number, and frankly, growing north of our internal -- or external growth rate as a company, too. So we see great upside there, and frankly, we think we can be a player in the Outdoor space for a long time to come, and we think that we've got a good relationship now that just can keep getting better and better."

If you kind of walk from our 2014, 32% top line growth to our 22% guidance for '15, I think the first place you have to look is our International  business, which grew 96% in 2014. And that really included a lot of new launches into new markets like Brazil, Chile, Southeast Asia and the Middle East, most of those launches happening more from the middle to the back half of the year. So although we still anticipate very, very strong growth in International businesses. We will be comping those market entries year-over-year. In addition, on the International side, the foreign currency, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, I mentioned in my prepared remarks the 1% decline in revenue just from the last 90 days activity in foreign currency. For the full year, it's a 2 percentage point growth with the strengthening dollar full year, year-over-year for us. So if you take both of those factors, the International business comping those market launches and the impact of the strengthening dollar, you're probably at more than half of the walk down from 32% to 22%. On the North America side, obviously, we have this planned deceleration of our Factory House growth we've been planning for over the course of the last few years. We talked about adding less new doors and focus more on square footage growth. So although we are focusing on square footage growth, that square footage growth year-over-year, as you saw in Q4, also a decline in '14 from '13, it will be declining throughout 2015 compared to 2014 also. So that's another factor that's really kind of driving us down. And on the wholesale side, I've always been pretty clear, and I'm going to take a look at the information I have today when we give our guidance and forecast going forward. And obviously, we have our Q4 results in, but the data point that I don't have today for the back half of '15 is all of our bookings and orders on the wholesale side, specifically again in our largest business, which is North America wholesale, don't have those bookings in for a good part of the back half of the year, especially the fourth quarter. So obviously, taking a cautious approach to our forecast and from that aspect based on the fact that we don't have that data in place right now."

So that will definitely have a positive impact on our ASPs as we get to the back half of the year and continue to innovate. But obviously, our price point increase over the course of the last few seasons has been kind of in the low to mid-single digit range. So our story is growth. It's unit growth. It's less about ASP growth. That ASP growth is important from an innovation perspective for us, but our brand is all about unit growth."

So I think, first of all, what we're doing on a global basis right now is pretty extraordinary. We're up 123% in the quarter, 96% for the full year, and it's the first year that we saw Europe surpass $100 million. And really hats off to our team and particularly Matt Shearer, who is there before who we pulled out of our Canadian business and sent over there to really get the shift right and which is a place that we took a lot of hits in Europe for a long time before we figured out how to make things happen. And we've really took one of our own who built an amazing $100-plus million business in Canada and asked him to do the same thing in Europe and then handed the reins in the last 8 months or so to an industry professional, a guy named Chris Bate, who's been -- we've got the leadership established and in place. But there's a lot of things that are at play there. So of course, first and foremost is leadership. But I really like the assets that we've been signing and think of the global perspective that we've taken. Things like Tottenham Hotspur and being in the EPL has been really important for us and continue to double down with athletes and with assets on the outside of being relevant to that consumer. But like anything -- Europe does not happen overnight. It takes a little bit longer. And so as we sit here in our, I guess, ninth year doing business over there, it's been a long run. What we're seeing though is the partnerships that we have on the wholesale side, a lot of really good things that have been going on. Some of the milestones, again, we said surpass the 100 -- it's actually north of $130 million in Europe in '14. And the plans that we have are even to breakeven for the first time in Europe. We took some -- Europe was difficult for a very long time. So going from not having that negative is actually -- to being a breakeven and actually looking and having a line of sight to making money is incredibly powerful for us. The aided and unaided brand awareness that we have basically tripled year-over-year in key markets like the U.K. and Germany. The launch of our E-Commerce site for the first time in U.K. made a big deal. Same thing in Germany, same thing in France, and then we expect to add the Netherlands to the EU in 2015. And our market focus provided the visibility, the opportunity to drive deep account connections. We've been in some of the right places. We still have opportunity to go from a wholesale standpoint. It's a difficult wholesale environment to say the least in Europe, but we see ourselves really driving and moving. And frankly, the partnership that we felt from people is that -- we're now getting recognized is that Under Armour is an incredibly key brand to have in your store and you cannot live without of. And frankly, what we recognize is that we can't live without them either, which is a very healthy relationship and one that we probably share in our wholesale environment here in the United States. So we're looking forward to some of those new partnerships that we have. But that global story doesn't stop at the borders of Europe either. The good news is that what Charlie and our team in the International group have done are really driving Under Armour toward that vision of someday we expect in order to find ourselves with a global brand that definition means that more than half of our revenues must come from outside of our home country. So we got a shot and we love the execution that our team has taken to making that happen. And we've got Andy Murray now, finalist for the Australian open, so it's a good scout on our team -"

So Latin America was really -- it began as Charlie's wheelhouse for us, but we're looking at these markets and things that we thought would be nice countries to do business in. We're now looking at and saying what's our roadmap to $100 million, places like Mexico, Brazil and Chile, where it begins, as always, with great, great leadership. But in Brazil right now, we've got over 100 branded spaces that we opened in 2014. We'll have more than 250 spaces in 2015. Obviously, the energy and excitement with the Olympics coming there. Next year is going to be a big deal. Mexico continues to move for us. We've got a new master franchise agreement that's going to magnify our distribution approach that we have there, big assets like Toluca and Cruz Azul and the Mexican football league there. And then in Chile, where we announced -- probably we felt like it was a bit premature, but Colo-Colo, which is one of the top football clubs in Chile, we opened our first Brand House in the fourth quarter and it's doing incredibly bigger than we thought it would do. China is when we've talked about store growth, opening over 100 stores, the majority of those stores will actually come out of China and finding -- and many of them partner run, but it's not like it makes a difference as we expand from just 2 cities to more than 10 cities across China. We want to get into the roots of the country, and we want to make sure that they understand our authenticity and our commitment to China. But again, China from where it was when we launched in 2008, 2009, China, again, is going to be another International breakeven story for us. So the line of sight that we have towards making money in global markets is something. It's incredibly time-consuming. It's an incredible amount of sacrifice, money, energy, all those things. But we have an International team that is building out and giving us that global perspective as a company. The new Southeast Asia distribution agreement that we came through as well, we have this terrific partners based out of Singapore that have been really incredible, markets that you didn't think of. And one of the imagery we show when we talk about global growth is when we opened a roughly 2,000 square foot store, 200 square meter store in downtown Manila in the Philippines, and there's 700-plus people waiting in line to get into it. So we're seeing that there is a pull and there is an absolute demand for our brand. And throughout Asia, our partners in Japan continue to move and grow. Currency has been a struggle with them, but on an apples-to-apples basis, their business is incredibly healthy and growing at a real rate. And the last thing I'd like to say just about, I think, International growth and expansion and tying it back to the announcements that we made today, with frankly 52 million people outside of North America that now have Under Armour's Connected Fitness, one of our Connected Fitness platforms on their mobile, their digital device, it's the opportunity for us to have a different type of introduction with this consumer. It's a different type of handshake that we're going to introduce the Under Armour brand to them. And we think we can do it an incredibly digital way, but we think it's going to give us the opportunity to tell an incredibly complete story of who we are and just as importantly, where this brand is headed. So a lot of energy and excitement around what's happening with Under Armour on a global basis to the point where people here are knocking on my door and saying, ""Can I go move to Australia? Can I move to China? Can I move to these other markets?"" And so I think it's a lot of energy and excitement, and I think that vision of painting a global brand is something that we expect to bring to life."

Obviously, the front half of this year is locked in. So a part of that -- a part of the initiative there is to look at ways to get some money out of the supply chain because of the strengthening dollar. Obviously, you kind of have some offsets in SG&A with the strengthening dollar, too, in the International business from a cost perspective, too. It just kind of come naturally. And there's just things within SG&A itself. As we did the acquisitions, there are some things that made sense to scale back a little bit because we felt the investment and the acquisitions was a complementary thing to be doing to some of the things that we're planning on doing initially anyway, so some synergies there to some degree. So although it seems like big items there to offset, most of them are pretty natural because of the strengthening dollar, some synergies and the acquisitions that we're doing compared to some other investments we were going to make and some things naturally that SG&A made sense for us to kind of go after, again, just from a bottom line perspective."

So instead of a 3x number, it might look more like a 2x number or something like that. But again, I'm painting you more directionally here versus giving you an exact number. On the DTC side, the real change here is going to be on the Factory House side. That real change is, again, planned business. We've been talking all along the last couple of years of the ability to really focus more on our Brand House initiatives and our E-Commerce business as growth drivers and really planning on taking our especially North America Factory House growth down as we started to limit our new door growth and focus on square footage growth. So I think that's going to be a piece that if you look at DTC growing 32% this year, you would expect -- with Factory House being the largest portion of that, you would expect that growth rate to come below 30% to some degree."

It just feels like this was the year that you've gotten permission from the consumer, clearly reflecting the pricing migrating higher.

And first of all, that starts with my original partner, Kip Fulks, who's been driving Footwear for the last several years. And Kip is really -- he's one of the -- he's heart and soul of this",1301,"Of course, so like everything, it always begins with leadership. And first of all, that starts with my original partner, Kip Fulks, who's been driving Footwear for the last several years. And Kip is really -- he's one of the -- he's heart and soul of this company, and I think what we're always looking for is for that heart and soul to come out through our product. It's something that we've been proud of in our Apparel but something I think that the consumer is seeing come out and really articulate in the voice of our Footwear product, too. So a lot of big stories, a lot of good things to build on. I mean, launching the SpeedForm platform is one of the leading launches that we had and best debut, Runner's World, and I think a lot of accolades that made us all incredibly proud of what we did last year. The Highlight Cleat, I feel we always get caught up talking about the success in cleats, but that is really a big deal. From where we began, all the way back in 2006 till today, we are clearly the #2 player in the market with somewhere in the mid-30s in terms of market share, and our line of sight is being the #1 football cleat in America. And we say that from the standpoint of if it bleeds, we can kill it. And what we heard was that we never had ability to be successful in these markets, we could never, we could never, and all we've done is come back with better product every single year, winning more consumers that are choosing our brand. So what you're seeing happen and play out in our longest standing business in Footwear was this American football cleats. It's happening in the same way in baseball cleats. It's happening the same way in training shoes, in running shoes and in basketball shoes right now. So the big place that we're looking for is -- again, one thing I definitely want to say is that when it comes to Footwear, we have a solid footwear company. I mean, with the growth that we saw, the 44% growth that we saw, we're over $400 million today and growing at an incredibly healthy pace, we're the #2 market share in overall footwear at several of our key accounts. So there are lots of places around this country, and frankly, places we're working on around the world that Under Armour is absolutely winning in Footwear and then also things like anecdotally doubling our basketball footwear business the season led by things like that ClutchFit Drive that you saw and 3 of the teams we have in the top 25 in the AP men's poll and I think 3 of the top 5 in the women's AP poll as well. So Under Armour makes great quality shoes. And especially when you talk about things like basketball, we have the leading vote getter by 40,000 votes for the MVP -- for the NBA All-Star game. Like Stephen Curry has been an unbelievable human being to begin with, but his play on the court is something that's just flat out inspirational. So we're incredibly proud of what that means. In addition, with Kip, we talked about Peter joining the team. So you're just bringing -- you're bringing a professional in. You're bringing an absolute vet who comes in, who's basically seen the big movie before and someone who can help us as we start guiding ourselves through that where the law of big numbers starts laying in. And I don't see the growth rates slowing in Footwear, and I'll temper myself when I say that. But I think that we have an opportunity as impressive as 44 percentage. I'd say that opportunity is much, much larger than that. In 2014 alone, we added 60 teammates to our team. We really reinforced our office in Portland and some -- a place that we'll continue to add talent and bring people toward, as well as bringing Peter Ruppe in as our new SVP of Footwear. The 25 years of industry experience that Peter brings is something that complements, really, the brand knowledge that Kip has, plus the expertise that we've built here. And beyond that, it's just a really great team and a really positive energy in Under Armour Footwear. So with the cleated, we'll continue to lead and attack there. Football, baseball, all of these categories. SpeedForm is actually a product in a platform that we're taking in to our cleated businesses as a whole. The highlight continues to be the top-selling premium product sold at key accounts like Eastbay and frankly places where kids shop. You go to a football field, and you'll find our products showing up there. Our running is really the next chapter for us. It's a place that we really focus. The SpeedForm that debuted last year was pretty impressive. The Gemini, what you'll  hear from people, it's not only the best running shoes that Under Armour has ever built, it could be one of the best running shoes ever. It is that good of a product that at $130, we're really reinforcing ourselves, I think, as a premium player. And what we're seeing from some of the -- especially the key accounts that we have in the run specialty shop getting refills and things that the kind of reaction we haven't had from Under Armour in a very long time. Basketball, we mentioned it. Stephen is a signature shoe, kind of an individual. And as I said in my script earlier, that Stephen will be -- we'll be featuring him next weekend at the NBA All-Star game where we're launching a new commercial of the new Stephen Curry One, a lot of energy and expectation around that. And I think that campaign is one of the best that we've done in our history. And as I mentioned in an earlier question as well, like Footwear is having [ph] that stops and sporting goods either. What we're doing in the Outdoor space -- our Outdoor Footwear line is one of the most impressive, frankly, anywhere in the world. And that shoe that we won best new product and best innovation at the Outdoor Retailer, the Fat Tire shoe, that thing is cool. You should get one for your kids. They're going to go crazy for it. But I think it also demonstrates our ability to start leveraging our partnerships with people like Michelin and people like the GOREs of the world, that we don't have to do all the heavy lifting ourselves and that we're taking this platform that we have as a consumer wants our brand, we're making sure that we just put the best around it all the time. So from -- lastly, from a distribution standpoint in Footwear, we're going to continue to broaden our Footwear business inside of our existing terrific partners that we have. We don't believe that we need necessarily new doors today as much as we just need to be excellent in the doors where we're doing business. And for us, that begins with sporting goods. And it also means extending some of our key partners at places like Finish Line and Foot Locker. And one quick note as well just to -- the support that we felt from the executive team at Foot Locker and particularly Ken Hicks and wishing him well in his retirement and welcoming Dick Johnson, who is the first person who bought Under Armour back in Eastbay when he ran that in 1999. So long story, we've been at this for a long time. We feel pretty -- very proud of what we've done, and frankly, we think we're just getting started."

I think the one thing we should take into account is that fact that we have been investing in the Connected Fitness business over the last couple of years, even before these 2 acquisitions. So the reality is that our operating margin has been relatively flat over the last couple of years, that 11.4, 11.5 range. The reality is the mix of that is that Connected Fitness, obviously, has been an investment and an increasing investment over the last couple of years, even for these acquisitions, and then on top of that, obviously, adding a 90 basis points dilutive impact in 2015. So the reality is the last couple of years, we have been leveraging kind of our core business. Even though we are investing in places like International and innovation and product creation and Footwear, we're still seeing some levers across other points in our existing business, and Connected Fitness has been an investment perspective. So as you look going forward, I think what you would expect to see is continued investment in places like I just mentioned. International, although becoming profitable and although leveraging within the business unit itself, is still really an overall investment point in the overall company. Things like Brand House is kind of just kind of getting off the ground. Whether it be Brand House on the International front or specifically Brand House here in North America, it's definitely an investment mode for us. And then I think, again, Connected Fitness, with the acquisitions on top of the existing model, will be investment mode. So I think what you're seeing here is kind of a continuation of leveraging our core business and the places you would expect us to leverage and balancing that leverage with needed investments to continue to drive long-term sustainable growth program."

Today, we reported outstanding financial results for 2014. It was a record year in almost every aspect of our business, enabling us to continue our streak of now 19 consecutive quarters of revenue growth over 20%",2941,"Thanks, Tom, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, we reported outstanding financial results for 2014. It was a record year in almost every aspect of our business, enabling us to continue our streak of now 19 consecutive quarters of revenue growth over 20% and 5 consecutive quarters of 30-plus percent growth. 
Heading into 2015, the confidence we have in our Apparel and Footwear businesses has never been higher; our execution, never better; and our ambition, never stronger. 
We also announced the formation of the world's largest digital health and fitness community with the acquisitions of Endomondo and MyFitnessPal to supplement our existing MapMyFitness and Under Armour Record platforms that create Under Armour Connected Fitness. We believe this positions Under Armour to meaningfully benefit as the world of technology and health and fitness intersect, creating new ways of connecting with athletes, building equity for our brand and additional levels of trust with our consumers. 
So first, I want to spend a few moments covering how our performance this past year will inform how we will grow our business in 2015 and beyond, and then spend some time on the future state of Under Armour and how the acquisitions we announced earlier this afternoon will help ensure 2 things: that we reach our consumer in the manner they expect now and in the future; and that we continue to grow our business in the manner our shareholders expect as well. 
Crossing the $3 billion revenue mark in 2014 was an important milestone for our brand, and we did so with the most balanced growth in our history. And while a lot of today's conversation will be about new growth drivers, we had a tremendous year in our core Apparel business, growing total Apparel revenues by more than $0.5 billion. The growth was across all categories and genders, across our wholesale and direct businesses, in new categories and established ones and also across geographies. 
We brought a new dimension to our brand in 2014 and laid the foundation for continued growth in Women's with our I WILL WHAT I WANT campaign. We continue to drive innovation and premium pricing throughout our North American Apparel business with large platforms like ColdGear Infrared, Charged Cotton and Storm and in key categories like training, outdoor, golf and Women's Studio. 
We are focused on gaining additional floor space in these categories with our key wholesale sporting goods partners through improved merchandising and key initiatives like reinvigorating our core performance training apparel with the introduction of Armour, our reengineered base layer featuring enhanced ventilation. In addition, we see growth with our partners in the department store channel as we build out broader businesses there in women's and kids. 
There are multiple parts to our apparel growth story for 2015, but they are consistent with what we've been planning and executing against for the past 21 quarters.  And in each of them, we've driven 20-plus percent growth in our core Apparel business. We will continue to build out large platforms, drive better assortments and strategically broaden our wholesale distribution in the right businesses. 
Accompanying that growth was our wholesale partners and our continued focus on our Direct-to-Consumer business, where we grew 32%, coming in at just under $1 billion for the full year, we saw strong growth in our Factory House stores as we increased our assortment of Footwear and benefited from our new Brand House stores in Tysons Corner in SoHo in New York. 
In Q1, we are opening our largest Brand House yet on Michigan Avenue in Chicago where we will highlight the innovation, localization and specialization of product that we can only do in a 30,000-square-foot Brand House environment. And you'll also see our Connected Fitness initiative integrated into the store as well. We know from our experience in the existing Brand House stores, especially in SoHo, that we are better positioned to tell great Footwear stories, and we'll expand on that as we build out new doors in 2015 and beyond. 
Our Footwear business helped accelerate our overall growth in 2014 with revenues up 44% for the year to $431 million. As we've been discussing on these calls, we are most proud of the foundation and the team we are building in our Footwear category as we continue to gain share and drive innovation in large categories like running and basketball. We significantly invested in Footwear leadership in 2014, and the strength of the Under Armour brand continues to bring consumers to our Footwear, while our focus on cushioning and fit is helping drive market share gains. 
Well, this past weekend, Tom Brady won his fourth Super Bowl and third MVP award wearing red and white Run 'N Gun Under Armour cleats.
And next week, the biggest star in Under Armour's basketball universe and leading vote-getter for the NBA All-Star game, Stephen Curry, will be in New York City to debut his first signature shoe, the Curry One. We'll be telling the basketball world about it when we introduce our Holiday One commercial next week starring Stephen and a very special surprise guest. This will be the largest campaign in our company's history, so big, in fact, that there will be a second part to it with a campaign to support the introduction of the SpeedForm Gemini running shoe. 
With the Curry One retailing at $120 and the SpeedForm Gemini at $130, we are creating a sustainable platform for growth in Footwear by focusing on premium, innovative products for the best athletes in the world, and we'll look back on 2014 as a pivotal year in the development of what may become our biggest engine for growth. 
The last piece of 2014 that I'll discuss also happens to be the part of our business where we saw the greatest increase in growth, International. Revenues grew 96% to $260 million in 2014 as we opened new markets around the globe, expanded our wholesale account base and continued to build out our international Brand House space with 68 Brand House stores opened outside the United States and rolling out underarmour.com in multiple new markets and languages. 
As we head into another strong year of growth in our global business, we'll continue to invest in both local and global assets like our recent signing of Andy Murray, the #4 ranked tennis player in the world and Australian Open finalist. We will strategically grow with our wholesale partners around the world, continue to build out the international Brand House stores, going from 18 stores at the end of 2013 to 68 stores in 2014 and adding more than 100 doors this year. This growing global presence enables us to bring the full Under Armour story to our consumers outside the United States and illustrates the true breadth of our product innovations. 
So summing up the year, 2014 was a period of great accomplishment for the Under Armour team and a great example of what's possible when we're successfully anticipating the needs of our consumer. 
Our focus in 2015, as it has been since Under Armour's inception, is on making all athletes better and going well beyond their expectations. That philosophy enables us to focus on what is written on the whiteboard in my office above everything else, ""Do not forget to sell shirts and shoes."" That is job 1 for our team in 2015 and will always be the foundation on which we grow the Under Armour brand's global footprint. 
That being said, I want to share a vision now and provide some color on how the acquisitions we announced earlier today accomplished 2 very important things: first, the immediate scale we gained by adding Endomondo and MyFitnessPal to the MapMyFitness and UA Record platform, positioning Under Armour as the world's largest digital health and fitness community; and second, how this investment will enable us to better anticipate our consumers' needs, drive more informed purchase decisions and authentically build brand loyalty by helping our consumers lead a healthy life. 
So first, the facts. Early last month, we purchased Endomondo, a Copenhagen-based company that has built one of the largest global connected fitness communities. With approximately 20 million registered users, most of whom live in Europe, Endomondo provides the perfect strategic complement to the activity and workout tracking we currently have in our existing digital platform of MapMyFitness and UA Record. 
And with today's announcement to acquire MyFitnessPal, we have firmly established our Connected Fitness platform as the leading provider of everything an athlete needs to live a healthier lifestyle. Based in San Francisco, MyFitnessPal is the leading resource for healthy living and nutrition, with over 80 million registered users and world-class nutritional resources. By bringing this established leader into our Connected Fitness platform, we can offer the full suite of information, activity and workout tracking, as well as nutritional expertise, to truly make all athletes better. 
So what have we bought and, more importantly, why? For starters, with MyFitnessPal and Endomondo added to our existing platform, we now have the world's largest digital health and fitness community, with a combined audience among all our platforms of over 120 million unique people. For perspective, there are approximately 20 digital communities in the world with more than 100 million members, so the first thing to note is the sheer scale that we now bring to bear. 
To give you a sense of that scale, 1 out of every 5 people in the United States has downloaded one of the apps in our platform. Collectively, the 3 sites grew 46% last year, adding 40 million members, and we continue to add over 100,000 registered users every day. We have great geographic balance, with 57% of our 120 million registered users in North America and the balance outside the United States. We also have 72 million women registered on our platform, providing another great opportunity for us to grow our brand presence with both female athletes and athletic females. 
Second, owning the world's largest digital health and fitness platform provides an incredibly unique opportunity for Under Armour to build a different type of relationship with our consumer over the long term. Health and fitness is a part of your life from childhood onward, and our goal in aggregating these 3 platforms is to make you better by making your health and fitness really easy to understand. The truth is that you know more about how your car is performing than your own body, and we see the potential to inform and inspire our consumer through these assets and its impact on our ability to sells shirts and shoes as unparalleled in our industry. 
We've built a $3 billion business by making great product and telling great stories, but there's nothing that says we must follow our competitor's playbook, especially when the way consumers digest media and make their purchase decisions is undergoing such dramatic shifts. The net result of this shift is that our consumer is demanding more from athletic brands than just making shirts and shoes. We embrace those higher expectations and believe these investments position us better than anyone in our industry to truly make all athletes better. 
At the end of the day, the math is pretty simple. The more active someone is, the more likely they are to buy athletic apparel and footwear. And for the month of January, the 4 sites in our Connected Fitness platform, MapMyFitness, Endomondo, MyFitnessPal and UA Record, recorded more than 100 million workouts and added 4.2 million new unique users. 
So how did we come to the decision to invest in these communities and strategically add another tool in how we interact with our consumer? This chapter in the Under Armour story started at the NFL Combine in 2011 where we debuted the Armour39, the first performance apparel that incorporated biometric measurements and was used to track the performance of top NFL prospects. We saw the potential in measuring performance and how our consumers could benefit from it. 
At the same time, a lot of different trackers and wearable technology started to hit the market, and we were quick to realize that our core competencies lied in making shirts and shoes and understanding how to best incorporate technology to improve athletes' lives. We also realized that for Under Armour, it wasn't as much about the hardware, as there would always be someone else working in a lab or a garage, someone who might crack the code on the next great device and that we could create the most value by working closely with partners who understood the power of the Under Armour brand and our knowledge of the athlete. 
At the same time, we started to understand that the true value for an athletic brand was actually in the community. And that crystallized for us when we started the conversion with Robin Thurston that led us to acquiring MapMyFitness in December of 2013. 
As we started working with Rob and his team in Austin, Texas, it only reinforced our belief that the value is in the community, especially one where the user is not just looking at their friends' pictures, but providing you with data that empowers you to come back to them with an informed point of view to help improve their health and fitness. We understood that there was tremendous value in becoming that trusted brand and to set out to assemble all the elements that would enable Under Armour to be the one place to access all of that information. 
From a geographic view, Endomondo was the obvious choice to complement MapMyFitness. Their community of 20 million users, most of whom are based in Europe, provides a great opportunity for us to learn from and expands our ability to interact with the consumer who is still relatively new to us. 
With MyFitnessPal, their expertise in the nutritional space positions us to have a complete picture of our athletes and rounds out the data from which we'll be able to provide the most informed and personalized input on our users' health and fitness. 
So how will all this come together? All of the 3 existing platforms, MapMyFitness, Endomondo and MyFitnessPal, will live as distinct platforms under the Under Armour Connected Fitness banner. But we have a longer-term point of view and vision, and it's found in UA Record, the community we launched last month at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. 
Over time, we believe UA Record will eventually become the daily destination dashboard, aggregating all you want to know about your general fitness, sleep, steps, activity level and yes, nutrition. We know that we are on the verge of remarkable developments in wearable technology, some of which are being worked on across the street in our own innovation lab right now. And our recently announced partnership with HTC will enable us to help to develop statement-level product that demonstrates the full capabilities of UA Record. But by focusing on an open platform and being device agnostic, we believe we are the best positioned among all athletic brands to benefit from the evolution of wearables. 
So let me sum up what this investment will do for Under Armour and why we believe it's critical to our ability to sell shirts and shoes going forward. Everything about our consumer is rapidly evolving, the way they digest media, what influences their purchase decisions, how and where they buy things. We see that every day in our own business. 
For example, this past December, we did 77% more E-Commerce business on a mobile device than we did in December of just the year prior in 2013. Brands that do not evolve, that do not offer their consumers something more than a product will be hard for us to compete in 2015 and beyond. We fully understand the massive shift in how our consumer will intersect with their favorite brands, and these acquisitions firmly position us on the leading-edge of that new paradigm. 
With the world's largest digital health and fitness community, we now have a unique opportunity to build equity and consumer loyalty over the long term. We will be able to provide the most complete measure of a person's health and fitness and become the trusted brand that will help drive not only E-Commerce but also long-term value for our shareholders. 
Are we ready for this next step? Two years ago, I would have had to answer no. But since that time, we have assembled an incredible pool of talent led by 3 entrepreneurs who literally helped create the entire category of Connected Fitness: Robin Thurston, the Founder of MapMyFitness; Mette Lykke, the Founder and CEO of Endomondo; and Mike Lee, the Founder and CEO of MyFitnessPal. Prior to the MapMyFitness acquisition, we had 4 engineers working in our digital team. With the 2 acquisitions announced today, that number is now over 300. 
More important than the sheer numbers, we now have 3 of the best minds in the space all adept at navigating in a rapidly shifting market and all with extensive experience understanding the needs of their communities. Robin is going to run our overall Connected Fitness business. And reporting to him will be Mette, who will drive our International business and initiatives; and Mike Lee, who will be running our North American business. This breadth of experience will enable our core product leadership to focus on the business of selling shirts and shoes as we build out this new growth platform that will position Under Armour at the center of the world's health and fitness activities for years and years to come. 
And with that, I'll hand it over to Brad."

I'd now like to spend some time discussing our fourth quarter and full year 2014 financial results, followed by updated outlook for 2015. 
Our net revenues for the fourth quarter of 2014 increased 31% to $895 million. For the full year, net revenues increased 32% to $3.08 billion, which compared to our most recent full year guidance of $3.03 billion. As Kevin outlined, this $3 billion milestone was comprised of strong results across all of our growth drivers, with Apparel up 30%; Direct-to-Consumer, up 32%; Footwear, up 44%; and International, up 96%. 
Focusing on the fourth quarter, we grew Apparel category 30% to $708 million compared to $546 million in the prior year's quarter. Similar to the third quarter, our platform innovations of Storm, ColdGear Infrared and Charged Cotton were key volume drivers across the key category, while new innovation like this year's MagZip showcased our ongoing ability to bring value to the consumer. Areas of particular strength in Apparel include training, golf, outdoor and Studio. 
Fourth quarter Footwear net revenues increased 55% to $86 million from $55 million in the prior year, representing approximately 10% of net revenues for the period. We continue to see success in running Footwear across a broader price spectrum, including the $100 SpeedForm Apollo driving market share gains within our core sporting goods distribution. Basketball also continued to gain momentum, most notably around the $125 ClutchFit Drive. These categories, along with our ongoing strength in areas such as cleated and slide, position Under Armour as the #2 overall footwear brand in some of our top wholesale accounts in 2014. 
Our Accessories net revenues during the fourth quarter increased 22% to $79 million from $65 million last year. Growth during the quarter was primarily driven by headwear offerings and gloves. 
Our global Direct-to-Consumer net revenues increased 27% for the quarter, representing approximately 38% of net revenues. 
Within North America, our Factory House square footage grew 17% year-over-year. This growth reflects the total of 125 Factory House stores at the end of the year, up 7% from the end of 2013, as well as the upsizing of 14 existing locations during the year. On the full-price side, we remained at 5 Brand House stores in North America. 
In our E-Commerce channel, where we continue to see a migration of traffic from desktop to mobile devices, we were encouraged by the conversion improvements from our new responsive site launched at the end of September. We also followed up our third quarter launches of local E-Commerce sites in the U.K., Germany and France, with a fourth quarter debut of our site in Singapore, which is our first site in Southeast Asia. 
International net revenues increased 123% to $82 million in the fourth quarter and represented 9% of total net revenues. In the EMEA region, we saw continued strength in our 3 key markets in Europe, the U.K., Germany and France, and commenced our new distributor agreement covering the Middle East. In Asia Pacific, we remain focused on accelerating growth at both wholesale accounts and distributors, including partner store openings throughout Greater China and Southeast Asia. Finally, in Latin America, our business benefited from the early 2014 conversion of our Mexico distributor to an Under Armour subsidiary and our market expansions into Brazil and Chile. This included our first South American Brand House Store, which opened in Santiago, Chile during the fourth quarter. 
Moving on to margins. Fourth quarter gross margins contracted 140 basis points to 49.9% compared with 51.3% in the prior year's quarter. Three primary factors contributed to this performance during the quarter. First, as discussed in our prior call, our sales mix adversely impacted gross margins by approximately 90 basis points for the period, primarily reflecting a higher mix of International net revenues, including the introduction of new lower-margin distributor businesses during the fourth quarter. Second, the strengthening of U.S. dollar negatively impacted gross margins by approximately 20 basis points for the period. And finally, higher freight costs to better meet consumer demand negatively impacted gross margins by approximately 20 basis points in the period. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues leveraged 330 basis points to 33.6% in the fourth quarter of 2014 from 36.9% in the prior year's period. As a reminder, we incurred higher incentive compensation expenses in last year's fourth quarter, which was a primary contributor of leverage in each of our 4 SG&A buckets. 
Additional SG&A details are as follows. First, marketing costs decreased to 8.4% of net revenues for the quarter from 8.9% in the prior year period. Second, selling cost decreased to 11% of net revenues for the quarter from 11.6% in the prior year period. Third, product innovation and supply chain cost decreased to 8.4% of net revenues for the quarter from 9% in the prior year period. And finally, corporate services decreased to 5.8% of net revenues for the quarter from 7.4% in the prior period, inclusive of closing costs for the MapMyFitness acquisition in the prior year period. 
Operating income for the fourth quarter increased 49% to $146 million compared with $98 million in the prior year period. For the full year, operating income increased 34% to $354 million compared to our most recent guidance of $348 million. 
Operating margin expanded 190 basis points during the quarter to 16.3% compared to 14.4% in the prior year period.  For the full year, operating margin expanded 10 basis points to 11.5% compared to 11.4% in 2013. 
Interest and other expense for the fourth quarter increased to $4 million compared with $1 million in the prior year period, primarily reflecting the negative impact of foreign currency, along with increased interest expense from our additional term debt. 
Our fourth quarter tax rate of 38.3% was unfavorable to the 34% rate last year, primarily driven by the timing of a state tax credit received in the fourth quarter of 2013. Our full year effective tax rate of 39.2% was higher than the 37.8% rate in 2013, primarily due to increased international investments and the lapping of the state tax credit. 
Our fourth quarter net income increased 37% to $88 million compared to $64 million in the prior year period. 
Diluted earnings per share increased 35% to $0.40 compared to $0.30 in the prior year period. Full year diluted earnings per share increased 27% to $0.95 compared to $0.75 in 2013. 
On the balance sheet, total cash and cash equivalents at year-end increased 71% to $593 million compared with $347 million at December 31, 2013. Total debt increased to $284 million from $153 million at December 31, 2013. Both our cash and debt positions reflect an additional $100 million term loan drawn during the fourth quarter used primarily for the closing on the $85 million Endomondo acquisition in early January. 
Inventory at year-end increased 14% to $537 million compared to $469 million at December 31, 2013. 
Looking at our cash flows. Our investment and capital expenditures was approximately $59 million for the fourth quarter and approximately $145 million for 2014. 
Now moving on to 2015. We have 3 factors driving our updated outlook: First, the impact of the 2 new Connected Fitness businesses we are acquiring; second, the negative impact of the strengthening dollar on our International results; and third, the continued strength of our existing business. 
Starting with revenues. We are maintaining our prior guidance of approximately 22% net revenue growth. It should be noted this is off of a higher number compared to 3 months ago as we exceeded our most recent 2014 target by nearly $55 million. This growth rate takes into account the strengthening of the U.S. dollar over the past 90 days, which has negatively impacted our 2015 net revenues forecast by approximately 1 percentage point from our prior guidance. However, revenues from the Connected Fitness acquisitions are expected to largely offset this currency impact. 
As stated in our previous guidance, we expect solid growth across all of our growth drivers led by continued outperformance in our Footwear and International businesses. We expect the year-over-year growth rates across each of the quarters in 2015 to be relatively consistent, except for the fourth quarter where we will be lapping strong International growth, including new market entries. 
Now moving on to operating income. We are now planning 2015 operating income in the range of $397 million to $407 million, representing growth of 12% to 15%. This change from our prior guidance of operating income growth of 22% is largely due to the impact of our 2 Connected Fitness acquisitions. We estimate 90 basis points of operating margin dilution from these acquisitions, mostly within SG&A, offset with a slight gross margin benefit. 
There are 3 components of this. First, onetime deal-closing costs recorded in the first quarter are expected to impact the full year by approximately 20 basis points. Second, operating losses from the operations of the 2 businesses we are acquiring are expected to impact the full year by approximately 40 basis points. And third, the intangible assets generated from the acquisitions will result in noncash amortization charges, which are expected to impact the full year by approximately 30 basis points. 
The recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar also has had a negative impact on our 2015 operating income guidance, specifically in our gross margin line as we purchase the majority of our inventory for our International businesses in U.S. dollars. This has created an incremental 50 basis point impact to operating margin just from the time of our prior guidance. We anticipate to offset this currency impact through targeted improvements in gross margin and SG&A. Our current guidance assumes no further significant strengthening of the U.S. dollar compared to current exchange rates. 
From a gross margin standpoint, we believe we can still generate a modest improvement from last year's 49% level despite foreign currency headwinds given the ongoing supply chain opportunities as the year progresses. Relative to timing, we expect this improvement to be generally consistent throughout the year. 
On SG&A, we expect expense deleverage mainly driven by the Connected Fitness acquisitions. The rate of SG&A expense deleverage is expected to gradually ease throughout the year from approximately 200 basis points deleveraged during the first quarter. 
Factors weighing on expenses during the first quarter include higher year-over-year marketing expenses to support our first Brand Holiday of 2015, as well as the onetime deal closing cost for the Connected Fitness acquisitions. Below the operating line, we expect higher year-over-year interest expense for the funding of our Connected Fitness acquisitions. We anticipate funding these acquisitions through cash on hand and expanded term loan and revolving credit facility. 
The full year effective tax rate is now expected to be slightly higher than our 2014 effective rate of 39.2%. The impact of the strong dollar on our International result is negatively impacting our 2015 effective tax rate in excess of 100 basis points.  
Our 2015 fully diluted share count is expected to be approximately $220 million. 
Finally, as we indicated with our preliminary 2015 guidance in October, we expect elevated capital expenditures during the year. Part of this acceleration includes combined investments of approximately $90 million for our new domestic distribution center and the expansion of our corporate headquarters in Baltimore. We also expect elevated capital expenditures tied to our global retail expansion. In total, we are currently planning 2015 capital expenditures in the range of $280 million to $290 million. 
In conclusion, 2015 has developed into an important investment year for our company as we create the world's largest digital health and fitness community. We believe these investments will enhance and support our growth drivers and drive long-term value for our shareholders. Even after factoring in the dilutive impact on 2015, we believe that our forward 3-year operating income CAGR through 2017 will be in line with the 22% growth rate level that we provided in our prior 2015 guidance. We will provide specific long-term guidance at our Investor Day targeted for September 16 of this year.

Philosophy for us a few years ago was what can we do to just sell more product over $100, and that's not as easy as it's said. And so we've had to learn that the hard way. But I think what you've seen, and now we're in our 10th year of making shoes, our 8th year of selling shoes, that we've actually gotten pretty good at it and we can drive premium pricing. It's something that's been familiar to us in apparel for a very long time. So I think that we're thoughtful and there's a lot of factors at play with oil and a few other things that are still working their way through the system. But we're not seeing, number one, a great squeeze on the manufacturing prices that we're not enjoying any advantages just yet. And we are feeling some of these currency pinches, but I think everybody's trying to figure out which way is up with that. At the end of the day, I'm not sure it's going to be any global or international market that'll be dictating what the price for Under Armour is. It's going to be the relationship that we have with the consumer. And I think that we'll continue to drive that and echo that in everything we do from our branding, our marketing and, frankly, highlighted today with the 2 acquisitions that we announced about a deeper and better understanding of that consumer."

On the pricing side, obviously, with the strengthening U.S. dollar, we'll look at the ability to increase prices potentially on the International businesses. But obviously, that's probably more of a 2016 conversation at this point. And the teams are working through the impact of a strengthening dollar and how that'll help on pricing on the International front. And on the costing side, kind of the same time frame for the most part is we're about a year ahead of the selling season in locking in fabric pricing. So the locking in of our Spring/Summer '15 product, and obviously, our Fall/Winter '15 product, too, really occurred 1 year to 8 months ago to some degree when the oil prices were still elevated. So with oil prices coming down, that is one of the input costs, obviously, that impact our costs. We're locking in Spring/Summer '16 fabric pricing today, and we'll be locking in Fall/Winter '16 over the course of the next 6 months. I think we've a better opportunity in 2016 both from a pricing perspective to the consumer and also the costing perspective from the vendor."

But let me just start with, first of all, why we thought that we could do this. The basic reason is because, frankly, our business and our brand have never been stronger. 19 consecutive quarters, 20-plus percent top line growth, including the last 5 of which we delivered over 30%. The year that we had in 2014, we saw strength across the business from, again, a core Apparel business that grew by $0.5 billion, our Footwear businesses that grew 44%, our International business grew 96%, just to name a few of them. And frankly, at the end of the day, as we said, and you've heard me say, in my whiteboard, there sit lots of slogans, things that say like, ""Overpromise and deliver,"" and ""Dictate the tempo"" and ""Walk with a purpose."" And the one note that's written in red very simply says, ""Don't forget to sell shirts and shoes."" The reason that we did what we did today was because we believe ultimately this will help us sell more shirts and shoes and reach more athletes to make them better. So what we really did. This exercise began for us a little more than a year ago in December '13 when we announced the acquisition of MapMyFitness and we paid $150 million for them. It really helped us establish a beachhead in digital. And as I said, I think, in my script, you heard me talk about how we didn't really have a presence. I mean, combined between our internal Connected Fitness team and our E-Commerce team, we had less than 50 people in that group. And today, we have roughly 400 people in the group, and we'll add another 100 this year. So the world of digital, and again, some of the anecdotes that lead to that thinking, and you heard me give the stat about 77% more people going to mobile, we also had another stat for you. We had 11% of our orders on Cyber Monday this year we saw come -- or last year we saw come across mobile devices. And in just 1 year in 2014, the same day, apples-to-apples, that number has grown to 27% of people that placed orders at ua.com or on mobile devices. So we recognize that having relations there is incredibly important. With this acquisition though, the one thing that we learned was about having additional functionality was we knew what we had dealing with Robin and the team over the last 12, 13 months. But also, we realized what we didn't have. If our ultimate goal was to build a complete picture of the athlete, there were 2 things that we're missing: number one, we have an incredibly North American outlook, and so global scale was something that we were looking for; and secondly, something that we thought would be much easier for us to buy than to try to build was the idea of nutritional expertise. In announcing the purchase of these, 2 of the world's leading platforms, Endomondo in Copenhagen and MyFitnessPal in San Francisco, I mean, in one fell swoop, we created the world's largest connected health and fitness community with 120 million unique members and the largest by a factor of 2 and arguably 3. So there is no real person in second place; that we've basically aggregated this community all at once. And just as importantly, it's growing at over 100,000 people a day. And just a little fact. In January, it's obviously a big month, particularly for people as they start thinking about health and wellness and measuring themselves. We average 136,000 people joining and registering every single day, totaling 4.2 million people in the 31 days of January. And just as impressively, as you heard me mention, over 100 million workouts were logged, 100 million workouts. And so when you talk about the one thing that we emphatically know is that the more someone exercises, the more that they work out, it's just logical that the more Apparel and Footwear they are going to ultimately buy. The mission that we have says, ""Let's make athletes better."" And with that information, people choose to share with our Connected Fitness platforms, we think it creates piece of the puzzle that's going to allow us to have that total complete picture of the athlete, how much they're exercising, how much they're sleeping, how much activity they have, what they're putting in their body and what their nutrition habits are. So with all of that, it basically comes down to why we did it and really what it means for Under Armour. The thing that as I saw it -- and look, this was not an easy decision. And as we talked about this, we debated this heavily internally, had lots of conversations, and at the end of today, we kept coming back to the same thing, is that this will help drive our core business. This will help with our 5 core growth drivers. And frankly, the idea of standing here and looking and saying, ""Should we do it or not?"" To me, it felt incredibly obvious. It reminded me of when I made that first stretchy T-shirt and looking around and saying, ""Has anybody ever done anything like this and why is everyone is still wearing a short-sleeved cotton tee in the summer and a long-sleeved cotton tee in the winter?"" And I look and say, ""No one has aggregated and put all of these pieces together."" And we don't see anything coming. So the ability we have was incredibly new. But while I saw this really white space with what we're doing making T-shirts, the opportunity that we have here is a bit different just because there's so much energy and excitement around wearables and biometric measurement. But the surprise that I have is that, frankly, no one is leading or adjusting what we are today, the power of a truly connected fitness community. There's this massive shift that's happening on where the consumers are interacting with their favorite brands as the world goes digital, and we don't see anyone appropriately addressing the needs of consumers. So now, when you look and just think about what's happening, and frankly, for myself coming back from CES, in 2009, there were roughly 1 billion ""connected things"" in the planet. An estimate, depending on who you listen to, by 2020, that number will be somewhere between 25 billion to 50 billion. So who does the best job of synthesizing that data and making it easier for the consumer to understand are the ones that will win. Activity, sleep, exercise, nutrition, and that's the place where we think that we can win, particularly with our UA Record dashboard. And again, the vision there is to become the daily dashboard that people check, the same way you check your bank balance, the same way you check the weather is the same way that you get an update on the most important aspect in your life, your own personal health. So finally, this convergence that we see happening, the digitization of kids as we look and we talk to the people and see that they've forgotten about no one's looking and wondering what's happening in the newspaper. If you have one device that a 20-year-old cannot live with today, right, it is not a magazine in print, it is -- without question, it is a handheld device. And what we see is with the acceleration of wearables and what's happening there, that we feel like we are positioned squarely in the center of what is supposed to happen. Community and platform is a right play, and because of the acquisitions that began December '13, we're sitting in the middle of it. This aggregation provides us with the opportunity to build a long and sustainable relationship with our consumer, and ultimately, we think we're going to sell a lot more shirts and shoes. That would be -- I was waiting for that question, Omar, so thank you."

Walk in to any Cabela's, Bass Pro Shop, and the Under Armour presence is overwhelming. And first of all, as I dive into the question on Outdoor, I think just given a nod, I think, to the brand that's been established with the elasticity that we demonstrate with the same company that can come out with probably one of the most talked about commercials of 2014 featuring Misty Copeland and Gisele in our Women's business for the I WILL WHAT I WANT campaign is frankly the same company that has a relationship with Willie from Duck Dynasty. And when you walk in and you see what we have in the Outdoor and the fishing and the mountain business, there is a need for a brand like Under Armour. And I think we're continuing to innovate. We're fresh off the Outdoor Retailer Show out in Salt Lake, and amongst other things, we won best product, most innovative product for a new shoe that we have coming out called the Fat Tire shoe. It's a partnership that we did with Michelin, and it puts us against squarely with a shoe that's fashioned, if you've seen those big, oversized bikes that ride on snow or can ride on sand. And I think it's just another approach that we're taking from a very consumer-centric approach that demonstrates we know what we're doing. From a ability for win there, you're going to start seeing our outerwear, which we've been making, frankly, for the last 7 and 8 years. And among that time, we've, of course, built a better relationship with the consumer, understanding them, but we've also built a better relationship with the factories, building better products, taking and incorporating the ethos, the essence that is Under Armour, that makes us special on an athletic playing field, makes us just as special on a ski mountain, just as special in the woods and just as special on a saltwater flat fishing boat. So I think what you're seeing from us is that what gives us the greatest elasticity is the ability to apply the principles that make something so incredibly Under Armour and apply it to a market that makes sense. We have an authentic team here. We have it on the grassroots side. We have it on the product side especially. We have it on the marketing side. And I think that we see a great opportunity with a business now that's clearly well over $300 million for us that surprises people when they hear that number, and frankly, growing north of our internal -- or external growth rate as a company, too. So we see great upside there, and frankly, we think we can be a player in the Outdoor space for a long time to come, and we think that we've got a good relationship now that just going to keep getting better and better."

And that really included a lot of new launches into new markets like Brazil, Chile, Southeast Asia and the Middle East, most of those launches happening more from the middle to the back half of the year. So although we still anticipate very, very strong growth in our International businesses, we'll be comping those market entries year-over-year. In addition, on the International side, the foreign currency, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, I mentioned in my prepared remarks the 1% decline in revenue just from the last 90 days' activity in foreign currency. For the full year, it's a 2 percentage point growth [ph] with the strengthening dollar full year, year-over-year for us. So if you take both of those factors, the International business comping those market launches and the impact of the strengthening dollar, you're probably at more than half of the walk down from 32% to 22%. On the North America side, obviously, we have this planned deceleration of our Factory House growth we've been planning for over the course of the last few years. We talked about adding less new doors and focus more on square footage growth. So although we are focusing on square footage growth, that square footage growth year-over-year, as you saw in Q4, also it declined in '14 from '13, it will be declining throughout 2015 compared to 2014 also. So that's another factor that's really kind of driving us down. And on the wholesale side, I've always been pretty clear, and I'm going to take a look at the information I have today when we give our guidance and forecast going forward. And obviously, we have our Q4 results in, but the data point that I don't have today for the back half of '15 is all of our bookings and orders on the wholesale side, specifically again in our largest business, which is North America wholesale, don't have those bookings in for a good part of the back half of the year, especially the fourth quarter. So obviously, taking a cautious approach to our forecast and from that aspect based on the fact that we don't have that data in place right now."

And obviously, as we innovate, those are mostly coming in at premium price points when we innovate. So that will definitely have a positive impact on our ASPs as we get to the back half of the year and continue to innovate. But obviously, our price point increase over the course of the last few seasons has been kind of in the low to mid-single digit range. So our story is growth. It's unit growth. It's less about ASP growth. That ASP growth is important from an innovation perspective for us, but our brand's all about unit growth."

So I think, first of all, what we're doing on a global basis right now is pretty extraordinary. We're up 123% in the quarter, 96% for the full year, and it's the first year where we saw Europe surpass $100 million. And really hats off to our team and particularly Matt Shearer, who was there before who we pulled out of our Canadian business and sent over there to really get the shift right and which was a place that we took a lot of hits in Europe for a long time before we figured out how to make things happen. And we've really took one of our own who built an amazing $100-plus million business in Canada and asked him to do the same thing in Europe and then handed the reins in the last 8 months or so to an industry professional, a guy named Chris Bate, who's been -- we've got the leadership established and in place. But there's a lot of things that are at play there. So of course, first and foremost is leadership. But I really like the assets that we've been signing and frankly, the global perspective that we've taken. Things like Tottenham Hotspur and being in the EPL has been really important for us and continuing to double down with athletes and with assets on the outside of being relevant to that consumer. But like anything, Europe does not happen overnight. It takes a little bit longer. And so as we sit here in our, I guess, ninth year doing business over there, it's been a long run. What we're seeing though is the partnerships that we have on the wholesale side, a lot of really good things that have been going on. Some of the milestones, again, we said surpass the $100 million, it's actually north of $130 million in Europe in '14. And the plans that we have are even to breakeven for the first time in Europe. We took some -- Europe was difficult for a very long time. So going from not having that negative is actually -- to being a breakeven and actually looking and having a line of sight to making money is incredibly powerful for us. The aided and unaided brand awareness that we have basically tripled year-over-year in key markets like the U.K. and Germany. The launch of our E-Commerce site for the first time in the U.K. made a big deal. Same thing in Germany, same thing in France, and then we expect to add the Netherlands and to the E.U. in 2015. And our market focus provided visibility, the opportunity to drive deep account connections. We've been in some of the right places. We still have opportunity to go from a wholesale standpoint. It's a difficult wholesale environment to say the least in Europe, but we see ourselves really driving and moving. And frankly, the partnership that we felt from people is that we're now getting recognized, is that Under Armour is an incredibly key brand to have in your store and you cannot live without us. And frankly, what we recognize is that we can't live without them either, which is a very healthy relationship and one that we probably share in our wholesale environment here in the United States. So we're looking forward to some of those new partnerships we have. But that global story doesn't stop at the borders of Europe either. The good news is that what Charlie and our team in the International group have done are really driving Under Armour toward that vision of someday we expect in order to find ourselves with a global brand, that definition means that more than half of our revenues must come from outside of our home country. So we got a shot and we love the execution that our team has taken to making that happen. And we've got Andy Murray now, finalist for the Australian Open, so it's a good Scott on our team."

So Latin America was really -- it began as Charlie's wheelhouse for us, but we're looking at these markets and things that we thought would be nice countries to do business in. We're now looking at and saying, ""What's our roadmap to $100 million?"" Places like Mexico, Brazil and Chile, where it begins, as always, with great, great leadership. But in Brazil right now, we've got over 100 branded spaces that we opened in 2014. We'll have more than 250 spaces in 2015. Obviously, the energy and excitement with the Olympics coming there next year is going to be a big deal. Mexico continues to move for us. We've got a new master franchise agreement that's going to magnify our distribution approach that we have there, big assets like Toluca and Cruz Azul and the Mexican football league there. And then in Chile, where we announced -- probably we felt like it was a bit premature, but Colo-Colo, which is one of the top football clubs in Chile, we opened our first Brand House in the fourth quarter and it's doing incredibly bigger than we thought it would do. China is -- when we've talked about store growth, opening over 100 stores, the majority of those stores will actually come out of China and finding -- and many of them partner run, but it's not like it makes a difference as we expand from just 2 cities to more than 10 cities across China. We want to get into the roots of the country, and we want to make sure that they understand our authenticity and our commitment to China. But again, China from where it was when we launched in 2008, 2009, China, again, is going to be another International breakeven story for us. So the line of sight that we have toward making money in global markets is something. It's incredibly time-consuming. It's an incredible amount of sacrifice, money, energy, all those things. But we have an International team that is building out and giving us that global perspective as a company. The new Southeast Asia distribution agreement that we came to as well, we have this terrific partners based out of Singapore that have been really incredible, markets that you didn't think of. And one of the imagery we show when we talk about global growth is when we opened a roughly 2,000 square foot store, 200 square meter store in downtown Manila in the Philippines, and there's 700-plus people waiting in line to get into it. So we're seeing that there's a pull and there's an absolute demand for our brand. And throughout Asia, our partners in Japan continue to move and grow. Currency has been a struggle with them, but on an apples-to-apples basis, their business is incredibly healthy and growing at a real rate. And the last thing I'd like to say just about International growth and expansion and tying it back to the announcements that we made today, with frankly 52 million people outside of North America that now have Under Armour's Connected Fitness, one of our Connected Fitness platforms on their mobile, their digital device, it's the opportunity for us to have a different type of introduction with this consumer. It's a different type of handshake that we're going to introduce the Under Armour brand to them. And we think we can do it an incredibly digital way, but we think it's going to give us the opportunity to tell an incredibly complete story of who we are and just as importantly, where this brand is headed. So a lot of energy and excitement around what's happening with Under Armour on a global basis, to the point where people here are knocking on my door and saying, ""I want to -- can I go move to Australia? Can I move to China? Can I move to these other markets?"" And so I think it's a lot of energy and excitement, and I think that vision of painting a global brand is something that we expect to bring to life."

So a lot of our initiatives are focused on things in the supply chain. So the fact that the dollar strengthened pretty significantly here in the last 60 days, really, I think gives us some opportunities potentially within the supply chain to take advantage of some of that, especially towards the back half of this year. Obviously, the front half of this year is locked in. So part of that -- part of the initiative there is to look at ways to get some money out of the supply chain because of the strengthening dollar. Obviously, you kind of have some offsets in SG&A with the strengthening dollar, too, in the International business from a cost perspective, too that just kind of come naturally. And there's just things within SG&A itself. As we did the acquisitions, there are some things that made sense to scale back a little bit because we felt the investment in the acquisitions was a complementary thing to be doing to some of the things that we're planning on doing initially anyway, so some synergies there to some degree. So although it seems like big items there to offset, most of them are pretty natural because of the strengthening dollar, some synergies in the acquisitions that we're doing compared to some other investments we were going to make and some things naturally true [ph] just in SG&A made sense for us to kind of go after, again, just from a bottom line perspective."

But again, if you think about our overall growth as a company in 2014 of 32% and our International growth of 96%, there's an even 3x number basically there of International versus overall company growth. Obviously, as we talked about, again, lapping some of those market entries last year, again, the impact of foreign currencies on International revenues, that growth rate will come down much more. So instead of a 3x number, it might look more like a 2x number or something like that. But again, I'm painting you more directionally here versus giving you an exact number. On the DTC side, the real change here is going to be on the Factory House side. That real change is, again, planned business. We've been talking all along the last couple of years of the ability to really focus more on our Brand House initiatives and our E-Commerce business as growth drivers and really planning on taking our especially North America Factory House growth down as we started to limit our new door growth and focus on square footage growth. So I think that's going to be a piece that if you look at DTC growing 32% this year, you would expect -- with Factory House being the largest portion of that, you would expect that growth rate to come below 30% to some degree."

And first of all, that starts with my original partner, Kip Fulks, who's been driving Footwear for the last several years. And Kip is really -- he's one of the -- he's the heart and soul of this company, and I think what we're always looking for is for that heart and soul to come out through our products. It's something that we've been proud of in our Apparel but something I think that the consumer is seeing come out and really articulate in the voice of our Footwear product, too. So a lot of big stories, a lot of good things to build on. I mean, launching the SpeedForm platform is one of the leading launches that we had and best debut, Runner's World, and I think a lot of accolades that made us all incredibly proud of what we did last year. The Highlight Cleat, I feel like we always get caught up talking about our success in cleats, but that is really a big deal. From where we began, all the way back in 2006 'til today, we are clearly the #2 player in the market with somewhere in the mid-30s in terms of market share, and our line of sight is being the #1 football cleat in America. And we say that from the standpoint of if it bleeds, we can kill it. And what we heard was that we never have the ability to be successful in these markets, we could never, we could never, and all we've done is come back with better product every single year, winning more consumers that are choosing our brand. So what you're seeing happen and play out in our longest standing business in Footwear was these American football cleats. It's happening in the same way in baseball cleats. It's happening the same way in training shoes, in running shoes and in basketball shoes right now. So the big place that we're looking for is -- again, one thing I definitely want to say is that when it comes to Footwear, we have a solid footwear company. I mean, with the growth that we saw, the 44% growth that we saw, we're over $400 million today and growing at an incredibly healthy pace, we're the #2 market share in overall footwear at several of our key accounts. So there are lots of places around this country, and frankly, places we're working on around the world that Under Armour is absolutely winning in Footwear. And then also things like anecdotally doubling our basketball footwear business this season led by things like that ClutchFit Drive that you saw and 3 of the teams we have in the top 25 in the AP men's poll and I think 3 of the top 5 in the women's AP poll as well. So Under Armour makes great quality shoes. And especially when you talk about things like basketball, we have the leading vote getter by 40,000 votes for the MVP -- for the NBA All-Star game. Like Stephen Curry has been an unbelievable human being to begin with, but his play on a court is something that's just flat out inspirational. So we're incredibly proud of what that means. In addition with Kip, we talked about Peter joining the team. So you're just bringing -- you're bringing a professional in. You're bringing an absolute vet who comes in, who's basically seen the big movie before and someone who could help us as we start guiding ourselves through that where the law of big numbers starts laying in. And I don't see the growth rates slowing in Footwear, and I'll temper myself when I say that. But I think that we have an opportunity. As impressive as 44% is, I'd say that our opportunity is still much, much larger than that. In 2014 alone, we added 60 teammates to our team. We really reinforced our office in Portland and some -- a place that we'll continue to add talent and bring people toward, as well as bringing Peter Ruppe in as our new SVP of Footwear. The 25 years of industry experience that Peter brings is something that complements, really, the brand knowledge that Kip has, plus the expertise that we've built here. And beyond that, just a really great team and a really positive energy in Under Armour Footwear. So with cleated, we'll continue to lead and attack there. Football, baseball, all of these categories. SpeedForm is actually a product in a platform that we're taking in to our cleated businesses as a whole. The highlight continues to be the top-selling premium product sold at key accounts like Eastbay and frankly places where kids shop. You go to a football field, and you'll find our products showing up there. Our running is really the next chapter for us. It's a place that we really focus. The SpeedForm, that debut last year was pretty impressive. The Gemini, what you'll hear from people, it's not only the best running shoe that Under Armour has ever built, it could be one of the best running shoes ever. It is that good of a product that at $130, we're really reinforcing ourselves, I think, as a premium player. And what we're seeing from some of the -- especially the key accounts that we have in the run specialty shop getting refills and things that the kind of reaction we haven't had from Under Armour in a very long time. Basketball, we mentioned it. Stephen is a signature shoe, kind of an individual. And as I said in my script earlier, that Stephen will be -- we'll be featuring him next weekend at the NBA All-Star game where we're launching a new commercial of the new Stephen Curry One, a lot of energy and expectation around that. And I think the campaign is one of the best that we've done in our history. And then, as I mentioned on an earlier question as well, like Footwear isn't something that stops at sporting goods either. What we're doing in the Outdoor space, our Outdoor Footwear line is one of the most impressive, frankly, anywhere in the world. And that shoe that we won best new product and best innovation at the Outdoor Retailer, the Fat Tire shoe, that thing is cool. You should get one for your kids. They're going to go crazy for it. But I think it also demonstrates our ability to start leveraging our partnerships with people like Michelin and people like the GOREs of the world, that we don't have to do all the heavy lifting ourselves and that we're taking this platform that we have as a consumer wants our brand, we're making sure that we just put the best around it all the time. So from -- lastly, from a distribution standpoint in Footwear, we're going to continue to broaden our Footwear business inside of our existing terrific partners that we have. We don't believe that we need necessarily new doors today as much as we just need to be excellent in the doors where we're doing business. And for us, that begins with sporting goods. And it also means extending some of our key partners at places like Finish Line and Foot Locker. And one quick note as well just to the support that we felt from the executive team at Foot Locker and particularly Ken Hicks and wishing him well in his retirement and welcoming Dick Johnson, who is the first person who bought Under Armour back in Eastbay when he ran that in 1999. So long story, we've been at this for a long time. We feel pretty -- very proud of what we've done, and frankly, we think we're just getting started."

I think the one thing we should take into account is the fact that we have been investing in the Connected Fitness business over the last couple of years, even before these 2 acquisitions. So the reality that our operating margin has been relatively flat over the last couple of years, in that 11.4, 11.5 range, the reality is the mix of that is that Connected Fitness, obviously, has been an investment and an increasing investment over the last couple of years, even before these acquisitions, and then on top of that, obviously, adding a 90 basis point dilutive impact in 2015. So the reality is the last couple of years, we have been leveraging kind of our core business. Even though we are investing in places like International and innovation and product creation and Footwear, we're still seeing some leverage across other points in our existing business, and Connected Fitness has been an investment perspective. So as you look going forward, I think what you would expect to see is continued investment in places like I just mentioned. International, although becoming profitable and although leveraging within the business unit itself, is still really an overall investment point in our overall company. Things like Brand House is kind of just kind of getting off the ground. Whether it be Brand House on the International front or specifically Brand House here in North America, it's definitely in investment mode for us. And then I think, again, Connected Fitness, with the acquisitions on top of the existing model, we'll be investment mode. So I think what you're seeing here is kind of a continuation of leveraging our core business in the places you would expect us to leverage, and balancing that leverage with needed investments to continue to drive long-term sustainable growth programs."

There are 1,696 players in the NFL, and there's only 1 Super Bowl MVP. 
There have been hundreds of gears in the Women's Alpine circuit since 2004 but just one has won 67 times. 
There are 450 players in the NBA and there is at least, in my mind, just 1 MVP. There are 125 players on the PGA Tour and there is only 1 Masters champion. 
The numbers associated with the recent performances of Under Armour athletes like Tom Brady, Lindsey Vonn, Stephen Curry, and most recently, Jordan Spieth, are compelling and true evidence that we are just getting started. 
Three months ago, we talked you about some of the important numbers Under Armour achieved in 2014. So far in 2015, we put some equally impressive numbers on the scoreboard. 
First, there were acquisitions of MyFitnessPal and Endomondo, which combined with our existing MapMyFitness and UA Record platform create the world's largest digital health and fitness community now with over 130 million unique users. 
We opened our Chicago Brand House, 30,000 square feet of Magnificent Mile with the best presentation of the Under Armour brand experience anywhere in the world. 
We've opened a store in the Mall of America, bringing the Under Armour brand to more than 40 million shoppers annually. 
We signed São Paulo Futebol Clube, Brazil's most successful club with 18 overall titles and more than 17 million supporters in that market. 
And with the results from our first quarter, we've now recorded 20 consecutive quarters of 20-plus percent revenue growth that's 5 years since our last quarter with less than 20% revenue growth or to put it more topically, back before Jordan Spieth had his driver's license. 
But without question, the most impressive performances were put together by the Under Armour athletes I mentioned earlier. So indulge me for a minute while I talk about these record-setting performances from Under Armour athletes so far in 2015. 
Tom Brady won his fourth Super Bowl ring and his third Super Bowl MVP award. Lindsey Vonn broke the record for most career all-time scheme Women's World Cup wins. Stephen Curry, the league's most unguardable player led his team in the best record in the NBA, and it's my choice to win the NBA's MVP award when it's announce shortly, as well as having been the leading vote-getter at the NBA All-Star game. 
Jordan Spieth, a record-setting performance at The Masters were he became the first player to win wire to wire since 1976. He reached 19 under which no one had ever done in the history of the tournament, set the record for most birdies at 1 Masters with 28 and became one of the second man in the 100 years to win a major wire to wire at 21 years or younger. 
Equally important, Jordan dominated those 4 days at The Masters with the sense of purpose and will that the define both him and Under Armour. 
Part of the formula for success in our business is making a big bet and we did so when we signed Jordan as a teenager a few years ago. 
To quote the great Dodgers executive, Branch Rickey, luck is a residue of design and knowing that we have Jordan Spieth as the face of Under Armour golf into the future solidifies our presence in the category and aligns us with the new face of golf in the United States. 
We're proud to be associated with athletes like Tom, Lindsay, Stephen and Jordan not just because of their accomplishments, but especially because the people that they are. 
The great performances of these athletes are driving sales force too. We had a great launch at the Curry One at the All-Star game in February and the tremendous buzz in this community about that shoe, as well as great anticipation already around the Curry Two. 
So while it feels good to be viewed as a growing presence in the signature shoe market, it's important to recognize that we are just getting started. 
In golf apparel, our team did a great job about outbidding Jordan for The Masters, and it provided terrific visibility for our golf apparel and footwear. When we signed him, we knew he had the ability to help drive our brand beyond just golf and that we needed to align our product stores with his aggressive, young and fearless personality. 
We come along way in the category in the last 2 years and because we know that every detail matters, it was nice to be able to put him in that hole on Sunday knowing how great it would look wearing a Green Jacket. 
Moving on to other areas of our business that continue to shine. We saw 41% growth in our Footwear business this past quarter. 
In addition to the heat being generated in basketball by the Curry One, our SpeedForm Gemini running shoe at $130 continue to collect rave reviews and check at retail. 
Building off the success of our SpeedForm platform, we're introducing cleaded models in both American and global football, including a boot worn by one of our newest athlete, Memphis Depay, the top scorer in the Dutch league who helped his team clinched first place Saturday with a spectacular free kick and who, at only 21 years old, may soon become one of the most exciting players in the beautiful game. 
We continue to see strength in our core Apparel business with revenues up 21% in the quarter, the 22nd consecutive quarter of 20-plus percent apparel revenue growth, our largest category. 
In addition to our strength in golf, we're off to a strong start with the introduction of Armour, our reengineered base layer featuring enhanced ventilation. 
As we grow our presence in key Footwear categories like running and basketball, it's helping drive our business and those key growth categories across all Men's and Women's apparel. 
Our growing strength in Footwear is also helping to drive apparel sales with kids as we understand how critically important the footwear piece is to how our young male and female consumers dress. 
Our financial results are great evidence of the growing power of the Under Armour brand and our ability to execute against this tremendous opportunity. But operationally, we believe we have yet to play our best game. We believe there's a great opportunity to improve both how our supply chain gets product to market and how our product looks once we get there. On the latter, our growing pipeline of innovation in footwear, apparel, accessories and Connected Fitness provides us with the opportunity to evolve our model by providing better merchandising to our wholesale partners, as well as in our own Direct-to-Consumer businesses. 
We are adding human capital to our global merchandising function, starting with Kevin Estrich, who will run our global merchandising team after 2.5-plus years successfully establishing our brand in China. 
The Under Armour brand will continue to grow by ensuring we show up in a premium way whenever our consumer interacts with our brand, whether that's in the wholesale partners store, our own doors, an E-Commerce environment or anywhere our brand is available. 
Our ability to stratify our presentation at retail with multiple end use categories is an asset we have yet to fully maximize, and we believe these types of surgical improvements in our merchandising will help ensure our continued growth with our wholesale partners. 
In our DTC business, we are laser-focused on using our Brand House stores to provide that elite presentation of the Under Armour brand. That presentation is on display at our newest 30,000 square-foot Brand House store on Magnificent Mile in Chicago where we've dedicated space for Men's and Women's, running, golf, basketball, hunt, studio and youth, as well as presentations of local assets like Notre Dame, Northwestern, the Cubs and White Sox. 
It's also our first opportunity to bring our Connected Fitness story to our consumer, and we will evolve that experience as we continue to develop our Brand House presence. 
Our Connected Fitness community added over 10 million unique users since our last call in February and now totals more than 130 million combined. 
We average more than 130,000 people in the first quarter downloading 1 of our 4 apps. We are focused on integrating the 4 companies and continued development of the individual apps as we build out the Under Armour record platform. 
To build on this, we're expanding our partnership with SAP for the infrastructure that will help us create a single integrated view of our consumer. We believe the brand that can build true communities among their consumers by improving their health and fitness will be best positioned, and we are focused on the competitive advantage we enjoy by having the world's largest digital health and fitness community. 
The final piece I want to cover today is our fastest-growing business, International, where we grew 74% this past quarter. We continue to show great strength as the Under Armour establishes itself as an authentic athletic brand in new markets. We will add over 100 total stores outside United States in 2015. And this past quarter, we opened our first stores in Abu Dhabi and Brazil. Next month, we will be in Brazil to unveil the kits for our newest team, São Paulo Futebol Clube, the most successful club in the country's history. 
Adding key assets by São Paulo accelerates our presence in these new markets and helps us deliver authenticity as we establish ourselves in global football. 
And finally, on International, we are most excited about the fact that we are just getting started. I mentioned earlier that we are bringing our former GM in China back to run our global merchandising team. Taking over is our new GM in China is Erick Haskell, brings extensive industry experience in the country as he leads what will be one of our largest countries in revenue outside North America by the end of 2015. 
So whether it was football cleats when we entered that market, golf with Jordan Spieth and basketball with Stephen Curry, we consistently proven our ability to go hard and disrupt key categories, which we believe positions us as the next great global athletic brand. 
And with the additional asset of our Connected Fitness platform, we believe we can do so in a way that connects us to our consumer like no other brand on the planet. We are truly just getting started. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Brad."

I'd like to spend some time discussing our first quarter results followed by our updated outlook for 2015. Our net revenues for the first quarter of 2015 increased 25% to $805 million.

Our net revenues for the first quarter of 2015 increased 25% to $805 million. As Kevin highlighted, our results represented 20th straight quarter of achieving above 20% top line growth. We are proud of this consistency, particularly in a period where several external headwinds, including the strong U.S. dollar negatively impacted our business. 
On a currency-neutral basis, net revenues increased 27% for the period. In addition, our North American business experience some disruptions from the West Coast port delays and weather-related store closures during the period, which we estimate had a 1% to 2% cumulative impact on overall net revenues. 
Looking at our product categories, we grew apparel net revenues 21% to $555 million compared to $459 million in the prior year's quarter. 
Despite the impact of some of the headwinds I just outlined, we were able to post strong results in our largest product category led by the introductions of Armour Baselayer and our updated training platform, as well as continued growth in golf and running. 
First quarter Footwear net revenues increased 41% to $161 million from $114 million in the prior year, representing 20% of our total business for the first time since our initial running shoe launch in early 2009. 
As the centerpiece of our first Brand Holiday of 2015, our new SpeedForm Gemini and Apollo event running shoes, as well as Stephen Curry's first enter into basketball shoe at Curry One drove tremendous excitement to the category in the marketplace. 
Our accessories net revenues during the first quarter increased 23% to $63 million from $52 million last year with particular strength in our pipeline. Our global Direct-to-Consumer net revenues increased 21% for the quarter, representing approximately 25% of net revenues. The E-Commerce growth rate exceeded our retail growth rate during the quarter with weather driving store closures for several of our domestic doors during the quarter. Nevertheless, we are excited with the regional progress we've made during the quarter, including strong new Brand House openings in Chicago on the Magnificent Mile and in Minneapolis at the Mall of America, as well of our first Brand House store in Brazil. 
From a global standpoint, we entered the first quarter with 153 owned stores, including 134 factory house stores and 19 Brand House stores compared to 134 owned stores in the year-ago period comprised of 123 Factory House stores and 11 Brand House doors. 
In our E-Commerce channel, we continue to see strong overall trends as our consumer continues to shift to mobile, which represented over 40% of our traffic and nearly 20% of our E-Commerce sales during the period. 
At the same time, we're seeing a strong response to our new local E-Commerce sites, including the first quarter launches in the Philippines and The Netherlands, which we believe is indicative of some of the untapped demand in these markets. 
Looking at our regions. North America net revenues increased 20% to $700 million in the first quarter compared to $583 million in the prior year's quarter. 
On a currency-neutral basis, North America net revenues increased 21% for the period, driven primarily by the growth in Apparel and Footwear categories and our Direct-to-Consumer channel I just outlined. 
International red revenues increased 74% to $96 million in the first quarter and represented 12% total revenues. 
On a currency-neutral basis, International net revenues increased 86% for the period. This was the first quarter in Under Armour's history for the International mix surpassed 10%. 
In the EMEA region, in addition to a strong launch of our new Dutch website, we celebrated the opening of our new in Germany, which puts us closer to our customers at the time around we are beginning to see strong traction within the market. 
We're also just beginning our new distributors agreement in the Middle East, which included the January opening of our first regional Brand House store in Abu Dhabi. 
In Asia Pacific, we more than tripled our business in China as we began to accelerate our partner store expansion efforts and experienced significant traction across E-Commerce. 
We also remain in the early stages of our expansion efforts in Southeast Asia, Taiwan and Hong Kong. 
Finally, in Latin America. We're still less than a year into our market entry in Brazil, and we are seeing success building brand awareness without for such as our recent signing of São Paulo Futebol Clube, the opening of our first Brand House store in São Paulo and a local marketing push in conjunction with our SpeedForm Gemini launch. 
Moving on to margins. First quarter growth margins held steady year-over-year at 46.9% with 3 primary factors contributing to this performance during the quarter. 
First, favorable product margins in both North American and International Apparel and Footwear benefited gross margins by approximately 110 basis points for the period. 
Second, higher air freight costs primarily tied to our efforts to mitigate the impact of the West Coast port disruptions negatively impacted the gross margins by approximately 60 basis points in the period. 
Finally, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar negatively impacted gross margins by approximately 50 basis points for the period as we purchased the majority of our inventory for International businesses in U.S. dollars. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues de-leveraged 80 basis points to 43.5% in the first quarter of 2015 from 42.7% in the prior year's period. 
Starting this quarter in an effort to simplify and streamline our conversation, we are consolidating our SG&A detail into 2 primary buckets: Marketing and other SG&A. 
Other SG&A is the sum of our previously outlined selling, product division in supply chain and corporate services buckets. SG&A details for the first quarter were as follows: Marketing cost decreased to 13.4% of net revenues for the quarter, from 13.7% in the prior year period, driven primarily by the shift of certain planned expenditures to later in 2015. 
Other SG&A costs increased to 30.1% of net revenues for the quarter from 29% in the prior year, driven primarily by our Connected Fitness acquisitions and investments in Brand House and E-Commerce. 
The onetime deal closing cost of $6.3 million for the Connected Fitness acquisitions negatively impacted the quarter by approximately 80 basis points. 
Operating income for the first quarter increased 3% to $28 million compared with $27 million in the prior year period. Interest and other expense for the first quarter increased to $4 million compared with $2 million in the prior year period, primarily reflecting increased interest expense associated with the financing of our Connected Fitness acquisitions. 
Our first quarter tax rate of 50.3% was unfavorable to the 46.1% rate last year, primarily driven by increased losses in our newer Latin America businesses. 
Discrete tax items such as International losses are particularly impactful to our effective tax rate period such as the first quarter with lower consolidated pretax income levels. 
Given these factors below the operating line, our first quarter net income decreased 13% to $12 million compared to $14 million in the prior year period while our diluted earnings per share decreased to $0.05 from $0.06 in the prior year period. 
On the balance sheet, total cash and cash equivalents for the quarter increased 29% to $232 million compared with $180 million at March 31, 2014. 
Inventory for the quarter increased 22% to $578 million compared to $472 million at March 31, 2014. 
Total debt increased to $677 million as compared to $152 million at March 31, 2014, and $284 million at December 31, 2014. 
The first quarter increase reflects the financing of our Connected Fitness acquisitions, including $250 million on our revolving line of credit and an additional $150 million of term debt. 
Looking at our cash flows. Our investment and capital expenditures was $68 million for the first quarter compared to $31 million in the prior year's period, driven primarily by our investments in our new North American distributors center, our corporate headquarters in Baltimore and our global fixturing and retail strategies. 
Now moving on to our updated 2015 guidance. Based on current visibility, we expect 2015 net revenues of approximately $3.78 billion, representing growth of 23% and 2015 operating income in the range of $400 million to $408 million, representing growth of 13% to 15%. Our operating income guidance includes the dilutive impact of the Connected Fitness acquisitions, consisting of $6.3 million of onetime transaction cost incurred in the first quarter, as well as full year operating losses from this businesses and noncash amortization charges of intangible assets generated from the acquisition. 
Below operating results, we estimate a $9 million increase year-over-year in interest expense, primarily due to incremental borrowings under our credit agreement to fund the Connected Fitness acquisitions. 
We currently expect the full year effective tax rate of approximately 41%, which is higher than previously anticipated given the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar, which negatively impacts our International profitability, which in turn negatively impacts our consolidated tax rate. 
As this impact is more pronounced in quarters with lower consolidated pretax profits, our guidance assumes a second quarter tax rate similar to our first quarter rate, followed by a more normalized effective tax rate expected in the back half of the year. 
I'd also like to add some color on several items. Starting with revenues. As we indicated last quarter and as reflected in our first quarter results, International and Footwear, are areas that are planned to outperform in 2015 as we continue to answer and expanding new markets and see successes across our footwear lines. 
From a macro standpoint, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar is expected to impact our 2015 net revenues by approximately 2 to 3 percentage points given current exchange rates, and we factored this into our updated guidance. 
Now looking at gross margins. Given the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar, along with anticipated higher ongoing air freight due to the service to our customers, we now expect full year gross margin will be roughly in line with last year's 49% rate. This compares to our prior guidance of a modest year-over-year improvement. 
Specifically, we expect our second quarter and third quarter margins will be down approximately 50 basis points compared to last year. 
We continue to plan for higher air freight expenses in the second quarter as we continue our efforts to mitigate the impacts of the West Coast port disruptions. While the negative impact of the strongly U.S. dollar is expected to have the most pronounced margin impact in the second and third quarters. 
In SG&A, the timing of certain expenses as a result in some changes to our quarterly cadence. Given our current visibility, we now expect SG&A expense deleverage of approximately 200 basis points during the second quarter, including higher costs associated with our Brand House strategy given the timing of store openings, as well as the timing of certain marketing innovation expenditures. 
We anticipate SG&A will continue to deleverage, albeit to a lesser degree during the third quarter before showing modest leverage during the fourth quarter. 
From an operating income standpoint, while the gross margin headwinds have increased since our previous guidance, we have seen some offsetting impacts from our Connected Fitness acquisitions primarily related to lower amortization expense than previously anticipated. 
In addition, we continue to expect to mitigate some of the overall margin pressures through targeted improvements in gross margin and SG&A with the largest offset emerging in the fourth quarter. 
Finally, some updates on our planned capital expenditures. We have previously indicated planned 2015 capital expenditures in the range of $280 million to $290 million inclusive of approximately $90 million for our new domestic distribution center and the expansion of our corporate headquarters at Baltimore. 
Following a recent acquisitions in the Connected Fitness space, we began looking into areas of integration tied to our overall business. An important first step is our technology platform. 
As such, we've decided to invest in our systems with SAP to enhance, extend and integrate our core Apparel and Footwear systems, along with our Connected Fitness platforms. This project will occur over the next few years with the initial phases occurring in 2015. As a result, we now expect 2015 capital expenditures in the range of $330 million to $340 million.

So Brad, as you know, is taking on additional responsibilities, making shopping some things around where we prioritized Footwear and Kevin fully focused on Footwear innovation. And it is only going to be a driver for the company with what you'll see coming out as we see this massive opportunity in Footwear. At the same time, supply chain, particularly as you get more complex, particularly as you look to grow globally, it's incredibly complex. And frankly, for us, much further beyond what we were just making. We used to sell tight t-shirts and we put them in some sporting goods stores, and they would sell a. And now, it's a much more complex and diverse line and you have things like Women's that includes fashion and flow and all these other pieces that come to bear. Doing business with other markets is incredibly sophisticated difficult as well. We just opened or just broke ground, rather, a few months ago our new distributors facility down in Tennessee and things like that that are happening and taking place for us. I wanted that to come across frankly, a bit for the company in terms of we just think we can do better. We're incredibly proud, I think, of the results that we put on the paper and what we've done, particularly from an apparel standpoint with 22 consecutive quarters and posting the growth that we have. But, as I said, we have yet to play our best game. So I don't think that what Brad is building out with our team and Jim Hardy, who's been our Chief Supply Chain Officer here for the last several years and bringing to bear the expertise. I can tell you what we're doing physically with warehouses in some of the other components. But also systems are going to play a massive role in where we're heading. One of the things I also mentioned was our new partnership with SAP, who is Bill German has been in our Board for the last 9 or nearly 10 years. And so we've had a lot of insight as to running with best run companies do and what they look like. And I think we're now in a position where we're big enough to being able to implement that but not to bid where it will actually be a hindrance to the company. So I think there's a renewed vigor as that what we've done to date has been good, and we've done well. But we're just looking and saying from a company that now has a focus on things like Women's where we're looking to turn product every 3 and 4 weeks versus having 2 seasons a year, doing business and truly having distribution facilities in Europe, in Asia, in Southeast Asia and Latin America, around the world and figuring out this completed the supply chains that include things like booty and tariff and all those other issues. It's just -- it's becoming a much for complicated world, and we are elevating ourselves. And so Brad is moving away from the CFO, which of course will continue to report to him. It's part of the challenge, We're closing on $4 billion or close to $2 billion in FOB this year. The gross margin moving a few  bps, let alone percentage point or 2 has a massive impact in the company. So we think that we've done well, we think that we've been probably a little fat at getting into this point, and we're just looking and recognizing the fact that if we -- when we begin to tighten the belt and bringing it professionals, this is not like finding any designer where you're hoping somewhere can do the job. There's lots of people that has this expertise and experience from some of the fast fashion people that are great to learn from as well as we can implement ourselves. And so I think what you're seeing is the company growing up. The last thing I'll just say is around the merchandising function. We did not have a merchandising function in the organization. And I say that from -- we have product people that built product, and we have salespeople that sold it in and the buyers would select what they wanted. But truly, curating and articulating exactly the voice that we want depending on the distribution is not a function that we had at the company. And so what you're seeing, I believe, I believe is a more sophisticated Under Armour. And at the end of the day, I think were going to have a better end result for our consumer first and foremost, that will continue to drive the kind of results that I think we've made everyone accustomed to over the last 5 years."

Beginning",713,"Sure. Well, Kate, I think, first of all, we see this general trend toward athletic in Women's fashion as a whole is something that we don't see it slowing anytime soon, and we're very fortunate for that, I think, being the heart and soul of it. Beginning -- going back to 2014, we're incredibly proud I believe that the conversation that we kicked off with I WILL WHAT I WANT campaign that began with Misty Copeland and that aspirational commercial that we had with Misty, and then following up with Gisele. The momentum from that is something that we're still feeling today. And capping off last week with Misty being named one of Time Magazine's 100 Most Influential People on the Planet. So I think we're having a bigger conversation and even what is the style color that is in the store. At the end of the day, though, that is that what we do for a living and we're looking at how to style, color hits in the store. I'm not sure that we have taken full advantage of the conversation that we started from a product merchandising standpoint. And we believe that there's a greater opportunity for us in Women's to have a conversation with her that is meeting her where she is versus asking her to come to us. And we articulated that last year with this idea of the female athlete versus the athletic female. And so I think you'll continue to see styles and silhouettes and speaking about Under Armour, we basically built our Women's business on the back of the compression shorts and sports bras. And where we're trying to show up in more places for and being more relevant beyond just strictly in the gym or what she's wearing beneath, I think, is part of where we're going. And I say that in the context of we built a $600 million Women's business by the end of 2014. So those signs are slowing. I think you're just seeing us continue to sophisticate. But we feel great, I believe, about the team that we put in place, the momentum we have and the direction that we're going. Couple of things to play with that as well I think it's worth mentioning is our Connected Fitness platform, which you know in bringing that on and assembling the community of now [indiscernible]over 130 million. More than 60% of which are women. And so as we really get our arms around what we have there, we believe that continuing that conversation with her and having -- finding ways to have meaningful conversations #1, of how we can communicate their but also, we can listen to her. And so I think you'll see Under Armour continue to take those steps toward being more relevant in more aspects of her life. And I guess that there's one message that I want to get across today and whether it's sort of maybe a bit mass in the merchandising is that we don't believe we played our best game yet. We don't think when you walk into our store you're getting the best version of Under Armour yet. And it's where we worry, we're proud of it, but we believe that there's people out there that are doing it well. We believe we're one of those people, we just think we can do a lot better. So more to come in that. If I ended with anything, maybe just quickly on distribution, talking about meeting her where she, our sporting goods partners have been incredibly aggressive in this space as well with our sells, with our merchandising, the way we set up actually a lot of competition in sporting goods. And I feel we're answering that well, but we also see that #1 in winning in our core distribution and #2, the ability for us to move to other places where she is shopping. It's something that you'll continue to see happening from us with people like our department store partners and a few other places. But to answer it in one [indiscernible], we believe our Women's business can be as large, if not bigger, than our Men's business. And we'll stick to that, and we're pretty proud of our Men’s business as well."

So we really had a breakthrough year in 2014. And again, like most things that came down to leadership, we struggled for a long time in Europe beginning back in 2006 when we launched in finding our way and finding local partners that would spoke 6 languages and then finding Americans to send over and kind of back-and-forth. I think we settled on some of that A, had a great understanding relationship with the brand, who is running our Canadian business for us and took it basically here at over $100 billion, and walked into a $50 million or $60 million U.S. business, and we crossed the $100 million for the first time in 2014. So the momentum continues in Europe, and we're incredibly excited about that. And it's not as much today about a distribution expansion game, but it is about getting better in the places where we are doing business because when we say we were distributed most of the stores, it was a few racks at best of a couple compression T-shirts and typically Men's only. And so we're looking to, I think, modify that conversation as well and take our positioning to be first of all, a full resource brand, meaning Men's, Women's and Kid's to show up and where we show up, to show up in presence. Sporting goods, particularly in the place like the U.K. has been a pretty challenged place from a discount environment. And so we're also looking to be able to offset that of maybe creating a unique experience for people in wholesale distribution. And then like you're seeing here in America, we will augment that with our own full-priced stores. The Brand House concept is something we're incredibly proud of, and it's really been working for us. In anchoring the stats of America for just a second, the 30,000 square feet we just opened up in Chicago, we can only dream about what that would do from a brand elevation standpoint and celebrating some of the stories that we have on that area. But I can tell you is a company as we look to move forward, we'll continue to have wholesale be incredibly important part of what we do. But where we look for statement retail through breadth our Brand House concepts, whether that means 2000 to 3000 square feet in some of the smaller markets like we mentioned Abu Dhabi or 30,000 square feet in Chicago, I think it's important that people understand the full expression of what our brand can be. And frankly, it's not appropriate that it's always interpreted. So we'll continue to build on that and I think you'll see more of that coming from us, particularly in a place like Europe."

So couple of things to some since we've been to -- we left in New York and gave you last real deep dive on what's happening with Connected Fitness. So first of all, it's still very new. The MyFitnessPal deal just closed on March 17, so we're less than 30 days roughly into our partnership and getting to know one another. As we said, the first year was all going to be about integration and the integration begins with culture. Culture of 4 different companies really coming together, and we've been doing that with MapMyFitness from Osten a couple 5, 6 weeks ago, we just opened our new 35,000 square-foot office in Austin, which is -- it's incredibly hot tech market and the Under Armour Connected Fitness office there, anchored with Robin and his team, is no exception to it. So I think that we're beginning sort of putting a flag on the ground of what that Under Armour attitude looks like. And it's evolving with taking the best things, I believe, of the culture that were like MapMyFitness and evolving that together to really help shape Under Armour. And it's no different with Endomondo and MyFitnessPal in the way that we're going to approach that. The first thing we realized in the integration efforts though is that this need for alignment from a systems perspective. So now between our own E-Commerce, the number of people we have 40 some, close to 50 million people walking to our retail stores in North America this year, the 130 million unique users that we have in the platform finding a way to synthesize all this information is where the SAP integration really comes from. So we're looking for this single view of the consumer that will give so much better picture and easier understanding of our consumer. I think it's going to make us a lot smarter in the long run to be able to anticipate the needs of our athletes and of our consumers. The second thing that we really focus on is building out the community. So within all of the apps, I mentioned some of the stats in my written comments, but building the world's largest 24/7, 365-day digital health and fitness community. In the first quarter alone, we added over 10 million and I want to be clear, we expect to update you on the growth numbers in our Connected Fitness in 10 million unit increments, so when we cross 120 million, when we cross 130 million, when we cross 140 million that's how we'll be articulating that. And you just look at the sheer scale where we don't want to compromise MyFitnessPal, Endomondo or MapMyFitness, their individual action, their downloads want to continue to encourage that. But we want to continue to focus on them all helping us with Under Armour records one of the collaborative product that we're going to build that we think will then be able to aggregate those desperate communities into one place and time by satisfying them. And so using all the mind power that we have from Meta, Mike Lee and Robin of the founders of the 3 sites, we think that we have the capacity and the capability to do that. And showing that, we're not slowing down any of that growth. I mean, we average over 130,000 people, we're  downloading 1 of the 4 apps every single day in the first quarter. And we're not really seeing any signs of that slowing anytime soon. So we're a little bit concerned and trepidation in our part speaking about how we define victory is that people are going to say now that we've involved in the company maturities of the number. So we haven't seen any signs of that. We do see that now have a higher expectation up the product that we're going to deliver. And I can tell you that anyone now are closing on 500 people working in our Connected Fitness and digital spaces are focused on working toward that. So what I'll tell you is that I'm going to hold back before I truly define victory. I'm just going to start with, we think we grab something that's incredibly unique, that's really large in size and scale. And that with that, there is monetization things that we talked about that we can look out from A, the brand halo effect, subscription services, products and bundles, putting in product services that we can showcase. But at the end of the day, we're still finding out exactly what we have. Meanwhile, we're going to continue to grow what we have. We're going to be thoughtful about the investments that we make there and we're going to continue to encourage things as we come to us. I mean, the Apple Watch is a great example of that. I mean, 3 of our 4 apps are now completely compatible with the Apple Watch and we encourage it. We think it's another conversation around tracking and wearables and health and fitness, and so it's actually the best thing that can happen to us. And so those are the good things that I think are happening, but we're also working on building great new products. And what I can tell you is that I'm going to give you put flag in the sand, we want a little more time to reflect, we want a little more time to get used to the flags if we getting used to between Baltimore, to Austin, to San Francisco to Copenhagen and get them comfortable with us and get comfortable with them. And we anticipate to have some very large news for you under Under Armour's Investor Day in September."

On the DTC side, maybe it's kind of reconcile some of the impact of some of these things on what talk about the my prepared remarks. Again, on the total revenue side, we talked about growing at 25% but, obviously, at a constant currency, we're at 27% and the estimated impact of due to port delays and weather are 1% to 2%. I'll be honest with you, I think we're being conservative there. The thing that we can really measure and define accurately there is the retail piece our own retail, and we know that our own retail was at least 1 percentage point due to store closures for 2 different weekends during the first quarter where the storms hit on the weekend and we literally had dozens of stores closed down. It's a little more difficult to estimate the exact impact of port on our businesses both in DTC and the wholesale and a little more difficult impact the weather impact on our wholesale business due to some degrees. So we think that 1% to 2% is pretty conservative. So again, total revenue going from 25% to 29%, it gets to use the upper end of the port and weather impact. On the DTC side, again, I think if you look at weather and port, we'd probably be more, I would say, in the upper 20s as a percentage growth, which should be similar to our growth rate in the fourth quarter for the DTC. The biggest driver of DTC growth change year-over-year as we've talked about is the fact that we're opening up less Factory House stores, that planned our DTC growth down year-over-year because of the slow growth in Factory House for us and again, that was unplanned. On the E-Commerce side in DTC, we've seen consistent strong growth in E-Commerce. There's not really -- when you look at Q1's growth rate versus last year's growth rate, pretty consistent growth rate overall in E-Commerce. So most of that decline in DTC growth rate was coming from the retail side. A lot of it -- some of it being planned and some of it being because of the impact of weather. If you also just to take a little bit further, the impact of North America, obviously, we put North America at 20% growth. Again, if you take in the effect of the FX, which is a more Canadian business and again, the port and weather challenges, we probably are closer to probably a 24% or so growth rate in North America, normalized taking into those items. So DTC going forward, I think, obviously, what we would expect not really any impact going forward for port and weather. Obviously, in the next few quarters. However, again just to make your that we have plans slower growth specifically around  Factory House and new doors."

Playing Kirsch 2014 MPV award winner, Tom Brady 2014 Super Bowl MVP, third time being named the MVP. Memphis Depay, the 20-year old football player that we signed in somebody that we have great expectation I think of what he's going to be as we move into the beautiful game into a bigger wave. Jordan, obviously, Andy Murray, the #3 ranked tennis player in the world, Misty Copeland, one of the top, one of the most influential people by Time Magazine. Lindsey Vonn, I think another made in the Women's side and defining what a beautiful athlete these. And then Steph Curry. So without question, Jordan and Steph are 2 that in incredibly relevant right now and make a lot of sense. With Jordan, I think we're letting it come to us. I mean, incredibly proud, I think, of the styling and the way that we dress Jordan. It's incredibly athletic, it was incredibly Under Armour, it's incredibly bold and it's incredibly American. And I think that's something translates as Under Armour continues to move itself from just being of product that seen and perceived about being on core, on field, on pitch, on the course, whatever that may be. And as we continue to move to other places, now that doesn't mean that we begin to comprise who we are, and we are the fact that every Under Armour product does something for you. But I just think the people are finding and seeing more ways you can utilize and interact with our brand. So having some of Jordan being able to showcase look for us over the next decade and frankly, throughout the rest of his career is something we're incredibly excited about. I mean, if you look at sportswear over the last 30 years, where transformational athletes have lived and have been successful its golf and basketball. And sitting on Jordan that we think is the type of upside and potential, it's pretty remarkable. So he's got a lot of carrier to play, it's 1 tournament but I can tell you when you sit down with Jordan Spieth, there's every belief that he's going to win every golf tournament every time he heads out and takes the tee box the FIDAC and just tell you that not every golfer thinks like that. He's different, he's special and we're going to continue to evolve that. So from a standpoint, we have 4 great days of celebrating him and there'll be more to come and most will be spoken through his play. As Steph goes, it's a certainly not guarantee nothing is guaranteed. But no matter what happens with the MVP though, we couldn't be more proud just of someone like Stephen Curry. I've said this before, the crew he rolls with, his wife, his kid, his mom and his dad and right down to his agent, his entire organization is just really some of the best people that we deal with. And so I'm as proud, I think, of the quality of people we have. And then, of course, what they're doing on court. But Stephen, from the Curry One to the Curry Two, we've been modifying and chasing that a little bit where we have pretty limited I think expectations of what we really wanted to do with that product to begin with and looking in saying the places we have coming from places like China are really just extraordinary. And so I think there's probably been some books written about how you're supposed to limit and allocate and tighten things up, and so don't get me wrong, we are not going to open the floodgates, but we definitely see this as a watershed moment for us with several of our athletes to take advantage of things that you just don't get these opportunities in life. So the train is going by, we're going to hop on the train and will exploit that to the sense where it makes the best sense for athlete and continuing their performance, first and foremost, as well as things that will celebrate the brand and help drive the great business. So the Curry One, the Curry Two, like I've seen the Curry Three and the Curry Four, so this is being and the signature basketball business, we've sort of been around it before but now, we're really in the game,and it's something that we like very much and at the same time, it's going to help elevate what was a $100-ish or a little less than $100 million-ish dollar basketball business and our goal is building $1 billion basketball brand."

Yes, if you look at the nuances here, I think the big stories are the foreign currency impact and airfreight. And if you look at just the timing of those works out, the biggest pressure for airfreight, which, again, is mostly around mitigating the West Coast port delays is going to be in the front half of the year we talked about it in Q1, we also had some of it, some residual going into Q2 also. And then when you look at FX, your biggest impact, we're going to have impacts every quarter for FX, but your biggest impact are going to be Q2 and Q3 kind of right in the middle of the year. When you kind of line those two things up together, your second quarter probably is your biggest challenge because you have both FX and airfreight. In Q3, you end up with just kind of more of an FX impact. And as you get to Q4, the FX impact is still there in Q4 it's a little bit less so because as you recall, the strengthening of the dollar started to happen in Q4 last year so your comp get a little bit easier, but you still have do some challenges FX impact in Q4 also."

But without question, I think, even considering Europe and the growth -- the great growth that you're seeing there, the 30% and 40% type of growth range that we're experiencing there. China is one of those -- it seems like an abundantly limitless place. So we're just experiencing and feeling a little bit of that. We finished 2014 with about -- roughly 57 stores by the end of the year. We made mention that we're going to be opening 100 stores outside of North America today. The majority of those are actually going to be in China's so probably come close to doubling the number of stores we have in China and these are partner stores that we show up. And a lot of this going to be a learning process. I mentioned Erick Haskell will begin with us April 1. He's previously the CFO and CEO of Adidas China, and it was before we brought him on, he's the MVP of Adidas India. But some of that sort of been there this in the movie and really is not easy to find replace, our brand is incredibly unique and different. The partnership and the relationship there is something that really seem to tap into. We feel like we've established, I think, done a lot of the hard work in China as we've been there and up. Really we opened our first store there in 2010. So we've done a lot of slugging, put the hard work in. And found a some of these relevant global assets we have and whether that is Stephen Curry that we're working on a tour of China with Stephen at some point later this year or whether that is the relevance of a Jordan showing up or the EPO, whether it's Tod, we're now having Memphis Depay showing up as well. So we think that's we're doing things being after and relevant in that market in China is almost its own world. And so we believe that when focus and now we have the foundations in place that we're really going to be able to #1, bring something to China and give something to China and in turn, we think going to have reward for Under Armour and ultimately, our shareholders too."

The biggest change being the amount of amortization that we were anticipating back in February and the intangibles and the acquisition came in a little bit different as far as value and the useful is a little bit longer so we would have benefit amortization there for Connected Fitness offsetting some of those headwinds we have on FX and airfreight. In addition, our core business we do see some opportunities again for some additional savings to help offset some of the other headwinds we talked about earlier.

There are 1,696 players in the NFL, and there's only 1 Super Bowl MVP. 
There have been hundreds of skiers in the Women's Alpine circuit since 2004 but just one has won 67 times. 
There are 450 players in the NBA and there is, at least in my mind, just 1 MVP. 
There are 125 players on the PGA Tour and there is only 1 Masters champion. 
The numbers associated with the recent performances of Under Armour athletes like Tom Brady, Lindsey Vonn, Stephen Curry, and most recently, Jordan Spieth, are compelling and true evidence that we are just getting started. 
Three months ago, we talked you about some of the important numbers Under Armour achieved in 2014. So far in 2015, we put some equally impressive numbers on the scoreboard. 
First, there were acquisitions of MyFitnessPal and Endomondo, which combined with our existing MapMyFitness and UA Record platform, created the world's largest digital health and fitness community, now with over 130 million unique users. 
We opened our Chicago Brand House, 30,000 square feet of Magnificent Mile with the best presentation of the Under Armour brand experience anywhere in the world. 
We've opened a store in the Mall of America, bringing the Under Armour brand to more than 40 million shoppers annually. 
We signed São Paulo Futebol Clube, Brazil's most successful club with 18 overall titles and more than 17 million supporters in that market. 
And with the results from our first quarter, we've now recorded 20 consecutive quarters of 20-plus percent revenue growth. That's 5 years since our last quarter with less than 20% revenue growth. Or to put it more topically, back before Jordan Spieth had his driver's license. 
But without question, the most impressive performances were put together by the Under Armour athletes I mentioned earlier. So indulge me for a minute while I talk about these record-setting performances from Under Armour athletes so far in 2015. 
Tom Brady won his fourth Super Bowl ring and his third Super Bowl MVP award. Lindsey Vonn broke the record for most career Alpine Skiing Women's World Cup wins. Stephen Curry, the league's most unguardable player, led his team in the best record in the NBA and is my choice to win the NBA's MVP award when it's announced shortly, as well as having been the leading vote-getter at the MVP All-Star game. 
Jordan Spieth, a record-setting performance at The Masters, where he became the first player to win wire to wire since 1976. He reached 19 under, which no one had ever done in the history of the tournament, set the record for most birdies at 1 Masters with 28 and became only the second man in 100 years to win a major wire to wire at 21 years or younger. Equally important, Jordan dominated those 4 days at The Masters with a sense of purpose and will that defined both him and Under Armour. 
Part of the formula for success in our business is making a big bet, and we did so when we signed Jordan as a teenager a few years ago. 
To quote the great Dodgers executive, Branch Rickey, luck is a residue of design. And knowing that we have Jordan Spieth as the face of Under Armour golf into the future solidifies our presence in the category and aligns us with the new face of golf in the United States. 
We're proud to be associated with athletes like Tom, Lindsay, Stephen and Jordan not just because of their accomplishments, but especially because the people that they are. 
The great performances of these athletes are driving sales force, too. We had a great launch of the Curry One at the All-Star game in February, and there's tremendous buzz in the sneaker community about that shoe as well as great anticipation already around the Curry Two. 
So while it feels good to be viewed as a growing presence in the signature shoe market, it's important to recognize that we are just getting started. 
In golf apparel, our team did a great job of outfitting Jordan for The Masters, and it provided terrific visibility for our golf apparel and footwear. When we signed him, we knew he had the ability to help drive our brand beyond just golf and that we needed to align our product stores with his aggressive, young and fearless personality. 
We come along way in the category in the last 2 years. And because we know that every detail matters, it was nice to be able to put him in that blue polo on Sunday, knowing how great it would look wearing a Green Jacket. 
Moving on to other areas of our business that continue to shine. We saw 41% growth in our Footwear business this past quarter. In addition to the heat being generated in basketball by the Curry One, our SpeedForm Gemini running shoe, at $130, continues to collect rave reviews and check at retail. 
Building off the success of our SpeedForm platform, we're introducing cleated models in both American and global football, including a boot worn by one of our newest athletes, Memphis Depay, the top scorer in the Dutch league who helped his team clinch first place Saturday with a spectacular free kick; and who, at only 21 years old, may soon become one of the most exciting players in the beautiful game. 
We continue to see strength in our core Apparel business with revenues up 21% in the quarter, the 22nd consecutive quarter of 20-plus percent apparel revenue growth, our largest category. 
In addition to our strength in golf, we were off to a strong start with the introduction of Armour, our reengineered base layer featuring enhanced ventilation. As we grow our presence in key Footwear categories like running and basketball, it's helping drive our business and those key growth categories across all Men's and Women's apparel. 
Our growing strength in Footwear is also helping to drive apparel sales with kids as we understand how critically important the footwear piece is to how our young male and female consumers dress. 
Our financial results are great evidence of the growing power of the Under Armour brand and our ability to execute against this tremendous opportunity. But operationally, we believe we have yet to play our best game. We believe there's a great opportunity to improve both how our supply chain gets product to market and how our product looks once we get there. On the latter, our growing pipeline of innovation in footwear, apparel, accessories and Connected Fitness provides us with the opportunity to evolve our model by providing better merchandising to our wholesale partners, as well as in our own Direct-to-Consumer businesses. 
We are adding human capital to our global merchandising function, starting with Kevin Eskridge, who will run our global merchandising team after 2-plus years successfully establishing our brand in China. 
The Under Armour brand will continue to grow by ensuring we show up in a premium way whenever our consumer interacts with our brand, whether that's in a wholesale partner store, our own doors, an E-Commerce environment or anywhere our brand is available. 
Our ability to stratify our presentation at retail with multiple end-use categories is an asset we have yet to fully maximize, and we believe these types of surgical improvements in our merchandising will help ensure our continued growth with our wholesale partners. 
In our DTC business, we are laser-focused on using our Brand House stores provide that elite presentation of the Under Armour brand. That presentation is on display at our newest 30,000 square-foot Brand House store on Magnificent Mile in Chicago where we've dedicated space for Men's and Women's, running, golf, basketball, hunt, studio and youth, as well as deep presentations of local assets like Notre Dame, Northwestern, the Cubs and White Sox. 
It's also our first opportunity to bring our Connected Fitness story to our consumer, and we will evolve that experience as we continue to develop our Brand House presence. 
Our Connected Fitness community added over 10 million unique users since our last call in February and now totals more than 130 million combined. We average more than 130,000 people in the first quarter downloading 1 of our 4 apps. We are focused on integrating the 4 companies and continued development of the individual apps as we build out the Under Armour record platform. 
To build on this, we're expanding our partnership with SAP for the infrastructure that will help us create a single integrated view of our consumer. We believe the brands that can build true communities among their consumers by improving their health and fitness will be best positioned, and we are focused on the competitive advantage we enjoy by having the world's largest digital health and fitness community. 
The final piece I want to cover today is our fastest-growing business: International, where we grew 74% this past quarter. We continue to show great strength as the Under Armour brand establishes itself as an authentic athletic brand in new markets. We will add over 100 total stores outside United States in 2015. And this past quarter, we opened our first stores in Abu Dhabi and Brazil. Next month, we will be in Brazil to unveil the kits for our newest team, São Paulo Futebol Clube, the most successful club in the country's history. Adding key assets like São Paulo accelerates our presence in these new markets and helps us deliver authenticity as we establish ourselves in global football. 
And finally, on International, we are most excited about the fact that we are just getting started. I mentioned earlier that we are bringing our former GM in China back to run our global merchandising team. Taking over is our new GM in China is Erick Haskell, who brings extensive industry experience in the country as he leads what will be one of our largest countries in revenue outside North America by the end of 2015. 
So whether it was football cleats when we entered that market, golf with Jordan Spieth or basketball with Stephen Curry, we've consistently proven our ability to go hard and disrupt key categories, which we believe positions us as the next great global athletic brand. And with the additional asset of our Connected Fitness platform, we believe we can do so in a way that connects us to our consumer like no other brand on the planet. 
We are truly just getting started. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Brad."
8740684,289992748,791083,"Under Armour, Inc., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2015",2015-04-21,"Earnings Calls","Under Armour, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Kevin. I'd now like to spend some time discussing our first quarter results followed by our updated outlook for 2015. Our net revenues for the first quarter of 2015 increased 25% to $805 million. As Kevin highlighted, our results represent the 2",2078,"Thanks, Kevin. I'd now like to spend some time discussing our first quarter results followed by our updated outlook for 2015. 
Our net revenues for the first quarter of 2015 increased 25% to $805 million. As Kevin highlighted, our results represent the 20th straight quarter of achieving above 20% top line growth. We are proud of this consistency, particularly in a period where several external headwinds, including the strong U.S. dollar, negatively impacted our business. 
On a currency-neutral basis, net revenues increased 27% for the period. In addition, our North American business experienced some disruptions from the West Coast port delays and weather-related store closures during the period, which we estimate had a 1% to 2% cumulative impact on overall net revenues. 
Looking at our product categories, we grew apparel net revenues 21% to $555 million compared to $459 million in the prior year's quarter. Despite the impact of some of the headwinds I just outlined, we were able to post strong results in our largest product category led by the introductions of Armour Baselayer and our updated training platform, as well as continued growth in golf and running. 
First quarter Footwear net revenues increased 41% to $161 million from $114 million the prior year, representing 20% of our total business for the first time since our initial running shoe launch in early 2009. 
As the centerpieces of our first Brand Holiday of 2015, our new SpeedForm Gemini and Apollo event running shoes, as well as Stephen Curry's first signature basketball shoe, the Curry One, drove tremendous excitement for the category in the marketplace. 
Our accessories net revenues during the first quarter increased 23% to $63 million from $52 million last year with particular strength within our bags line. 
Our global Direct-to-Consumer net revenues increased 21% for the quarter, representing approximately 25% of net revenues. 
The E-Commerce growth rate exceeded our retail growth rate during the quarter, with weather driving store closures for several of our domestic doors during the quarter. Nevertheless, we were excited with the retail progress we made during the quarter, including strong new Brand House openings in Chicago on the Magnificent Mile and in Minneapolis at the Mall of America, as well of our first Brand House store in Brazil. 
From a global standpoint, we entered the first quarter with 153 owned stores, including 134 Factory House stores and 19 Brand House stores compared to 134 owned stores in the year-ago period comprised of 123 Factory House stores and 11 Brand House stores. 
In our E-Commerce channel, we continue to see strong overall trends as our consumer continues to shift to mobile, which represented over 40% of our traffic and nearly 20% of our E-Commerce sales during the period. At the same time, we're seeing a strong response to our new local E-Commerce sites, including the first quarter launches in the Philippines and The Netherlands, which we believe is indicative of some of the untapped demand in these markets. 
Looking at our regions. North America net revenues increased 20% to $700 million in the first quarter compared to $583 million in the prior year's quarter. On a currency-neutral basis, North America net revenues increased 21% for the period, driven primarily by the growth in Apparel and Footwear categories in our Direct-to-Consumer channel, as I just outlined. 
International net revenues increased 74% to $96 million in the first quarter and represented 12% of total net revenues. On a currency-neutral basis, International net revenues increased 86% for the period. This was the first quarter in Under Armour's history where the International mix surpassed 10%. 
In the EMEA region, in addition to a strong launch of our new Dutch website, we celebrated the opening of our new office in Germany, which puts us closer to our customers at a time when we are beginning to see strong traction within the market. 
We are also just beginning our new distributor agreement in the Middle East, which include the January opening of our first regional Brand House store in Abu Dhabi. 
In Asia Pacific, we more than tripled our business in China as we began to accelerate our partner store expansion efforts and experienced significant traction across E-Commerce. We also remain in the early stages of our expansion efforts in Southeast Asia, Taiwan and Hong Kong. 
Finally, in Latin America. We are still less than a year into our market entry in Brazil, and we are seeing success building brand awareness with efforts such as our recent signing of São Paulo Futebol Clube, the opening of our first Brand House store in São Paulo and a local marketing push in conjunction with our SpeedForm Gemini launch. 
Moving on to margins. First quarter gross margins held steady year-over-year at 46.9%, with 3 primary factors contributing to this performance during the quarter. 
First, favorable product margins in both North American and International Apparel and Footwear benefited gross margins by approximately 110 basis points for the period. 
Second, higher air freight cost primarily tied to our efforts to mitigate the impacts of the West Coast port disruptions negatively impacted gross margins by approximately 60 basis points in the period. 
Finally, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar negatively impacted gross margins by approximately 50 basis points for the period as we purchased the majority of our inventory for International businesses in U.S. dollars. 
Selling, general, administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues de-leveraged 80 basis points to 43.5% in the first quarter of 2015 from 42.7% in the prior year's period. 
Starting this quarter, in an effort to simplify and streamline our conversation, we are consolidating our SG&A detail into 2 primary buckets: Marketing and other SG&A. Other SG&A is the sum of our previously outlined selling, product innovation and supply chain and corporate services buckets. 
SG&A details for the first quarter are as follows: Marketing cost decreased to 13.4% of net revenues for the quarter from 13.7% in the prior year period, driven primarily by the shift of certain planned expenditures to later in 2015. 
Other SG&A cost increased to 30.1% of net revenues for the quarter from 29% in the prior year, driven primarily by our Connected Fitness acquisitions and investments in Brand House and E-Commerce. The onetime deal closing cost of $6.3 million for the Connected Fitness acquisitions negatively impacted the quarter by approximately 80 basis points. 
Operating income for the first quarter increased 3% to $28 million compare with $27 million in the prior year period. Interest and other expense for the first quarter increased to $4 million compared with $2 million in the prior year period, primarily reflecting increased interest expense associated with the financing of our Connected Fitness acquisitions. 
Our first quarter tax rate of 50.3% was unfavorable to the 46.1% rate last year, primarily driven by increased losses in our newer Latin American businesses. Discrete tax items such as International losses are particularly impactful to our effective tax rate in periods such as the first quarter with lower consolidated pretax income levels. 
Given these factors below the operating line, our first quarter net income decreased 13% to $12 million compared to $14 million the prior year period, while our diluted earnings per share decreased to $0.05 from $0.06 in the prior year's period. 
On the balance sheet, total cash and cash equivalents for the quarter increased 29% to $232 million compared with $180 million at March 31, 2014. 
Inventory for the quarter increased 22% to $578 million compared to $472 million at March 31, 2014. 
Total debt increased to $677 million as compared to $152 million at March 31, 2014, and $284 million at December 31, 2014. The first quarter increase reflects the financing of our Connected Fitness acquisitions, including $250 million on our revolving line of credit and an additional $150 million of term debt. 
Looking at our cash flows. Our investment and capital expenditures was $68 million for the first quarter compared to $31 million in the prior year's period, driven primarily by our investments in our new North American distributor center, our corporate headquarters in Baltimore and our global fixturing and retail strategies. 
Now moving on to our updated 2015 guidance. Based on current visibility, we expect 2015 net revenues of approximately $3.78 billion, representing growth of 23%, and 2015 operating income in the range of $400 million to $408 million, representing growth of 13% to 15%. Our operating income guidance includes the dilutive impact of the Connected Fitness acquisitions, consisting of $6.3 million of onetime transaction cost incurred in the first quarter, as well as full year operating losses from these businesses and noncash amortization charges of the intangible assets generated from the acquisitions. 
Below operating results, we estimate a $9 million increase year-over-year in interest expense, primarily due to incremental borrowings under our credit agreement to fund the Connected Fitness acquisitions. 
We currently expect a full year effective tax rate of approximately 41%, which is higher than previously anticipated given the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar, which negatively impacts our International profitability, which in turn negatively impacts our consolidated tax rate. 
As this impact is more pronounced in quarters with lower consolidated pretax profits, our guidance assumes a second quarter tax rate similar to our first quarter rate, followed by a more normalized effective tax rate expected in the back half of the year. 
I would also -- I'd like to add some color on several items, starting with revenues. As we indicated last quarter and as reflected in our first quarter results, International and Footwear are areas that are planned to outperform in 2015 as we continue to enter and expand in new markets and see successes across our footwear lines. 
From a macro standpoint, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar is expected to impact our 2015 net revenues by approximately 2 to 3 percentage points given current exchange rates, and we have factored this into our updated guidance. 
Now looking at gross margins. Given the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar, along with anticipated higher ongoing air freight needed to service to our customers, we now expect full year gross margin will be roughly in line with last year's 49% rate. This compares to our prior guidance of a modest year-over-year improvement. Specifically, we expect our second quarter and third quarter margins will be down approximately 50 basis points compared to last year. 
We continue to plan for higher air freight expenses in the second quarter as we continue our efforts to mitigate the impacts of the West Coast port disruptions. While the negative impact of the stronger U.S. dollar is expected to have the most pronounced margin impact in the second and third quarters. 
In SG&A, the timing of certain expenses has resulted in some changes to our quarterly cadence. Given our current visibility, we now expect SG&A expense deleverage of approximately 200 basis points during the second quarter, including higher costs associated with our Brand House strategy given the timing of store openings, as well as the timing of certain marketing and innovation expenditures. 
We anticipate SG&A will continue to deleverage, albeit to a lesser degree, during the third quarter before showing modest leverage during the fourth quarter. 
From an operating income standpoint, while the gross margin headwinds have increased since our previous guidance, we have seen some offsetting impacts from our Connected Fitness acquisitions primarily related to lower amortization expense than previously anticipated. 
In addition, we continue to expect to mitigate some of the overall margin pressures through targeted improvements in gross margin and SG&A with the largest offset emerging in the fourth quarter. 
Finally, some updates on our planned capital expenditures. We have previously indicated planned 2015 capital expenditures in the range of $280 million to $290 million, inclusive of approximately $90 million for our new domestic distribution center and the expansion of our corporate headquarters at Baltimore. 
Following our recent acquisitions in the Connected Fitness space, we began looking into areas of integration tied to our overall business. An important first step is our technology platform. As such, we've decided to invest in our systems with SAP to enhance, expand and integrate our core Apparel and Footwear systems, along with our Connected Fitness platforms. This project will occur over the next few years with the initial phases occurring in 2015. As a result, we now expect 2015 capital expenditures in the range of $330 million to $340 million.

And I've mo",836,"Well, I think a couple of things we've done is just from an organization standpoint, the way we structured. So Brad, as you know, has taken on additional responsibilities and making -- shuffling some things around where we prioritize Footwear. And I've moved Kip and have him exclusively focused on Footwear and innovation. And I think it's really going to be a driver for the company with what you'll see coming out as we see this massive opportunity in Footwear. At the same time, supply chain, particularly as you get more complex, particularly as you look to grow globally, it's incredibly complex. And frankly, for us, much further beyond what we were just making. We used to sell tight t-shirts and we'd put them in sporting goods stores and they would sell. And now it's a much more complex and diverse line. And you have things like Women's that includes fashion and flow and all these other pieces that come to bear. Doing business with other markets is incredibly sophisticated and difficult as well. We just opened -- or just broke ground, rather a few months ago, a new distribution facility down in Tennessee. And things like that, that are happening and taking place for us. When -- I wanted that to come across, frankly, a bit deprecating for the company in terms of we just think we can do better. We're incredibly proud, I think, of the results that we've put on the paper and what we've done, particularly from an apparel standpoint, with 22 consecutive quarters and then posting the growth that we have. But as I said, we have yet to play our best game. So I don't think that what Brad is building out with our team and Jim Hardy, who's been our Chief Supply Chain Officer here for the last several years, and bringing to bear the expertise. I can tell you what we're doing physically with warehouses and some of the other components, but also systems are going to play a massive role in where we're heading. One of the things I also mentioned was our new partnership with SAP, who -- Bill McDermott has been on our board for the last 9 or nearly 10 years. And so we've had a lot of insight into what -- running -- what best-run companies do and what they look like. And I think we're now in a position that we're big enough to be able to implement that, but not too big where it will actually be a hindrance to the company. So I think there's a renewed vigor as that what we've done to date has been good, and we've done well. But we're just looking and saying, from a company that now has a focus on things like Women's where we're looking to turn product every 3 and 4 weeks versus having 2 seasons a year, doing business and truly having distribution facilities in Europe, in Asia, in Southeast Asia and Latin America, around the world, and figuring out this complicated supply chains that include things like duty and tariff. In all of that -- those other issues, it's just -- it's becoming a much more complicated world and we're elevating ourselves. And so Brad is moving away from the CFO, which of course will continue to report to him. It's part of the challenge with closing on $4 billion or close to $2 billion in FOB this year, with gross margin moving up a few bps, let alone a percentage point or 2, has a massive impact in the company. So we think that we've done well, we think that we've been probably a little fat in getting to this point, and we're just looking and recognizing the fact that if we -- when we begin to tighten the belt and bring in professionals, this is not like finding a new designer where you're hoping somewhere can do the job. There's lots of people that have this expertise and experience from some of the fast fashion people that are great to learn from as well as what we can implement ourselves. And so I think what you're seeing is the company growing up. And the last thing I'll just say is around the merchandising function. We did not have a merchandising function in the organization. And I say that from -- we had product people that built product and we had salespeople that sold it in and then the buyers would select what they wanted. But truly, curating and articulating exactly the voice that we want depending on the distribution is not a function that we had at the company. And so what you're seeing, I believe, is a more sophisticated Under Armour. And at the end of the day, I think we're going to have a better end result for our consumer, first and foremost, that will continue to drive the kind of results that I think we've made everyone accustomed to over the last 5 years."

Beginn",737,"Sure. Well, Kate, I think, first of all, we see this general trend toward athletic in Women's fashion as a whole is something that -- we don't see it slowing any time soon, and we're very fortunate for that, I think, being the heart and soul of it. Beginning -- going back to 2014, we're incredibly proud, I believe, of the conversation that we kicked off with the I WILL WHAT I WANT campaign that began with Misty Copeland and that aspirational commercial that we had with Misty, and then following up with Gisele. That -- the momentum from that is something that we're still feeling today. And capping it off last week with Misty being named one of Time Magazine's 100 Most Influential People on the planet. So I think we're having a bigger conversation than even what is the style, color that's in the store. At the end of the day, though, that is that what we do for a living and we're looking at how the style, color hits in the store. I'm not sure that we have taken full advantage of the conversation that we started from a product merchandising standpoint. And we believe that there's a greater opportunity for us in Women's to have a conversation with her. That is, meeting her where she is versus asking her to come to us. And we articulated that last year with this idea of athletic -- the female athlete versus the athletic female. And so I think you'll continue to see styles and silhouettes. And speaking about Under Armour, we basically built our Women's business on the back of the compression shorts and sports bras. And where we're trying to show up in more places for and being more relevant beyond just strictly in the gym or what she's wearing beneath, I think, is part of where we're going. And I say that in the context of we built a $600 million Women's business in -- by the end of 2014. So there's no signs of this slowing. I think you're just seeing us continue to sophisticate. But we feel great, I believe, about the team that we put in place, the momentum we have and the direction that we're going. A couple of things that play with that as well, and I think it's worth mentioning, is our Connected Fitness platform, which in bringing that on and assembling that community of now over 130 million, more than 60% of which are women. And so as we really get our arms around what we have there, we believe that continuing that conversation with her and having -- finding ways to have meaningful conversations, number one, of how we can communicate there, but also how we can listen to her. And so I think you'll see Under Armour continue to take those steps toward being more relevant in more aspects of her life. And I guess that there's one message that I wanted to get across today, and whether it's sort of maybe a bit masked in the merchandising, is that we don't believe we've played our best game yet. We don't think when you walk into our store, you're getting the best version of Under Armour yet. And it's where we were and we're proud of it, but we believe that there's people out there that are doing it well. We believe we're one of those people, we just think we can do a lot better. So more to come in that. If I end it with anything, and maybe just quickly on distribution. Talking about meeting her where she is, our sporting goods partners have been incredibly aggressive in this space as well with our sells, with our merchandising, with the way we set up. There's actually a lot of competition in sporting goods. And I feel we're answering that bell, but we also see that, number one, in winning in our core distribution, and number two, the ability for us to move to other places where she is shopping. It's something that you'll continue to see happening from us, with people like our department store partners and a few other places. But to answer it in one fell swoop, Kate, it's we believe our Women's business can be as large, if not bigger, than our Men's business. And we'll stick to that. And we're pretty proud of our Men’s business as well."

So we're -- we really had a breakthrough year in 2014. And again, like most things, it came down to leadership. We struggled for a long time in Europe, beginning back in 2006 when we launched, and finding our way and finding local partners that would -- spoke 6 languages and then finding Americans to send over and kind of back-and-forth. And I think we settled on someone that, a, had a great understanding and relationship with the brand in the guy named Matt Shearer, who is running our Canadian business for us and took it from basically 0 to over $100 million, and walked into a $50 million or $60 million U.S. business. And we crossed $100 million for the first time in 2014. So the momentum continues in Europe, and we're incredibly excited about that. And it's not as much today about a distribution expansion game, but it is about getting better in the places where we are doing business. Because when we say we were distributed in most of the stores, it was a few racks at best of a couple compression T-shirts and typically Men's only. And so we're looking to, I think, modify that conversation as well and take our positioning to be, first of all, a full resource brand, meaning Men's, Women's and Kid's, to show up, and where we show up, to show up in presence. Sporting goods, particularly in a place like the U.K., has been a pretty challenged place from a discount environment. And so we're also looking to be able to offset that of maybe creating a unique experience for people in wholesale distribution. And then not unlike you're seeing us do here in America, we want to augment that with our own full-priced stores. The Brand House concept is something we're incredibly proud of, and it's really been working for us. And anchoring us back to America for just a second, the 30,000 square feet we just opened up in Chicago, we can only dream about what that would do from a brand elevation standpoint and celebrating some of the stories that we have in the area. But I can tell you, as a company, as we look to move forward, we will continue to have wholesale be an incredibly important part of what we do. But where we look for statement retail in our breadth -- through our Brand House concepts, whether that means 2,000 to 3,000 square feet in some of the smaller markets, like when we mentioned Abu Dhabi, or 30,000 square feet in Chicago, I think it's important that people understand the full expression of what our brand can be. And frankly, it's not appropriate that it's always interpreted. So we'll continue to build on that. And I think you'll see more of that coming from us, particularly in a place like Europe."

So a couple of things, just some updates since we've been to -- we left you in New York and gave you a last, real deep dive on what's happening with Connected Fitness. So first of all, it's still very -- it's very new. And the MyFitnessPal deal just closed on March 17, so we're less than 30 days roughly into our partnership and getting to know one another. As we said, the first year was all going to be about integration, the integration begins with culture. Culture of 4 different companies really coming together, and we've been doing that with MapMyFitness from Austin. A couple -- 5, 6 weeks ago, we just opened our new 35,000 square-foot office in Austin, which is -- look, it's an incredibly hot tech market, and the Under Armour Connected Fitness office there, anchored with Robin and his team, is no exception to it. So I think that we're beginning sort of putting a flag on the ground of what that Under Armour attitude looks like. And it's evolving with -- it's taking the best things, I believe, of the culture that were, like at MapMyFitness, and evolving that together to really help shape Under Armour. And it's no different with Endomondo and MyFitnessPal in the way that we're going to approach that. The first thing we realized in the integration efforts though is that this need for alignment from a systems perspective. So now between our own E-Commerce, the number of people, we have 40-some-odd -- close to 50 million people walking into our retail stores in North America this year, the 130 million unique users that we have in the platform, of finding a way to synthesize all this information is where the SAP integration really comes from. So we're looking for this single view of the consumer that will give a much better picture and easier understanding of our consumer. I think it's going to make us a lot smarter also in the long run to be able to anticipate the needs of our athletes and of our consumers. The second thing that we really focus on is building out the community. So within all of the apps, I mentioned some of the stats in my written comments, but building the world's largest 24/7, 365-day digital health and fitness community. In the first quarter alone, we added over 10 million. And I want to be clear, we expect to update you on the growth numbers in our Connected Fitness in 10 million unit increments. So when we cross 120 million, when we cross 130 million, we cross 140 million, that's how I will be -- we'll be articulating that. And you just look at the sheer scale. Where we don't want to compromise MyFitnessPal, Endomondo or MapMyFitness', those -- their individual apps and their downloads. We want to continue to encourage that, but we want to continue to focus on them all helping us with Under Armour records, sort of the collaborative product that we're going to build, that we think will then be able to aggregate those disparate communities into one place and time by satisfying them. And so using all the mind power that we have from Mehta [ph], mike Lee and Robin, of the founders of the 3 sites, I -- we think that we have the capacity and the capability to do that. In showing that we're not slowing down any of that growth, I mean, we average over 130,000 people who are downloading 1 of the 4 apps every single day in the first quarter. And we're not really seeing any signs of that slowing anytime soon. So there was a bit of concern and trepidation in our part speaking about how we define victory, is that are people are going to say they've -- now that it involves [ph] that [ph] company, I'm not going to use it any more. So we haven't seen any signs of that. We just see them now having a higher expectation, I think, of the product that we're going to deliver. And I can tell you that everyone now with -- are closing on 500 people working in our Connected Fitness and digital spaces are focused on working toward that. So what I'll tell you is that I'm going to hold back before I truly define victory. I'm just going to start with we think we've -- we grab something that's incredibly unique, that's really large in size and scale. And that with that, there is the monetization things that we've talked about, that we can look at, from a, the brand halo effect, subscription services, products in bundles, premium product services that we can showcase. But at the end of the day, we're still finding out exactly what we have. Meanwhile, we're going to continue to grow what we have. We're going to be thoughtful about the investment that we make there. And we're going to continue to encourage things as they come to us. I mean, the Apple Watch is a great example of that. I mean, 3 of our 4 apps are now completely compatible with the Apple Watch and we encourage it. We think it's another conversation around tracking and wearables in health and fitness. And so it's actually the best thing that can happen to us. And so those are the good things that I think are happening. But we're also working on building great new products. And what I can tell you is that -- I'm going to give -- we've put one flag in the sand, we want a little more time to reflect, we want a little more time to get used to the flights that we're getting used to between Baltimore, to Austin, to San Francisco to Copenhagen and get them comfortable with us and us comfortable with them. And we anticipate to have some very large news for you around Under Armour's Investor Day in September."

Again, on the total revenue side, we talked about growing at 25%. But obviously at a constant currency, we were at 27%. And then we -- estimated impact of due to port delays and weather, 1% to 2%. I'll be honest with you, I think we're being pretty conservative there. The thing that we can really measure and define accurately there is the retail piece, our own retail. And we know that our own retail was at least at 1 percentage point due to store closures, about for 2 different weekends during the first quarter, where the storms hit on the weekend and we literally had dozens of stores closed down. It's a little more difficult to estimate the exact impact of port on our businesses, of both in DTC and wholesale. And a little more difficult to impact the weather impact on our wholesale business, too, to some degree. So we think that 1% to 2% is pretty conservative. So again, total revenue going from 25% to 29%, I guess, if you use the upper end of that port and weather impact. On the DTC side, again, I think if you look at weather and port, we'd probably be more, I would say, in the upper 20s as a percentage growth, which would be similar to our growth rate in the fourth quarter for DTC. The biggest driver of DTC growth change year-over-year as we've talked about is the fact that we're opening up less Factory House stores, so we planned our DTC growth down year-over-year because of the slower growth in Factory House for us. And again, that was as planned. On the E-Commerce side in DTC, we've seen consistent strong growth in E-Commerce. There's not really -- when you look at Q1's growth rate versus last year's growth rates, pretty consistent growth rate overall in E-Commerce. So most of that decline in DTC growth rate was coming from the retail side. A lot of it -- some of it being planned and some of it being because of the impact of weather. If you also -- just to take a little bit further, the impact to North America, obviously, we put our North America at 20% growth. Again, if you take into effect the FX, which is a more on Canadian business, and again, the port and weather challenges, we probably were closer to probably a 24% or so growth rate in North America, normalized, taking into those items. So DTC going forward, I think, obviously, what we would expect not really any impact going forward for port and weather, obviously, in the next few quarters. However, again, just to make you aware that we have planned slower growth specifically around Factory House new doors."

Tom Brady, 2014 Super Bowl MVP, third time being named the MVP. Memphis Depay, the 20-year old footballer that we just signed in somebody that we have great expectation, I think, of what he's going to be as we move into the beautiful game in a bigger way. Jordan, obviously. Andy Murray, the #3 ranked tennis player in the world. Misty Copeland, one of the top -- one of the Most Influential People by Time Magazine. Lindsey Vonn, I think another maven, just on the Women's side, in defining what a beautiful athlete is. And then Steph Curry. So without question, Jordan and Steph are 2 that incredibly relevant right now and make a lot of sense. With Jordan, I think we're letting it come to us. I mean, incredibly proud, I think, of the styling and the way that we dress Jordan. It was incredibly athletic, it was incredibly Under Armour, it was incredibly bold and it was incredibly American. And we think that, that story is something that's going to translate as Under Armour continues to move itself from just being a product that's seen and perceived about being on court, on field, on pitch, on the course, whatever that may be, and as we continue to move to other places. Now this doesn't mean that we begin to comprise who we are in the fact that every Under Armour product does something for you, but I just think that people are finding and seeing more ways you can utilize and interact with our brand. So having someone like Jordan be able to showcase those looks for us over the next decade, and frankly throughout the rest of his career, is something we're incredibly excited about. I mean, you look at sportswear over the last 30 years where transformational athletes have lived and have been successful, it's golf and basketball. And sitting on Jordan, that we think has that type of upside and potential, it's pretty remarkable. So he's got a lot more career to play, it's one tournament. But I can tell you, when you sit down with Jordan Spieth, there's every belief that he's going to win every golf tournament every time he heads out and takes the tee box. And I can just tell you that not every golfer thinks like that. He's different, he's special and we're going to continue to evolve that. So from a PR standpoint, I think we had a great pop, we had 4 great days of celebrating him. And there'll be more to come and most will be spoken through his play. As far as Steph goes, it's certainly not guaranteed, nothing is guaranteed. But no matter what happens with the MVP vote, we couldn't be more proud just to have someone like Stephen Curry. Is that -- I said this before, is that the crew he rolls with is -- his wife, his kid, his mom and his dad and right down to his agent, his entire organization is just really some of the best people that we deal with. And so I'm as proud, I think, of the quality of people we have and then of course what they're doing on court. But Steph, from the Curry One to the Curry Two, we've been modifying and chasing that a little bit. Where we had pretty limited, I think, expectations of what we really wanted to do with that product to begin with, and looking and saying the places we have, coming from places like China, are really just extraordinary. And so I think there's probably been some books written about how you're supposed to limit and allocate and tighten things up. And so don't get me wrong, we're not going to open the floodgates, but we definitely see this as a watershed moment for us with several of our athletes to take advantage of things that -- you just don't get these opportunities in life. And so the train is going by, we're going to hop on the train and we will exploit that to the sense where it makes the best sense for our athlete and continuing their performance, first and foremost, as well as things that will celebrate the brand and help drive a great business. So the Curry One, the Curry Two, like I've seen the Curry Three and the Curry Four, so this is a -- being in the signature basketball business, we've sort of been around it before, but now we're really in the game. And it's something that we like very much. And at the same time, it's going to help elevate what was a $100-ish or a little less than $100 million-ish dollar basketball business. And our goal is building $1 billion basketball brand."

Yes, if you look at the nuances here, I think that the big stories are the foreign currency impact and airfreight. And if you look at just the -- how the timing of those works out, the biggest pressure for airfreight, which again is mostly around mitigating the West Coast port delays, is going to be in the front half of the year. We talked about it in Q1, also had some of it, some residual going into Q2 also. And then when you look at FX, your biggest impact, we're going to have impacts every quarter for FX, but your biggest impacts are going to be Q2 and Q3, kind of right in the middle of the year. When you kind of line those 2 things up together, your second quarter probably is your biggest challenge because you have both FX and airfreight. In Q3, you end up just with kind of more of an FX impact. And as you get to Q4, the FX impact's still there in Q4, just a little bit less so. Because as you recall, the strengthening of the dollar started to happen in Q4 last year. So your comp gets a little bit easier, but you still have do some challenge in FX in Q4 also."

So I want to be clear that our Japanese business is -- continues to be our largest business outside the United States, closing around $300 million business for us, but that shows up as a licensing partnership that we have there. But without question, I think, even considering Europe and the growth -- the great growth that we're seeing there, in the 30% and 40% type of growth range that we're experiencing there. China is one of those -- it seems like an abundantly limitless place. And so we're just experienced and feeling a bit of that. We finished 2014 with about roughly 57 stores by the end of the year. We made mention that we're going to be opening 100 stores outside of North America today. The majority of those are actually going to be in China. so probably come close to doubling the number of stores we have in China. And these are partner stores that we show up. And a lot of it is going to be a learning process. I mentioned Erick Haskell, who begins with us April 1. He was previously the CFO and COO of Adidas China, and he's -- he was, before we brought him on, is the MD of Adidas India. So he's somebody that we look at and say this is somebody who's sort of been there, done it. They've seen the movie. And really, while it's not as easy as a find and replace, our brand is incredibly unique and different, the partnerships and relationships that are there are something that we really just need to tap into. We feel like we've established, I think, done a lot of the hard work in China, as we've been there now -- really, we opened our first steward [ph] store there in 2010. So we've done a lot of slugging, put the hard work in. And frankly, with some of these relevant global assets we have, and whether that is Stephen Curry, that we're working on a tour of China with Stephen at some point later this year; or whether that is the relevance of a Jordan showing up; or the EPL, whether it's Tottenham Hotspur; we're now having Memphis Depay showing up as well. So we think that we're doing things to interact and be relevant in that market. And China is almost its own world. And so we believe that when focus, and now we have the foundations in place, that we're really going to be able to, number one, bring something to China and give something to China. And in turn, we think that's going to have a -- in reap a great reward for Under Armour and ultimately our shareholders, too."

The biggest change being the amount of amortization that we were anticipating back in February and the intangibles in the acquisition came in a little bit different as far as value. And the useful lives are a little bit longer, so we had a little bit of a benefit in amortization there for Connected Fitness offsetting some of those headwinds we had in FX and airfreight. In addition, in our core business, we do see some opportunities, again, for some additional savings to help offset the -- some of the other headwinds we talked about earlier.

There are 1,696 players in the NFL, and there's only 1 Super Bowl MVP. 
There have been hundreds of skiers in the Women's Alpine circuit since 2004 but just one has won 67 times. 
There are 450 players in the NBA and there is, at least in my mind, just 1 MVP. 
There are 125 players on the PGA Tour and there is only 1 Masters champion. 
The numbers associated with the recent performances of Under Armour athletes like Tom Brady, Lindsey Vonn, Stephen Curry, and most recently, Jordan Spieth, are compelling and true evidence that we are just getting started. 
Three months ago, we talked you about some of the important numbers Under Armour achieved in 2014. So far in 2015, we put some equally impressive numbers on the scoreboard. 
First, there were acquisitions of MyFitnessPal and Endomondo, which combined with our existing MapMyFitness and UA Record platform, created the world's largest digital health and fitness community, now with over 130 million unique users. 
We opened our Chicago Brand House, 30,000 square feet of Magnificent Mile with the best presentation of the Under Armour brand experience anywhere in the world. 
We've opened a store in the Mall of America, bringing the Under Armour brand to more than 40 million shoppers annually. 
We signed São Paulo Futebol Clube, Brazil's most successful club with 18 overall titles and more than 17 million supporters in that market. 
And with the results from our first quarter, we've now recorded 20 consecutive quarters of 20-plus percent revenue growth. That's 5 years since our last quarter with less than 20% revenue growth. Or to put it more topically, back before Jordan Spieth had his driver's license. 
But without question, the most impressive performances were put together by the Under Armour athletes I mentioned earlier. So indulge me for a minute while I talk about these record-setting performances from Under Armour athletes so far in 2015. 
Tom Brady won his fourth Super Bowl ring and his third Super Bowl MVP award. Lindsey Vonn broke the record for most career Alpine Skiing Women's World Cup wins. Stephen Curry, the league's most unguardable player, led his team in the best record in the NBA and is my choice to win the NBA's MVP award when it's announced shortly, as well as having been the leading vote-getter at the MVP All-Star game. 
Jordan Spieth, a record-setting performance at The Masters, where he became the first player to win wire to wire since 1976. He reached 19 under, which no one had ever done in the history of the tournament, set the record for most birdies at 1 Masters with 28 and became only the second man in 100 years to win a major wire to wire at 21 years or younger. Equally important, Jordan dominated those 4 days at The Masters with a sense of purpose and will that defined both him and Under Armour. 
Part of the formula for success in our business is making a big bet, and we did so when we signed Jordan as a teenager a few years ago. 
To quote the great Dodgers executive, Branch Rickey, luck is a residue of design. And knowing that we have Jordan Spieth as the face of Under Armour golf into the future solidifies our presence in the category and aligns us with the new face of golf in the United States. 
We're proud to be associated with athletes like Tom, Lindsey, Stephen and Jordan not just because of their accomplishments, but especially because the people that they are. 
The great performances of these athletes are driving sales for us, too. We had a great launch of the Curry One at the All-Star game in February, and there's tremendous buzz in the sneaker community about that shoe as well as great anticipation already around the Curry Two. 
So while it feels good to be viewed as a growing presence in the signature shoe market, it's important to recognize that we are just getting started. 
In golf apparel, our team did a great job of outfitting Jordan for The Masters, and it provided terrific visibility for our golf apparel and footwear. When we signed him, we knew he had the ability to help drive our brand beyond just golf and that we needed to align our product stores with his aggressive, young and fearless personality. 
We come a long way in the category in the last 2 years. And because we know that every detail matters, it was nice to be able to put him in that blue polo on Sunday, knowing how great it would look wearing a Green Jacket. 
Moving on to other areas of our business that continue to shine. We saw 41% growth in our Footwear business this past quarter. In addition to the heat being generated in basketball by the Curry One, our SpeedForm Gemini running shoe, at $130, continues to collect rave reviews and check at retail. 
Building off the success of our SpeedForm platform, we're introducing cleated models in both American and global football, including a boot worn by one of our newest athletes, Memphis Depay, the top scorer in the Dutch league who helped his team clinch first place Saturday with a spectacular free kick; and who, at only 21 years old, may soon become one of the most exciting players in the beautiful game. 
We continue to see strength in our core Apparel business with revenues up 21% in the quarter, the 22nd consecutive quarter of 20-plus percent apparel revenue growth, our largest category. 
In addition to our strength in golf, we were off to a strong start with the introduction of Armour, our reengineered base layer featuring enhanced ventilation. As we grow our presence in key Footwear categories like running and basketball, it's helping drive our business in those key growth categories across all Men's and Women's apparel. 
Our growing strength in Footwear is also helping to drive apparel sales with kids as we understand how critically important the footwear piece is to how our young male and female consumers dress. 
Our financial results are great evidence of the growing power of the Under Armour brand and our ability to execute against this tremendous opportunity. But operationally, we believe we have yet to play our best game. We believe there's a great opportunity to improve both how our supply chain gets product to market and how our product looks once we get there. On the latter, our growing pipeline of innovation in footwear, apparel, accessories and Connected Fitness provides us with the opportunity to evolve our model by providing better merchandising to our wholesale partners, as well as in our own Direct-to-Consumer businesses. 
We are adding human capital to our global merchandising function, starting with Kevin Eskridge, who will run our global merchandising team after 2-plus years successfully establishing our brand in China. 
The Under Armour brand will continue to grow by ensuring we show up in a premium way whenever our consumer interacts with our brand, whether that's in a wholesale partner store, our own doors, an E-Commerce environment or anywhere our brand is available. 
Our ability to stratify our presentation at retail with multiple end-use categories is an asset we have yet to fully maximize, and we believe these types of surgical improvements in our merchandising will help ensure our continued growth with our wholesale partners. 
In our DTC business, we are laser-focused on using our Brand House stores provide that elite presentation of the Under Armour brand. That presentation is on display at our newest 30,000 square-foot Brand House store on Magnificent Mile in Chicago where we've dedicated space for Men's and Women's, running, golf, basketball, hunt, studio and youth, as well as deep presentations of local assets like Notre Dame, Northwestern, the Cubs and White Sox. 
It's also our first opportunity to bring our Connected Fitness story to our consumer, and we will evolve that experience as we continue to develop our Brand House presence. 
Our Connected Fitness community added over 10 million unique users since our last call in February and now totals more than 130 million combined. We average more than 130,000 people in the first quarter downloading 1 of our 4 apps. We are focused on integrating the 4 companies and continued development of the individual apps as we build out the Under Armour record platform. 
To build on this, we're expanding our partnership with SAP for the infrastructure that will help us create a single integrated view of our consumer. We believe the brands that can build true communities among their consumers by improving their health and fitness will be best positioned, and we are focused on the competitive advantage we enjoy by having the world's largest digital health and fitness community. 
The final piece I want to cover today is our fastest-growing business: International, where we grew 74% this past quarter. We continue to show great strength as the Under Armour brand establishes itself as an authentic athletic brand in new markets. We will add over 100 total stores outside United States in 2015. And this past quarter, we opened our first stores in Abu Dhabi and Brazil. Next month, we will be in Brazil to unveil the kits for our newest team, São Paulo Futebol Clube, the most successful club in the country's history. Adding key assets like São Paulo accelerates our presence in these new markets and helps us deliver authenticity as we establish ourselves in global football. 
And finally, on International, we are most excited about the fact that we are just getting started. I mentioned earlier that we are bringing our former GM in China back to run our global merchandising team. Taking over is our new GM in China is Erick Haskell, who brings extensive industry experience in the country as he leads what will be one of our largest countries in revenue outside North America by the end of 2015. 
So whether it was football cleats when we entered that market, golf with Jordan Spieth or basketball with Stephen Curry, we've consistently proven our ability to go hard and disrupt key categories, which we believe positions us as the next great global athletic brand. And with the additional asset of our Connected Fitness platform, we believe we can do so in a way that connects us to our consumer like no other brand on the planet. 
We are truly just getting started. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Brad."
8740684,289992748,791233,"Under Armour, Inc., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2015",2015-04-21,"Earnings Calls","Under Armour, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Kevin. I'd now like to spend some time discussing our first quarter results followed by our updated outlook for 2015. Our net revenues for the first quarter of 2015 increased 25% to $805 million. As Kevin highlighted, our results represent the 2",2078,"Thanks, Kevin. I'd now like to spend some time discussing our first quarter results followed by our updated outlook for 2015. 
Our net revenues for the first quarter of 2015 increased 25% to $805 million. As Kevin highlighted, our results represent the 20th straight quarter of achieving above 20% top line growth. We are proud of this consistency, particularly in a period where several external headwinds, including the strong U.S. dollar, negatively impacted our business. 
On a currency-neutral basis, net revenues increased 27% for the period. In addition, our North American business experienced some disruptions from the West Coast port delays and weather-related store closures during the period, which we estimate had a 1% to 2% cumulative impact on overall net revenues. 
Looking at our product categories, we grew apparel net revenues 21% to $555 million compared to $459 million in the prior year's quarter. Despite the impact of some of the headwinds I just outlined, we were able to post strong results in our largest product category led by the introductions of Armour Baselayer and our updated training platform, as well as continued growth in golf and running. 
First quarter Footwear net revenues increased 41% to $161 million from $114 million the prior year, representing 20% of our total business for the first time since our initial running shoe launch in early 2009. 
As the centerpieces of our first Brand Holiday of 2015, our new SpeedForm Gemini and Apollo event running shoes, as well as Stephen Curry's first signature basketball shoe, the Curry One, drove tremendous excitement for the category in the marketplace. 
Our accessories net revenues during the first quarter increased 23% to $63 million from $52 million last year with particular strength within our bags line. 
Our global Direct-to-Consumer net revenues increased 21% for the quarter, representing approximately 25% of net revenues. 
The E-Commerce growth rate exceeded our retail growth rate during the quarter, with weather driving store closures for several of our domestic doors during the quarter. Nevertheless, we were excited with the retail progress we made during the quarter, including strong new Brand House openings in Chicago on the Magnificent Mile and in Minneapolis at the Mall of America, as well of our first Brand House store in Brazil. 
From a global standpoint, we ended the first quarter with 153 owned stores, including 134 Factory House stores and 19 Brand House stores compared to 134 owned stores in the year-ago period comprised of 123 Factory House stores and 11 Brand House stores. 
In our E-Commerce channel, we continue to see strong overall trends as our consumer continues to shift to mobile, which represented over 40% of our traffic and nearly 20% of our E-Commerce sales during the period. At the same time, we're seeing a strong response to our new local E-Commerce sites, including the first quarter launches in the Philippines and The Netherlands, which we believe is indicative of some of the untapped demand in these markets. 
Looking at our regions. North America net revenues increased 20% to $700 million in the first quarter compared to $583 million in the prior year's quarter. On a currency-neutral basis, North America net revenues increased 21% for the period, driven primarily by the growth in Apparel and Footwear categories in our Direct-to-Consumer channel, as I just outlined. 
International net revenues increased 74% to $96 million in the first quarter and represented 12% of total net revenues. On a currency-neutral basis, International net revenues increased 86% for the period. This was the first quarter in Under Armour's history where the International mix surpassed 10%. 
In the EMEA region, in addition to a strong launch of our new Dutch website, we celebrated the opening of our new office in Germany, which puts us closer to our customers at a time when we are beginning to see strong traction within the market. 
We are also just beginning our new distributor agreement in the Middle East, which includes the January opening of our first regional Brand House store in Abu Dhabi. 
In Asia Pacific, we more than tripled our business in China as we began to accelerate our partner store expansion efforts and experienced significant traction across E-Commerce. We also remain in the early stages of our expansion efforts in Southeast Asia, Taiwan and Hong Kong. 
Finally, in Latin America. We are still less than a year into our market entry in Brazil, and we are seeing success building brand awareness with efforts such as our recent signing of São Paulo Futebol Clube, the opening of our first Brand House store in São Paulo and a local marketing push in conjunction with our SpeedForm Gemini launch. 
Moving on to margins. First quarter gross margins held steady year-over-year at 46.9%, with 3 primary factors contributing to this performance during the quarter. 
First, favorable product margins in both North American and International Apparel and Footwear benefited gross margins by approximately 110 basis points for the period. 
Second, higher air freight cost primarily tied to our efforts to mitigate the impacts of the West Coast port disruptions negatively impacted gross margins by approximately 60 basis points in the period. 
Finally, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar negatively impacted gross margins by approximately 50 basis points for the period as we purchased the majority of our inventory for International businesses in U.S. dollars. 
Selling, general, administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues de-leveraged 80 basis points to 43.5% in the first quarter of 2015 from 42.7% in the prior year's period. 
Starting this quarter, in an effort to simplify and streamline our conversation, we are consolidating our SG&A detail into 2 primary buckets: Marketing and other SG&A. Other SG&A is the sum of our previously outlined selling, product innovation and supply chain and corporate services buckets. 
SG&A details for the first quarter are as follows: Marketing cost decreased to 13.4% of net revenues for the quarter from 13.7% in the prior year period, driven primarily by the shift of certain planned expenditures to later in 2015. 
Other SG&A cost increased to 30.1% of net revenues for the quarter from 29% in the prior year, driven primarily by our Connected Fitness acquisitions and investments in Brand House and E-Commerce. The onetime deal closing cost of $6.3 million for the Connected Fitness acquisitions negatively impacted the quarter by approximately 80 basis points. 
Operating income for the first quarter increased 3% to $28 million compared with $27 million in the prior year period. Interest and other expense for the first quarter increased to $4 million compared with $2 million in the prior year period, primarily reflecting increased interest expense associated with the financing of our Connected Fitness acquisitions. 
Our first quarter tax rate of 50.3% was unfavorable to the 46.1% rate last year, primarily driven by increased losses in our newer Latin American businesses. Discrete tax items such as International losses are particularly impactful to our effective tax rate in periods such as the first quarter with lower consolidated pretax income levels. 
Given these factors below the operating line, our first quarter net income decreased 13% to $12 million compared to $14 million the prior year period, while our diluted earnings per share decreased to $0.05 from $0.06 in the prior year's period. 
On the balance sheet, total cash and cash equivalents for the quarter increased 29% to $232 million compared with $180 million at March 31, 2014. 
Inventory for the quarter increased 22% to $578 million compared to $472 million at March 31, 2014. 
Total debt increased to $677 million as compared to $152 million at March 31, 2014, and $284 million at December 31, 2014. The first quarter increase reflects the financing of our Connected Fitness acquisitions, including $250 million on our revolving line of credit and an additional $150 million of term debt. 
Looking at our cash flows. Our investment and capital expenditures was $68 million for the first quarter compared to $31 million in the prior year's period, driven primarily by our investments in our new North American distribution center, our corporate headquarters in Baltimore and our global fixturing and retail strategies. 
Now moving on to our updated 2015 guidance. Based on current visibility, we expect 2015 net revenues of approximately $3.78 billion, representing growth of 23%, and 2015 operating income in the range of $400 million to $408 million, representing growth of 13% to 15%. Our operating income guidance includes the dilutive impact of the Connected Fitness acquisitions, consisting of $6.3 million of onetime transaction cost incurred in the first quarter, as well as full year operating losses from these businesses and noncash amortization charges of the intangible assets generated from the acquisitions. 
Below operating results, we estimate a $9 million increase year-over-year in interest expense, primarily due to incremental borrowings under our credit agreement to fund the Connected Fitness acquisitions. 
We currently expect a full year effective tax rate of approximately 41%, which is higher than previously anticipated given the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar, which negatively impacts our International profitability, which in turn negatively impacts our consolidated tax rate. 
As this impact is more pronounced in quarters with lower consolidated pretax profits, our guidance assumes a second quarter tax rate similar to our first quarter rate, followed by a more normalized effective tax rate expected in the back half of the year. 
I would also -- I'd like to add some color on several items, starting with revenues. As we indicated last quarter and as reflected in our first quarter results, International and Footwear are areas that are planned to outperform in 2015 as we continue to enter and expand in new markets and see successes across our footwear lines. 
From a macro standpoint, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar is expected to impact our 2015 net revenues by approximately 2 to 3 percentage points given current exchange rates, and we have factored this into our updated guidance. 
Now looking at gross margins. Given the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar, along with anticipated higher ongoing air freight needed to service to our customers, we now expect full year gross margin will be roughly in line with last year's 49% rate. This compares to our prior guidance of a modest year-over-year improvement. Specifically, we expect our second quarter and third quarter margins will be down approximately 50 basis points compared to last year. 
We continue to plan for higher air freight expenses in the second quarter as we continue our efforts to mitigate the impacts of the West Coast port disruptions. While the negative impact of the stronger U.S. dollar is expected to have the most pronounced margin impact in the second and third quarters. 
In SG&A, the timing of certain expenses has resulted in some changes to our quarterly cadence. Given our current visibility, we now expect SG&A expense deleverage of approximately 200 basis points during the second quarter, including higher costs associated with our Brand House strategy given the timing of store openings, as well as the timing of certain marketing and innovation expenditures. 
We anticipate SG&A will continue to deleverage, albeit to a lesser degree, during the third quarter before showing modest leverage during the fourth quarter. 
From an operating income standpoint, while the gross margin headwinds have increased since our previous guidance, we have seen some offsetting impacts from our Connected Fitness acquisitions primarily related to lower amortization expense than previously anticipated. 
In addition, we continue to expect to mitigate some of the overall margin pressures through targeted improvements in gross margin and SG&A with the largest offset emerging in the fourth quarter. 
Finally, some updates on our planned capital expenditures. We have previously indicated planned 2015 capital expenditures in the range of $280 million to $290 million, inclusive of approximately $90 million for our new domestic distribution center and the expansion of our corporate headquarters at Baltimore. 
Following our recent acquisitions in the Connected Fitness space, we began looking into areas of integration tied to our overall business. An important first step is our technology platform. As such, we've decided to invest in our systems with SAP to enhance, expand and integrate our core Apparel and Footwear systems, along with our Connected Fitness platforms. This project will occur over the next few years with the initial phases occurring in 2015. As a result, we now expect 2015 capital expenditures in the range of $330 million to $340 million.

And I've mo",836,"Well, I think a couple of things we've done is just from an organization standpoint, the way we structured. So Brad, as you know, has taken on additional responsibilities and making -- shuffling some things around where we prioritize Footwear. And I've moved Kip and have him exclusively focused on Footwear and innovation. And I think it's really going to be a driver for the company with what you'll see coming out as we see this massive opportunity in Footwear. At the same time, supply chain, particularly as you get more complex, particularly as you look to grow globally, it's incredibly complex. And frankly, for us, much further beyond what we were just making. We used to sell tight t-shirts and we'd put them in sporting goods stores and they would sell. And now it's a much more complex and diverse line. And you have things like Women's that includes fashion and flow and all these other pieces that come to bear. Doing business with other markets is incredibly sophisticated and difficult as well. We just opened -- or just broke ground, rather a few months ago, a new distribution facility down in Tennessee. And things like that, that are happening and taking place for us. When -- I wanted that to come across, frankly, a bit deprecating for the company in terms of we just think we can do better. We're incredibly proud, I think, of the results that we've put on the paper and what we've done, particularly from an apparel standpoint, with 22 consecutive quarters and then posting the growth that we have. But as I said, we have yet to play our best game. So I don't think that what Brad is building out with our team and Jim Hardy, who's been our Chief Supply Chain Officer here for the last several years, and bringing to bear the expertise. I can tell you what we're doing physically with warehouses and some of the other components, but also systems are going to play a massive role in where we're heading. One of the things I also mentioned was our new partnership with SAP, who -- Bill McDermott has been on our board for the last 9 or nearly 10 years. And so we've had a lot of insight into what -- running -- what best-run companies do and what they look like. And I think we're now in a position that we're big enough to be able to implement that, but not too big where it will actually be a hindrance to the company. So I think there's a renewed vigor as that what we've done to date has been good, and we've done well. But we're just looking and saying, from a company that now has a focus on things like Women's where we're looking to turn product every 3 and 4 weeks versus having 2 seasons a year, doing business and truly having distribution facilities in Europe, in Asia, in Southeast Asia and Latin America, around the world, and figuring out this complicated supply chains that include things like duty and tariff. In all of that -- those other issues, it's just -- it's becoming a much more complicated world and we're elevating ourselves. And so Brad is moving away from the CFO, which of course will continue to report to him. It's part of the challenge with closing on $4 billion or close to $2 billion in FOB this year, with gross margin moving up a few bps, let alone a percentage point or 2, has a massive impact in the company. So we think that we've done well, we think that we've been probably a little fat in getting to this point, and we're just looking and recognizing the fact that if we -- when we begin to tighten the belt and bring in professionals, this is not like finding a new designer where you're hoping somewhere can do the job. There's lots of people that have this expertise and experience from some of the fast fashion people that are great to learn from as well as what we can implement ourselves. And so I think what you're seeing is the company growing up. And the last thing I'll just say is around the merchandising function. We did not have a merchandising function in the organization. And I say that from -- we had product people that built product and we had salespeople that sold it in and then the buyers would select what they wanted. But truly, curating and articulating exactly the voice that we want depending on the distribution is not a function that we had at the company. And so what you're seeing, I believe, is a more sophisticated Under Armour. And at the end of the day, I think we're going to have a better end result for our consumer, first and foremost, that will continue to drive the kind of results that I think we've made everyone accustomed to over the last 5 years."

Beginn",737,"Sure. Well, Kate, I think, first of all, we see this general trend toward athletic in Women's fashion as a whole is something that -- we don't see it slowing any time soon, and we're very fortunate for that, I think, being the heart and soul of it. Beginning -- going back to 2014, we're incredibly proud, I believe, of the conversation that we kicked off with the I WILL WHAT I WANT campaign that began with Misty Copeland and that aspirational commercial that we had with Misty, and then following up with Gisele. That -- the momentum from that is something that we're still feeling today. And capping it off last week with Misty being named one of Time Magazine's 100 Most Influential People on the planet. So I think we're having a bigger conversation than even what is the style, color that's in the store. At the end of the day, though, that is that what we do for a living and we're looking at how the style, color hits in the store. I'm not sure that we have taken full advantage of the conversation that we started from a product merchandising standpoint. And we believe that there's a greater opportunity for us in Women's to have a conversation with her. That is, meeting her where she is versus asking her to come to us. And we articulated that last year with this idea of athletic -- the female athlete versus the athletic female. And so I think you'll continue to see styles and silhouettes. And speaking about Under Armour, we basically built our Women's business on the back of the compression shorts and sports bras. And where we're trying to show up in more places for and being more relevant beyond just strictly in the gym or what she's wearing beneath, I think, is part of where we're going. And I say that in the context of we built a $600 million Women's business in -- by the end of 2014. So there's no signs of this slowing. I think you're just seeing us continue to sophisticate. But we feel great, I believe, about the team that we put in place, the momentum we have and the direction that we're going. A couple of things that play with that as well, and I think it's worth mentioning, is our Connected Fitness platform, which in bringing that on and assembling that community of now over 130 million, more than 60% of which are women. And so as we really get our arms around what we have there, we believe that continuing that conversation with her and having -- finding ways to have meaningful conversations, number one, of how we can communicate there, but also how we can listen to her. And so I think you'll see Under Armour continue to take those steps toward being more relevant in more aspects of her life. And I guess that there's one message that I wanted to get across today, and whether it's sort of maybe a bit masked in the merchandising, is that we don't believe we've played our best game yet. We don't think when you walk into our store, you're getting the best version of Under Armour yet. And it's where we were and we're proud of it, but we believe that there's people out there that are doing it well. We believe we're one of those people, we just think we can do a lot better. So more to come in that. If I end it with anything, and maybe just quickly on distribution. Talking about meeting her where she is, our sporting goods partners have been incredibly aggressive in this space as well with our sells, with our merchandising, with the way we set up. There's actually a lot of competition in sporting goods. And I feel we're answering that bell, but we also see that, number one, in winning in our core distribution, and number two, the ability for us to move to other places where she is shopping. It's something that you'll continue to see happening from us, with people like our department store partners and a few other places. But to answer it in one fell swoop, Kate, it's we believe our Women's business can be as large, if not bigger, than our Men's business. And we'll stick to that. And we're pretty proud of our Men’s business as well."

So we're -- we really had a breakthrough year in 2014. And again, like most things, it came down to leadership. We struggled for a long time in Europe, beginning back in 2006 when we launched, and finding our way and finding local partners that would -- spoke 6 languages and then finding Americans to send over and kind of back-and-forth. And I think we settled on someone that, a, had a great understanding and relationship with the brand and the guy named Matt Shearer, who is running our Canadian business for us and took it from basically 0 to over $100 million, and walked into a $50 million or $60 million U.S. business. And we crossed $100 million for the first time in 2014. So the momentum continues in Europe, and we're incredibly excited about that. And it's not as much today about a distribution expansion game, but it is about getting better in the places where we are doing business. Because when we say we were distributed in most of the stores, it was a few racks at best of a couple compression T-shirts and typically Men's only. And so we're looking to, I think, modify that conversation as well and take our positioning to be, first of all, a full resource brand, meaning Men's, Women's and Kid's, to show up, and where we show up, to show up in presence. Sporting goods, particularly in a place like the U.K., has been a pretty challenged place from a discount environment. And so we're also looking to be able to offset that of maybe creating a unique experience for people in wholesale distribution. And then not unlike you're seeing us do here in America, we want to augment that with our own full-priced stores. The Brand House concept is something we're incredibly proud of, and it's really been working for us. And anchoring us back to America for just a second, the 30,000 square feet we just opened up in Chicago, we can only dream about what that would do from a brand elevation standpoint and celebrating some of the stories that we have in the area. But I can tell you, as a company, as we look to move forward, we will continue to have wholesale be an incredibly important part of what we do. But where we look for statement retail through our Brand House concepts, whether that means 2,000 to 3,000 square feet in some of the smaller markets, like when we mentioned Abu Dhabi, or 30,000 square feet in Chicago, I think it's important that people understand the full expression of what our brand can be. And frankly, it's not appropriate that it's always interpreted. So we'll continue to build on that. And I think you'll see more of that coming from us, particularly in a place like Europe."

A couple -- 5, 6 weeks ago, we just opened our new 35,000 square-foot office in Austin, which is -- look, it's an incredibly hot tech market, and the Under Armour Connected Fitness office there, anchored with Robin and his team, is no exception to it. So I think that we're beginning sort of putting a flag on the ground of what that Under Armour attitude looks like. And it's evolving with -- it's taking the best things, I believe, of the culture that were, like at MapMyFitness, and evolving that together to really help shape Under Armour. And it's no different with Endomondo and MyFitnessPal in the way that we're going to approach that. The first thing we realized in the integration efforts though is that this need for alignment from a systems perspective. So now between our own E-Commerce, the number of people, we have 40-some-odd -- close to 50 million people walking into our retail stores in North America this year, the 130 million unique users that we have in the platform, of finding a way to synthesize all this information is where the SAP integration really comes from. So we're looking for this single view of the consumer that will give a much better picture and easier understanding of our consumer. I think it's going to make us a lot smarter also in the long run to be able to anticipate the needs of our athletes and of our consumers. The second thing that we really focus on is building out the community. So within all of the apps, I mentioned some of the stats in my written comments, but building the world's largest 24/7, 365-day digital health and fitness community. In the first quarter alone, we added over 10 million. And I want to be clear, we expect to update you on the growth numbers in our Connected Fitness in 10 million unit increments. So when we cross 120 million, when we cross 130 million, we cross 140 million, that's how I will be -- we'll be articulating that. And you just look at the sheer scale. Where we don't want to compromise MyFitnessPal, Endomondo or MapMyFitness', those -- their individual apps and their downloads. We want to continue to encourage that, but we want to continue to focus on them all helping us with Under Armour records, sort of the collaborative product that we're going to build, that we think will then be able to aggregate those disparate communities into one place and time by satisfying them. And so using all the mind power that we have from Mette, Mike Lee and Robin, of the founders of the 3 sites, I -- we think that we have the capacity and the capability to do that. In showing that we're not slowing down any of that growth, I mean, we average over 130,000 people who are downloading 1 of the 4 apps every single day in the first quarter. And we're not really seeing any signs of that slowing anytime soon. So there was a bit of concern and trepidation in our part speaking about how we define victory, is that are people are going to say they've -- now that it involves that company, I'm not going to use it any more. So we haven't seen any signs of that. We just see them now having a higher expectation, I think, of the product that we're going to deliver. And I can tell you that everyone now with -- are closing on 500 people working in our Connected Fitness and digital spaces are focused on working toward that. So what I'll tell you is that I'm going to hold back before I truly define victory. I'm just going to start with we think we've -- we grab something that's incredibly unique, that's really large in size and scale. And that with that, there is the monetization things that we've talked about, that we can look at, from a, the brand halo effect, subscription services, products in bundles, premium product services that we can showcase. But at the end of the day, we're still finding out exactly what we have. Meanwhile, we're going to continue to grow what we have. We're going to be thoughtful about the investment that we make there. And we're going to continue to encourage things as they come to us. I mean, the Apple Watch is a great example of that. I mean, 3 of our 4 apps are now completely compatible with the Apple Watch and we encourage it. We think it's another conversation around tracking and wearables in health and fitness. And so it's actually the best thing that can happen to us. And so those are the good things that I think are happening. But we're also working on building great new products. And what I can tell you is that -- I'm going to give -- we've put one flag in the sand, we want a little more time to reflect, we want a little more time to get used to the flights that we're getting used to between Baltimore, to Austin, to San Francisco to Copenhagen and get them comfortable with us and us comfortable with them. And we anticipate to have some very large news for you around Under Armour's Investor Day in September."

Again, on the total revenue side, we talked about growing at 25%. But obviously at a constant currency, we were at 27%. And then we -- estimated impact of due to port delays and weather, 1% to 2%. I'll be honest with you, I think we're being pretty conservative there. The thing that we can really measure and define accurately there is the retail piece, our own retail. And we know that our own retail was at least at 1 percentage point due to store closures, for 2 different weekends during the first quarter, where the storms hit on the weekend and we literally had dozens of stores closed down. It's a little more difficult to estimate the exact impact of ports on our businesses, of both in DTC and wholesale. And a little more difficult to impact the weather impact on our wholesale business, too, to some degree. So we think that 1% to 2% is pretty conservative. So again, total revenue going from 25% to 29%, I guess, if you use the upper end of that port and weather impact. On the DTC side, again, I think if you look at weather and port, we'd probably be more, I would say, in the upper 20s as a percentage growth, which would be similar to our growth rate in the fourth quarter for DTC. The biggest driver of DTC growth change year-over-year as we've talked about is the fact that we're opening up less Factory House stores, so we planned our DTC growth down year-over-year because of the slower growth in Factory House for us. And again, that was as planned. On the E-Commerce side in DTC, we've seen consistent strong growth in E-Commerce. There's not really -- when you look at Q1's growth rate versus last year's growth rates, pretty consistent growth rate overall in E-Commerce. So most of that decline in DTC growth rate was coming from the retail side. A lot of it -- some of it being planned and some of it being because of the impact of weather. If you also -- just to take a little bit further, the impact to North America, obviously, we put our North America at 20% growth. Again, if you take into effect the FX, which is a more on Canadian business, and again, the port and weather challenges, we probably were closer to probably a 24% or so growth rate in North America, normalized, taking into those items. So DTC going forward, I think, obviously, what we would expect not really any impact going forward for port and weather, obviously, in the next few quarters. However, again, just to make you aware that we have planned slower growth specifically around Factory House new doors."

Tom Brady, 2014 Super Bowl MVP, third time being named the MVP. Memphis Depay, the 20-year old footballer that we just signed in somebody that we have great expectation, I think, of what he's going to be as we move into the beautiful game in a bigger way. Jordan, obviously. Andy Murray, the #3 ranked tennis player in the world. Misty Copeland, one of the top 100 Most Influential People by Time Magazine. Lindsey Vonn, I think another maven, just on the Women's side, in defining what a beautiful athlete is. And then Steph Curry. So without question, Jordan and Steph are 2 that incredibly relevant right now and make a lot of sense. With Jordan, I think we're letting it come to us. I mean, incredibly proud, I think, of the styling and the way that we dress Jordan. It was incredibly athletic, it was incredibly Under Armour, it was incredibly bold and it was incredibly American. And we think that, that story is something that's going to translate as Under Armour continues to move itself from just being a product that's seen and perceived about being on court, on field, on pitch, on the course, whatever that may be, and as we continue to move to other places. Now this doesn't mean that we begin to comprise who we are in the fact that every Under Armour product does something for you, but I just think that people are finding and seeing more ways you can utilize and interact with our brand. So having someone like Jordan be able to showcase those looks for us over the next decade, and frankly throughout the rest of his career, is something we're incredibly excited about. I mean, you look at sportswear over the last 30 years where transformational athletes have lived and have been successful, it's golf and basketball. And sitting on Jordan, that we think has that type of upside and potential, it's pretty remarkable. So he's got a lot more career to play, it's one tournament. But I can tell you, when you sit down with Jordan Spieth, there's every belief that he's going to win every golf tournament every time he heads out and takes the tee box. And I can just tell you that not every golfer thinks like that. He's different, he's special and we're going to continue to evolve that. So from a PR standpoint, I think we had a great pop, we had 4 great days of celebrating him. And there'll be more to come and most will be spoken through his play. As far as Steph goes, it's certainly not guaranteed, nothing is guaranteed. But no matter what happens with the MVP vote, we couldn't be more proud just to have someone like Stephen Curry. Is that -- I said this before, is that the crew he rolls with is -- his wife, his kid, his mom and his dad and right down to his agent, his entire organization is just really some of the best people that we deal with. And so I'm as proud, I think, of the quality of people we have and then of course what they're doing on court. But Steph, from the Curry One to the Curry Two, we've been modifying and chasing that a little bit. Where we had pretty limited, I think, expectations of what we really wanted to do with that product to begin with, and looking and saying the places we have, coming from places like China, are really just extraordinary. And so I think there's probably been some books written about how you're supposed to limit and allocate and tighten things up. And so don't get me wrong, we're not going to open the floodgates, but we definitely see this as a watershed moment for us with several of our athletes to take advantage of things that -- you just don't get these opportunities in life. And so the train is going by, we're going to hop on the train and we will exploit that to the sense where it makes the best sense for our athlete and continuing their performance, first and foremost, as well as things that will celebrate the brand and help drive a great business. So the Curry One, the Curry Two, like I've seen the Curry Three and the Curry Four, so this is a -- being in the signature basketball business, we've sort of been around it before, but now we're really in the game. And it's something that we like very much. And at the same time, it's going to help elevate what was a $100-ish or a little less than $100 million-ish dollar basketball business. And our goal is building $1 billion basketball brand."

Yes, if you look at the nuances here, I think that the big stories are the foreign currency impact and airfreight. And if you look at just the -- how the timing of those works out, the biggest pressure for airfreight, which again is mostly around mitigating the West Coast port delays, is going to be in the front half of the year. We talked about it in Q1, also had some of it, some residual going into Q2 also. And then when you look at FX, your biggest impact, we're going to have impacts every quarter for FX, but your biggest impacts are going to be Q2 and Q3, kind of right in the middle of the year. When you kind of line those 2 things up together, your second quarter probably is your biggest challenge because you have both FX and airfreight. In Q3, you end up just with kind of more of an FX impact. And as you get to Q4, the FX impact's still there in Q4, just a little bit less so. Because as you recall, the strengthening of the dollar started to happen in Q4 last year. So your comp gets a little bit easier, but you still have do some challenge in FX in Q4 also."

So I want to be clear that our Japanese business is -- continues to be our largest business outside the United States, closing around $300 million business for us, but that shows up as a licensing partnership that we have there. But without question, I think, even considering Europe and the growth -- the great growth that we're seeing there, in the 30% and 40% type of growth range that we're experiencing there. China is one of those -- it seems like an abundantly limitless place. And so we're just experienced and feeling a bit of that. We finished 2014 with about roughly 57 stores by the end of the year. We made mention that we're going to be opening 100 stores outside of North America today. The majority of those are actually going to be in China. so probably come close to doubling the number of stores we have in China. And these are partner stores that we show up. And a lot of it is going to be a learning process. I mentioned Erick Haskell, who begins with us April 1. He was previously the CFO and COO of Adidas China, and he's -- he was, before we brought him on, is the MD of Adidas India. So he's somebody that we look at and say this is somebody who's sort of been there, done it. They've seen the movie. And really, while it's not as easy as a find and replace, our brand is incredibly unique and different, the partnerships and relationships that are there are something that we really just need to tap into. We feel like we've established, I think, done a lot of the hard work in China, as we've been there now -- really, we opened our first steward [ph] store there in 2010. So we've done a lot of slugging, put the hard work in. And frankly, with some of these relevant global assets we have, and whether that is Stephen Curry, that we're working on a tour of China with Stephen at some point later this year; or whether that is the relevance of a Jordan showing up; or the EPL, whether it's Tottenham Hotspur; we're now having Memphis Depay showing up as well. So we think that we're doing things to interact and be relevant in that market. And China is almost its own world. And so we believe that when focus, and now we have the foundations in place, that we're really going to be able to, number one, bring something to China and give something to China. And in turn, we think that's going to have a -- in reap a great reward for Under Armour and ultimately our shareholders, too."

The biggest change being the amount of amortization that we were anticipating back in February and the intangibles and the acquisition came in a little bit different as far as value. And the useful lives are a little bit longer, so we had a little bit of a benefit in amortization there for Connected Fitness offsetting some of those headwinds we had in FX and airfreight. In addition, in our core business, we do see some opportunities, again, for some additional savings to help offset the -- some of the other headwinds we talked about earlier. So overall, Connected Fitness acquisitions, we thought would be 90 basis point impact for the year, it's looking more like about 70 basis points now."

This is my last stop of a weeklong trip that is taking me to multiple cities, including Glascow, Copenhagen, and now, Munich. 
As we continue to grow our global footprint, these trips continue to provide deeper insight into the markets and how consumers are thinking about our brand. 
My visit to Copenhagen reconfirmed and enhance the excitement around our recent Endomondo acquisition and the huge opportunity that Connected Fitness provides UA with global consumers. 
With today's ribbon cutting in Munich, we'll now have 17 regional offices outside the United States, which positioned the brand closer to the local consumer and driving incredible execution we have seen in the past year, including 93% International net revenue growth just this past quarter. 
That strong growth outside the United States helped drive total net revenues for the quarter up 29%, the 21st consecutive quarter of 20-plus percent net revenue growth. 
In addition, total apparel net revenues grew by 23%, marking the 23rd consecutive quarter of 20-plus percent net revenue growth. 
We have traditionally referred to this as our scoreboard, but based on my visits to Saint Andrews early this week maybe we should refer to it as a leaderboard. Either way, we continue to shoot consistently great numbers. 
As we prepare to enter our 20th-year in the business of sports, we have learned a lot of valuable lessons. Some of them have been learned through business, but just as many probably have been learned through sport. 
Over the past year, 3 Under Armour athletes have transcended their sports and become known by just their first names, Stephen, Misty and Jordan. These 3 athletes have combined to teach us one incredibly lesson that we need to think bigger. 
For Stephen Curry, Misty Copeland and Jordan Spieth, being great basketball player, principal ballerina and PGA golfer was rooted in their ability to see beyond, to be prepared for not just be great, but to be extraordinary, to plan and practice but also know when you take the risk. Our lessons out of this are incredibly relevant to this moment in time for the Under Armour brand. 
First, our athletes' success pushes us to see beyond just maximizing the revenue opportunities in any given quarter. It forces us to think clearly about what we need to be do better, and how do we need to organize to be more than just an American sports brand, to go from changing the way athletes dress to changing the way athletes live. 
Second, this intense brand heat provides us with a bundle of opportunities to invest in businesses like basketball, Women's and golf that will not only grow our share within those large categories, but will also positively impact all of our business across both categories and geographies. 
So my 2 main topics today are how do we invest to capitalize in that momentum, and how do we organize to think bigger about the opportunities in front of us today. 
Thinking bigger is part of what drives the world's greatest athletes to outperform on the higher stage, and it's hard to think of 3 individuals who have done more of that recently than Stephen, Misty and Jordan. And the best part is, it just like UA, they, too, are just getting started. 
Stephen Curry, NBA league MVP, World Champion recently voted Best Male Athlete and Best NBA Player at ESPN and most importantly, new father of a baby girl that one day might give her big sister, Riley, a competition for the spotlight. A pretty good stretch for a great young man and tremendously rewarding for Under Armour to be part of his on core success. 
We're taking steps in our tour China and other markets in Asia starting late next month, and frankly, we believe he's just beginning to touch upon his potential, both in the U.S. and other key basketball markets across the globe. 
Misty Copeland, trailblazer, prima ballerina, athlete. Named last month as the first Female African-American Principal Dancer with the American Ballet Theatre. Again, tremendous pride on our behalf to be involved early in Misty's mid rise by helping introduce her to audience beyond the ballet world with last year's, I WILL WHAT I WANT company. 
Jordan Spieth. When we signed him more than 2.5 years ago, we told you to watch out for this young man as we have a strong feeling he was going to turn into a huge asset for our Golf business. It's amazing for all of us that in such a short time, he's gone from being one of the names touted as the future of golf to being the story of golf. Not just now, but we believe, well into the future. 
And while I'll be remiss to at least mention the great performances by other UA athletes, this quarter, not this year, Andy Murray, Gary Price, Bryce Harper, Todd Frazier, the Cincinnati Reds, who last week won the home run Derby in front of his home crowd of the Great American ballpark. The recent accomplishments of Stephen, Misty and Jordan are somewhat overwhelming and heavily impactful. Their achievements these past few weeks represent the moment in time for the Under Armour brand that forces us to reassess our opportunities and look deeper to understand all the success means for us. 
There is, of course, the immediate benefit to our brand. This brand heat is driving huge amounts and incremental traffic to our E-Commerce platform across the globe with our basketball traffic up more than 300% year-over-year while in our social channels, we added more followers on Instagram during the recent NBA finals than we did in all of 2014. 
The Curry One shoe was a great success for our E-Commerce site as we continue to gain share in key Footwear categories with our wholesale partners. 
Our Women's business continues to grow strongly in key areas like capris, shorts, sports bras and running footwear while our E-Commerce Golf business was exceptional, growing about 60% year-over-year. 
But there is a bigger takeaway for our company and all of these. We've learned from these athletes not only about the preparation taken to be great but the added level of commitment it takes to be truly special. 
All 3 of these athletes started as clear underdogs yet were able to put themselves in a position where their skills and focus enabled them to transcend their sport. All of them have proven, as Jordan Spieth stated following his Masters victory when asked why he chose Under Armour, that being aggressive, young and fearless can be a deadly combination. 
Our athletes' ability to see what was needed to be excellent forces us to think bigger. It requires we accept there are moments in time where we need to accelerate, to take advantage of the new opportunities our brand momentum creates. We understand there are short-term benefit this unprecedented momentum, but we are focused on the long-term. 
To us, this moment provides a great chance to build a more meaningful connection with our consumer through the power of these transcendent athletes, and that connection can be deeper and more powerful to our brand in any short-term spike in our revenues or our earnings. 
Without question, the brand equity we are creating right now will benefit our business more significantly over the long term that it will simply just this 
year. Specifically, in a large category like basketball, we've had incredible success for the Curry One Footwear, including some very hot selling limited releases. But that brand heat, evidenced by the lines outside our Brand House stores on the release day gives us great confidence in the brand we are building with Stephen Curry and our strategy in bringing new product to market. 
It is motivated our Footwear tam and has given confidence to our retail partners about expanding presence in the basketball category amongst others, particularly in the mall. 
We recently debuted a new shop-in-shop concept with Champ sports called The Armoury, which highlights not only the basketball category but a broader mix of product and innovation to the athletes that been historically unable to find more brand in the mall. This is great evidence of the confidence we have and our product and the continued success we are seeing across our offerings with our key retail partners. 
And like basketball, that same foundation and confidence is building in our Golf and Women's businesses. We're still developing a wide consumer audience in these 3 categories here in the U.S. and the opportunity for us, in International markets is abundant. 
The second element of thinking bigger lies in how we organize our business. And in this case, thinking bigger means thinking smaller. Thinking in a way that enables us to be more surgical with how we reach our consumer and experiences we provide them. 
To look at our end-use consumer more discreetly and with more discipline. As the breadth of our product mix continues to expand, we're moving to sports category focused on innovation and structure that will enable us to maintain our focus on the needs of that end-use consumer. We recognize that UA run consumer has different needs than a UA basketball consumer, and we are now in a great position to harness the overall strength of our brand and innovation pipeline to ensure we are exceeding expectations for all of our consumers. 
To help drive this initiative, we have recently brought on Terdema Ussery, who over the past 18 years have served as President of the NBA Dallas Mavericks and has prior industry experience in athletic Footwear and Apparel. 
We can speak to this in more depth at our Investor Day meeting in September, but we want to be clear about our intent. This category of focus will provide the structure to help us sell more shirts and shoes. This structure has proven successful for us in golf for the combination of great product, a great asset and a great team help to double revenues in the past 2 years. 
This increased category will help drive our core business, a critical component in our long-term growth story. 
The last piece I will cover today is our evolution from a brand that started by just making compression piece to 1 now focused on perfecting shirts and shoes as well as creating authentic and relevant sports and fitness experiences every time and everywhere our consumer interacts with our brand. 
We can do so because of the strength of our Connected Fitness platform where we continue to add more than 100,000 unique registered users to the platform every single day. We remain in the early stages of uncovered potential of what the world digital health and fitness community with now over 140 million athletes can do to help us build consumer engagement and drive healthier lifestyles. 
We are growing our community at more than 30% year-over-year, and so far in 2015, these users have voluntarily logged over 1 billion workouts and more than 5 billion foods have been logged into our apps. This level and detail of data will empower us to provide actionable insights back to our community that will have them lead a healthier lifestyle, and we believe the brand equity that can provide us as immeasurable. 
Ultimately, the more people exercise, the more athletic footwear and apparel they will buy. 
Again, we will provide deeper detail in our Connected Fitness opportunities in September at our Investor Day, but we are extremely pleased with the growth of our community and the type of insight we can bring to our consumers' lives. 
So just before I hand it back to Brad, I want to reiterate our commitment to growth. We have delivered 21 consecutive quarters of 20-plus percent revenue growth. We are growing in key areas like Footwear, Women's and International and doing so while investing in new opportunities like Connected Fitness, which we believe will be critical to our continued growth.  And most importantly, we have the capacity to adapt, to change course and accelerate investments when the opportunity calls for it and to think bigger about what the Under Armour brand can and eventually be. 
There are so many great things going on in Under Armour today, which are difficult to fully articulate in one hour conference call. I look forward to seeing all of you at our Investor Day in September at our headquarters in Baltimore to further showcase the brand we are building. We remain aggressive, young and fearless, and I'm excited to provide more color and how we are thinking in organizing to become the next great local brand. 
And with that, let me turn it over to Brad."

I would now like to spent some time discussing our second quarter results, followed by our updated outlook for 2015. 
Our net revenues for the second quarter of 2015 increased 29% to $784 million. On a currency-neutral basis, net revenues increased 31% for the period. 
Within our product categories, we grew apparel net revenues 23% to $515 million compared to $420 million in the prior year's quarter. Many of the same growth drivers that drove our first quarter Apparel business continued during the second quarter, including our new Armour Baselayer, updated train products and expanded golf and hunting lines. 
Second quarter Footwear net revenues increased 40% to $154 million from $110 million in the prior year. We continue to gain significant traction across multiple Footwear categories, most notably within the larger markets of running and basketball. SpeedForm remains a key growth story for our brand, where we've introduced this innovation across a wider range of styles and categories this year. And as Kevin mentioned, we capitalized on the incredible success of Stephen Curry in basketball with new color ways quickly selling out during his MVP and championship run with the Warriors. 
Our accessories net revenues during the second quarter increased 39% to $83 million from $60 million last year, primarily driven by strong consumer demand for our line of bags. 
Our global Direct-to-Consumer net revenues increased 33% for the quarter, representing approximately 32% of net revenues. We continue to be encouraged with our recent Brand House openings, including the first full quarter of results for our Chicago and Mall of America stores as well as the new second quarter openings in Indianapolis and Orlando. 
From a global standpoint, we entered the second quarter with 160 owned stores, including 139 Factory House stores and 21 Brand House stores. 
Our E-Commerce business had a standout quarter, and we're seeing return on our investment in mobile optimization across our expanding list of global sites. 
While an ongoing focus on mobile is key, we're also able to drive strong traffic gain through more effective email communications as well as by leveraging the incredible success of our athletes during the period. 
Looking at our regions, North American net revenues increased 22% to $681 million in the second quarter compared to $558 million in the prior year's quarter. 
On a currency-neutral basis, North America net revenues increased 23% based primarily on the drivers I highlighted for the overall company. 
International net revenues increased 93% to $89 million in the second quarter and represented 11% of total net revenues.  On a currency-neutral basis, International net revenues increased to 112% for the period. 
In the EMEA region, we continue to focus on the 3 core markets of the U.K., Germany and France, while also developing distributors agreements in the region, including the Middle East. 
In Asia Pacific, our partner store expansion in E-Commerce growth in China remain key stories and will also benefited from the rollout of our distributor agreement in Southeast Asia. 
And in Latin America, we are seeing balanced growth throughout the region following our market entry into many of these countries during 2014. 
Moving on to margins. Second quarter gross margins contracted 80 basis points to 48.4% compared to 49.2% in the prior year's period. The following factors were the primary drivers during the quarter: First, as we previously outlined, the continued strength of the us dollar negatively impacted gross margins by approximately 60 basis points in the second quarter versus the prior year; second, we incurred higher air freight expense in the second quarter, primarily due to our efforts to normalize product flow from the West Coast port disruption and better service of back-to-school selling season, which negatively impacted gross margins by approximately 50 basis points. 
Partially offsetting this margin pressure better margins in our Factory House business, combined with our higher margin Connected Fitness revenues benefited gross margins by approximately 20 basis points in the second quarter. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues delevered 80 basis points to 44.3% in the second quarter of 2015 from 43.5% in the prior year's period. 
As a reminder, starting last quarter in an effort to simplify and streamline our conversation, we consolidated our SG&A detail into 2 primary buckets: Marketing and other SG&A. 
SG&A details for the second quarter are as follows: Marketing cost decreased to 11.4% of net revenues for the quarter from 11.6% in the prior year period with modest leverage driven primarily by the strong net revenues during second quarter. 
Our SG&A cost increased 32.9% of net revenues for the quarter from 31.9% in the prior year, driven primarily by our Connected Fitness acquisitions and investments in our Brand House strategy. 
Operating income for the second quarter decreased 8% to $32 million compared with $35 million in the prior year period. Interest and other expense for the second quarter increased to $4 million compared with the $1 million in the prior year period, primarily reflecting increased interest expense associated with the financing of our Connected Fitness acquisitions. 
Our second quarter tax rate of 46.7% was favorable to the 47.5% rate last year, primarily due to certain tax planning strategies. 
Our second quarter net income decreased 17% to $15 million compared to $18 million in the prior year period while lower diluted earnings per share decreased to $0.07 from $0.08 in the prior year's period. 
On the balance sheet, total cash and cash equivalents for the quarter decreased 43% to $171 million compared with $300 million at June 30, 2014. 
Inventory for the quarter increased 26% to $837 million compared to $662 million at June 30, 2014. 
Total debt increased to $716 million as compared to $197 million at June 30, 2014, primarily reflecting the financing of our Connected Fitness acquisition. 
Looking at our cash flows. Our investment and capital expenditures was $91 million for the second quarter compared to $29 million in the prior year's period, driven primarily by our investments in our SAP platform and our global retail strategy. 
Now moving on to our updated 2015 guidance. Based on current visibility, we expect 2015 net revenues of approximately $3.84 billion, representing growth of 25%, and 2015 operating income in the range of $405 million to $408 million, representing growth of 14% to 15%. 
We have long stated that we'd be opportunistic with our investment levels if and when the right situations present themselves. 
In the period where we have seen unprecedented success from our athletes on a global stage, we believe we have a unique opportunity to position ourselves more aggressively in key long-term growth categories such as basketball and golf, which we believe can create brand halos across the Under Armour portfolio. 
As a result, we expect to spend more than originally planned in marketing throughout the remainder of the year, in this is the primary reason we are raising our full year net revenues guidance, while maintaining the upper end of our previous operating income guidance. We believe this will better position our brand in delivering long-term sustainable growth. 
As a reminder, our operating income guidance includes the dilutive impact of the Connected Fitness acquisition consisting of onetime transaction cost in the first quarter, operating losses from these businesses and noncash amortization charges of the intangible assets generated from the acquisitions. 
Below operating results, we continue to expect a full year effective tax rate of approximately 41% compared to 39.2% in the prior year, primarily given the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, which continues to negatively impact our International profitability. 
Now I'd also like to provide some additional color and several items starting with revenues. We expect the growth rate in Footwear to continue outpacing the growth rate for the overall business during the second half of the year. 
International growth is expected to ease from the growth rate achieved in the first half of 2015 as we begin to cycle through our entry into Latin America as well as new distributors partnerships launched during the second half of 2014. 
From a cadence standpoint, we expect relatively consistent net revenue growth rates during the third and fourth quarters. 
Now looking at gross margins. We continue to expect our full year gross margin will be roughly in line with last year's 49% rate. 
During the third quarter, we continue to expect an approximate 50 basis-point contraction, primarily due to the negative impact of the stronger U.S. dollar. 
In SG&A, we expect the combined impact of higher planned marketing spend, I previously discussed, and ongoing other SG&A expense pressure will result in similar year-over-year growth rate in the third quarter as experienced during the first half of the year. 
Finally, a quick look at our plan capital expenditures. We continue to plan 2015 capital expenditures in the range of $330 million to $340 million. Consistent with our prior guidance, proximately $140 million of this total is allocated across 3 large areas to support long-term growth, including our new domestic distribution center, the expansion of our corporate headquarters in Baltimore and a new and expanded SAP platform. 
We can also accelerate our investments in key areas that will drive revenue growth, including the rollouts of our global retail strategy and new E-Commerce sites.

And for me personally, I remember how I felt when I had this idea for a T-shirt and more importantly, a piece of equipment to be worn underneath athletes uniforms or equipm",988,"Yes. Thank you, Erinn, so first of all, we see this as just a massive white space. And for me personally, I remember how I felt when I had this idea for a T-shirt and more importantly, a piece of equipment to be worn underneath athletes uniforms or equipment that in the past, it's always just been a short sleeved cotton t-shirt or long sleeves or large T-shirt, depending on the weather. And it just felt like how come no one has done this before. And for me personally is when we look at this opportunity to begin with, it felt like there's this massive white space and that no one, no one in the world is measuring sort of athletes' performance. And you start to see these things come in around weather is wearables and biometric measurements, et cetera, and we in that all the way back to 2008. But we quickly came to realize the value for us is not going to be in, I think, the equipment side of it, but the value for us is going to be in the community. And we feel like we're going to lock that up. The fact that consumers have no parameter for their help today is a mistake and frankly, that's where we see this massive opportunity, and we feel we're the best one to take advantage of it really because acquisitions that the made over the last 2 years. The sheer size and scale the community that we've made, it marks us as a clear leader by a factor of as much as 4, 3 or at least 2x now having more than 140 million unique registered users. And as I mentioned in my script, adding more than 100,000 users are downloading 1 of our 4 apps, MyFitnessPal, Endomondo, MyFitnessPal or Under Armour record. And again, from the stats that I read off as well I want to drive them home because I think it's incredible. We logged more than 1 billion workouts were logged into 1 of our 4 apps over the last -- just the beginning of the year. More than 5 billion different foods have been logged as well. And giving the scale, MyFitnessPal, which is the largest of the 4 apps that we have and as we continue to merge them, that voice will continue to come out as we articulated. But this is the world's largest database in the history of mankind of food. I mean just think about it as, we log more than 5 billion food that we know in over 80 countries what people are eating, what they're putting in their body. We now believe the got the ability to be relevant across all the platforms and we're going to work the merge them into consistent product that only dashboard. I mean, ultimately that's where we're heading. We think that consumer just needs dashboard says, how am I doing. If I can look at my cellphone and I can figure out my bank balance, my stock price or the weather in a given city, the fact that I have no measure for my health instead for going to see a doctor every 12, 18 or 24 months we think is really a crime. So we were identifying that as 4 key place that the consumer should be measuring themselves, the athletes should measuring themselves. Sleep, how much did I sleep last night; fitness, did I exercise or not and if so, what degree. Daily activity, which is typically like the steps like how much am I moving around and then fourth and probably most importantly, what am I putting in my body, my nutrition. And we thought a lot about this, and I think one thing I really want to get across is sort of the way that we are thinking about defining success. And we do believe that there needs to be a daily dashboard, and so we will continue to see that articulate itself through the Under Armour Record platform, and we've got many things coming from that particularly showcase for you at Investor Day. But if you ask us to sum it up, we're looking for and engages the community that relies on Under Armour to Connected Fitness ecosystem we are building to help them measure those 4 central areas: Sleep, fitness, daily activity and nutrition. And more importantly, we want to empower people. This isn't just about knowing that I took 8,000 steps yesterday, but because I took 8,000 steps, how did that make me feel. And more importantly, how did that work with how I slept or what the exercise or what I ate that next day. And we think that having that information will allow them to make better decisions to live healthier and life. I mean, affecting, I think, ultimately, obviously, fitness, the way that work, but we think there's the outlook for us to affect global health, and that's what's get us so excited. And by doing this, of course, we believe that realtime is a company that focuses on selling shirts and shoes. We believe that we're going to create engagement with consumer to give them a reason to interact with our brand multiple times a day. And I think all those things lead to this energy that you're feeling from us, and frankly, the resources that we've expanded over the last couple of years positions ourselves, I think, really uniquely and unlike any other brand especially in our space, but frankly, anyone who's looking at biometric measurement for the athlete and ultimately, for any end consumer. So as I said, this is going to be big part of the book is that we have at our Investor Day in September and I encourage you to come in and see what we have coming on. But incredibly exciting for us, and, I think, there's a lot more to come."

In our guidance, we've been consistent I think in the last couple of years talking about being very prudent in how we forecast the fourth quarter relative to weather and in holiday, and so forth in not taking things for granted there in our guidance. So I'd say those are the two things in the back half of the year, revenue guidance, a better flow in back-to-school and also consistent of how where we are approaching the fourth quarter revenue guidance."

And if you just think about basketball for his second, and you take Stephen Curry and ability for us, to tell a story in a category that is influential, not only in the basketball category but just the younger consumer and what that can mean for youth business in 2016, 2017 and beyond, that's what we're really talking about here, it's just the longer term opportunity versus the shorter term opportunity."

Without question, the performances of Stephen and, really, breaking through -- since we signed Steph 3 years ago, he's always an underdog but is always the best everywhere he went so that the credit for something we've been front of doing whether it was -- first of all, most important of him is winning the championship, but then the league MVP and acknowledging the SP's where I think among all athletes, he's broken through and is a really difficult thing to do particular in a sport like basketball. And so we're proud of what that means. It's not a runway ticket to all of a sudden, you've arrived, there's a lot of work for us, to be done and there's a lot more. One thing I learned a long time ago, and you the first time I move away to the top of the front cover of U.S. Today sports page and I thought, I'm going to walk in the office and the place to be flooded with orders, it's not just the way it goes, and so growth on consistency. Consistency is built on trust and trust is build on drops and it's loss in buckets and so what you see is we have a great big pouring. I think credibility in the sport of basketball and what Steph brings us on a day-to-day basis but is going to acquire a lot more investment and it's going to require a lot more commitment. So we want to let everybody know, particularly our consumer but frankly, our competition as well that we're moving into basketball and been working on this is not an overnight success, we've been working for years, if not the decade, and we're incredibly proud of where we got into, but we're really just getting started. So as far as basketball as the category goes, we've been working, we've had great support from our sporting goods partners primarily where, I think, we really have that kid who is buying product to play at the high school level, and we've had -- we've been working on what the right assortments there and really getting behind footwear for us, it's initiative, particularly in basketball. And then in the mall channel, whether it's Finish Line or Foot Locker and I described what we're doing with Champs Sports through Foot Locker with The ARMOURY series, it's going to be a really neat opportunity for us, I think to change the way that consumer is looking at the brand, the way that they see us, is breaking through and having people see basketball brand. Again, it's just taking -- it's taken a lot of time and the chance for us, to I think really differentiates ourselves in the brand maybe for the brand that we see ourselves, the brand we're going to be. So Steph is a big part of that."

I sort of let footwear get away so if somebody ask another question about that, we can circle back on footwear. In International, as I'm sitting in Munich opening this new office and cutting the ribbon this afternoon. First of all, what Charlie has done for International business in really helping us accelerate and think about ourselves as a global brand, but more importantly beginning to act like a global brand. We're fashion way of doing that. This would be our 17th office that we've opened up, I think, our fifth or sixth this year in our way that relates to our brand incredibly authentic. And if you were hear, it basically feels like Baltimore in Munich beginning, of course, with esthetic, the way the place  looks, but the team, the people, the energy just incredibly proud. And you're seeing that at retail too. We went and look at stores. We saw 3 of the largest sports stores and retailers that are here in Germany and throughout Europe over the last couple of days. And the excitement we have from the very of this organization, we believe that Under Armour can penetrate where we are very, very young, and we are just getting started here. While we've been doing business in selling stuff, probably for the last 8 or 9 or close to 10 years now, we're really beginning to do business. And I think it's reflected, obviously, in our revenues. I mean, 93% revenue growth in the second quarter alone, 83% revenue growth in International year-to-date, 94% growth in 2014. So that idea of coming close to doubling and the plans we've talked about is growing by about 50% a year in International, and it's something, I think, that we get really excited that is incredible realistic to happen. A number of things that we have from a product standpoint. We remain positioned really in the premium way, the consumer sees us, and so I think it's more to refill us wants us as well. We are a full-price brand basically everywhere we do business, and that's no different abroad. We've learned a lot of this about our brand translates through Japan and learning that Under Armour moves outside of North America and we're just seeing that reinforced especially here in Europe. We're doing a lot of that a lot of strategic accounts and core markets with premium shop-in-shop investments that we can have, and that's been a real positive for us with the right market retailers. From a retail standpoint as well, we've opened 18 Brand House stores in the second quarter in places like Chile, China, Taiwan, Malaysia, the Philippines. We're targeting more than 100 additional Brand House stores opening in 2015, build off of a base of 73 in 2014. 3 quarters of which are going to be located in Asia, 85% of those that will be doors where we will be leveraging distributors partners that will be opening those up. And just from perspective the majority of those stores are, obviously, I guess, going to be in China, I guess, that would be obvious, but just for some perspective in the month of September alone, we're going to be opening roughly 1 store per day in the month of September, so it's since going to be a big month for us, and it's something we've been perfecting for the last 5 and 6 years. There globally with Susie McCabe and Henry and our retail team are really becoming expert in how to open and translate our store and have the consistent message to the brand everywhere we show up. So not to be lost in all the physical manifestation the brand that we're putting in retail is I think some of the success that we're seeing in E-Commerce. The second quarter alone, we launched new sites in Thailand, Austria, Ireland, Belgium, Portugal, and I think we've also been working on translating our sites as well and making sure they're open. The new markets continues to be a real big opportunity for us. One thing I don't want to get lost is, it's not all roses either. Going global is not an easy thing. It's a slug, it's an investment, it's something we continue to get better. So while we're pleased with the results we still see it as a tremendous amount of meat left on the bone with opportunity for us to improve. Our fulfillment rates is not where they need to be, the wholesale partners have been incredibly patient with us as we get this settled and organized, but things like Brad mentioned with our new SAP upgrades and implementations, they're going to make a big different with systems and processes. And there's is part of the shift to becoming a global brand. So across the road, EMEA, as I mentioned, I spent the last couple of days here in Europe, a lot of excitement, a lot of energy, of course, driven in part by our sports marketing assets, the success we see there, but I think really is the teams in the ground and it's the energy, it's the culture of the brand that is really is leading the way. Asia, a lot of incredibly exciting things happening there. Japan continues to be a stalwart for us and leading, but, as I mentioned, things like China where the stores are opening up and what we're doing in September. We're going to drive a lot of energy from the Stephen Curry tour we're be taking them through about 7 days over there between Japan, obviously, 3 stops in China, and then a few other stops as well. So it will be very exciting. And then Latin America I think energies to building around Brazil, especially with the Olympics coming back and things we have there. We opened our first Brand House in Sao Paulo around these shopping mall and it's doing very, very well. Nearly every place that we've opened stores, I think, we're outperforming. So haven't seen any surprises to the downside, there's tremendous amount of heat and energy to the brand I'm living and feeling that today and excited for about 350 to 400 of our closest friends and media partners are going to come and help us cut the ribbon. So a lot of energy about Under Armour being here in Germany and really every place we're opening up in stores around the world. So it's a good story, it's good news but, as I said, there's still room for us, to improve, and you'll see us ambitiously go after that."

So great question, Omar, and one we're anticipating. So we've been talking about this for years. We've tried implementing it in 3 years and then we sort of got to this point  where it's hard, it's not easy to change things is that we are -- we've not been end-use driven in the past. We are basically apparel team, we have a footwear team, we have an accessory team, and we think that, that obvious he has worked in getting us started, but we at the point where be reaching the size and frankly, the scale to be able to afford and more importantly, not able to afford to go after really addressing category management. And the thing we use with the sport of golf, which really got us excited several years ago, where we implemented this, and we identified a leader, and they really took the bull by the horns and started with product and organizing everything from the way that we showed up in sporting goods, in our wholesale partners, the way we showed up in the Gulf course and also given the same control over to how we're going to spend marketing dollars and that meant additional showed up things like POP and marketing, all the way to the assets that we signed. And so I think it's a great story that led us to getting us enjoy the speed. The things for all of these as we're going to think about category management that can come down the leadership and what we want was accountability and where golf started is that I never after a golf tournament several ago, sitting on a Sunday and I'm watching and not feeling great about the way that one of our golfers was outfitted and I write an email and say, this isn't working well and, I think, I had 18 people CC-ed on the email. And saying this is ridiculous. We should get this to much more consistent manner where we can flow the information in a better way that would be more effective and ultimately, it's going to better serve the end-use consumer and the athlete. So I use that theme of thinking bigger, and that's where hiring Terdema Ussery, who is going to join us and has great experience in this industry as someone who knows everyone who's got a five-star resume of leadership and success and frankly, a really great person I think that just as importantly as anything expertise and his smart is the culture fit that is going to be at Under Armour. So there's a lot to happen there, but we have almost force the issue. And while we've been working through -- these pieces, we're going to give you a lot more color at Investor Day as well, it will tell you little more specific how we're thinking about it but ultimately, the idea is we're not going to just pull the plug and eliminate our Apparel and our Footwear groups, there's going to be a bit of transition there. The first way we're going to start though is identifying the category leadership across it's roughly 9 different categories that we have right now that we've identified where we want a true General Manager to run each of these that we'll have both in some instances clear P&L responsibility and other instances, a bit of virtual P&L responsibility, but the most important thing is we're going to create accountability across each of these divisions where hopefully, it will drive and prevent us from things that may be perceived as inauthentic and making sure that we preserve the Under Armour life. But again, I use that example of golf and just the sport of golf in the last 2 years, our revenues has more than doubled. We're seeing key category growth throughout the rest of the year. Things like on our website, our play off polos, the #1 item at Brand House and our E-Commerce sites. The business is basically up everywhere. We have our key asset, which is the one thing, which led us to find the right asset with Jordan that's really leading the way out there has been absolute kill and home run for us too. And also allows us to launch categories like we'll have authentic golf shoe coming out. You're seeing Jordan wearing our golf club there out in the course. So all these things from the right asset, from the right marketing, from the right positioning, being in a ready to distribution it's all led us to get this. So we're excited what we're seen the success of golf, it's something we hope to see translates through things like basketball and running and really, the obvious category that you imagine we'd be looking for in global football, of course, and things like that. So we want to win. We think that opportunity for us is do that not defined by what anybody has done. And we carved a bit of our own legs, but still the same lots of good lessons to learn from other people that have done this before too. So I think we're going to take the best of both worlds and we do it best with the Under Armour Brent."

I have been to, but I have seen pictures, is it more of a shop and shop, it almost looks like a store, standalone store? Can help us understand that dynamic there, what it is, and obviously, there's, I think, 400 plus champs locations throughout the court country, how you're thinking about the rollout of it, at least what the plans are at point in time. Yes, I think we've been very highly successful in sporting goods. The mall has been different. I think champs is a great -- it's a bit step from the sporting goods into the mall because they played a bit of a [indiscernible] roll. But Champ and Foot Locker, as a whole, has been amazing partner for us, and it's something, I think, where we can translate our existing consumers. It helped get them to use thinking about this in the mall environment. We still see ourselves in a holistic head-to-toe brand and our philosophy remains that we're going to go where our consumers went and frankly, where they expect us. And so we're looking for is further ways that we can build relationships with our wholesale partners to elevate the product story for the best Under Armour. We're only in roughly 25% of the 3,400 global footing stores today but, obviously, we're working with their team in aligning with that. The ARMOURY and Champ is a great example of how we can grow the business, the relationship together. We're testing a handful of these premium shop and shops over the next couple of years, starting with our own backyard in Maryland. And the early days that we've seen, the first several weeks are very, very, very encouraging. The merchandising is going to consist of the mixture of line products, mall specific product, in addition with some product not found also in the mall too. So things like that where we're putting our Highlight Cleat's into the mall channel, into The ARMOURY. And it's just getting a big deeper breadth of the Under Armour experience in the mall environment. So I think it's exciting. I encourage you to get the chance and we can put our listing and Tom and the team can let you know where we got those, you'll see one for yourself as well."

The first partnership deal that I've signed was with NFL Europe league. So we're no stranger to international  business. It's becoming good at it, more importantly, I think, in a lot of places, particularly in Europe. Continuity is an incredibly important lesson and attribute with any brand. Consistency is very, very important, doing things the same way. I mean, it's a comment that designed by history. And brands sort of come in, leave today and are gone tomorrow, I think everyone has seen a lot of that. So a lot of it is a bit of question, the way that you're out and wondering how you're going to make it, are you going to be there. And what we've seen is the brand, it's taking a while, doesn't happen in the first handshake, it doesn't happen in the first introduction. And we came over to Europe for the first time back at the end of 2005 and then 2006. And it was a -- it's been a slug, we weren't really understanding completely what we have going on. At the same time, we're  also organizing ourselves in North America. The thing we think about with Brad and my job, in our entire executive team's job, again, it's defining and deciding how to deploy their resources, the time, the people and money, there's is only so much of any one of them. And we're torn with the fact that it's always International, such a small part of our business, and so U.S. and North America would usually dominate the amount of time we spend. So as we've grown, you've seen us going all the way back to 2009 and 2010, I think, we feel a lot of question why are you pouring this money into Europe, why are you pouring this money, when is the return going to come? And so we had this long story of long term investments and things like Women's, long term investments and things like Footwear, long term investments in something like International. This year, and we said it big enough comment, but we're going to be profitable in Europe this year and that was something if you went back 5 years, you may have filled the questions on why not throw in the towel. If you want to successful there, why don't  just focus in North America? So we're not looking at our profitability. It's been one asset at a time and it's been things from joining EPL football with people and places like [indiscernible] Casper and then finding ways to make investments. The recent announcements with São Paulo Futebol Clube down in Brazil, it's not an immediate return for us, I've always said I don't really see us as a licensed jersey manufacturer. I don't like that idea of growing sport by simply selling fan gear. We want to be on the authentic athlete, we want to be on the pitch, on the court, on the field, but there's ways for us to get in. And so of finding the resources that we can splitter off to make investment in a market that's very new for us like Brazil, it's a big deal. And so we're patiently doing that around the globe every finding asset that makes sense and especially we can reinforce in markets that we can create an ROI than see it sooner or later. So it's a big -- running something global and we said that at a long time but really understanding what it means to be a global company, that takes time, and it takes experience, and it takes maturity, and it takes patience and the things that maybe you characterize as not having in the first 2 years as a company. But I think that we've been developing that skill sets and most importantly, we've been developing that leadership team. So Terdema is a great example of that coming onboard and I think you're seeing -- filled out throughout our company and something that will only continue to get bigger and better for us and the brand. So we're learning a lot of lessons. As I said, there's mistakes in there, believe me, but when it comes to the performance of the 90-plus percent revenue growth that we saw this quarter and is reflective of, I think, what you're seeing happening. One thing I can tell you it's a tremendous pull, a tremendous demand for the brand right now. It's a matter about execution of this a lot of places that we can improve, we can enhance, we can better. I called the supply chain specifically is that it's difficult figuring out how to move products that duty conscious and being careful and being able to make money and not getting crushed on margin and running who to manufacturer locally. And so we've been learning all these lessons. The good news is something we've been doing for the last 3  or 6 months. This is something we've been doing for really the last 6 to 10 years. So we're certainly not going to extras right now, but we feel great about our trajectory, we feel great about our team, we remain humble and hungry, and we've got to shop. The mission here is to be the next great global brand and you're going to see us fight, crawl and scratch and do everything we can to make that happen, so we'll keep running hard for you. That's for sure."

So the way that we're thinking about measurement and growth and things like that. When we made the announcement that we called digital day a few days -- following our 2014 earnings call, we told you there are 120 million people roughly on the platform and then about a month or so later, I was on a -- I did a talking head show and we said 130 million. Now today, we're talking it's over 140 million people. We're only careful to sort of quantify these things in terms of the number of users we have. Our next job is really taking out how to make them good quality users as well is that I'd take 40 million hyper engaged people that really we're very getting benefiting from the brand and using our apps or ecosystem using that as a learning place that we can go that's a broader audience. At the same time, this scale that we're growing is nothing we want to ignore, but we think the definition of success is that just a total top line number of users, how we're going north of 30% and seeing that consistently happen, that is going to be something that's positive. But what I think you'll see from us and again, we're going to go deeper in our own Investor Day into at the story of Connected Fitness means for the Under Armour brand is that there's a high-level engagement that we're going to be able to drive with that. And without a doubt, our Gear Tracker side alone, which is something that's exclusive to the MapMyFitness platform is more than 400,000 people that are actively tracking products and whether compare shoes that they wear or whatever item that the use. I think it's close to 2,000 people a day are signing up for Gear Tracker. So people are interested in this idea of the Internet of Things that eventually everything that we have is going to have a chip on it. So 1 billion connected things in 2010 and I think the projection is by 2020, it's going to be over 25 billion or 30 billion connected things in the world. So, obviously, we want to use that to make are so smart and honestly to help enrich and improve the life of our consumers. We think we have the ability to do that. we Think getting smart in everything we do. Again, the thing I'm probably most proud of with these acquisitions, of course, the community we built, the team we built, but also the level of engagement that we're creating with the consumer, of giving them reason to think about themselves holistically. This idea of approaching health and arming people with the ability to make better decisions for themselves, it's a pretty powerful thing that I think who is going to own that information or who's going to will help give you that and organize that information for you. Should be health care provider, should be a drugstore, should be a health insurance company or should be as force brand that you trust and so we think we have great connection with the athletes, we think that we can test and prototype this with -- at the highest levels with people like Universal Football team and we think if it's good enough for them, we think it's a -- and some of our athletes, it should be good enough for the consumers. So building that trust is going to be paramount in doing this. And yes, we think we're going to sell more shirts and shoes ultimately, but we think we're going to transform what the Under Armour brand is, and we'll continuously do that."

I am calling in from Munich, Germany where later today, we are opening our newest International office from which we will serve the markets in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. This is my last stop of a weeklong trip that is taking me to multiple cities, including Glascow, Copenhagen, and now, Munich. As we continue to grow our global footprint, these trips continue to provide deeper insight into the markets and how consumers are thinking about our brand. My visit to Copenhagen reconfirmed and enhanced the excitement around our recent Endomondo acquisition, and a huge opportunity that Connected Fitness provides UA with global consumers.  With today's ribbon cutting in Munich, we will now have 17 regional offices outside the United States, which are positioning the brand closer to the local consumer and driving the incredible execution we have seen in the past year, including 93% international net revenue growth just this past quarter. That strong growth outside the United States helped drive total net revenues for the quarter up 29%, the 21st consecutive quarter of 20-plus-percent net revenue growth. In addition, total apparel net revenues grew by 23%, marking the 23rd consecutive quarter of 20-plus percent net revenue growth. We have traditionally referred to this as our scoreboard, but based on my visits to Saint Andrews early this week, maybe we should refer to it as a leaderboard. Either way, we continue to shoot consistently great numbers. As we prepare to enter our 20th-year in the business of sports, we have learned a lot of valuable lessons. Some of them have been learned through business, but just as many probably have been learned through sport. 
Over the past year, 3 Under Armour athletes have transcended their sports, and become known by just their first names, Stephen, Misty and Jordan. These 3 athletes have combined to teach us one incredibly valuable lesson that we need to think bigger. For Stephen Curry, Misty Copeland and Jordan Spieth, being a great basketball player, principal ballerina and PGA golfer was rooted in their ability to see beyond, to be prepared to not just be great, but to be extraordinary, to plan and practice, but also know when to take the risk. Our lessons out of this are incredibly relevant to this moment in time for the Under Armour brand. First, our athletes' success pushes us to see beyond just maximizing the revenue opportunities in any given quarter. It forces us to think clearly about what we need to be do better, and how we need to organize to be more than just an American sports brand, to go from changing the way athletes dress to changing the way athletes live. Second, this intense brand heat provides us with abundant opportunities to invest in businesses like basketball, Women's and golf that will not only grow our share within those large categories, but will also positively impact all of our business across both categories and geographies. So my 2 main topics today are how do we invest to capitalize in that momentum, and how do we organize to think bigger about the opportunities in front of us today. 
Thinking bigger is part of what drives the world's greatest athletes to outperform on the highest stage, and it's hard to think of 3 individuals who have done more of that recently than Stephen, Misty and Jordan. And the best part is that just like UA, they too are just getting started.  Stephen Curry, NBA league MVP, world champion, recently voted Best Male Athlete and Best NBA Player at the ESPYs, and most importantly, new father of a baby girl who one day might give her big sister, Riley, some competition for the spotlight. A pretty good stretch for a great young man and tremendously rewarding for Under Armour to be part of his on-court success. We're taking Stephen on a tour in China and other markets in Asia, starting late next month, and frankly, we believe he's just beginning to touch upon his potential both in the U.S. and other key basketball markets across the globe. 
Misty Copeland, trailblazer, prima ballerina, athlete, named last month as the first female African-American principal dancer with the American Ballet Theatre. Again, tremendous pride on our behalf to be involved early in Misty's meteoric rise by helping introduce her to an audience beyond the ballet world with last year's, I WILL WHAT I WANT campaign. 
Jordan Spieth. When we signed him more than 2.5 years ago, we told you to watch out for this young man, as we had a strong feeling he was going to turn into a huge asset for our Golf business. It's amazing for all of us that in such a short time, he's gone from being one of the names touted as the future of golf to being the story of golf, not just now, but we believe, well into the future. And while I'd be remiss to not at least mention the great performances by other UA athletes, this quarter, not this year: Andy Murray, Carey Price, Bryce Harper, Todd Frazier, The Cincinnati Reds, who last week won the Home Run Derby in front of his home crowd at the Great American ballpark. The recent accomplishments of Stephen, Misty and Jordan are somewhat overwhelming and heavily impactful. Their achievements these past few weeks represent a moment in time for the Under Armour brand, one that forces us to reassess our opportunities and look deeper to understand what all the success means for us. There is, of course, the immediate benefit to our brand. This brand heat is driving huge amounts and incremental traffic to our E-Commerce platform across the globe, with our basketball traffic up more than 300% year-over-year while in our social channels, we added more followers on Instagram during the recent NBA finals than we did in all of 2014. The Curry One shoe was a great success in our E-Commerce site, as we continue to gain share in key Footwear categories with our wholesale partners. Our Women's business continues to grow strongly in key areas, like capris, shorts, sports bras and running footwear, while our E-Commerce Golf business was exceptional, growing about 60% year-over-year. But there is a bigger takeaway for our company and all of these. We've learned from these athletes, not only about the preparation it takes to be great, but the added level of commitment it takes to be truly special. 
All 3 of these athletes started as clear underdogs, yet were able to put themselves in a position where their skills and focus enabled them to transcend their sport. All of them have proven, as Jordan Spieth stated, following his Masters victory when asked why he chose Under Armour, that being aggressive, young and fearless can be a deadly combination. Our athletes' ability to see what was needed to be excellent forces us to think bigger. It requires we accept there are moments in time where we need to accelerate to take advantage of the new opportunities our brand momentum creates. We understand there are short-term benefit to this unprecedented momentum, but we are focused on the long-term. To us, this moment provides a great chance to build a more meaningful connection with our consumer through the power of these transcendent athletes, and that connection can be deeper and more powerful for our brand than any short-term spike in our revenues or our earnings. Without question, the brand equity we are creating right now will benefit our business more significantly over the long term than it will simply just this year. Specifically, in a large category, like basketball, we've had incredible success for the Curry One Footwear, including some very hot selling limited releases. But that brand heat, evidenced by the lines outside our Brand House stores on release day, gives us great confidence in the brand we are building with Stephen Curry and our strategy in bringing new product to market. It has motivated our Footwear team. It has given confidence to our retail partners about expanding presence in the basketball category amongst others, particularly in the mall. 
We recently debuted a new shop-in-shop concept with Champ sports, called The ARMOURY, which highlights, not only the basketball category, but a broader mix of product and innovation that the athletes' been historically unable to find from our brand in the mall. This is great evidence of the confidence we have in our product and the continued success we are seeing across our offerings with our key retail partners. And like basketball, that same foundation and confidence is building in our Golf and Women's businesses. We're still developing a wide consumer audience in these 3 categories here in the U.S. and the opportunity for us in international markets is abundant. The second element of thinking bigger lies in how we organize our business, and in this case, thinking bigger means thinking smaller, thinking in a way that enables us to be more surgical with how we reach our consumer and the experiences we provide them. 
To look at our end-use consumer more discreetly and with more discipline. As the breadth of our product mix continues to expand, we're moving to a sports category focused organizational structure that will enable us to maintain our focus on the needs of that end-use consumer. We recognize that a UA-run consumer has different needs than a UA basketball consumer, and we are now in a great position to harness the overall strength of our brand and innovation pipeline to ensure we are exceeding expectations for all of our consumers. To help drive this initiative, we have recently brought on Terdema Ussery, who for the past 18 years have served as President of the NBA Dallas Mavericks, and has prior industry experience in athletic Footwear and Apparel. 
We can speak to this in more depth at our Investor Day Meeting in September, but we want to be clear today about our intent. This category of focus will provide the structure to help us sell more shirts and shoes. This structure has proven successful for us in golf with a combination of great product, a great asset and a great team helped to double revenues the past 2 years. This increased category will us help drive our core business, a critical component in our long-term growth story. 
The last piece I want to cover today is our evolution from a brand that started by just making compression tees to one now focused on perfecting shirts and shoes, as well as creating authentic and relevant sports and fitness experiences every time and everywhere our consumer interacts with our brand. We can do so because of the strength of our Connected Fitness platform, where we continue to add more than 100,000 unique registered users to the platform every single day. We remain in the early stages of uncovered potential of one of the world's largest digital health and fitness community, with now over 140 million athletes can do to help us build consumer engagement and drive healthier lifestyles. We are growing our community at more than 30% year-over-year, and so far, in 2015, these users have voluntarily logged over 1 billion workouts and more than 5 billion foods have been logged into our apps. This level and detail of data will empower us to provide actionable insights back to our community that will have them lead a healthier lifestyle, and we believe the brand equity that can provide us is immeasurable. Ultimately, the more people exercise, the more athletic footwear and apparel they will buy. Again, we will provide deeper detail on our Connected Fitness opportunities in September at our Investor Day, but we are extremely pleased with the growth of our community and the type of insight we can bring to our consumers' lives.  
So just before I hand it back to Brad, I want to reiterate our commitment to growth. We have delivered 21 consecutive quarters of 20-plus percent revenue growth. We are growing in key areas like Footwear, Women's and International, and doing so while investing in new opportunities like Connected Fitness, which we believe will be critical to our continued growth. And most importantly, we have the capacity to adapt, to change course and accelerate investments when the opportunity calls for it and to think bigger about what the Under Armour brand can eventually be. 
There are so many great things going on in Under Armour today, which are difficult to fully articulate in a 1 hour conference call. I look forward to seeing all of you at our Investor Day in September at our headquarters in Baltimore to further showcase the brand that we are building. We remain aggressive, young and fearless, and I'm excited to provide more color on how we are thinking and organizing to become the next great global brand. 
And with that, let me turn it over to Brad."

Our net revenues for the second quarter of 2015 increased 29% to $784 million. On a currency-neutral basis, net revenues increased 31% for the period.  Within our product categories, we grew apparel net revenues 23% to $515 million compared to $420 million in the prior year's quarter. Many of the same growth drivers that drove our first quarter Apparel business continued during the second quarter, including our new Armour Baselayer, updated train products and expanded golf and hunting lines. 
Second quarter Footwear net revenues increased 40% to $154 million from $110 million in the prior year. We continue to gain significant traction across multiple Footwear categories, most notably within the larger markets of running and basketball. SpeedForm remains a key growth story for our brand, where we've introduced this innovation across a wider range of styles and categories this year. And as Kevin mentioned, we capitalized on the incredible success of Stephen Curry in basketball, with new color waves quickly selling out during his MVP and championship run with the Warriors. 
Our accessories net revenues during the second quarter increased 39% to $83 million from $60 million last year, primarily driven by strong consumer demand for our line of bags. Our global Direct-to-Consumer net revenues increased 33% for the quarter, representing approximately 32% of net revenues. We continue to be encouraged with our recent Brand House openings, including the first full quarter of results for our Chicago and Mall of America stores, as well as the new second quarter openings in Indianapolis and Orlando. From a global standpoint, we entered the second quarter with 160 owned stores, including 139 Factory House stores and 21 Brand House stores. Our E-Commerce business had a standout quarter, and we're seeing the return on our investment in mobile optimization across our expanding list of global sites. While an ongoing focus on mobile is key, we were also able to drive strong traffic gain through more effective email communications, as well as by leveraging the incredible success of our athletes during the period. 
Looking at our regions, North American net revenues increased 22% to $681 million in the second quarter compared to $558 million in the prior year's quarter. On a currency-neutral basis, North America net revenues increased 23% based primarily on the drivers I highlighted for the overall company. International net revenues increased 93% to $89 million in the second quarter, and represented 11% of total net revenues. On a currency-neutral basis, International net revenues increased to 112% for the period. In the EMEA region, we continue to focus on the 3 core markets of the U.K., Germany and France, while also developing distributor agreements in the region, including the Middle East. In Asia Pacific, our partner store expansion in E-Commerce growth in China remain key stories, and we also benefited from the rollout of our distributor agreement in Southeast Asia. And in Latin America, we are seeing balanced growth throughout the region, following our market entry into many of these countries during 2014. 
Moving on to margins. Second quarter gross margins contracted 80 basis points to 48.4% compared to 49.2% in the prior year's period. The following factors were the primary drivers during the quarter: first, as we previously outlined, the continued strength of the U.S dollar negatively impacted gross margins by approximately 60 basis points in the second quarter versus the prior year; second, we incurred higher air freight expense in the second quarter, primarily due to our efforts to normalize product flow from the West Coast port disruption and better service of back-to-school selling season, which negatively impacted gross margins by approximately 50 basis points. Partially offsetting this margin pressure is better margins in our Factory House business, combined with our higher margin Connected Fitness revenues, benefited gross margins by approximately 20 basis points in the second quarter. Selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of net revenues, delevers 80 basis points to 44.3% in the second quarter of 2015 from 43.5% in the prior year's period. As a reminder, starting last quarter, in an effort to simplify and streamline our conversation, we consolidated our SG&A detail into 2 primary buckets: Marketing and other SG&A. 
SG&A details for the second quarter are as follows: marketing cost decreased to 11.4% of net revenues for the quarter from 11.6% in the prior year period, with modest leverage driven primarily by the strong net revenues during second quarter. Our SG&A cost increased 32.9% of net revenues for the quarter from 31.9% in the prior year, driven primarily by our Connected Fitness acquisitions and investments in our Brand House strategy. Operating income for the second quarter decreased 8% to $32 million compared with $35 million in the prior year period. Interest and other expense for the second quarter increased to $4 million compared with the $1 million in the prior year period, primarily reflecting increased interest expense associated with the financing of our Connected Fitness acquisitions. Our second quarter tax rate of 46.7% was favorable to the 47.5% rate last year, primarily due to certain tax planning strategies. 
Our second quarter net income decreased 17% to $15 million compared to $18 million in the prior year period, while our diluted earnings per share decreased to $0.07 from $0.08 in the prior year's period. On the balance sheet, total cash and cash equivalents for the quarter decreased 43% to $171 million compared with $300 million at June 30, 2014. Inventory for the quarter increased 26% to $837 million compared to $662 million at June 30, 2014. Total debt increased to $716 million, as compared to $197 million at June 30, 2014, primarily reflecting the financing of our Connected Fitness acquisition. 
Looking at our cash flows. Our investment and capital expenditures was $91 million for the second quarter compared to $29 million in the prior year's period, driven primarily by our investments in our SAP platform and our global retail strategy. 
Now moving on to our updated 2015 guidance. Based on current visibility, we expect 2015 net revenues of approximately $3.84 billion, representing growth of 25%, and 2015 operating income in the range of $405 million to $408 million, representing growth of 14% to 15%. We have long stated that we'd be opportunistic with our investment levels if and when the right situations present themselves. In the period where we have seen unprecedented success from our athletes on a global stage, we believe we have a unique opportunity to position ourselves more aggressively in key long-term growth categories, such as basketball and golf, which we believe can create brand halos across the Under Armour portfolio. As a result, we expect to spend more than originally planned in marketing throughout the remainder of the year, and this is the primary reason we are raising our full year net revenues guidance, while maintaining the upper end of our previous operating income guidance. We believe this will better position our brand in delivering long-term sustainable growth. 
As a reminder, our operating income guidance includes the dilutive impact of the Connected Fitness acquisitions, consisting of one-time transaction cost in the first quarter, operating losses from these businesses and noncash amortization charges of the intangible assets generated from the acquisitions. Below operating results, we continue to expect a full year effective tax rate of approximately 41% compared to 39.2% in the prior year, primarily given the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, which continues to negatively impact our international profitability. 
Now I'd also like to provide some additional color on several items, starting with revenues. We expect the growth rate in Footwear to continue outpacing the growth rate for the overall business during the second half of the year. International growth is expected to ease from the growth rate achieved in the first half of 2015, as we begin to cycle through our entry into Latin America, as well as new distributor partnerships launched during the second half of 2014. From a cadence standpoint, we expect relatively consistent net revenue growth rates during the third and fourth quarters. 
Now looking at gross margins. We continue to expect our full year gross margin will be roughly in line with last year's 49% rate. During the third quarter, we continue to expect an approximate 50 basis-point contraction, primarily due to the negative impact of the stronger U.S. dollar. In SG&A, we expect the combined impact of higher planned marketing spend I previously discussed and ongoing other SG&A expense pressure will result in similar year-over-year growth rate in the third quarter, as experienced during the first half of the year. Finally, a quick look at our planned capital expenditures. We continue to plan 2015 capital expenditures in the range of $330 million to $340 million. Consistent with our prior guidance, approximately $140 million of this total is allocated across 3 large areas to support long-term growth, including our new domestic distribution center, the expansion of our corporate headquarters in Baltimore and a new and expanded SAP platform. We will also accelerate our investments in key areas that will drive revenue growth, including the rollouts of our global retail strategy and new E-Commerce sites.

And for me, personally, I remember how I felt when I had this idea for a T-shirt, or more importantly, a piece of equipment to be worn underneath athletes' uniforms or equipment that in the past, it's always just been a short-sleeved cotton t-shirt and a long-sleeve or a large-fit cotton t-shirt, depending on the weather, and it just felt like how come no one has done this before. And for me personally is when we look at this opportunity to begin with, it felt like there's this massive white space and that no one, no one in the world is measuring sort of an athletes' performance. And you start to see these things coming around, whether it's wearables and biometric measurement, et cetera, and we dabbled in that all the way back to 2008. But we quickly came to realize the value for us was not going to be in, I think, the equipment side of it, but the value for us is going to be in the community, and we feel like we've really locked that up. The fact that consumers have no barometer for their health today is a mistake, and frankly, that's where we see this massive opportunity, and we feel that we're the best ones to take advantage of it, really, because of the acquisitions that we made over the last 2 years. The sheer size and scale of the community that we've made, it marks us as a clear leader by a factor of as much as 4, 3 or at least 2x, now having more than 140 million unique registered users. And as I mentioned in my script, adding more than 100,000 users, are downloading 1 of our 4 apps today: MapMyFitness, Endomondo, MyFitnessPal or Under Armour record. And again, from the stats that I read off as well, I want to drive them home because I think it's incredible. We log more than 1 billion workouts, were logged into 1 of our 4 apps over the last -- just since the beginning of the year. More than 5 billion different foods have been logged as well. And giving the scale, MyFitnessPal, which is the largest of the 4 apps that we have, and as we continue to merge them, that voice will continue to come out as we articulated, but this is the world's largest database in the history of mankind of food. I mean, just think about it for a second that we log more than 5 billion food that we know in over 80 countries what people are eating and what they're putting in their body. So we now believe we've got the ability to be relevant across all of our platforms, and we're going to work to merge them into a consistent product that reads the daily dashboard. I mean, ultimately, that's where we're heading. We think that the consumer just needs a dashboard that just says, ""How am I doing?"" If I can look on my cellphone, and I can figure out my bank balance, my stock price or the weather in a given city, the fact that I have no measure of barometer for my health, expect for going to see a doctor every 12, 18 or 24 months, we think, is really a crime. So we were identifying that as 4 key place that the consumer should be measuring themselves, the athletes should measuring themselves. Sleep, how much did I sleep last night; fitness, did I exercise or not and if so, to what degree. Daily activity, which is typically, like the steps, like how much am I moving around; and then fourth, and probably most importantly, what am I putting in my body, my nutrition. And we thought a lot about this, and I think one thing I really want to get across is sort of the way that we're thinking about defining success. And we do believe that there needs to be a daily dashboard, and so we will -- you will continue to see that articulate itself through the Under Armour Record platform, and we've got many things coming from that, particularly we'll showcase for you at Investor Day. But if you ask us to sum it up, we're looking for an engaged user community that relies on Under Armour and the Connected Fitness ecosystem we are building to help them measure those 4 central areas: the sleep, fitness, daily activity and nutrition, and more importantly, we want to empower people. This isn't just about knowing that I took 8,000 steps yesterday, but because I took 8,000 steps, how did that make me feel. And more importantly, how did that work with how I slept or whether I exercise or what I ate that next day. And we think that having that information is going to allow them to make better decisions to live healthier and a rich life. I mean, affecting, I think, ultimately, obviously, fitness, the way that it work, but we think there's the outlook for us to affect global health, and that's what's get us so excited. And by doing this, of course, we believe that realtime is a company that focuses on selling shirts and shoes. We believe that we're going to create engagement with consumer to give them a reason to interact with our brand multiple times a day. And I think all those things lead to this energy that you're feeling from us, and frankly, the resources that we've expended over the last couple of years positions ourselves, I think, really uniquely and unlike any other brand, especially in our space, but frankly, anyone who's looking at the biometric measurement for the athlete, and ultimately, for any end consumer. So as I said, this is going to be a big part of the focus that we have at our Investor Day in September, and I encourage you to come in and see what we have coming on. But incredibly exciting for us, an I think, there's a lot more to come."

So I think we should look much better on the retail floor in a more timely fashion for back-to-school this year, so we're looking -- we're thinking pretty well about that. As we get in the back of the year also, just to remember, also, in our guidance kind of consistent with how we look at things in the past years too, especially when you look at fourth quarter. In our guidance, we've been consistent, I think, in the last couple of years talking about being very prudent in how we forecast the fourth quarter relative to weather and holiday, and so forth, and not taking things for granted there in our guidance. So I'd say those are the 2 things in the back half of the year, revenue guidance, a better flow in back-to-school, and also consistent of how where we're approaching the fourth quarter revenue guidance."

So the ability for us to invest in our stories here, tell our stories, take advantage of the unique environment we're in and say that we're going to drive a much, much more top line in the back half of the year because of that, I think there's no doubt that we'll see some benefit, and we expect to see some benefit, and that's kind of included in our guidance. But the real story here is about beyond 2015. It's about 2016 and beyond of what this does, especially in key categories, again, like basketball and golf. And if you just think about basketball for a second, and you take Stephen Curry and the ability for us to tell a story in a category that is influential, not only in the basketball category, but just the younger consumer and what that can mean for our youth business in 2016 to '17 and beyond. That's what we're really talking about here. It's just the longer term opportunity versus the shorter term opportunity."

And without question, the performances of Steph, and really, breaking through, I mean -- since we signed Steph 3 years ago, he's always an underdog, but he was always the best everywhere he went, and so getting credit for that is something we're really proud of in doing, whether it was -- first of all, most important thing to him was winning the championship, but then the league MVP, and then his acknowledgment at the SBs, where I think, among all athletes, he has broken through, and that's a really difficult thing to do, particularly in a sports like basketball, and so we're proud of what that means. But it's not a one-way ticket to all of a sudden, you've arrived, but there's a lot of work for us to be done and there's a lot more. One thing I learned a long time ago, and I remember the first time an Under Armour logo popped up on the front cover of U.S. Today sports page, and I thought, I was going to walk in the office and the place to be flooded with orders, it's not just the way it goes, and so brands are built on consistency. Consistency is built in trust, and trust is built on drops, and it's lost in buckets. And so what you see is we have a great big pouring, I think, of credibility in the sport of basketball, and what Steph brings to us on a day-to-day basis. But that's going to require a lot more investment and it's going to require a long-term commitment, and so we want to let everybody know, particularly, our consumer, but frankly, our competition as well that we are moving into basketball. We've been working on this for -- it's not an overnight success. We've been working for years, if not, a decade, and we're incredibly proud of where we've gotten to, but we're really just getting started. So as far as basketball, as the category goes, we've been working. We've had great support from our sporting goods partners first and primarily, where, I think, we really have that kid who is buying product to play at the high school level and we've had -- we've been working on with the right assortments there, and really getting behind footwear for us as an initiative, particularly in basketball. And then in the mall channel, the -- whether it's Finish Line or Foot Locker, and I described what we're doing with Champs Sports through Foot Locker with The ARMOURY series. It's going to be a really neat opportunity for us, I think, to change the way that consumer is looking at the brand, the way that they see us, is that breaking through and having people see you with the basketball brand. Again, it's just taking -- it's taking a lot of time and the chance for us to, I think, really differentiate ourselves from the brand that maybe people have seen as us to the brand that we see ourselves, the brand we're going to be. So Steph is a big part of that."

So if somebody asks another question about that, we can circle back on footwear. But in international, as I'm sitting in Munich, opening this new office and cutting the ribbon this afternoon, first of all, what Charlie has done for our International business in really helping us accelerate and think about ourselves as a global brand, but more importantly, beginning to act like a global brand. We're fast in the way of doing that. This would be our 17th office that we've opened up, I think, our fifth or sixth this year. In a way, that relates to our brand's incredibly authentic. And if you were here, it basically -- it feels like Baltimore in Munich, and beginning, of course, with, I think,  the esthetic, the way the place looks, but the team, the people, the energy, just incredibly, incredibly proud, and you're seeing that at retail too. We went and walked stores. We saw 3 of the largest sports stores and retailers that are here in Germany and throughout Europe over the last couple of days, and the excitement we have from the very tops of these organizations and the belief they have that Under Armour can penetrate, where we are very, very -- we are very young, and we are just getting started here. While we've been doing business in selling stuff, probably for the last 8 or 9 or close to 10 years now, we're really beginning to do business. And I think it's reflective, obviously, in our revenues. I mean, 93% revenue growth in the second quarter alone, 83% revenue growth in International year-to-date, 94% growth in 2014. So that idea of coming close to doubling and the plans we talked about is growing by about 50% a year in International, and it's something, I think, that we get really excited that is incredible realistic to happen. A number of things that we have from a product standpoint. We remain positioned, really, in a premium way, the consumer sees us, and so I think it's where the retailers wants us as well. We are a full-priced brand basically everywhere we do business, and that's no different abroad. We learned a lot in this about how our brand translates through Japan and learning that Under Armour moves outside of North America, and we're just seeing that reinforced especially here in Europe. We're doing a lot of that around the strategic accounts and core markets with premium shop-in-shop investments that we can have, and that's been a real positive for us with the right marquee retailers. From a retail standpoint as well, we've opened 18 Brand House stores in the second quarter in places like Chile, China, Taiwan, Malaysia, the Philippines. We're targeting more than 100 additional global Brand House stores, opening in 2015, built off of a base of 73 in 2014, 3 quarters of which are going to be located in Asia, 85% of those that will be doors, where we we'll be leveraging distributors partners that will be opening those up. And just some perspective, the majority of those stores are, obviously, I guess, going to be in China. I guess, that would be obvious. But just for some perspective, in the month of September alone, we're going to be opening roughly 1 store per day in the month of September, so it's since going to be a big month for us, and it's something we've been perfecting for the last 5 and 6 years. There, and really, globally, with Susie McCabe and our -- and Henry and our retail team are really becoming expert in how to open and translate our store, and have a consistent message for the brand everywhere we show up. So not to be lost in all the physical manifestation of the brand that we're putting at retail is, I think, some of the success that we're seeing in E-Commerce. The second quarter alone, we launched new sites in Thailand, Austria, Ireland, Belgium, Portugal, and I think we've also been working on translating our sites as well and making sure they're open. The new markets continues to be a real big opportunity for us. One thing I don't want to get lost in this message is it's not all roses either because going global is not an easy thing. It's a slug. It's an investment. It's something we're continuing to get better. So while we're pleased with the results that we're seeing, we still see that there's a tremendous amount of meat left on the bone, with the opportunity for us to improve in that. Our fulfillment rates are not where they need to be. Our -- the wholesale partners have been incredibly patient with us, as we get this settled and organized. But things like Brad mentioned, with our new SAP upgrades and implementations, they're going to make a big difference with systems and processes, and there's is part of the shift to becoming a global brand. So across the world in EMEA, as I mentioned, having spent the last couple of days here in Europe, a lot of excitement, a lot of energy, of course, driven in part by our sports marketing assets, the success we see in there, but I think, really, it's the teams in the ground and it's the energy, and it's the culture of the brand that's -- is really the leading the way. Asia, a lot of the incredibly exciting things happening there. Japan continues to be a stalwart for us and leading. But as I mentioned, things like China, where all the stores we're opening up and what we're doing in September, we're going to drive a lot of energy from the Stephen Curry tour that we'll be taking him through for about 7 days over there between Japan. Obviously, 3 stops in China, and then a few other stops as well. So it will be very exciting. And then Latin America, I think energy is still building around Brazil, especially with the Olympics coming back and things we have there. We opened our first Brand House in Sao Paulo in the MorumbiShopping mall and it's doing very, very well. And really, every place that we've opened stores, I think, we're outperforming. So haven't seen any surprises to the downside. There's tremendous amount of heat and energy to the brand. I'm living and feeling that today and excited for about 350 to 400 of our closest friends and media partners are going to come over and help us cut our ribbon this afternoon. So a lot of energy about Under Armour being here in Germany, and really every place we're opening offices and stores around the world. So it's a good story. It's good news, but as I said, there's still room for us to improve, and you'll see us ambitiously go after that."

We've tried implementing it for years, and then we sort of got to this point where it's hard. It's not easy to change things is that we are -- we've not been end-use driven in the past. We are basically -- we've got an apparel team. We have a footwear team. We have an accessory team, and we think that, that obviously has worked in getting us started, but we're at the point where we're reaching the size, and frankly, the scale to be able to afford, and more importantly, not be able to not afford to go after really addressing category management. And the thing we use with the sport of golf, which really got us excited several years ago, where we implemented this, and we identified a leader, and they really took the bull by the horns and started with product and organizing everything from the way that we showed up in our sporting goods, in our wholesale partners, the way we showed up on the green grass gulf course. And also given the same control over to how we're going to spend the marketing dollars, and that meant -- and additionally, we showed up with things like POP and marketing, all the way to the assets that we signed, and so it was a great story that led us to getting us to Jordan Spieth. The things for all of these, and as we're going to think about category management, it's going to come down the leadership. And what we wanted was accountability, and where golf started is that I never -- after a golf tournament several ago, sitting on a Sunday, and I'm watching and not feeling great about the way that one of our golfers was outfitted. And I write an email and say, ""This isn't working well."" And I think I had 18 people CC-ed on the email, and saying this is ridiculous. We should get this to much more consistent manner, where we can flow the information in a better way that will be more effective, and ultimately, it's going to better serve the end-use consumer and the athlete. So I use that theme of thinking bigger, and that's where -- us hiring Terdema Ussery, who's going to join us and has great experience in this industry, is someone who knows everyone who's got a five-star resume of leadership and success, and frankly, a really great person, I think, that just as importantly as anything is his expertise and he's smart, it's the culture fit that he's going to be at Under Armour. So there's a lot to happen there, but I think we have almost forced the issue. And while we've been working through -- these pieces, we're going to give you a lot more color at Investor Day as well that will tell you a little more specific how we're thinking about it. But ultimately, the idea is we're not going to just pull the plug and eliminate our Apparel and our Footwear groups. There's going to be a bit of transition there. The first way we're going to start though is identifying the category leadership across. It's roughly 9 different categories that we have right now that we've identified where we want a true general manager to run each of these that will have both, in some instances, clear P&L responsibility, in other instances, a bit of virtual P&L responsibility. But the most important thing is we're going to create accountability across each of these divisions, where, hopefully, it will drive and prevent us from things that may be perceived as inauthentic and making sure that we preserve the Under Armour life. But again, I use that example of golf. In just the sport of golf, in the last 2 years, our revenue has more than doubled. We're seeing key category growth throughout the rest of the year, things like on our website, our play-off polos, the #1 item at our Brand House and our E-Commerce sites. The business is basically up everywhere. We have our key asset, which is the one thing, which led us -- we're able to find the right asset with Jordan, really, leading the way out there has been an absolute kill and home run for us too. And it also allows us to launch new categories, like we'll have a authentic golf shoe coming out, and you're seeing Jordan wearing our golf club out there on the course. So all these things from the right asset, from the right marketing, from the right positioning, being in the right retail distribution, it's all really led us to get this. So we're excited in what we've seen. The success in golf is something we'll hopefully see you -- us translate through in things like basketball and running. And really, the obvious category that you'd imagine, we'd be looking for, sport and using global football, of course, and things like that. So we want to win. We think that the opportunity for us do that is not defined about what anybody else has done. And we carved a bit of our own legs, but still, at the same time, there's a lot of good lessons to learn from other people that have done this before too. So I think we're going to take the best of all worlds and we'll do what's best for the Under Armour brand."

The mall has been different. I think Champs is a great -- it's sort of a -- it's a bit of a step from the sporting goods into the mall, and because they played that bit of a twiner role. But Champs and Foot Locker, as a whole, has been an amazing partner for us, and it's something, I think, where we can translate our existing consumer. It help get them used to thinking about us in a mall environment. We still see ourselves as a holistic head-to-toe brand, and our philosophy remains that we're going to go where our consumers want, and frankly, where they expect us. And so what we're looking for is further ways that we can build relationships with our wholesale partners to elevate the product story for the best Under Armour. We're only in roughly 25% of the 3,400 global footing stores today, but obviously, we're working with their team and aligning with that. The ARMOURY and Champs is a great example of how we can grow our business and the relationship together. We're testing a handful of these premium shop and shops over the next couple of years, starting with our own backyard in Maryland. In the early days that we've seen this thing, the first several weeks are very, very, very encouraging. The merchandising is going to consist of a mixture of inline product, mall-specific product, in addition to some product not found also in the mall too, so things like that. We're putting our Highlight Cleat's into the mall channel, into The ARMOURY, and it's getting just the deeper breadth of the sort of the Under Armour experience in the mall environment. So I think it's exciting. I encourage you to get a chance and we can put out a listing, and Tom and the team can let you know. When we got some of those, go see one for yourself as well."

The first partnership deal that I've signed was with the NFL Europe league. So we're no stranger to international business. It's becoming good at it, more importantly, I think, in a lot of places, particularly, here in Europe. Continuity is an incredibly important lesson and attribute with any brand. Consistency is very, very important, doing things the same way. I mean, it's a continent that's defined by history. And brands that sort of come in, live today and are gone tomorrow, I think everyone have seen a lot of that. So a lot of it is a bit of questioning. They're waiting you out and wondering, are you going to make it, are you going to be there. And what we've seen is the brand, it's taking a while. It doesn't happen on the first handshake. It doesn't happen on the first introduction. And we came over to Europe for the first time back at the end of 2005 and in 2006, and it was a -- it's been a slug. We weren't really understanding completely what we have going on. At the same time, we're also organizing ourselves in North America. The thing we think about with Brad and my job and our entire executive team's job is, again, is defining and deciding how to deploy the resources, the time, people and money. There's only so much of any one of them. And we're torn with the fact that it's always international. It's such a small part of our business, and so U.S. and North America would usually dominate the amount of time we spend. So as we've grown, you've seen us going all the way back to 2009 and 2010. I think we fielded a lot of questions of why are you pouring this money into Europe, why are you pouring this money, and where is the return going to come? And so we had this long story of long-term investments in things like Women's, long term investments in things like Footwear, long term investments in something like International. And this year, and we said, I don't know if it's a big enough comment, but we're going to be profitable in Europe this year. And that was something, if you went back 5 years, you may have fielded the question on why not throw in the towel. Can you really be successful there? Why not just focus on North America? So we're now looking at A, our profitability, and it's been one asset at a time, and it's been things from joining EPL football, with people and places like Tottenham Hotspur, and then finding ways to make investments. The recent announcement we had with São Paulo Futebol Clube down in Brazil, it's not an immediate return for us. I've always said I don't really see us as a licensed jersey manufacturer. I don't like that idea of growing sport by simply selling fan gear. We want to be on the authentic athlete. We want to be on the pitch, on the court, on the field, but there's ways for us to get in. So finding the resource that we can splinter off to make an investment in a market that's very new for us, like Brazil, it's a big deal, and so we're -- I think we're very patiently doing that around the globe where we're finding assets that makes sense, and especially, we can reinforce it in markets that we can create an ROI that's sooner than later. So it's a big -- running something global, and we said that a long time, but really, understanding what it means to be a global company. That takes time, and it takes experience, and it takes maturity, and it takes patience, and many of the things that maybe you would characterize as us not having in the first few years as a company. But I think that we've been developing that skill set, and most importantly, we've been developing that leadership team. So Terdema is a great example of that coming onboard, and I think you're seeing it filled out throughout our company, and something that will only continue to get bigger and better for us as a brand. So we're learning a lot of lessons. As I said, we're -- there are mistakes in there, believe me, but when it comes through with, I think, the performance of the 90-plus percent revenue growth that we saw this quarter and is reflective of, I think, what you're seeing happening, one thing I can tell you is it's a tremendous pull, it's tremendous demand for the brand right now. It's a matter of our execution. There's a lot of places that we can improve, we can enhance, we can better. I called out supply chain specifically is that it's difficult figuring out how to move products, that duty conscious and being careful and being able to make money and not getting crushed on margin and learning how to manufacture locally, and so we've been learning all these lessons. The good news, this isn't something we've been doing for the last 3 or 6 months. This is something we've been doing for, really, the last 6 to 10 years. So we're certainly not climbing with the extras right now, but we feel great about our trajectory. We feel great about our team. We remain humble and hungry, and we got a shot. The mission here is to be the next great global brand, and you're going to see us fight, crawl and scratch and do everything we can to make that happen. So we'll keep running hard for you. That's for sure."

When we made the announcement at what we called Digital Day a few days -- following our 2014 earnings call, we told you, there were 120 million people roughly on the platform and then it was about a month or so later, I was on a -- I did a talking head show, and we said 130 million, and now, today, we're telling you it's over 140 million people. We will be really careful to sort of quantifying these things in terms of the number of users we have. Our next job is really figuring out how to make them good quality users as well is that I'd take 40 million hyper-engaged people that really we're very getting -- benefiting from the brand and using our apps and our ecosystem, using that as a learning place that we could grow that out to a broader audience. At the same time, the scale that we're growing is nothing we want to ignore, but we think the definition of success is not just the total top line number of users. How we're growing north of 30%, and seeing that consistently happen, that is going to be something that's positive. But what I think you'll see from us, and again, we're going to go deeper on our own Investor Day into what the story of Connected Fitness means for the Under Armour brand, is that there's a high-level engagement that we're going to be able to drive with that. And without a doubt, our Gear Tracker side alone, which is something that's exclusive to the MapMyFitness platform, there's more than 400,000 people that are actively tracking products, and whether they compare shoes that they wear or whatever item that the use. I think it's close to 2,000 people a day are signing up for Gear Tracker. So people are interested in this idea of the Internet of Things, that theory being that, eventually everything that we have is going to have a chip in it. So 1 billion connected things in 2010, and I think the projection is by 2020, it's going to be over 25 billion or 30 billion connected things in the world. So we obviously want to use that to make ourselves smart, and to honestly to help enrich and improve the life of our consumers. So we think we're going to have the ability to do that, we think, getting smart in everything we do. Again, the thing I'm probably most proud of with these acquisitions, of course, the community we built, the team we built, but also, I think, the level of engagement that we're creating with the consumer, of giving them a reason to think about themselves holistically. This idea of approaching health and arming people with the ability to make better decisions for themselves is a pretty powerful, powerful thing that, I think, who's going to own that information or who's going to help give you that and organize that information for you, shouldn't be a health care provider, shouldn't be a drugstore, shouldn't be a health insurance company or shouldn't be a sports brand that you trust. And so we think we have a great connection with the athletes. We think that we can test and prototype this with -- at the highest levels with people, like the University of Notre Dame football team. And if it's good enough for them, we think it's a -- and some of our other marquee athletes, it should be good enough for the consumers. So building that trust is going to be paramount in doing this. And yes, we think we're going to be able to sell more shirts and shoes ultimately, but we think we're going to be able to continue to transform what the Under Armour brand is, and we'll continuously be able do that."

I am calling in from Munich, Germany where later today, we are opening our newest International office from which we will serve the markets in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. This is my last stop of a weeklong trip that is taking me to multiple cities, including Glascow, Copenhagen, and now, Munich. As we continue to grow our global footprint, these trips continue to provide deeper insight into the markets and how consumers are thinking about our brand. My visit to Copenhagen reconfirmed and enhanced the excitement around our recent Endomondo acquisition, and a huge opportunity that Connected Fitness provides UA with global consumers.  With today's ribbon cutting in Munich, we will now have 17 regional offices outside the United States, which are positioning the brand closer to the local consumer and driving the incredible execution we have seen in the past year, including 93% international net revenue growth just this past quarter. That strong growth outside the United States helped drive total net revenues for the quarter up 29%, the 21st consecutive quarter of 20-plus-percent net revenue growth. In addition, total apparel net revenues grew by 23%, marking the 23rd consecutive quarter of 20-plus percent net revenue growth. We have traditionally referred to this as our scoreboard, but based on my visits to Saint Andrews early this week, maybe we should refer to it as a leaderboard. Either way, we continue to shoot consistently great numbers. As we prepare to enter our 20th-year in the business of sports, we have learned a lot of valuable lessons. Some of them have been learned through business, but just as many probably have been learned through sport. 
Over the past year, 3 Under Armour athletes have transcended their sports, and become known by just their first names, Stephen, Misty and Jordan. These 3 athletes have combined to teach us one incredibly valuable lesson that we need to think bigger. For Stephen Curry, Misty Copeland and Jordan Spieth, being a great basketball player, principal ballerina and PGA golfer was rooted in their ability to see beyond, to be prepared to not just be great, but to be extraordinary, to plan and practice, but also know when to take the risk. Our lessons out of this are incredibly relevant to this moment in time for the Under Armour brand. First, our athletes' success pushes us to see beyond just maximizing the revenue opportunities in any given quarter. It forces us to think clearly about what we need to be do better, and how we need to organize to be more than just an American sports brand, to go from changing the way athletes dress to changing the way athletes live. Second, this intense brand heat provides us with abundant opportunities to invest in businesses like basketball, Women's and golf that will not only grow our share within those large categories, but will also positively impact all of our business across both categories and geographies. So my 2 main topics today are how do we invest to capitalize in that momentum, and how do we organize to think bigger about the opportunities in front of us today. 
Thinking bigger is part of what drives the world's greatest athletes to outperform on the highest stage, and it's hard to think of 3 individuals who have done more of that recently than Stephen, Misty and Jordan. And the best part is that just like UA, they too are just getting started.  Stephen Curry, NBA league MVP, world champion, recently voted Best Male Athlete and Best NBA Player at the ESPYs, and most importantly, new father of a baby girl who one day might give her big sister, Riley, some competition for the spotlight. A pretty good stretch for a great young man and tremendously rewarding for Under Armour to be part of his on-court success. We're taking Stephen on a tour in China and other markets in Asia, starting late next month, and frankly, we believe he's just beginning to touch upon his potential both in the U.S. and other key basketball markets across the globe. 
Misty Copeland, trailblazer, prima ballerina, athlete, named last month as the first female African-American principal dancer with the American Ballet Theatre. Again, tremendous pride on our behalf to be involved early in Misty's meteoric rise by helping introduce her to an audience beyond the ballet world with last year's, I WILL WHAT I WANT campaign. 
Jordan Spieth. When we signed him more than 2.5 years ago, we told you to watch out for this young man, as we had a strong feeling he was going to turn into a huge asset for our Golf business. It's amazing for all of us that in such a short time, he's gone from being one of the names touted as the future of golf to being the story of golf, not just now, but we believe, well into the future. And while I'd be remiss to not at least mention the great performances by other UA athletes, this quarter, not this year: Andy Murray, Carey Price, Bryce Harper, Todd Frazier, The Cincinnati Reds, who last week won the Home Run Derby in front of his home crowd at the Great American ballpark. The recent accomplishments of Stephen, Misty and Jordan are somewhat overwhelming and heavily impactful. Their achievements these past few weeks represent a moment in time for the Under Armour brand, one that forces us to reassess our opportunities and look deeper to understand what all the success means for us. There is, of course, the immediate benefit to our brand. This brand heat is driving huge amounts and incremental traffic to our E-Commerce platform across the globe, with our basketball traffic up more than 300% year-over-year while in our social channels, we added more followers on Instagram during the recent NBA finals than we did in all of 2014. The Curry One shoe was a great success in our E-Commerce site, as we continue to gain share in key Footwear categories with our wholesale partners. Our Women's business continues to grow strongly in key areas, like capris, shorts, sports bras and running footwear, while our E-Commerce Golf business was exceptional, growing about 60% year-over-year. But there is a bigger takeaway for our company and all of these. We've learned from these athletes, not only about the preparation it takes to be great, but the added level of commitment it takes to be truly special. 
All 3 of these athletes started as clear underdogs, yet were able to put themselves in a position where their skills and focus enabled them to transcend their sport. All of them have proven, as Jordan Spieth stated, following his Masters victory when asked why he chose Under Armour, that being aggressive, young and fearless can be a deadly combination. Our athletes' ability to see what was needed to be excellent forces us to think bigger. It requires we accept there are moments in time where we need to accelerate to take advantage of the new opportunities our brand momentum creates. We understand there are short-term benefit to this unprecedented momentum, but we are focused on the long-term. To us, this moment provides a great chance to build a more meaningful connection with our consumer through the power of these transcendent athletes, and that connection can be deeper and more powerful for our brand than any short-term spike in our revenues or our earnings. Without question, the brand equity we are creating right now will benefit our business more significantly over the long term than it will simply just this year. Specifically, in a large category, like basketball, we've had incredible success for the Curry One Footwear, including some very hot selling limited releases. But that brand heat, evidenced by the lines outside our Brand House stores on release day, gives us great confidence in the brand we are building with Stephen Curry and our strategy in bringing new product to market. It has motivated our Footwear team. It has given confidence to our retail partners about expanding presence in the basketball category amongst others, particularly in the mall. 
We recently debuted a new shop-in-shop concept with Champ sports, called The ARMOURY, which highlights, not only the basketball category, but a broader mix of product and innovation that the athletes' been historically unable to find from our brand in the mall. This is great evidence of the confidence we have in our product and the continued success we are seeing across our offerings with our key retail partners. And like basketball, that same foundation and confidence is building in our Golf and Women's businesses. We're still developing a wide consumer audience in these 3 categories here in the U.S. and the opportunity for us in international markets is abundant. The second element of thinking bigger lies in how we organize our business, and in this case, thinking bigger means thinking smaller, thinking in a way that enables us to be more surgical with how we reach our consumer and the experiences we provide them. 
To look at our end-use consumer more discreetly and with more discipline. As the breadth of our product mix continues to expand, we're moving to a sports category focused organizational structure that will enable us to maintain our focus on the needs of that end-use consumer. We recognize that a UA-run consumer has different needs than a UA basketball consumer, and we are now in a great position to harness the overall strength of our brand and innovation pipeline to ensure we are exceeding expectations for all of our consumers. To help drive this initiative, we have recently brought on Terdema Ussery, who for the past 18 years have served as President of the NBA Dallas Mavericks, and has prior industry experience in athletic Footwear and Apparel. 
We can speak to this in more depth at our Investor Day Meeting in September, but we want to be clear today about our intent. This category of focus will provide the structure to help us sell more shirts and shoes. This structure has proven successful for us in golf with a combination of great product, a great asset and a great team helped to double revenues the past 2 years. This increased category will us help drive our core business, a critical component in our long-term growth story. 
The last piece I want to cover today is our evolution from a brand that started by just making compression tees to one now focused on perfecting shirts and shoes, as well as creating authentic and relevant sports and fitness experiences every time and everywhere our consumer interacts with our brand. We can do so because of the strength of our Connected Fitness platform, where we continue to add more than 100,000 unique registered users to the platform every single day. We remain in the early stages of uncovered potential of one of the world's largest digital health and fitness community, with now over 140 million athletes can do to help us build consumer engagement and drive healthier lifestyles. We are growing our community at more than 30% year-over-year, and so far, in 2015, these users have voluntarily logged over 1 billion workouts and more than 5 billion foods have been logged into our apps. This level and detail of data will empower us to provide actionable insights back to our community that will have them lead a healthier lifestyle, and we believe the brand equity that can provide us is immeasurable. Ultimately, the more people exercise, the more athletic footwear and apparel they will buy. Again, we will provide deeper detail on our Connected Fitness opportunities in September at our Investor Day, but we are extremely pleased with the growth of our community and the type of insight we can bring to our consumers' lives.  
So just before I hand it back to Brad, I want to reiterate our commitment to growth. We have delivered 21 consecutive quarters of 20-plus percent revenue growth. We are growing in key areas like Footwear, Women's and International, and doing so while investing in new opportunities like Connected Fitness, which we believe will be critical to our continued growth. And most importantly, we have the capacity to adapt, to change course and accelerate investments when the opportunity calls for it and to think bigger about what the Under Armour brand can eventually be. 
There are so many great things going on in Under Armour today, which are difficult to fully articulate in a 1 hour conference call. I look forward to seeing all of you at our Investor Day in September at our headquarters in Baltimore to further showcase the brand that we are building. We remain aggressive, young and fearless, and I'm excited to provide more color on how we are thinking and organizing to become the next great global brand. 
And with that, let me turn it over to Brad."

On a currency-neutral basis, net revenues in",1554,"Thanks, Kevin. I would now like to spend some time discussing our second quarter results, followed by our updated outlook for 2015. Our net revenues for the second quarter of 2015 increased 29% to $784 million. On a currency-neutral basis, net revenues increased 31% for the period.  Within our product categories, we grew apparel net revenues 23% to $515 million compared to $420 million in the prior year's quarter. Many of the same growth drivers that drove our first quarter Apparel business continued during the second quarter, including our new Armour Baselayer, updated train products and expanded golf and hunting lines. 
Second quarter Footwear net revenues increased 40% to $154 million from $110 million in the prior year. We continue to gain significant traction across multiple Footwear categories, most notably within the larger markets of running and basketball. SpeedForm remains a key growth story for our brand, where we've introduced this innovation across a wider range of styles and categories this year. And as Kevin mentioned, we capitalized on the incredible success of Stephen Curry in basketball, with new color waves quickly selling out during his MVP and championship run with the Warriors. 
Our accessories net revenues during the second quarter increased 39% to $83 million from $60 million last year, primarily driven by strong consumer demand for our line of bags. Our global Direct-to-Consumer net revenues increased 33% for the quarter, representing approximately 32% of net revenues. We continue to be encouraged with our recent Brand House openings, including the first full quarter of results for our Chicago and Mall of America stores, as well as the new second quarter openings in Indianapolis and Orlando. From a global standpoint, we entered the second quarter with 160 owned stores, including 139 Factory House stores and 21 Brand House stores. Our E-Commerce business had a standout quarter, and we're seeing the return on our investment in mobile optimization across our expanding list of global sites. While an ongoing focus on mobile is key, we were also able to drive strong traffic gain through more effective email communications, as well as by leveraging the incredible success of our athletes during the period. 
Looking at our regions, North American net revenues increased 22% to $681 million in the second quarter compared to $558 million in the prior year's quarter. On a currency-neutral basis, North America net revenues increased 23% based primarily on the drivers I highlighted for the overall company. International net revenues increased 93% to $89 million in the second quarter, and represented 11% of total net revenues. On a currency-neutral basis, International net revenues increased to 112% for the period. In the EMEA region, we continue to focus on the 3 core markets of the U.K., Germany and France, while also developing distributor agreements in the region, including the Middle East. In Asia Pacific, our partner store expansion in E-Commerce growth in China remain key stories, and we also benefited from the rollout of our distributor agreement in Southeast Asia. And in Latin America, we are seeing balanced growth throughout the region, following our market entry into many of these countries during 2014. 
Moving on to margins. Second quarter gross margins contracted 80 basis points to 48.4% compared to 49.2% in the prior year's period. The following factors were the primary drivers during the quarter: first, as we previously outlined, the continued strength of the U.S dollar negatively impacted gross margins by approximately 60 basis points in the second quarter versus the prior year; second, we incurred higher air freight expense in the second quarter, primarily due to our efforts to normalize product flow from the West Coast port disruption and better service of back-to-school selling season, which negatively impacted gross margins by approximately 50 basis points. Partially offsetting this margin pressure is better margins in our Factory House business, combined with our higher margin Connected Fitness revenues, benefited gross margins by approximately 20 basis points in the second quarter. Selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of net revenues, delevers 80 basis points to 44.3% in the second quarter of 2015 from 43.5% in the prior year's period. As a reminder, starting last quarter, in an effort to simplify and streamline our conversation, we consolidated our SG&A detail into 2 primary buckets: Marketing and other SG&A. 
SG&A details for the second quarter are as follows: marketing cost decreased to 11.4% of net revenues for the quarter from 11.6% in the prior year period, with modest leverage driven primarily by the strong net revenues during second quarter. Our SG&A cost increased 32.9% of net revenues for the quarter from 31.9% in the prior year, driven primarily by our Connected Fitness acquisitions and investments in our Brand House strategy. Operating income for the second quarter decreased 8% to $32 million compared with $35 million in the prior year period. Interest and other expense for the second quarter increased to $4 million compared with the $1 million in the prior year period, primarily reflecting increased interest expense associated with the financing of our Connected Fitness acquisitions. Our second quarter tax rate of 46.7% was favorable to the 47.5% rate last year, primarily due to certain tax planning strategies. 
Our second quarter net income decreased 17% to $15 million compared to $18 million in the prior year period, while our diluted earnings per share decreased to $0.07 from $0.08 in the prior year's period. On the balance sheet, total cash and cash equivalents for the quarter decreased 43% to $171 million compared with $300 million at June 30, 2014. Inventory for the quarter increased 26% to $837 million compared to $662 million at June 30, 2014. Total debt increased to $716 million, as compared to $197 million at June 30, 2014, primarily reflecting the financing of our Connected Fitness acquisition. 
Looking at our cash flows. Our investment and capital expenditures was $91 million for the second quarter compared to $29 million in the prior year's period, driven primarily by our investments in our SAP platform and our global retail strategy. 
Now moving on to our updated 2015 guidance. Based on current visibility, we expect 2015 net revenues of approximately $3.84 billion, representing growth of 25%, and 2015 operating income in the range of $405 million to $408 million, representing growth of 14% to 15%. We have long stated that we'd be opportunistic with our investment levels if and when the right situations present themselves. In the period where we have seen unprecedented success from our athletes on a global stage, we believe we have a unique opportunity to position ourselves more aggressively in key long-term growth categories, such as basketball and golf, which we believe can create brand halos across the Under Armour portfolio. As a result, we expect to spend more than originally planned in marketing throughout the remainder of the year, and this is the primary reason we are raising our full year net revenues guidance, while maintaining the upper end of our previous operating income guidance. We believe this will better position our brand in delivering long-term sustainable growth. 
As a reminder, our operating income guidance includes the dilutive impact of the Connected Fitness acquisitions, consisting of one-time transaction cost in the first quarter, operating losses from these businesses and noncash amortization charges of the intangible assets generated from the acquisitions. Below operating results, we continue to expect a full year effective tax rate of approximately 41% compared to 39.2% in the prior year, primarily given the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, which continues to negatively impact our international profitability. 
Now I'd also like to provide some additional color on several items, starting with revenues. We expect the growth rate in Footwear to continue outpacing the growth rate for the overall business during the second half of the year. International growth is expected to ease from the growth rate achieved in the first half of 2015, as we begin to cycle through our entry into Latin America, as well as new distributor partnerships launched during the second half of 2014. From a cadence standpoint, we expect relatively consistent net revenue growth rates during the third and fourth quarters. 
Now looking at gross margins. We continue to expect our full year gross margin will be roughly in line with last year's 49% rate. During the third quarter, we continue to expect an approximate 50 basis-point contraction, primarily due to the negative impact of the stronger U.S. dollar. In SG&A, we expect the combined impact of higher planned marketing spend I previously discussed and ongoing other SG&A expense pressure will result in similar year-over-year growth rate in the third quarter, as experienced during the first half of the year. Finally, a quick look at our planned capital expenditures. We continue to plan 2015 capital expenditures in the range of $330 million to $340 million. Consistent with our prior guidance, approximately $140 million of this total is allocated across 3 large areas to support long-term growth, including our new domestic distribution center, the expansion of our corporate headquarters in Baltimore and a new and expanded SAP platform. We will also accelerate our investments in key areas that will drive revenue growth, including the rollouts of our global retail strategy and new E-Commerce sites.

So first of all, we see this as a -- just a massive white space. And for me, personally, I remember how I felt when I had this idea for a T-shirt, or more importantly, a piece of equipment to be worn underneath athletes' uniforms or",1024,"Yes. Thank you, Erinn. So first of all, we see this as a -- just a massive white space. And for me, personally, I remember how I felt when I had this idea for a T-shirt, or more importantly, a piece of equipment to be worn underneath athletes' uniforms or equipment that in the past, it's always just been a short-sleeved cotton t-shirt and a long-sleeve or a large-fit cotton t-shirt, depending on the weather, and it just felt like how come no one has done this before. And for me personally is when we look at this opportunity to begin with, it felt like there's this massive white space and that no one, no one in the world is measuring sort of an athletes' performance. And you start to see these things coming around, whether it's wearables and biometric measurement, et cetera, and we dabbled in that all the way back to 2008. But we quickly came to realize the value for us was not going to be in, I think, the equipment side of it, but the value for us is going to be in the community, and we feel like we've really locked that up. The fact that consumers have no barometer for their health today is a mistake, and frankly, that's where we see this massive opportunity, and we feel that we're the best ones to take advantage of it, really, because of the acquisitions that we made over the last 2 years. The sheer size and scale of the community that we've made, it marks us as a clear leader by a factor of as much as 4, 3 or at least 2x, now having more than 140 million unique registered users. And as I mentioned in my script, adding more than 100,000 users, are downloading 1 of our 4 apps today: MapMyFitness, Endomondo, MyFitnessPal or Under Armour record. And again, from the stats that I read off as well, I want to drive them home because I think it's incredible. We log more than 1 billion workouts, were logged into 1 of our 4 apps over the last -- just since the beginning of the year. More than 5 billion different foods have been logged as well. And giving the scale, MyFitnessPal, which is the largest of the 4 apps that we have, and as we continue to merge them, that voice will continue to come out as we articulated, but this is the world's largest database in the history of mankind of food. I mean, just think about it for a second that we log more than 5 billion food that we know in over 80 countries what people are eating and what they're putting in their body. So we now believe we've got the ability to be relevant across all of our platforms, and we're going to work to merge them into a consistent product that reads the daily dashboard. I mean, ultimately, that's where we're heading. We think that the consumer just needs a dashboard that just says, ""How am I doing?"" If I can look on my cellphone, and I can figure out my bank balance, my stock price or the weather in a given city, the fact that I have no measure of barometer for my health, expect for going to see a doctor every 12, 18 or 24 months, we think, is really a crime. So we were identifying that as 4 key place that the consumer should be measuring themselves, the athletes should measuring themselves. Sleep, how much did I sleep last night; fitness, did I exercise or not and if so, to what degree. Daily activity, which is typically, like the steps, like how much am I moving around; and then fourth, and probably most importantly, what am I putting in my body, my nutrition. And we thought a lot about this, and I think one thing I really want to get across is sort of the way that we're thinking about defining success. And we do believe that there needs to be a daily dashboard, and so we will -- you will continue to see that articulate itself through the Under Armour Record platform, and we've got many things coming from that, particularly we'll showcase for you at Investor Day. But if you ask us to sum it up, we're looking for an engaged user community that relies on Under Armour and the Connected Fitness ecosystem we are building to help them measure those 4 central areas: the sleep, fitness, daily activity and nutrition, and more importantly, we want to empower people. This isn't just about knowing that I took 8,000 steps yesterday, but because I took 8,000 steps, how did that make me feel. And more importantly, how did that work with how I slept or whether I exercise or what I ate that next day. And we think that having that information is going to allow them to make better decisions to live healthier and a rich life. I mean, affecting, I think, ultimately, obviously, fitness, the way that it work, but we think there's the outlook for us to affect global health, and that's what's get us so excited. And by doing this, of course, we believe that realtime is a company that focuses on selling shirts and shoes. We believe that we're going to create engagement with consumer to give them a reason to interact with our brand multiple times a day. And I think all those things lead to this energy that you're feeling from us, and frankly, the resources that we've expended over the last couple of years positions ourselves, I think, really uniquely and unlike any other brand, especially in our space, but frankly, anyone who's looking at the biometric measurement for the athlete, and ultimately, for any end consumer. So as I said, this is going to be a big part of the focus that we have at our Investor Day in September, and I encourage you to come in and see what we have coming on. But incredibly exciting for us, an I think, there's a lot more to come."

So I think we should look much better on the retail floor in a more timely fashion for back-to-school this year, so we're looking -- we're thinking pretty well about that. As we get in the back of the year also, just to remember, also, in our guidance kind of consistent with how we look at things in the past years too, especially when you look at fourth quarter. In our guidance, we've been consistent, I think, in the last couple of years talking about being very prudent in how we forecast the fourth quarter relative to weather and holiday, and so forth, and not taking things for granted there in our guidance. So I'd say those are the 2 things in the back half of the year, revenue guidance, a better flow in back-to-school, and also consistent of how where we're approaching the fourth quarter revenue guidance."

So the ability for us to invest in our stories here, tell our stories, take advantage of the unique environment we're in and say that we're going to drive a much, much more top line in the back half of the year because of that, I think there's no doubt that we'll see some benefit, and we expect to see some benefit, and that's kind of included in our guidance. But the real story here is about beyond 2015. It's about 2016 and beyond of what this does, especially in key categories, again, like basketball and golf. And if you just think about basketball for a second, and you take Stephen Curry and the ability for us to tell a story in a category that is influential, not only in the basketball category, but just the younger consumer and what that can mean for our youth business in 2016 to '17 and beyond. That's what we're really talking about here. It's just the longer term opportunity versus the shorter term opportunity."

And without question, the performances of Steph, and really, breaking through, I mean -- since we signed Steph 3 years ago, he's always an underdog, but he was always the best everywhere he went, and so getting credit for that is something we're really proud of in doing, whether it was -- first of all, most important thing to him was winning the championship, but then the league MVP, and then his acknowledgment at the SBs, where I think, among all athletes, he has broken through, and that's a really difficult thing to do, particularly in a sports like basketball, and so we're proud of what that means. But it's not a one-way ticket to all of a sudden, you've arrived, but there's a lot of work for us to be done and there's a lot more. One thing I learned a long time ago, and I remember the first time an Under Armour logo popped up on the front cover of U.S. Today sports page, and I thought, I was going to walk in the office and the place to be flooded with orders, it's not just the way it goes, and so brands are built on consistency. Consistency is built in trust, and trust is built on drops, and it's lost in buckets. And so what you see is we have a great big pouring, I think, of credibility in the sport of basketball, and what Steph brings to us on a day-to-day basis. But that's going to require a lot more investment and it's going to require a long-term commitment, and so we want to let everybody know, particularly, our consumer, but frankly, our competition as well that we are moving into basketball. We've been working on this for -- it's not an overnight success. We've been working for years, if not, a decade, and we're incredibly proud of where we've gotten to, but we're really just getting started. So as far as basketball, as the category goes, we've been working. We've had great support from our sporting goods partners first and primarily, where, I think, we really have that kid who is buying product to play at the high school level and we've had -- we've been working on with the right assortments there, and really getting behind footwear for us as an initiative, particularly in basketball. And then in the mall channel, the -- whether it's Finish Line or Foot Locker, and I described what we're doing with Champs Sports through Foot Locker with The ARMOURY series. It's going to be a really neat opportunity for us, I think, to change the way that consumer is looking at the brand, the way that they see us, is that breaking through and having people see you with the basketball brand. Again, it's just taking -- it's taking a lot of time and the chance for us to, I think, really differentiate ourselves from the brand that maybe people have seen as us to the brand that we see ourselves, the brand we're going to be. So Steph is a big part of that."

But in international",1174,"Let me use this as an opportunity just to talk to you about International for a second. Let me take a minute to do that. I sort of let footwear get away. So if somebody asks another question about that, we can circle back on footwear. But in international, as I'm sitting in Munich, opening this new office and cutting the ribbon this afternoon, first of all, what Charlie has done for our International business in really helping us accelerate and think about ourselves as a global brand, but more importantly, beginning to act like a global brand. We're fast in the way of doing that. This would be our 17th office that we've opened up, I think, our fifth or sixth this year. In a way, that relates to our brand's incredibly authentic. And if you were here, it basically -- it feels like Baltimore in Munich, and beginning, of course, with, I think,  the esthetic, the way the place looks, but the team, the people, the energy, just incredibly, incredibly proud, and you're seeing that at retail too. We went and walked stores. We saw 3 of the largest sports stores and retailers that are here in Germany and throughout Europe over the last couple of days, and the excitement we have from the very tops of these organizations and the belief they have that Under Armour can penetrate, where we are very, very -- we are very young, and we are just getting started here. While we've been doing business in selling stuff, probably for the last 8 or 9 or close to 10 years now, we're really beginning to do business. And I think it's reflective, obviously, in our revenues. I mean, 93% revenue growth in the second quarter alone, 83% revenue growth in International year-to-date, 94% growth in 2014. So that idea of coming close to doubling and the plans we talked about is growing by about 50% a year in International, and it's something, I think, that we get really excited that is incredible realistic to happen. A number of things that we have from a product standpoint. We remain positioned, really, in a premium way, the consumer sees us, and so I think it's where the retailers wants us as well. We are a full-priced brand basically everywhere we do business, and that's no different abroad. We learned a lot in this about how our brand translates through Japan and learning that Under Armour moves outside of North America, and we're just seeing that reinforced especially here in Europe. We're doing a lot of that around the strategic accounts and core markets with premium shop-in-shop investments that we can have, and that's been a real positive for us with the right marquee retailers. From a retail standpoint as well, we've opened 18 Brand House stores in the second quarter in places like Chile, China, Taiwan, Malaysia, the Philippines. We're targeting more than 100 additional global Brand House stores, opening in 2015, built off of a base of 73 in 2014, 3 quarters of which are going to be located in Asia, 85% of those that will be doors, where we we'll be leveraging distributors partners that will be opening those up. And just some perspective, the majority of those stores are, obviously, I guess, going to be in China. I guess, that would be obvious. But just for some perspective, in the month of September alone, we're going to be opening roughly 1 store per day in the month of September, so it's since going to be a big month for us, and it's something we've been perfecting for the last 5 and 6 years. There, and really, globally, with Susie McCabe and our -- and Henry and our retail team are really becoming expert in how to open and translate our store, and have a consistent message for the brand everywhere we show up. So not to be lost in all the physical manifestation of the brand that we're putting at retail is, I think, some of the success that we're seeing in E-Commerce. The second quarter alone, we launched new sites in Thailand, Austria, Ireland, Belgium, Portugal, and I think we've also been working on translating our sites as well and making sure they're open. The new markets continues to be a real big opportunity for us. One thing I don't want to get lost in this message is it's not all roses either because going global is not an easy thing. It's a slug. It's an investment. It's something we're continuing to get better. So while we're pleased with the results that we're seeing, we still see that there's a tremendous amount of meat left on the bone, with the opportunity for us to improve in that. Our fulfillment rates are not where they need to be. Our -- the wholesale partners have been incredibly patient with us, as we get this settled and organized. But things like Brad mentioned, with our new SAP upgrades and implementations, they're going to make a big difference with systems and processes, and there's is part of the shift to becoming a global brand. So across the world in EMEA, as I mentioned, having spent the last couple of days here in Europe, a lot of excitement, a lot of energy, of course, driven in part by our sports marketing assets, the success we see in there, but I think, really, it's the teams in the ground and it's the energy, and it's the culture of the brand that's -- is really the leading the way. Asia, a lot of the incredibly exciting things happening there. Japan continues to be a stalwart for us and leading. But as I mentioned, things like China, where all the stores we're opening up and what we're doing in September, we're going to drive a lot of energy from the Stephen Curry tour that we'll be taking him through for about 7 days over there between Japan. Obviously, 3 stops in China, and then a few other stops as well. So it will be very exciting. And then Latin America, I think energy is still building around Brazil, especially with the Olympics coming back and things we have there. We opened our first Brand House in Sao Paulo in the MorumbiShopping mall and it's doing very, very well. And really, every place that we've opened stores, I think, we're outperforming. So haven't seen any surprises to the downside. There's tremendous amount of heat and energy to the brand. I'm living and feeling that today and excited for about 350 to 400 of our closest friends and media partners are going to come over and help us cut our ribbon this afternoon. So a lot of energy about Under Armour being here in Germany, and really every place we're opening offices and stores around the world. So it's a good story. It's good news, but as I said, there's still room for us to improve, and you'll see us ambitiously go after that."

We've tried implementing it for years, and then we sort of got to this point where it's hard. It's not easy to change things is that we are -- we've not been end-use driven in the past. We are basically -- we've got an apparel team. We have a footwear team. We have an accessory team, and we think that, that obviously has worked in getting us started, but we're at the point where we're reaching the size, and frankly, the scale to be able to afford, and more importantly, not be able to not afford to go after really addressing category management. And the thing we use with the sport of golf, which really got us excited several years ago, where we implemented this, and we identified a leader, and they really took the bull by the horns and started with product and organizing everything from the way that we showed up in our sporting goods, in our wholesale partners, the way we showed up on the green grass gulf course. And also given the same control over to how we're going to spend the marketing dollars, and that meant -- and additionally, we showed up with things like POP and marketing, all the way to the assets that we signed, and so it was a great story that led us to getting us to Jordan Spieth. The things for all of these, and as we're going to think about category management, it's going to come down the leadership. And what we wanted was accountability, and where golf started is that I never -- after a golf tournament several ago, sitting on a Sunday, and I'm watching and not feeling great about the way that one of our golfers was outfitted. And I write an email and say, ""This isn't working well."" And I think I had 18 people CC-ed on the email, and saying this is ridiculous. We should get this to much more consistent manner, where we can flow the information in a better way that will be more effective, and ultimately, it's going to better serve the end-use consumer and the athlete. So I use that theme of thinking bigger, and that's where -- us hiring Terdema Ussery, who's going to join us and has great experience in this industry, is someone who knows everyone who's got a five-star resume of leadership and success, and frankly, a really great person, I think, that just as importantly as anything is his expertise and he's smart, it's the culture fit that he's going to be at Under Armour. So there's a lot to happen there, but I think we have almost forced the issue. And while we've been working through -- these pieces, we're going to give you a lot more color at Investor Day as well that will tell you a little more specific how we're thinking about it. But ultimately, the idea is we're not going to just pull the plug and eliminate our Apparel and our Footwear groups. There's going to be a bit of transition there. The first way we're going to start though is identifying the category leadership across. It's roughly 9 different categories that we have right now that we've identified where we want a true general manager to run each of these that will have both, in some instances, clear P&L responsibility, in other instances, a bit of virtual P&L responsibility. But the most important thing is we're going to create accountability across each of these divisions, where, hopefully, it will drive and prevent us from things that may be perceived as inauthentic and making sure that we preserve the Under Armour life. But again, I use that example of golf. In just the sport of golf, in the last 2 years, our revenue has more than doubled. We're seeing key category growth throughout the rest of the year, things like on our website, our play-off polos, the #1 item at our Brand House and our E-Commerce sites. The business is basically up everywhere. We have our key asset, which is the one thing, which led us -- we're able to find the right asset with Jordan, really, leading the way out there has been an absolute kill and home run for us too. And it also allows us to launch new categories, like we'll have a authentic golf shoe coming out, and you're seeing Jordan wearing our golf club out there on the course. So all these things from the right asset, from the right marketing, from the right positioning, being in the right retail distribution, it's all really led us to get this. So we're excited in what we've seen. The success in golf is something we'll hopefully see you -- us translate through in things like basketball and running. And really, the obvious category that you'd imagine, we'd be looking for, sport and using global football, of course, and things like that. So we want to win. We think that the opportunity for us do that is not defined about what anybody else has done. And we carved a bit of our own legs, but still, at the same time, there's a lot of good lessons to learn from other people that have done this before too. So I think we're going to take the best of all worlds and we'll do what's best for the Under Armour brand."

The mall has been different. I think Champs is a great -- it's sort of a -- it's a bit of a step from the sporting goods into the mall, and because they played that bit of a twiner role. But Champs and Foot Locker, as a whole, has been an amazing partner for us, and it's something, I think, where we can translate our existing consumer. It help get them used to thinking about us in a mall environment. We still see ourselves as a holistic head-to-toe brand, and our philosophy remains that we're going to go where our consumers want, and frankly, where they expect us. And so what we're looking for is further ways that we can build relationships with our wholesale partners to elevate the product story for the best Under Armour. We're only in roughly 25% of the 3,400 global footing stores today, but obviously, we're working with their team and aligning with that. The ARMOURY and Champs is a great example of how we can grow our business and the relationship together. We're testing a handful of these premium shop and shops over the next couple of years, starting with our own backyard in Maryland. In the early days that we've seen this thing, the first several weeks are very, very, very encouraging. The merchandising is going to consist of a mixture of inline product, mall-specific product, in addition to some product not found also in the mall too, so things like that. We're putting our Highlight Cleat's into the mall channel, into The ARMOURY, and it's getting just the deeper breadth of the sort of the Under Armour experience in the mall environment. So I think it's exciting. I encourage you to get a chance and we can put out a listing, and Tom and the team can let you know. When we got some of those, go see one for yourself as well."

The first partnership deal that I've signed was with the NFL Europe league. So we're no stranger to international business. It's becoming good at it, more importantly, I think, in a lot of places, particularly, here in Europe. Continuity is an incredibly important lesson and attribute with any brand. Consistency is very, very important, doing things the same way. I mean, it's a continent that's defined by history. And brands that sort of come in, live today and are gone tomorrow, I think everyone have seen a lot of that. So a lot of it is a bit of questioning. They're waiting you out and wondering, are you going to make it, are you going to be there. And what we've seen is the brand, it's taking a while. It doesn't happen on the first handshake. It doesn't happen on the first introduction. And we came over to Europe for the first time back at the end of 2005 and in 2006, and it was a -- it's been a slug. We weren't really understanding completely what we have going on. At the same time, we're also organizing ourselves in North America. The thing we think about with Brad and my job and our entire executive team's job is, again, is defining and deciding how to deploy the resources, the time, people and money. There's only so much of any one of them. And we're torn with the fact that it's always international. It's such a small part of our business, and so U.S. and North America would usually dominate the amount of time we spend. So as we've grown, you've seen us going all the way back to 2009 and 2010. I think we fielded a lot of questions of why are you pouring this money into Europe, why are you pouring this money, and where is the return going to come? And so we had this long story of long-term investments in things like Women's, long term investments in things like Footwear, long term investments in something like International. And this year, and we said, I don't know if it's a big enough comment, but we're going to be profitable in Europe this year. And that was something, if you went back 5 years, you may have fielded the question on why not throw in the towel. Can you really be successful there? Why not just focus on North America? So we're now looking at A, our profitability, and it's been one asset at a time, and it's been things from joining EPL football, with people and places like Tottenham Hotspur, and then finding ways to make investments. The recent announcement we had with São Paulo Futebol Clube down in Brazil, it's not an immediate return for us. I've always said I don't really see us as a licensed jersey manufacturer. I don't like that idea of growing sport by simply selling fan gear. We want to be on the authentic athlete. We want to be on the pitch, on the court, on the field, but there's ways for us to get in. So finding the resource that we can splinter off to make an investment in a market that's very new for us, like Brazil, it's a big deal, and so we're -- I think we're very patiently doing that around the globe where we're finding assets that makes sense, and especially, we can reinforce it in markets that we can create an ROI that's sooner than later. So it's a big -- running something global, and we said that a long time, but really, understanding what it means to be a global company. That takes time, and it takes experience, and it takes maturity, and it takes patience, and many of the things that maybe you would characterize as us not having in the first few years as a company. But I think that we've been developing that skill set, and most importantly, we've been developing that leadership team. So Terdema is a great example of that coming onboard, and I think you're seeing it filled out throughout our company, and something that will only continue to get bigger and better for us as a brand. So we're learning a lot of lessons. As I said, we're -- there are mistakes in there, believe me, but when it comes through with, I think, the performance of the 90-plus percent revenue growth that we saw this quarter and is reflective of, I think, what you're seeing happening, one thing I can tell you is it's a tremendous pull, it's tremendous demand for the brand right now. It's a matter of our execution. There's a lot of places that we can improve, we can enhance, we can better. I called out supply chain specifically is that it's difficult figuring out how to move products, that duty conscious and being careful and being able to make money and not getting crushed on margin and learning how to manufacture locally, and so we've been learning all these lessons. The good news, this isn't something we've been doing for the last 3 or 6 months. This is something we've been doing for, really, the last 6 to 10 years. So we're certainly not climbing with the extras right now, but we feel great about our trajectory. We feel great about our team. We remain humble and hungry, and we got a shot. The mission here is to be the next great global brand, and you're going to see us fight, crawl and scratch and do everything we can to make that happen. So we'll keep running hard for you. That's for sure."

When we made the announcement at what we called Digital Day a few days -- following our 2014 earnings call, we told you, there were 120 million people roughly on the platform and then it was about a month or so later, I was on a -- I did a talking head show, and we said 130 million, and now, today, we're telling you it's over 140 million people. We will be really careful to sort of quantifying these things in terms of the number of users we have. Our next job is really figuring out how to make them good quality users as well is that I'd take 40 million hyper-engaged people that really we're very getting -- benefiting from the brand and using our apps and our ecosystem, using that as a learning place that we could grow that out to a broader audience. At the same time, the scale that we're growing is nothing we want to ignore, but we think the definition of success is not just the total top line number of users. How we're growing north of 30%, and seeing that consistently happen, that is going to be something that's positive. But what I think you'll see from us, and again, we're going to go deeper on our own Investor Day into what the story of Connected Fitness means for the Under Armour brand, is that there's a high-level engagement that we're going to be able to drive with that. And without a doubt, our Gear Tracker side alone, which is something that's exclusive to the MapMyFitness platform, there's more than 400,000 people that are actively tracking products, and whether they compare shoes that they wear or whatever item that the use. I think it's close to 2,000 people a day are signing up for Gear Tracker. So people are interested in this idea of the Internet of Things, that theory being that, eventually everything that we have is going to have a chip in it. So 1 billion connected things in 2010, and I think the projection is by 2020, it's going to be over 25 billion or 30 billion connected things in the world. So we obviously want to use that to make ourselves smart, and to honestly to help enrich and improve the life of our consumers. So we think we're going to have the ability to do that, we think, getting smart in everything we do. Again, the thing I'm probably most proud of with these acquisitions, of course, the community we built, the team we built, but also, I think, the level of engagement that we're creating with the consumer, of giving them a reason to think about themselves holistically. This idea of approaching health and arming people with the ability to make better decisions for themselves is a pretty powerful, powerful thing that, I think, who's going to own that information or who's going to help give you that and organize that information for you, shouldn't be a health care provider, shouldn't be a drugstore, shouldn't be a health insurance company or shouldn't be a sports brand that you trust. And so we think we have a great connection with the athletes. We think that we can test and prototype this with -- at the highest levels with people, like the University of Notre Dame football team. And if it's good enough for them, we think it's a -- and some of our other marquee athletes, it should be good enough for the consumers. So building that trust is going to be paramount in doing this. And yes, we think we're going to be able to sell more shirts and shoes ultimately, but we think we're going to be able to continue to transform what the Under Armour brand is, and we'll continuously be able do that."

This is my last stop of a weeklo",2163,"Thank you, Tom, and good morning to everyone. I am calling in from Munich, Germany where later today, we are opening our newest International office from which we will serve the markets in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. This is my last stop of a weeklong trip that has taken me to multiple cities, including Glascow, Copenhagen, and now, Munich. As we continue to grow our global footprint, these trips continue to provide deeper insight into the markets and how consumers are thinking about our brand. My visit to Copenhagen reconfirmed and enhanced the excitement around our recent Endomondo acquisition, and a huge opportunity that Connected Fitness provides UA with global consumers.  With today's ribbon cutting in Munich, we will now have 17 regional offices outside the United States, which are positioning the brand closer to the local consumer and driving the incredible execution we have seen in the past year, including 93% international net revenue growth just this past quarter. That strong growth outside the United States helped drive total net revenues for the quarter up 29%, the 21st consecutive quarter of 20-plus-percent net revenue growth. In addition, total apparel net revenues grew by 23%, marking the 23rd consecutive quarter of 20-plus percent net revenue growth. We have traditionally referred to this as our scoreboard, but based on my visit to Saint Andrews early this week, maybe we should refer to it as a leaderboard. Either way, we continue to shoot consistently great numbers. As we prepare to enter our 20th-year in the business of sports, we have learned a lot of valuable lessons. Some of them have been learned through business, but just as many probably have been learned through sport. 
Over the past year, 3 Under Armour athletes have transcended their sports, and become known by just their first names, Stephen, Misty and Jordan. These 3 athletes have combined to teach us one incredibly valuable lesson that we need to think bigger. For Stephen Curry, Misty Copeland and Jordan Spieth, being a great basketball player, principal ballerina and PGA golfer was rooted in their ability to see beyond, to be prepared to not just be great, but to be extraordinary, to plan and practice, but also know when to take the risk. Our lessons out of this are incredibly relevant to this moment in time for the Under Armour brand. First, our athletes' success pushes us to see beyond just maximizing the revenue opportunities in any given quarter. It forces us to think clearly about what we need to do better, and how we need to organize to be more than just an American sports brand, to go from changing the way athletes dress to changing the way athletes live. Second, this intense brand heat provides us with abundant opportunities to invest in businesses like basketball, Women's and golf that will not only grow our share within those large categories, but will also positively impact all of our business across both categories and geographies. So my 2 main topics today are how do we invest to capitalize on that momentum, and how do we organize to think bigger about the opportunities in front of us today. 
Thinking bigger is part of what drives the world's greatest athletes to outperform on the highest stage, and it's hard to think of 3 individuals who have done more of that recently than Stephen, Misty and Jordan. And the best part is that just like UA, they too are just getting started.  Stephen Curry, NBA league MVP, world champion, recently voted Best Male Athlete and Best NBA Player at the ESPYs, and most importantly, new father of a baby girl who one day might give her big sister, Riley, some competition for the spotlight. A pretty good stretch for a great young man and tremendously rewarding for Under Armour to be part of his on-court success. We're taking Stephen on a tour of China and other markets in Asia, starting late next month, and frankly, we believe he's just beginning to touch upon his potential both in the U.S. and other key basketball markets across the globe. 
Misty Copeland, trailblazer, prima ballerina, athlete, named last month as the first female African-American principal dancer with the American Ballet Theatre. Again, tremendous pride on our behalf to be involved early in Misty's meteoric rise by helping introduce her to an audience beyond the ballet world with last year's, I WILL WHAT I WANT campaign. 
Jordan Spieth. When we signed him more than 2.5 years ago, we told you to watch out for this young man, as we had a strong feeling he was going to turn into a huge asset for our Golf business. It's amazing for all of us that in such a short time he's gone from being one of the names touted as the future of golf to being the story of golf, not just now, but we believe, well into the future. And while I'd be remiss to not at least mention the great performances by other UA athletes, this quarter, not this year: Andy Murray, Carey Price, Bryce Harper, Todd Frazier of the Cincinnati Reds, who last week won the Home Run Derby in front of his home crowd at the Great American ballpark. The recent accomplishments of Stephen, Misty and Jordan are somewhat overwhelming and heavily impactful. Their achievements these past few weeks represent a moment in time for the Under Armour brand, one that forces us to reassess our opportunities and look deeper to understand what all the success means for us. There is, of course, the immediate benefit to our brand. This brand heat is driving huge amounts of incremental traffic to our e-commerce platform across the globe, with our basketball traffic up more than 300% year-over-year while in our social channels, we added more followers on Instagram during the recent NBA finals than we did in all of 2014. The Curry One shoe was a great success on our e-commerce site, as we continue to gain share in key footwear categories with our wholesale partners. Our Women's business continues to grow strongly in key areas, like capris, shorts, sports bras and running footwear, while our e-commerce Golf business was exceptional, growing above 60% year-over-year. But there is a bigger takeaway for our company in all of this. We've learned from these athletes, not only about the preparation it takes to be great, but the added level of commitment it takes to be truly special. 
All 3 of these athletes started as clear underdogs, yet were able to put themselves in a position where their skills and focus enabled them to transcend their sport. All of them have proven, as Jordan Spieth stated, following his Masters victory when asked why he chose Under Armour, that being aggressive, young and fearless can be a deadly combination. Our athletes' ability to see what was needed to be excellent forces us to think bigger. It requires we accept there are moments in time where we need to accelerate to take advantage of the new opportunities our brand momentum creates. We understand there are short-term benefit to this unprecedented momentum, but we are focused on the long-term. To us, this moment provides a great chance to build a more meaningful connection with our consumer through the power of these transcendent athletes, and that connection can be deeper and more powerful for our brand than any short-term spike in our revenues or our earnings. Without question, the brand equity we are creating right now will benefit our business more significantly over the long term than it will simply just this year. Specifically, in a large category, like basketball, we've had incredible success for the Curry One Footwear, including some very hot selling limited releases. But that brand heat, evidenced by the lines outside our Brand House stores on release day, gives us great confidence in the brand we are building with Stephen Curry and our strategy in bringing new product to market. It has motivated our Footwear team and it has given confidence to our retail partners about our expanding presence in the basketball category amongst others, particularly in the mall. 
We recently debuted a new shop-in-shop concept with Champ sports, called The ARMOURY, which highlights, not only the basketball category, but a broader mix of product and innovation that the athletes' been historically unable to find from our brand in the mall. This is great evidence of the confidence we have in our product and the continued success we are seeing across our offerings with our key retail partners. And like basketball, that same foundation and confidence is building in our Golf and Women's businesses. We are still developing a wide consumer audience in these 3 categories here in the U.S. and the opportunity for us in international markets is abundant. The second element of thinking bigger lies in how we organize our business, and in this case, thinking bigger means thinking smaller, thinking in a way that enables us to be more surgical with how we reach our consumer and the experiences we provide them. 
To look at our end-use consumer more discreetly and with more discipline. As the breadth of our product mix continues to expand, we're moving to a sports category focused organizational structure that will enable us to maintain our focus on the needs of that end-use consumer. We recognize that a UA Run consumer has different needs than a UA Basketball consumer, and we are now in a great position to harness the overall strength of our brand and innovation pipeline to ensure we are exceeding expectations for all of our consumers. To help drive this initiative, we have recently brought on Terdema Ussery, who for the past 18 years have served as President of the NBA's Dallas Mavericks, and has prior industry experience in athletic Footwear and Apparel. 
We can speak to this in more depth at our Investor Day Meeting in September, but we want to be clear today about our intent. This category focus will provide the structure to help us sell more shirts and shoes. This structure has proven successful for us in golf with a combination of great product, a great asset and a great team helped to double revenues the past 2 years. This increased category focus [ph] will us help drive our core business, a critical component in our long-term growth story. 
The last piece I want to cover today is our evolution from a brand that started by just making compression tees to one now focused on perfecting shirts and shoes, as well as creating authentic and relevant sports and fitness experiences every time and everywhere our consumer interacts with our brand. We can do so because of the strength of our Connected Fitness platform, where we continue to add more than 100,000 unique registered users to the platform every single day. We remain in the early stages of [indiscernible] the potential of what the world's largest digital health and fitness community, with now over 140 million athletes, can do to help us build consumer engagement and drive healthier lifestyles. We are growing our community at more than 30% year-over-year, and so far, in 2015, these users have voluntarily logged over 1 billion workouts and more than 5 billion foods have been logged into our apps. This level and detail of data will empower us to provide actionable insights back to our community that will help them lead a healthier lifestyle, and we believe the brand equity that can provide us is immeasurable. Ultimately, the more people exercise, the more athletic footwear and apparel they will buy. Again, we will provide deeper detail on our Connected Fitness opportunities in September at our Investor Day, but we are extremely pleased with the growth of our community and the type of insight we can bring to our consumers' lives.  
So just before I hand it back to Brad, I want to reiterate our commitment to growth. We have delivered 21 consecutive quarters of 20-plus percent revenue growth. We are growing in key areas like Footwear, Women's and International, and doing so while investing in new opportunities like Connected Fitness, which we believe will be critical to our continued growth. And most importantly, we have the capacity to adapt, to change course and accelerate investments when the opportunity calls for it and to think bigger about what the Under Armour brand can eventually be. 
There are so many great things going on in Under Armour today, which are difficult to fully articulate in a 1 hour conference call. I look forward to seeing all of you at our Investor Day in September at our headquarters in Baltimore to further showcase the brand that we are building. We remain aggressive, young and fearless, and I'm excited to provide more color on how we are thinking and organizing to become the next great global brand. 
And with that, let me turn it over to Brad."

Our net revenues for the second quarter of 2015 increased 29% to $784 million. On a currency-neutral basis, net revenues increased 31% for the period.  Within our product categories, we grew apparel net revenues 23% to $515 million compared to $420 million in the prior year's quarter. Many of the same growth drivers that drove our first quarter Apparel business continued during the second quarter, including our new Armour Baselayer, updated training products and expanded golf and hunting lines. 
Second quarter Footwear net revenues increased 40% to $154 million from $110 million in the prior year. We continue to gain significant traction across multiple Footwear categories, most notably within the larger markets of running and basketball. SpeedForm remains a key growth story for our brand, and we've introduced this innovation across a wider range of styles and categories this year. And as Kevin mentioned, we capitalized on the incredible success of Stephen Curry in basketball, with new color waves [ph] quickly selling out during his MVP and championship run with the Warriors. 
Our accessories net revenues during the second quarter increased 39% to $83 million from $60 million last year, primarily driven by strong consumer demand for our line of bags. Our global Direct-to-Consumer net revenues increased 33% for the quarter, representing approximately 32% of net revenues. We continue to be encouraged with our recent Brand House openings, including the first full quarter of results for our Chicago and Mall of America stores, as well as the new second quarter openings in Indianapolis and Orlando. From a global standpoint, we ended the second quarter with 160 owned stores, including 139 Factory House stores and 21 Brand House stores. Our E-Commerce business had a standout quarter, and we're seeing the return on our investment in mobile optimization across our expanding list of global sites. While an ongoing focus on mobile is key, we were also able to drive strong traffic gain through more effective email communications, as well as by leveraging the incredible success of our athletes during the period. 
Looking at our regions, North American net revenues increased 22% to $681 million in the second quarter compared to $558 million in the prior year's quarter. On a currency-neutral basis, North America net revenues increased 23% based primarily on the drivers I highlighted for the overall company. International net revenues increased 93% to $89 million in the second quarter, and represented 11% of total net revenues. On a currency-neutral basis, International net revenues increased to 112% for the period. In the EMEA region, we continue to focus on the 3 core markets of the U.K., Germany and France, while also developing distributor agreements in the region, including the Middle East. In Asia Pacific, our partner store expansion and e-commerce growth in China remain key stories, and we also benefited from the rollout of our distributor agreement in Southeast Asia. And in Latin America, we are seeing balanced growth throughout the region, following our market entry into many of these countries during 2014. 
Moving on to margins. Second quarter gross margins contracted 80 basis points to 48.4% compared to 49.2% in the prior year's period. The following factors were the primary drivers during the quarter: first, as we previously outlined, the continued strength of the U.S dollar negatively impacted gross margins by approximately 60 basis points in the second quarter versus the prior year; second, we incurred higher air freight expense in the second quarter, primarily due to our efforts to normalize product flow from the West Coast port disruption and better service of the back-to-school selling season, which negatively impacted gross margins by approximately 50 basis points. Partially offsetting this margin pressure, better margins in our Factory House business, combined with our higher margin Connected Fitness revenues, benefited gross margins by approximately 20 basis points in the second quarter. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues deleveraged 80 basis points to 44.3% in the second quarter of 2015 from 43.5% in the prior year's period. As a reminder, starting last quarter, in an effort to simplify and streamline our conversation, we consolidated our SG&A detail into 2 primary buckets: Marketing and other SG&A. 
SG&A details for the second quarter are as follows: marketing cost decreased to 11.4% of net revenues for the quarter from 11.6% in the prior year period, with modest leverage driven primarily by the strong net revenues during second quarter. Our SG&A cost increased to 32.9% of net revenues for the quarter from 31.9% in the prior year, driven primarily by our Connected Fitness acquisitions and investments in our Brand House strategy. Operating income for the second quarter decreased 8% to $32 million compared with $35 million in the prior year period. Interest and other expense for the second quarter increased to $4 million compared with $1 million in the prior year period, primarily reflecting increased interest expense associated with the financing of our Connected Fitness acquisitions. Our second quarter tax rate of 46.7% was favorable to the 47.5% rate last year, primarily due to certain tax planning strategies. 
Our second quarter net income decreased 17% to $15 million compared to $18 million in the prior year period, while our diluted earnings per share decreased to $0.07 from $0.08 in the prior year's period. On the balance sheet, total cash and cash equivalents for the quarter decreased 43% to $171 million compared with $300 million at June 30, 2014. Inventory for the quarter increased 26% to $837 million compared to $662 million at June 30, 2014. Total debt increased to $716 million, as compared to $197 million at June 30, 2014, primarily reflecting the financing of our Connected Fitness acquisitions. 
Looking at our cash flows. Our investment and capital expenditures was $91 million for the second quarter compared to $29 million in the prior year's period, driven primarily by our investments in our SAP platform and our global retail strategy. 
Now moving on to our updated 2015 guidance. Based on current visibility, we expect 2015 net revenues of approximately $3.84 billion, representing growth of 25%, and 2015 operating income in a range of $405 million to $408 million, representing growth of 14% to 15%. We have long stated that we'd be opportunistic with our investment levels if and when the right situations present themselves. In a period where we have seen unprecedented success from our athletes on a global stage, we believe we have a unique opportunity to position ourselves more aggressively in key long-term growth categories, such as basketball and golf, which we believe can create brand halos across the Under Armour portfolio. As a result, we expect to spend more than originally planned in marketing throughout the remainder of the year, and this is the primary reason we are raising our full year net revenues guidance, while maintaining the upper end of our previous operating income guidance. We believe this will better position our brand in delivering long-term sustainable growth. 
As a reminder, our operating income guidance includes the dilutive impact of the Connected Fitness acquisitions, consisting of one-time transaction costs in the first quarter, operating losses from these businesses and noncash amortization charges of the intangible assets generated from the acquisitions. Below operating results, we continue to expect a full year effective tax rate of approximately 41% compared to 39.2% in the prior year, primarily given the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, which continues to negatively impact our international profitability. 
Now I'd also like to provide some additional color on several items, starting with revenues. We expect the growth rate in Footwear to continue outpacing the growth rate for the overall business during the second half of the year. International growth is expected to ease from the growth rate achieved in the first half of 2015, as we begin to cycle through our entry into Latin America, as well as new distributor partnerships launched during the second half of 2014. From a cadence standpoint, we expect relatively consistent net revenue growth rates during the third and fourth quarters. 
Now looking at gross margins. We continue to expect our full year gross margin will be roughly in line with last year's 49% rate. During the third quarter, we continue to expect an approximate 50 basis-point contraction, primarily due to the negative impact of the stronger U.S. dollar. In SG&A, we expect the combined impact of higher planned marketing spend I previously discussed and ongoing other SG&A expense pressure will result in similar year-over-year growth rate in the third quarter, as experienced during the first half of the year. Finally, a quick look at our planned capital expenditures. We continue to plan 2015 capital expenditures in the range of $330 million to $340 million. Consistent with our prior guidance, approximately $140 million of this total is allocated across 3 large areas to support long-term growth, including our new domestic distribution center, the expansion of our corporate headquarters in Baltimore and a new and expanded SAP platform. We will also accelerate our investments in key areas that will drive revenue growth, including the rollouts of our global retail strategy and new e-commerce sites.

So first of all, we see this as a -- just a massive white space. And for me, personally, I remember how I felt when I had this idea for a T-shirt, or more importantly, a piece of equipment to be worn underneath of athletes' uniforms",1029,"Yes. Thank you, Erinn. So first of all, we see this as a -- just a massive white space. And for me, personally, I remember how I felt when I had this idea for a T-shirt, or more importantly, a piece of equipment to be worn underneath of athletes' uniforms or equipment that in the past, it's always just been a short-sleeved cotton t-shirt and a long-sleeve -- or a large-fit [ph] cotton t-shirt, depending on the weather, and it just felt like how come no one has done this before. And for me personally is when we looked at this opportunity to begin with, it felt like there's this massive white space and that no one, no one in the world is measuring sort of an athletes' performance. And you start to see these things coming around, whether it's wearables and biometric measurement, et cetera, and we dabbled in that all the way back to 2008. But we quickly came to realize the value for us was not going to be in, I think, the equipment side of it, but the value for us is going to be in the community, and we feel like we've really locked that up. The fact that consumers have no barometer for their health today is a mistake, and frankly, that's where we see this massive opportunity, and we feel that we're the best ones to take advantage of it, really, because of the acquisitions that we've made over the last 2 years. The sheer size and scale of the community that we've made, it marks us as the clear leader by a factor of as much as 4, 3 or at least 2x, now having more than 140 million unique registered users. And as I mentioned in my script, adding more than 100,000 users, are downloading 1 of our 4 apps today: MapMyFitness, Endomondo, MyFitnessPal or Under Armour Record. And again, from the stats that I read off as well, I want to drive them home because I think it's incredible. We logged more than 1 billion workouts, were logged into 1 of our 4 apps over the last -- just since the beginning of the year. More than 5 billion different foods have been logged as well. And giving the scale, MyFitnessPal, which is the largest of the 4 apps that we have, and as we continue to merge them, that voice will continue to come out as we articulated, but this is the world's largest database in the history of mankind of food. I mean, just think about it for a second, that we log more than 5 billion foods is that we know in over 80 countries what people are eating and what they're putting in their body. So we now believe we've got the ability to be relevant across all of our platforms, and we're going to work to merge them into a consistent product that reads as a daily dashboard. I mean, ultimately, that's where we're heading. We think that the consumer just needs a dashboard that just says, ""How am I doing?"" If I can look on my cellphone, and I can figure out my bank balance, my stock price or the weather in a given city, the fact that I have no measure or barometer for my health, expect for going to see a doctor every 12, 18 or 24 months, we think, is really a crime. So we were identifying that as 4 key place that the consumer should be measuring themselves, the athletes should measuring themselves. Sleep, how much did I sleep last night; fitness, did I exercise or not and if so, to what degree. Daily activity, which is typically, like the steps, like how much am I moving around; and then fourth, and probably most importantly, what am I putting in my body, my nutrition. And we've thought a lot about this, and I think one thing I really want to get across is sort of the way that we're thinking about defining success. And we do believe that there needs to be a daily dashboard, and so we will -- you will continue to see that articulate itself through the Under Armour Record platform, and we've got many things coming for that, particularly we'll showcase for you at Investor Day. But if you ask us to sum it up, we're looking for an engaged user community that relies on Under Armour and the Connected Fitness ecosystem we are building to help them measure those 4 central areas of sleep, fitness, daily activity and nutrition, and more importantly, we want to empower people. This isn't just about knowing that I took 8,000 steps yesterday, but because I took 8,000 steps, how did that make me feel. And more importantly, how did that work with how I slept or whether I exercise or what I ate that next day. And we think that having that information is going to allow them to make better decisions to live healthier and enriched lives. I mean, affecting, I think, ultimately, obviously, fitness, and the way that will work, but we think there's the outlook for us to affect global health, and that's what's get us so excited. And by doing this, of course, we believe that realtime is a company that focuses on selling shirts and shoes. We believe that we're going to create engagement with the consumer to give them a reason to interact with our brand multiple times a day. And I think all those things lead to this energy that you're feeling from us, and frankly, the resources that we've expended over the last couple of years positions ourselves, I think, really uniquely and unlike any other brand, especially in our space, but frankly, anyone who's looking at biometric measurement for the athlete, and ultimately, for any end consumer. So as I said, this is going to be a big part of the focus that we'll have at our Investor Day in September, and I encourage you to come in and see what we have coming on. But incredibly exciting for us, an I think, there's a lot more to come."

As we get in the back of the year also, just to remember, also, in our guidance kind of consistent with how we look at things in the past years too, especially when you look at fourth quarter. In our guidance, we've been consistent, I think, in the last couple of years talking about being very prudent in how we forecast the fourth quarter relative to weather and holiday, and so forth, and not taking things for granted there in our guidance. So I'd say those are the 2 things in the back half of the year, revenue guidance, a better flow in back-to-school, and also consistent of how where we're approaching the fourth quarter revenue guidance."

So the ability for us to invest in our stories here, tell our stories, take advantage of the unique environment we're in and say that we're going to drive much, much more top line in the back half of the year because of that, I think there's no doubt that we'll see some benefit, and we expect to see some benefit, and that's kind of included in our guidance. But the real story here is about beyond 2015. It's about 2016 and beyond of what this does, especially in key categories, again, like basketball and golf. And if you just think about basketball for a second, and you take Stephen Curry and the ability for us to tell a story in a category that is influential, not only in the basketball category, but just the younger consumer and what that can mean for our youth business in 2016 to '17 and beyond. That's what we're really talking about here. It's just the longer term opportunity versus the shorter term opportunity."

And without question, the performances of Steph, and really, breaking through, I mean -- since we signed Steph 3 years ago, he was always an underdog, but he was always the best everywhere he went, and so getting credit for that is something we're really proud of him doing, whether it was -- first of all, most important thing to him was winning the championship, but then the league MVP, and then his acknowledgment at the ESPYs, where I think, among all athletes, he has broken through, and that's a really difficult thing to do, particularly in a sport like basketball, and so we're proud of what that means. But it's not a one-way ticket to all of a sudden, you've arrived, but there's a lot of work for us to be done and there's a lot more. One thing I learned a long time ago when, I remember the first time an Under Armour logo popped up on the front cover of U.S. Today sports page, and I thought, I was going to walk in the office and the place would be flooded with orders, it's not just the way it goes, and so brands are built on consistency. Consistency is built in trust, and trust is built in drops, and it's lost in buckets. And so what you see is we had a great big pouring, I think, of credibility in the sport of basketball, and what Steph brings to us on a day-to-day basis. But that's going to require a lot more investment and it's going to require a long-term commitment, and so we want to let everybody know, particularly, our consumer, but frankly, our competition as well that we are moving into basketball. We've been working on this for -- it's not an overnight success. We've been working on this for years, if not, a decade, and we're incredibly proud of where we've gotten to, but we're really just getting started. So as far as basketball as a category goes, we've been working. We've had great support from our sporting goods partners first and primarily, where, I think, we really have that kid who is buying product to play at the high school level and we've had -- we've been working on with the right assortments there, and really getting behind footwear for us as an initiative, particularly in basketball. And then in the mall channel, the -- whether it's Finish Line or Foot Locker, and I described what we're doing with Champs Sports through Foot Locker with The ARMOURY series. It's going to be a really neat opportunity for us, I think, to change the way that the consumer is looking at the brand, the way that they see us is that, breaking through and having people see you as a basketball brand, again, it's just taking -- it's taking a lot of time and the chance for us to, I think, really differentiate ourselves from the brand that maybe people have seen as us to the brand that we see ourselves, and the brand we're going to be. So Steph is a big part of that."

So hopefully somebody asks another question about that and we can circle back on footwear. But in international, as I'm sitting here in Munich, opening this new office and cutting the ribbon this afternoon, first of all, what Charlie has done for our International business in really helping us accelerate and think about ourselves as a global brand, but more importantly, beginning to act like a global brand. We're fast in the way of doing that. This would be our 17th office that we've opened up, I think, our fifth or sixth this year. In a way, that relates to our brand's incredibly authentic. And if you were here, it basically -- it feels like Baltimore in Munich, and beginning, of course, with, I think,  the esthetic, the way the place looks, but the team, the people, the energy, just incredibly, incredibly proud, and you're seeing that at retail too. We went and walked stores. We saw 3 of the largest sports stores and retailers that are here in Germany and throughout Europe over the last couple of days, and the excitement we have from the very tops of these organizations and the belief they have that Under Armour can penetrate, where we are very, very -- we are very young, and we are just getting started here. While we've been doing business in selling stuff, probably for the last 8 or 9 or close to 10 years now, we're really beginning to do business. And I think it's reflective, obviously, in our revenues. I mean, 93% revenue growth in the second quarter alone, 83% revenue growth in International year-to-date, 94% growth in 2014. So that idea of coming close to doubling and the plans we talk about is growing by about 50% a year in International, and it's something, I think, that we get really excited that is incredible realistic to happen. A number of things that we have from a product standpoint. We remain positioned, really, in a premium way, the way the consumer sees us, and so I think that's the way the retailers wants us as well. We are a full-priced brand basically everywhere we do business, and that's no different abroad. We learned a lot of this about how our brand translates through Japan and learning that Under Armour moves outside of North America, and we're just seeing that reinforced especially here in Europe. We're doing a lot of that around some strategic accounts in core markets with premium shop-in-shop investments that we can have, and that's been a real positive for us with the right marquee retailers. From a retail standpoint as well, we've opened 18 Brand House stores in the second quarter in places like Chile, China, Taiwan, Malaysia, the Philippines. We're targeting more than 100 additional global Brand House stores, opening in 2015, built off of a base of 73 in 2014, 3 quarters of which are going to be located in Asia, 85% of those that will be doors, where we we'll be leveraging distributor partners that will be opening those up. And just some perspective, the majority of those stores are, obviously, I guess, going to be in China. I guess, that would be obvious. But just for some perspective, in the month of September alone, we're going to be opening roughly 1 store per day in the month of September, so it's since going to be a big month for us, and it's something we've been perfecting for the last 5 and 6 years. There, and really, globally, with Susie McCabe and our -- and Henry and our retail team are really becoming expert in how to open and translate our store, and have a consistent message for the brand everywhere we show up. So not to be lost in all the physical manifestation of the brand that we're putting at retail is, I think, some of the success that we're seeing in e-commerce. In the second quarter alone, we launched new sites in Thailand, Austria, Ireland, Belgium, Portugal, and I think we've also been working on translating our sites as well and making sure they're open. The new markets continues to be a real big opportunity for us. One thing I don't want to get lost in this message is it's not all roses either. This going global is not an easy thing. It's a slog. It's an investment. It's something we're continuing to get better. So while we're pleased with the results that we're seeing, we still see that there's a tremendous amount of meat left on the bone. With the opportunity for us to improve is that our fulfillment rates are not where they need to be. Our -- the wholesale partners have been incredibly patient with us, as we get this settled and organized. But things like Brad mentioned, with our new SAP upgrades and implementations, they're going to make a big difference with systems and processes, and this is part of the shift to becoming a global brand. So across the world in EMEA, as I mentioned, having spent the last couple of days here in Europe, a lot of excitement, a lot of energy. Of course, driven in part by our sports marketing assets, the success we've seen there, but I think, really, it's the teams on the ground and it's the energy, and it's the culture of the brand that's -- is really the leading the way. Asia, a lot of incredibly exciting things happening there. Japan continues to be a stalwart for us and leading. But as I mentioned, things like China, where all the stores we're opening up and what we're doing in September, we're going to drive a lot of energy from the Stephen Curry tour that we'll be taking him through for about 7 days over there between Japan, obviously, 3 stops in China and then a few other stops as well. So it will be very exciting. And then Latin America, I think energy is still building around Brazil, especially with the Olympics coming back and things we have there. We opened our first Brand House in Sao Paulo in the MorumbiShopping mall and it's doing very, very well. And really, every place that we've opened stores, I think, we're outperforming. So we haven't seen any surprises to the downside. There's a tremendous amount of heat and energy to the brand. I'm living and feeling that today and excited for about 350 to 400 of our closest friends and media partners are going to come over and help us cut a ribbon this afternoon. So a lot of energy about Under Armour being here in Germany, and really every place we're opening offices and stores around the world. So it's a good story. It's good news, but as I said, there's still room for us to improve, and you'll see us ambitiously go after that."

We've tried implementing it for years, and then we sort of got to this point where it's hard. It's not easy to change things is that we are -- we've not been end-use driven in the past. We were basically -- we've got an apparel team. We have a footwear team. We have an accessory team, and we think that, that obviously has worked in getting us started, but we're at the point where we're reaching the size, and frankly, the scale to be able to afford, and more importantly, not be able to not afford to go after really addressing category management. And the thing we used was the sport of golf, which really got us excited several years ago, where we implemented this, and we identified a leader, and they really took the bull by the horns and started with product and organizing everything from the way that we showed up in our sporting goods, in our wholesale partners, the way we showed up on the green grass golf course. And also given the same control over to how we're going to spend the marketing dollars, and that meant -- and additionally, we showed up with things like POP and marketing, all the way to the assets that we signed, and so it was a great story that led us to getting us to Jordan Spieth. The thing for all of this, and as we're going to think about category management, it's going to come down the leadership. And what we wanted was accountability, and where golf started is that I remember after a golf tournament several ago, sitting there on a Sunday and I'm watching and not feeling great about the way that one of our golfers was outfitted. And I write an email and say, ""This isn't working well."" And I think I had 18 people CC-ed on the email, and saying this is ridiculous. We should get this to much more consistent manner, where we can flow the information in a better way that will be more effective and, ultimately, is going to better serve the end-use consumer and the athlete. So I use that theme of thinking bigger, and that's where -- us hiring Terdema Ussery, who's going to join us and has great experience in this industry, is someone who knows everyone who's got a five-star resume of leadership and success, and frankly, a really great person, I think, that just as importantly as anything is his expertise and his smarts, is the culture fit that he's going to be at Under Armour. So there's a lot to happen there, but I think we have to almost force the issue. And while we've been working through these pieces, we're going to give you a lot more color at Investor Day as well that will tell you a little more specific how we're thinking about it. But ultimately, the idea is we're not going to just pull the plug and eliminate our Apparel and our Footwear groups. There's going to be a bit of transition there. The first way we're going to start though is identifying the category leadership across, it's roughly 9 different categories that we have right now that we've identified, where we want a true general manager to run each of these that will have both, in some instances, clear P&L responsibility, in other instances, a bit of virtual P&L responsibility. But the most important thing is we're going to create accountability across each of these divisions, where, hopefully, it will drive and prevent us from things that may be perceived as inauthentic and making sure that we preserve the Under Armour life [ph]. But again, I use that example of golf. In just the sport of golf, in the last 2 years, our revenue has more than doubled. We're seeing key category growth throughout the rest of the year, things like on our website, our play-off polos, the #1 item at our Brand House and on our E-Commerce site. The business is basically up everywhere. We have our key asset, which is the one thing, which led is the ability to find the right asset with Jordan, really, leading the way out there has been an absolute kill and home run for us, too. And it also allows us to launch new categories, like we'll have a authentic golf shoe coming out, and you're seeing Jordan wearing our golf club out there on the course. So all these things from the right asset, from the right marketing, from the right positioning, being in the right retail distribution, it's all really led us to get to this. So we're excited in what we've seen. The success in golf is something we'll hopefully see you -- us translate through in things like basketball and running. And really, the obvious categories that you'd imagine we'd be looking for, sport end-use, in global football, of course, and things like that. So we want to win. We think that the opportunity for us do that is not defined by what anybody else has done. And we're going to carve a bit of our own legs, but still, at the same time, there's a lot of good lessons to learn from other people that have done this before us, too. So I think we're going to take the best of all worlds and we're going to do what's best for the Under Armour brand."

But Champs and Foot Locker, as a whole, has been an amazing partner for us, and something, I think, where we can translate our existing consumer and help get them used to thinking about us in a mall environment. We still see ourselves as a holistic head-to-toe brand, and our philosophy remains that we're going to go where our consumers want, and frankly, where they expect us. And so what we're looking for is further ways that we can build relationships with our wholesale partners to elevate the product story for the best Under Armour. We're only in roughly 25% of the 3,400 global footing stores today, but obviously, we're working with their team on aligning with that. The ARMOURY and Champs is a great example of how we can grow our business and the relationship together. We're testing a handful of these premium shop-in-shops over the next couple of years, starting in our own backyard in Maryland. And the early readings that we've seen of this thing, the first several weeks that are very, very, very encouraging. The merchandising is going to consist of a mixture of inline product, mall-specific product, in addition to some product not found elsewhere in the mall too, so things like that. We're putting our Highlight Cleat's into the mall channel, or into The ARMOURY, and it's getting just at the deeper breadth of the sort of the Under Armour experience in a mall environment.

The first partnership deal that I signed was with NFL Europe league. So we're no stranger to international business. It's becoming good at it.  More importantly, I think, in a lot of places, particularly here in Europe, continuity is an incredibly important lesson and attribute of any brand. Consistency is very, very important, doing things the same way. I mean, it's a continent that's defined by history. And brands that sort of come in, live today and are gone tomorrow, and I think everyone has seen a lot of that. So a lot of it is a bit of questioning. They're waiting you out and wondering, are you going to make it, are you going to be there. And what we've seen is the brand, it's taking a while. It doesn't happen on the first handshake. It doesn't happen on the first introduction. And we came over to Europe for the first time back at the end of 2005 and into 2006, and it was a -- it's been a slog. We weren't really understanding completely what we had going on. At the same time, we're also organizing ourselves in North America. The thing we think about with Brad and my job and our entire executive team's job is, again, is defining and deciding how to deploy the resources of time, people and money. There's only so much of any one of them. And we're torn with the fact that it was always international, it was such a small part of our business. And so U.S. and North America would usually dominate the amount of time we spent. So as we've grown, you've seen us going all the way back to 2009 and 2010. I think we fielded a lot of questions of why are you pouring this money into Europe, why are you pouring this money, and where is the return going to come? And so we had this long story of long-term investments in things like Women's, long term investments in things like Footwear, long term investments in something like International. And this year, and we said, I don't know if it's a big enough comment, but we're going to be profitable in Europe this year. And that was something, if you went back 5 years, you may have fielded questions on why not throw in the towel. Can you really be successful there? Why not just focus on North America? So we're now looking at A, our profitability, and it's been one asset at a time, and it's been things from joining EPL football, with people and places like Tottenham Hotspur, and then finding ways to make investments. The recent announcement we had with the São Paulo Futebol Clube down in Brazil, it's not an immediate return for us. I've always said I don't really see us as a licensed jersey manufacturer. I don't like that idea of growing sport by simply selling fan gear. We want to be on the authentic athlete. We want to be on the pitch, on the court, on the field, but there's ways for us to get in. And so finding the resource that we can splinter off to make an investment in a market that's very new for us, like Brazil, it's a big deal, and so we're -- I think we're very patiently doing that around the globe where we're finding assets that makes sense, and especially where we can reinforce it in markets that we can create an ROI that's sooner than later. So it's a big -- running something global, and we said that a long time, but really, understanding what it means to be a global company. That takes time, and it takes experience, and it takes maturity, and it takes patience, and many of the things that maybe you would characterize as us not having in the first few years as a company. But I think that we've been developing that skill set, and most importantly, we've been developing that leadership team. So Terdema is a great example of that coming onboard, and I think you're seeing it filled out throughout our company, and something that will only continue to get bigger and better for us as a brand. So we're learning a lot of lessons. As I said, we're -- there are mistakes in there, believe me, but when it comes through with, I think, the performance of the 90-plus percent revenue growth that we saw this quarter and is reflective of, I think, what you're seeing happening, one thing I can tell you is there's a tremendous pull, there's a tremendous demand for the brand right now. It's a matter of our execution. There's a lot of places that we can improve, we can enhance, we can better. I called out supply chain specifically is that it's difficult figuring out how to move product, that duty conscious and being careful and being able to make money and not getting crushed on margin and learning how to manufacture locally, and so we've been learning all these lessons. The good news, this isn't something we've been doing for the last 3 or 6 months. This is something we've been doing for, really, the last 6 to 10 years. So we're certainly not claiming to be experts right now, but we feel great about our trajectory. We feel great about our team. We remain humble and hungry, and we've got a shot. The mission here is to be the next great global brand, and you're going to see us fight, crawl and scratch and do everything we can to make that happen. So we'll keep running hard for you. That's for sure."

How do you kind of think about leveraging this database from a marketing standpoint to help to further drive more connectedness towards the brand, but also towards specific kind of categories to help accelerate those?"
8740684,305840503,837468,"Under Armour, Inc., Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 23, 2015",2015-07-23,"Earnings Calls","Under Armour, Inc.","Executives","Yes, when we first did the -- I don't think I answered that when I did my Connected Fitness either, sort of the way that we're thinking about measurement of growth and things like that. When we made the announcement at what we called Digital Day a few day",684,"Yes, when we first did the -- I don't think I answered that when I did my Connected Fitness either, sort of the way that we're thinking about measurement of growth and things like that. When we made the announcement at what we called Digital Day a few days -- following our 2014 earnings call, we told you, there were 120 million people roughly on the platform and then it was about a month or so later, I was on a -- I did a talking head show, and we said 130 million, and now, today, we're telling you it's over 140 million people. We will be careful to sort of quantify those things in terms of the number of users we have. Our next job is really figuring out how to make them good quality users as well is that I'd take 40 million hyper-engaged people that really we're very getting -- benefiting from the brand and using our apps and our ecosystem, using that as a learning place that we could grow that out to a broader audience. At the same time, the scale that we're growing is nothing we want to ignore, but we think the definition of success is not just the total top line number of users. How we're growing north of 30%, and seeing that consistently happen, that is going to be something that's positive. But what I think you'll see from us, and again, we're going to go deeper on our own Investor Day into what the story of Connected Fitness means for the Under Armour brand, is that there's a higher level of engagement that we're going to be able to drive with that. And without doubt, our Gear Tracker site alone, which is something that's exclusive to the MapMyFitness platform, there's more than 400,000 people that are actively tracking products, and whether it's a pair of shoes that they wear or whatever item that the use. I think it's close to 2,000 people a day are signing up for Gear Tracker. So people are interested in this idea of the Internet of Things, that theory being that, eventually everything that we have is going to have a chip in it. So 1 billion connected things in 2010, and I think the projection is by 2020, it's going to be over 25 billion or 30 billion connected things in the world. So we obviously want to use that to make ourselves smart, and to honestly to help enrich and improve the lives of our consumers. So we think we're going to have the ability to do that, we think, getting smart in everything we do. Again, the thing I'm probably most proud of with these acquisitions is, of course, the community we've built and the team we've built, but also, I think, the level of engagement that we're creating with the consumer, of giving them a reason to think about themselves holistically. This idea of approaching health and arming people with the ability to make better decisions for themselves is a pretty powerful, powerful thing that, I think, who's going to own that information or who's going to help give you that and organize that information for you, should it be a health care provider, should it be a drugstore, should it be a health insurance company or should it be a sports brand that you trust. And so we think we have a great connection with the athlete. We think that we can test and prototype this with -- at the highest levels with people, like the University of Notre Dame football team. And if it's good enough for them, we think it's a -- and some of our other marquee athletes, it should be good enough for the consumer. So building that trust is going to be paramount in doing this. And yes, we think we're going to be able to sell more shirts and shoes ultimately, but we think we're going to be able to continue to transform what the Under Armour brand is, and we'll continue as being able to do that."

In 3 weeks, Under Armour will be celebrating our 10-year anniversary as a public company. Back in 2005, we were a $281 million company. Compression Apparel made up 2/3 of our business. The phrase Connected Fitne",2337,"Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. In 3 weeks, Under Armour will be celebrating our 10-year anniversary as a public company. Back in 2005, we were a $281 million company. Compression Apparel made up 2/3 of our business. The phrase Connected Fitness had not yet been coined. The day when we would feature a ballerina in a commercial seemed unlikely, and Jordan Spieth had only just begun his journey to greatness by taking golf lessons at Brook Hollow Golf Club in Dallas at a tender age of 12 from pro Cameron McCormack. 
What I knew back then and still believe today is that anything is possible because of the ever evolving power of sports. In just the last few months, I've seen firsthand the value to advertisers who understand that sports is the only thing left that viewers insist on watching live. Like the emotion of 80,000 fans at Twickenham Stadium, including Prince William, Duke of Cambridge; and his Royal Highness, Prince Harry of Wales, on a fall Saturday in London, to watch England take on Wales in the rugby World Cup. While 4,000 miles away another 80,000 were watching Notre Dame Football in South Bend. Was it 10,000 fans lining up from Manila to get a glimpse of the NBA's most valuable players Stephon Curry. The power of sports and its ability to transcend generations, technologies and trends is what makes other industries envious of the business that we are in. 
The power of sports is the engine that has fueled growth from day 1 and the reason for our confidence of the future. It is the foundation behind our doing business in just 4 countries in 2005 to now more than 60 today. Growing our retail footprint from a single UA website and 4 domestic Factory House outlet stores in 2005 to now 24 global E-Commerce sites and more than 300 UA-owned retail destinations and partner doors around the world. Building our team from around 600 employees in 2005 to more than 11,000 today. Going from not producing a single shoe in 2005 to approximately 30 million pairs in 2015. Reporting 22 consecutive quarters of 20-plus percent revenue growth and 24 straight quarters of 20-plus percent revenue growth in our largest category, Apparel. Achieving our first $1 billion revenue quarter. Saying confidently we're going to double our revenues to $7.5 billion by 2018, and our stock price appreciating more than 2,800% from our IPO price compared to roughly 60% for the S&P 500. 
It has been a great 10 years of public company and we've learned a lot during this time, but our focus remains the same and that is unlocking the equity we have created to continue to build the world's most important sports and fitness brand. To do that, we will continue to invest. We will do so in a prudent way that has driven our results over this past 10 years. At our Investor Day here in Baltimore last month, we spoke to the diversity of these investments. We are focused on 3 key areas where we are confident the return our investment will be increasingly evident as our business continues to grow globally. 
The first area is our core business including sports marketing assets, brand marketing, supply chain, investing in inventory to help us meet the unparalleled demand for the Under Armour brand. The second area is our growth drivers like international, where we grew the business 69% year-to-date, and Footwear were we posted a third quarter growth rate of 61% and continue to invest in world-class talent. And finally, on the new opportunities like local manufacturing, sportswear and Connected Fitness that may not meaningfully impact our top line results in the short term but will bring a new dimension to our model and create new competencies within our organization in the years to come. 
Starting with our core business. We continue to find assets that are fit with our brand, the most recent example being 2 weeks ago. We announced a new long-term partnership with the University of Wisconsin. It takes one trip to Madison, Wisconsin on a football Saturday to understand the value of college assets and the marketing landscape where more than 80,000 people show up to cheer on the team wearing our brand, where once loyalty is literally one on their sleeve. Take for example, 2 historical rivals finding common ground to their outfitter and donning the same Baselayer T-shirt for a football game, as our 2 partners, Notre Dame and the United States Naval Academy, did just 2 weeks ago in the name of respect for one another. We are not just closing athletes, we are telling stories. We are tapping into the emotion that is tied to the power of sport and we are giving them an authentic way to display their passion. 
We also talked at our Investor Day about our ongoing work with SAP. the vision here is a single-user database that combines the traditional consumer purchasing habit information with Under Armour's additional insights gained through our Connected Fitness platform. This work can be categorized into 2 main areas, architecting the future to create a business platform that will scale our organization and sustain our global growth; and developing the consumer insight engine that will use data to drive this business to $7.5 billion and beyond. Our increased insights into the consumer will empower us with better information to make better business decisions to build better products while helping athletes make better choices in your own personal, health and fitness and, ultimately, enriching their lives. 
The second big area of investment is in our growth drivers. They are the same 5 that we talked about since our IPO: Men's Apparel, Women's Apparel, Footwear, International and Direct-to-Consumer. And our strategy, which also remains the same today is simply to make Women's larger than men's, to make Footwear larger than Apparel as a whole then sell that product country by country around the globe, and when we don't find an appropriate redistribution, augment that with our own Direct-to-Consumer E-Commerce and retail channels. And the one thing we will never forget to do and is written on the whiteboards in my office is, don't forget to sell shirts and shoes. 
So let's start talking about Footwear. The momentum that you see and read about around our Footwear business is a result of the investments we've made starting back even before our IPO. But as we often say around here, we are just getting started. To give some perspective, we will produce 30 million pairs of shoes this year compared to our competition that produces around 0.5 billion pairs each year. This demonstrates the miles of runway in front of us for growth in this one category alone. We've already have seen the return on our investments in Footwear through the 98%-plus sell-throughs for the Curry signature footwear line. We are incredibly excited for the Curry Two, which becomes globally available at retail this Saturday and was first unveiled by Stephen Curry during the roadshow toward Asia last month. To support this launch, Stephen and Jamie Foxx have teamed up once again in a new digital campaign titled Flash, which was created by award winning agency [indiscernible] 5 and is available now for viewing across all our social platforms. 
Additional returns have come from the SpeedForm platform, who have been tripling in the revenue year-to-date, our Highlight football cleats, earning the #1 spot in the marketplace for the third straight year. And new breakthrough innovations like the Fat Tire shoe, which launched in May continues to disrupt the market and on high praise including gear of the show at the 2015 Winter Outdoor Retailer Tradeshow.
Looking ahead to 2016, we plan to leverage our relationship with Jordan Spieth, the recently crowned PGA Tour player of the year, by introducing our golf footwear brand, much like we did with our basketball footwear brand, through NBA MVP Stephen Curry. You also will see a much deeper concerted effort to put resources in the Women's Footwear as we've brought in depth of talent to help support this growing area of our business. 
As I said earlier, the third area of investment for us, to unlock the power of sports and new parts of our business like local manufacturing, sportswear and Connected Fitness. We unveiled our plans for Project Glory our local for local manufacturing at Investor Day, but let me refresh you on how this investment will change the game for us and for the world. State-of-the-art Footwear and Apparel manufacturing facilities haven't modernized like other industries, with end to end upwards of 150 people being needed to build a single product like a shoe. We know there's a better way. And through our SpeedForm Footwear platform and the innovative manufacturing approach that we took there, we've been able to reduce the number of human touches up to 30%, and we believe there's plenty of runway left. So we see an opportunity to innovate the process, increasing our speed to market by introducing local-for-local manufacturing that will produce better product globally, products as great as our brand, in the most efficient way possible.
In 2016, we opened our physical space for Project Glory, which we will call our lighthouse. The lighthouse will be an advanced manufacturing innovation hub located right here in Baltimore. It will commercialize new enabling technologies and processes that will first be integrated into our existing supply chain by our current partners before ultimately being rolled out by the same partners in new facilities around the world, changing the dynamics of speed to market, pricing, costing and labor made in the U.S. for the U.S. market, made in Brazil for the Brazilian market and so on. Being an innovative company means not only bringing innovation into everything we make, but also into how we create better product more efficiently.
Also at Investor Day, we revealed our plans for new category for Under Armour, sportswear. We will answer the call from our consumer for product that can be worn outside of the gym, court, pitch or field, delivering the same promise of functionality in form, fit and performance that they've come to expect from Under Armour. This category expands our vision of empowering all athletes on and off this playing field. Our gateway to an engaged consumer, which will allow us to emerge in new categories, such as sportswear, is Connected Fitness. As we move to changing the layout they stress to changing the way they live, we are becoming part of the athlete's life 24/7. From sleep and activity to fitness and nutrition, we are directly interacting with our consumer, turning their data into a call to action in support of our mission to make all athletes better. This type of insight we've come to rely on in other areas of our lives such as our personal finances or the performances of our cars is now finally available for our own health. I look forward to sharing with you more on how we will leverage this opportunity with some very exciting announcements to come at CES in early January 2016.
We believe Connected Fitness will enrich the lives of our consumer and we also believe it will help inform us to make better positions on behalf of our consumer. The information derived from our Connected Fitness platform delivers deep algorithmic capabilities that will create a highly interactive relationship with our consumers, making it possible to engage with them in a more personal and relevant way as individuals. World-renowned adviser and best selling author, Rom Charran [ph], Believes companies with these mathematical capabilities for personalization, companies he calls mass [ph] houses possess a huge advantage over companies that don't have these capabilities, even if they have been highly successful in the past, companies that will experience difficulty keeping up with a mass house are referred to as a legacy company. A legacy company still lives in the era of mass production and mass markets with the customer experience and delivered second or third hand. A math house uses data to shorten the distance between a brand and the consumer. Today, the information we gain through the more than 150 million Connected Fitness registered users including now updated from Investor Day 6.5 billion food logged and over 1.5 billion workouts logged just year-to-date across our 4 platforms, combined with the global point of sale, E-Commerce and transactional data from our partners has firmly secured or status as the mass house of the health, fitness and nutrition industry. And we believe, as Rom had said, any organization that is not a mass house is unable to became one soon is already a legacy company. 
The hidden benefit in entering these new spaces like Connected Fitness and sportswear are the organizational competencies that we gain s we build out these businesses. We are a team that adapts well, whether it's moving from U.S. to global, Apparel to Footwear, men's to women's or wholesale to Direct-to-Consumer.
[indiscernible] on my presentation at Investor Day was based on the pieces of advice given to me by former Navy Seal and Under Armour Director, Eric Olson. His advice was simply that when a math difference from train, I would always tell my soldiers to go with the terrain. Led by our world-class leadership team, we continue to demonstrate our deep expertise in going with the terrain, to evolve with the upwards and downwards strength we will inevitably see you through any business cycle. Our 10 years now of both 30% top and equally 30% bottom line growth established since our IPO and our healthy strong shirts and shoes business give us great confidence for the future. And our connected fitness mass house, which will empower us to understand our consumer at a higher level to help shape our cultural approach to continue to innovate and tap into the power of sports for the next 10 years and beyond. We are just getting started.

Now I'd like to spend some time reviewing our third quarter results followed by our updated outlook for 2015 and the preliminary thoughts on 2016. 
Our net revenues for the third quarter of 2015 increased 28% to $1.2 billion. On a currency-neutral basis, net revenues increased 31% for the period. Within our product categories, we grew Apparel net revenues 23% to $866 [ph] million compared to $705 million in the prior year's quarter. From a product perspective, our new Armour Baselayer and expanded innovation platforms like Storm and ColdGear Infrared were key stories during the third quarter. On sports categories, we saw significant growth in golf and outdoor. Third quarter Footwear net revenues increased 61% [ph] to $196 million from $122 million the prior year. Our strength in football remains broad-based including our largest categories of running and basketball and the same as our new categories such as hiking and global football. Key price included our latest addition to the SpeedForm platform with the SpeedForm [indiscernible] running shoe as well as additional Curry One basketball styles and we'll have the Curry Two launch this weekend.
Our accessories net revenues during the third quarter increased 22% to $104 million from $85 million last year, primarily driven by strong consumer demand for our line of bags. Our global Direct-to-Consumer net revenues increased 28% for the quarter, representing approximately 26% of net revenues. We continue to be encouraged by the success we are seeing with our 2015 Brand House openings. From a global standpoint, we ended the third quarter with 173 owned stores including 144 Factory House stores and 29 Brand House stores.
In E-Commerce we launched 6 new country websites during the quarter, bringing our total to 24 global sites. We continue to utilize more targeted effective communication to our consumers and traffic remained strong benefiting from the remarkable 2015 success of our sports marketing assets. While very early in its evolution, we are also encouraged by some of our efforts to generate traffic to our E-Commerce sites from our Connected Fitness community.
Looking at our regions, North America net revenues increased 25% to $1.1 billion in the third quarter compared to $848 million in the prior year's quarter. On a currency-neutral basis, North America net revenues increased 26% based primarily on the drivers I just highlighted.
International net revenues increased 52% to $130 million in the third quarter and represented 11% of total net revenues. On a currency-neutral basis, international net revenues increased 68% [ph] for the period. In the EMEA region, we remain focus on core markets with our largest 2 countries, the U.K. and Germany, contributing the strongest growth during the period. Our E-Commerce [indiscernible] has also played a key role in broadening our reach and awareness in the regions as we launched 9 new local sites here today.
In Asia Pacific, the growth of our own DTC, combined with partner store expansion, continues to drive our business. The recent Stephen Curry tore and opening of our largest international Brand House in Shanghai have helped drive strong demand for our brand. And in Latin America, we continue to see balanced growth throughout the region following our market entering into many of these countries during 2014.
Moving on to margins. Third quarter gross margins contracted 80 basis points to 48.8% compared to 49.6% in the prior year's period. The following factors were the primary drivers during the quarter: first, the continued strength of the U.S. dollar negatively impacted gross margins by approximately 90 basis points versus the prior year; second, sales mix negatively impacted gross margin by approximately 50 basis points in the third quarter versus the primary -- prior year, primarily driven by the continued strong performance of our Footwear business; also, our ongoing focus to better 2service resulting in higher freight [ph] expenses, which negatively impacted gross margin by approximately 20 basis points in the quarter versus the prior year. Partially offsetting these margin pressures, we continue to see favorable product margins in both our North America and international businesses, which benefited gross margin by approximately 90 basis points in the third quarter.
Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues delevered 60 [ph] basis points to 34.6% in the third quarter of 2015 from 34% in the prior year's period. SG&A details for the third quarter are as follows: marketing costs increased to 10.7% net revenues for the quarter from 10.6% in the prior year period reflecting higher marketing associated with our Connected Fitness business and our most recent global marketing campaigns for training and global football. Other SG&A costs increased to 23.9% net revenues for the quarter from 23.4% in the prior year, driven primarily by our Connected Fitness business and investments in our global Brand House strategy. 
Operating income for the third quarter increased 17% to $171 million compared with $146 million in the prior year period. Interest and other expense from the third quarter increased to $7 million compared with $5 million in the prior period primarily reflecting increased interest expense associated with the financing of our Connected Fitness acquisitions.
Our third quarter tax rate of 38.8% was unfavorable to the 36.9% rate last year, primarily driven by nondeductible costs associated with our Connected Fitness acquisitions as well as increased losses in our newer Latin American businesses, partially driven by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Our third quarter net income increased 13% to $100 million compared to $89 million in the prior year period while our diluted earnings per share increased to $0.45 from $0.41 in the prior year's period.
On the balance sheet, total cash and cash equivalents for the quarter decreased 36% to $159 million compared to $249 [ph] million at September 30, 2014. Inventory for the quarter increased 36% to $867 million compared to $637 million at September 30, 2014. Total debt increased to $905 million as compared to $192 million at September 30, 2014, primarily reflecting the financing of our Connected Fitness acquisition. Looking at our cash flows our investment and capital expenditures was $71 million for the third quarter compared to $26 million in the prior year's period, driven primarily by our investments in our global headquarters in Baltimore and our global retail strategy. 
Now moving on to our updated 2015 guidance. Based on current visibility, we expect 2015 net revenues of approximately $3.91 billion, representing growth of 27% and 2015 operating income of approximately $408 million, representing growth of 15%. As we have highlighted on our last earnings call in July, and during our recent Investor Day, we believe the decisions we make on where, when and how much we invest are a key driver of our success to date and it is our job to deliver both near and long-term value of simultaneously investing in our growth.
In a year, we have seen unprecedented success from our athletes on a global scale. We believe the investments we are making today will help fuel our growth for years to come. As Kevin mentioned earlier, we have abundant opportunities that we are investing in to drive our long-term top line growth. With so many areas that require investment, we continue to be focused on driving operating income dollars and not necessarily operating margin.
This is why we have now raised our 2015 net revenues guidance but a total of $150 million since January, while at the same time, maintaining the high end of our operating income target at $408 million. We are committed to a certain level of investment back into our business and we will continue to be opportunistic if and when possible during the fourth quarter.
As a reminder, our operating income guidance continues to include the dilutive impact of the Connected Fitness acquisitions consisting of one-time transaction cost in the first quarter, operating losses from these businesses and noncash amortization charges of the intangible assets generated from the acquisition.
Below operating results, we continue to expect the full year effective tax rate of approximately 41% compared to 39.2% in the prior year, primarily given the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, which continued to negatively impact our international profitability. 
So now I'd like to add some additional colors on several items pertaining to the fourth quarter, starting with revenues. We believe we are well positioned to execute heading into the holidays as our investments in service are paying off in fresher, cleaner assortments across our distribution. As we expand our innovation stories the ColdGear Infrared and Storm across our sports categories, we also believe we are more diversified in our solutions for the athlete. Supported by the launch of Curry Two basketball shoes, we expect Footwear growth will continue to outpace the growth rate for our overall business during the fourth quarter.
Now gross margin rate is now expected to decline approximately 100 basis points during the fourth quarter. Some of the same themes impacting our business the past few quarters will extend into the fourth quarter including pressure from the continued strength of the U.S. dollar, higher freight costs and a higher mix of [indiscernible] revenues. While higher than planned, the latter 2 factors are also key at our increased top line guidance for the year. In addition to these factors, driven by the recent higher growth rates in our Footwear business, we are now planning higher access Footwear liquidation sales as part of our normal inventory management process, which will negatively impact gross margins in the fourth quarter. Partially offsetting these factors, we anticipate that we will continue to see improvements in our product margins.
In SG&A, we expect a lower rate of spend from the fourth quarter due to the timing of marketing spend while other SG&A is expected to grow approximately in line with our net revenues growth as we continue with our planned investments in the areas for our long-term growth including Connected Fitness, international and Footwear. Also, as I mentioned earlier, we will remain opportunistic in investing incremental dollars during the fourth quarter in the event of more favorable unplanned revenues of gross margin rate. 
Switching over to inventory. As we outlined at our Investor Day, over the next few quarters, we are focused on delivering our products to our consumers more timely, specifically on key seasonal floor set dates. We anticipate this will result in elevated inventory growth rates over these periods to flow product earlier. 
Finally, on capital expenditures. Based on our current visibility, we are now planning capital expenditures in the range of $350 million to $360 million for 2015 including approximately $140 million allocated across 3 areas to support long-term growth, with our new domestic distribution center, the expansion of our corporate headquarters in Baltimore and initial investments in our new and expanded SAP platform. In addition, we have accelerated investments in key areas to drive revenue growth including the rollout of our global retail strategy and new E-Commerce sites. 
Before we turn it over to Q&A, I would also like to provide you with our preliminary outlook for 2016. Based on our current visibility, we are planning 2016 net revenues to grow at approximately 25% and 2016 operating income to grow at approximately 23%. Both of these metrics are in line with our long-term growth targets we established at our Investor Day last month.
Provide further color on 2016 during our earnings call in January. With that, let's turn it over to questions. Operator?"

Could you just give us a little more color on how Under Armour thinks about that huge opportunity in terms of partners and product categories or any insight you could give us?"

So first of all, internationally, we're really excited. We've crossed 11% of the total mix for the company, which is a big deal for us. It's been a long time coming. And becoming global is something that you can't just say, yes, you actually have t",947,"Great. So first of all, internationally, we're really excited. We've crossed 11% of the total mix for the company, which is a big deal for us. It's been a long time coming. And becoming global is something that you can't just say, yes, you actually have to act on it. I think it is really 2006 we launched our first shop in Europe. 2010, we opened our first Brand House with 1,000 square foot store in Shanghai, and it has been a lot of learnings and a lot of adjustment. It's not as easy as opening stores, but it's into the product, it's into the localized fit, it's into the localized merchandising. It's into the execution, the distribution, the manufacturing, so there are a lot of pieces. China is a great lesson for that. I haven't given these numbers publicly, but I think it's instructive of just sort of what our growth has been in China. So in 2012, for instance, I said we launched our first store at 1,000 square feet and it's incredibly successful. We were doing over $1 million of 1,000 square feet at the one store in Shanghai. We didn't have the right leadership when we went in there and we sort of toiled around for the next couple of years. By the end of 2012, we were doing $3 million of sales in China. We took somebody who was one of our -- I introduced to you Kevin Eskridge, who's now running global merchandising for us, but I pulled him out of our outdoor group and sent him and his family to Shanghai. And the results that we have with the business went from $3 million in '12 to $7 million in '13 to $30 million -- roughly $30 million in 2014. The current plan this year is just over $75 million for '15. And as we look forward to 2016, that number is north of $150 million today. So we're incredibly bullish that the hockey stick approach has really begun to lay in for us. We're excited about what that is going to mean. In China, though, one thing we did I think as a nod to the market was our -- the visit I did with the Curry, the Stephen Curry tour of 5 cities in 5 days. We actually launched the shoe that we're launching this Saturday globally. We launched it exclusively in China back at that tour. So China is a very important to make sure that you show and demonstrate great respect, I think, for the market. And hopefully, it's just another sign of the things that we're doing there. In addition of opening our largest international Brand House store, 15,000 square feet on 1 [indiscernible] road in one of those great shopping district in downtown Shanghai. We see great growth coming from there and it speaks to some -- one of the numbers that I mentioned was we'll have 300 stores globally. I think it's close to 100 stores or so we'll be opening this year. Roughly 3/4 of the stores are actually going to be in China. So we see great opportunity there. It's going to be our second-largest controlled market and growing exponentially. The 30 stores that we opened in the third quarter including 18 in September alone including the 1 [indiscernible] road, the E-Commerce revenues in the third quarter nearly equal the total number of 2014 business that we had in China. So a lot of big things and exciting things happening for us there. Let me jump on the sports category for you for a second. I think it's important and it's a good barometer I think on how our business is moving. As we outlined at Investor Day, we expect to move to 9 specific sports categories, men's training, Women's training, studio running, outdoor, golf, basketball team sports, global football and sportswear. Sportswear is one of those quiet discussions that we have, and we outlined in Investor Day the size and importance of sportswear represents for our current competitors. So collectively, our competition has roughly $50 billion of revenues, about [ph] 25% of which they claim publicly derived specifically from sportswear. That's basically a $12.5 billion opportunity as we look at it. Today, we're competing with effectively 0. We feel like we got the right leader in someone who came from this industry, worked for one of our chief competitors and responsible helping to build other sportswear category in Ben Pruess, and Ben is someone who's a process. I want to set people's expectations on sportswear at the same time. We issued $7.5 billion at our Investor Day goal for 2018. Sportswear isn't heavily considered in that. It's going to take time. It's going to take build, and I think understanding what we're going to need to do from an investment standpoint, which is why I think we've been so specific as Brad and I have been really hammering down the fact that while we expect to -- we can really grow and amp up our top line revenue, we want to be prudent with what we're doing on the bottom line, but this growth, this 25% CAGR that we've committed to, it will come at a price, and that price is a continuing investment. I think it's a measured investment at the same time, and our 10-year track record of making appropriate the right investment is something that will give us great confidence that these are categories that are going to pay dividends to investors in the future but it's the right thing for us to do at the time and certainly our moment in time to make it happen."

Yes, definitely with Footwear growing at the rate it is growing, and obviously, ASP in Footwear is much higher than Apparel, that's part of the driver behind inventory growth. But probably the bigger driver of what we're doing right now year-over-year specifically in Q3 and as we look into Q4 is more gauged around the flow of inventory. So if you recall looking back a year ago or so, I mean it's a little bit more than a year ago, we talked about some of the challenges that we had in flowing product on time for things like back-to-school and holiday, and we really got focused this year as we came into 2015 on making sure to some degree at all costs some of that we're going to flow product on time and we called out freight cost, specifically airfreight, as an impact to our gross margins this year to do that. So that's probably the bigger driver what you're seeing in inventory growth rate is we're really focused on hitting key floor set dates. So when you look at things like that getting into the holidays of this year, making sure that product is flowing and ready to go, it's increasing our Q3 inventory levels. When you look at starting to set the floors right at the the beginning of next year, in spring '16, what you're going to see is earlier flow of product in the back half of this year specifically as you get close to the end of this year. So as I talked about that Investor Day, when you kind of look at year-over-year growth rates and inventory, that's the bigger driver of this, is the flow of product. Obviously, we grew a little bit higher than revenue here in Q3. And I think what you'll see is even a little bit more so in Q4 as we're really focused on getting product on the floor on time for our spring floor sets. That should start to normalize a little bit as we work through 2016 because we start to get into a comparison of that focus we had in 2015 to flow product better to. So as you start working through Q1 and Q2 of '16, you should start to normalize that and get that one in line with revenue growth."

I mean it's the theme in Investor Day about the math and the terrain, and I think we demonstrated really great expertise in being able to adjust for the different terrain. There's going to be many very trends. We saw lot of them the last 10 years. We're anticipating probably something similar in the next decade or we're anticipating that we haven't thought about yet. But I think investments are important and a great way to talk about our team. Our core pillars we talked about is product story, service and team, and team obviously being the most important thing. There's a couple of places that I think are illustrative of where we have and, frankly, now that we need to be more aggressive. Our Women's business is a great example of that. Women's Footwear is something that as [indiscernible] a year ago we have just a handful of people or less than that, really people treating Women's Footwear as a part-time job. And where if you compare that to others in the industry, there's not a dozen, there's hundreds of people working on these themes. And so the investments that we're making from a few different -- our sizes are really important. I speak about being opportunistic with our investment in general, and there's a few places that we think we need to invest, first of all, our core business, investing in areas like marketing, supply chain and technology. And again, along with this, Camillo, it all comes down to team and people. But we do see that we are at this unique moment in time, and it's the right time for us because of the year we have with some of our assets and athletes is things like what should we be doing from our marketing and our storytelling standpoint, from a supply chain about being a better customer and having the right team. Because right now we're okay but we're still not level loading our factories the way that we could with the volumes that we're driving and being better with the best factories. And then when we're in the best factories driving the A teams in those factories and that having the best people in our factories working in our business. In technology, it's things like laying out the vision as I mentioned earlier with SAP about the single view of the consumer. Growth drivers for us, our existing growth drivers, I mentioned they're the same as they were, the 5 growth drivers are the same as they were at our IPO, men's, women's, international and direct consumer. Footwear international are places where we've done a great job and you look at the growth we have in the Footwear, we have 61% growth quarter and international we have a 60%, 69% growth quarter and 85% in constant currency basis. And there are things that we weren't getting a lot of credit for a few years ago. We told you were spending money in these categories. I think you're starting to see that really come to life. We're also investing in talent and people where again I think making sure that aid is a broad canvas but the canvas isn't too wide either. We feel comfortable about the investments we're making because beyond our growth drivers, there's new areas for you like Connected Fitness, sportswear, which I just spoke about, and again doubling down on some of the infrastructure we have. But Connected Fitness is one of those things that we're proud and I think we're bullish on the returns that we're beginning to see come back from it. And as we gave that [indiscernible] of $200 million we put out there for 2018, the real upside is something like Connected Fitness is. The collective dollars that will help grow across all our existing growth drivers as well as the new ones that we're investing and the dollars to come. But I feel we've done a good job. I just believe that we're in a process of hiring. I think In our website right now, there's over 350 jobs or something to that effect that we're looking for. There's obviously -- there's a few key executive positions that we're looking to fill. And as Brad and I have been working through the transition heading to February, we've gotten a great response for this position, and we expect to have an A player and some of that's been there, done that and really have seen what it's like. As we look to across the $7.5 billion and $1 billion-plus range. So we're looking to bring experts, and I think that's a unique thing about where we are today versus where we were in just a couple of years ago. We have a great attraction I think this company [indiscernible] custom fit for some real professionals that will be affected by growth."

So this is just the normal process of managing inventory as you work through selling in and selling through, which both have been very positive for us in the Footwear side. Ultimately, always going to be left with some excess inventory in Footwear. We become, over the course of the last few years and this year too, very focused on getting into the next season very clean on the Footwear side. So looking at the excess Footwear we have again, which is really just being generated from the tremendous growth and success we've had in Footwear in general, we really got focused on getting through some of the Footwear liquidation in Q4 and then making sure that we're very clean getting into next year. So obviously, as you talk about Footwear gross margins, just the regular gross margins on Footwear being well below our Apparel gross margins, that's also the case on the liquidation side where your Footwear liquidation margins are going to be much less than your Apparel liquidation side. As far as the avenues and vehicles to liquidate, Factory House obviously is one of them, and we have talked about third-party in the past also moving some of our excess inventory through a third party also. Although small in revenue volume, it obviously does impact gross margin."

FX could be -- will be a big part of that year-over-year decline. If you remember, when we came into this year talking about FX impacting our margins by about 50 basis points. Now we're up to about an 80 basis points full year impact. So obviously, the FX has worsened during the course of the year. So that's a big driver of it. Again, the fourth quarter margins, airfreight as we really get focused on flowing inventory, that's a little bit of a driver, too and that kind of increased during the course of the year as we got kind of laser focused on better deliveries and better flow of product. Those are the big, big drivers. We talked about the Footwear liquidation also being a driver in Q4. We came into this year on the FX side probably less prepared than the coming out of the year relative to how we hedge currencies going forward. So we've done a better job during the course of this year offsetting some of the increased pressures on FX. We've built some better competencies and house from a talent perspective and some better strategies around hedging that we'll continue to increase going forward. So I would expect that in the future, we're more prepared to offset some of those impacts that you're seeing right now. And obviously, as you get into 2016, we're going to start to compare to 2015 FX rates, so you would imagine that there'll be a much more favorable comparison unless something drastically changes on the FX front."

And it's one thing where I think we probably have been dragging a little bit. The women's example that I gave earlier, that's something which was glaring and really obvious, but we've got growth coming from a lot of places. And so until you really turn attention you can focus on it, you're probably a bit vulnerable. So we've made, I think 6 or 7 hires just in the last 45 days on our women's footwear team really looking to become robust and build that out. And there's places where we definitely taken an ROI approach to it, where we have the biggest impact. But at the same time, we don't want to apologize for Footwear. It's a relatively small number and we also put a 50% number up this quarter committed to a 40% CAGR through '18. We think there's great growth there and we're going to be the beneficiaries of that. But one thing I want to emphasize to people is that it is 10 years in making shoes for us, but it absolutely takes time. The first category we got into was American football cleats, and that was 2006 and it was a big breakthrough and we had high teens, low 20s market share. And since that time, we're now pushing to close to a 40% market share in football cleats with our sites set on being #1. And I'd say that only because it's a category we've been in the longest. And for 10 years in football cleats and 5 years in running shoes, imagine, we're going to look like in running shoes and another 5 years there. So but I guess the thing to say is making a great shoe is not as -- or [indiscernible] Footwear is not about making one great shoe. There are so many factors that are combined, and just like use of football cleats. When we were successful with 20% market share, we're basically making shoes for a particular type of athlete. And the speed guys and the guys on the edges of the team weren't the guys that were wearing our product. And the reason we couldn't figure out is why wouldn't they buy our speed shoes, our speed shoe's not good. And the fact is, is that the kid where basketball is really important to him. And he liked wearing the shoe on a football field that he wore on the basketball court. And until we launched the basketball shoe, we couldn't even become relevant there. And until we became relevant in basketball, he wasn't even going to consider us. And so it was about the esthetic of this shoe, but it's so many factors more than just, do you make a good speed cleat as to are you in basketball, do you have a a asset like a Stephen Curry that gives the credibility to want to wear the shoe. And then beyond that, as when we go to being in the biggest factories, it's not only being in the biggest or the best factories, but it's not having the B, C or D teams in the factories, but get to a point we have the A teams in the factories. You're not going to get that point, where I mentioned 30 million pairs of shoes versus 0.5 billion to our competition. And so we have the ability to truly level load and give them the things that they need. And so as we sit here 10 years in, in football cleats and those [indiscernible] football and 7 training shoes and 8 running shoes and 9 basketball shoes and 10, then we stopped launching new categories. We're getting there, we're evolving. It just takes a little more time. So we absolutely believe in sort of the head to toe hoax that we're heading to. But I'll tell you, at our bones, we believe that we're as entitled as anyone else to be #1 in Footwear. And the challenge goes to what spoke about from our local for local manufacturing. We talked about innovation in something Footwear. I don't think our industry has been incredibly innovative at all. When you look and you compare the fact that 20 years ago, the technology that can fit on my fingernail today or in my iPhone or Samsung device it took a mainframe the size of a Greyhound bus just 20 years ago. And today, it's absolutely evolved. In Footwear, we may shoes, we make Apparel the exact same way we did 80 years ago. So I think finding innovation and finding ways to win is that there's not an individual shoe technology that makes someone innovative. So I think the approach that we have is holistic and will pay absolute dividends. But we are challenging our team to think much bigger. But a few I think highlights we have on the Footwear side is that obviously basketball is something with [indiscernible] basketball business up over in triple digits, bringing SpeedForm technology to what that's going to mean for us in basketball as well, signing additional athletes, the #7 pick in this year's draft, Emmanuel Mudiay, is one of the breakout young stars this year as well. So doubling down there, women's, we covered that. Our running business, we've had a great product in SpeedForm but we're also bringing 6 new running models into market in 2016 including a product we have in the market right now called Fortis, which is our #1 selling shoe in our key sporting goods account $90-ish and doing really well as well as another new -- our first all-knit upper offering in a product called Slingshot, which is doing really well. But across the board, outdoor with the Fat Tire shoe I've mentioned in my notes earlier, football cleats have the #1 shoe in the market with the Highlight Cleat; soccer, our new slated [indiscernible] campaign our asset Memphis, the striker for Manchester United who's 22 years old and again, another next big star; Jordan Spieth, launching golf footwear. Our Youth Footwear continues to be on fire as well. So there's a lot of sort of individual stories I think that are drawing to the bigger narrative, and we haven't connected all the dots I think for the consumer yet, where I mean the consumer I also mean our customers, where we can be a great Footwear brand when you walk into a store with an A-Z Footwear experience. But I can tell you is that what that movie looks like. We've seen it before and we're being [indiscernible] we've seen it before as well, and it's just a matter of time for us to draw that. But I want to emphasize we think we can be the #1 brand in Footwear, and what our team is preparing for is what's the next shoe coming from one of our current competitors. But we're thinking about is what are we going to do if Apple or Samsung decide to make a show, how are we going to answer that. So that's the type of I think leapfrog mentality and that moonshot thinking that we're challenging our team with let's not fight with where people are today. Let's think about where they're going in the future and what we can do to be great."

But if I could just take a second on our Connected Fitness, today, more than 150 million athletes continue to add over 100,000 a day throughout 2015, downloading 1 of our 4 apps. I mean the scale is extraordinary. At Investor Day, we mentioned there were 6 billion foods are logged in time. Today, just a few weeks later over 6.5 billion foods logged. Workouts, 1.3 billion is the number we gave you at Investor Day. Today, it's more then 1.5 billion workouts. More than 200 million workouts occurred just from the last few weeks. So the information we're gaining every day we think is incredible and it's going to continue to enable us to provide the consumer with really relevant information, insights too. We'd like to use the words to enrich lives. We think the bigger opportunity, though, is much bigger -- is much broader than $200 million target that we talked about and ultimately is going to help us sell more shirts and shoes. The Math House idea, though, they build it to use data and analytics to drive business is something which is -- I don't think we've quantified yet. I used an example and I think it's a really good one, that Amazon how they the credit 40% of their revenues what they call the recommendation engine, and that's basically you just base off of toothpaste. I know if I told you a tube of toothpaste 5 weeks ago a toothpaste has a 6-week lifecycle, and I can ask what you want me to send in YouTube. Not only do we know purchasing issue, but we can tie that to activity to fitness to sleep to nutrition and data information that our customers are voluntarily giving to us. And we recognize that as they do that, our job is becoming this destination, this daily dashboard of your health and fitness that we think we can become, and that's all built on trust. And as I said many times, trust is one of those things that's built and dropped and can be lost in buckets, but we think that we have the credibility at this point and with the with some of the suite of products and apps and devices that we have as we're contemplating looking forward and partners we're looking with those devices to move forward. We got a large amount that we're looking forward to make at CES at January and we think it's an incredibly exciting space that is just partially contemplated as we look forward. But the one thing that is clear, as excited as we are about our Connected Fitness and now is going to enable us this Math House to be much smarter about our overall business, ultimately, what it's going to do is help us sell more shirts and shoes."

A lot of that right now is going to be timing of new market entries on the E-Commerce side globally, retail on the global side to enter into certain markets and expansion to certain markets. Kevin talked a lot about China and the growth in China, the timing of some of that, obviously, Brand House in the states, too. So if you look across the board, the E-Commerce side of it has been the strongest of the growth drivers across all the quarters. Really if you look back over the last 4 quarters, E-Commerce has kind of led the way from a growth rate perspective. The retail, although a bit strong, has been below the e-com growth. When you look at just in general in the retail side, you have to remember that still the majority of our revenues on retail are being generated by North American Factory House channel. So although we talk about brand houses both domestically and globally what's going on in retail, the large majority of our retail revenue still sits in that kind of North America Factory House. And we've talked about over the last 6, 7, 8 quarters that planning the slowdown of that growth rate as we open less doors going forward and focused on square footage growth that we plan the growth rate of North America Factory House to decline as we got into 2015 and the future. So that's, to some degree, what you're seeing is the impact of that North America Factory House growth rate, which we plan to kind of come down, still healthy but planned down.

The phrase Connected Fitness had not yet been coined, the day when we would feature a ballerina in a commercial seemed unlikely and Jordan Spieth had only just begun his journey to greatness by taking golf lessons at Brook Hollow Golf Club in Dallas at a tender age of 12 from pro, Cameron McCormick. 
What I knew back then and still believe today is that anything is possible because of the ever evolving power of sports. In just the last few months, I've seen firsthand the value to advertisers who understand that sports is the only thing left that viewers insist on watching live, like the emotion of 80,000 fans still in Twickenham Stadium including Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, and his Royal Highness, Prince Harry of Wales, on a fall Saturday in London to watch England take on Wales in the Rugby World Cup, while 4,000 miles away, another 80,000 were watching Notre Dame Football in South Bend. More than 10,000 fans lining up in Manila to get a glimpse of the NBA's most valuable player, Stephen Curry. The power of sports and its ability to transcend generations, technologies and trends is what makes other industries envious of the business that we are in. 
The power of sports is the engine that has fueled growth from day 1 and the reason for our confidence in the future. It is the foundation behind our doing business in just 4 countries in 2005 to now more than 60 today; growing our retail footprint from a single UA website and 4 domestic Factory House outlet stores in 2005 to now 24 global E-Commerce sites and more than 300 UA-owned retail destinations and partner doors around the world; building our team from around 600 employees in 2005 to more than 11,000 today; going from not producing a single shoe in 2005 to approximately 30 million pairs in 2015; reporting 22 consecutive quarters of 20-plus percent revenue growth and 24 straight quarters of 20-plus percent revenue growth in our largest category, apparel; achieving our first $1 billion revenue quarter; saying confidently we're going to double our revenues to $7.5 billion by 2018; and our stock price appreciating more than 2,800% from our IPO price compared to roughly 60% for the S&P 500. 
It has been a great 10 years of public company and we've learned a lot during this time, but our focus remains the same and that is unlocking the equity we have created to continue to build the world's most important sports and fitness brand. To do that, we will continue to invest and we will do so in a prudent way that has driven our results over this past 10 years. 
At our Investor Day here in Baltimore last month, we spoke to the diversity of these investments. We are focused on 3 key areas where we are confident the return our investment will be increasingly evident as our business continues to grow globally. 
The first area is our core business including sports marketing assets, brand marketing, supply chain, investing in inventory to help us meet the unparalleled demand for the Under Armour brand. The second area is our growth drivers like international where we grew the business 69% year-to-date and footwear were we posted a third quarter growth rate of 61% and continue to invest in world-class talent. And finally are the new opportunities like local manufacturing, sportswear and Connected Fitness that may not meaningfully impact our top line results in the short term, but will bring a new dimension to our model and create new competencies within our organization in the years to come. 
Starting with our core business. We continue to find assets that are a fit with our brand, the most recent example being 2 weeks ago. We announced a new long-term partnership with the University of Wisconsin. It takes one trip to Madison, Wisconsin on a football Saturday to understand the value of college assets and the marketing landscape where more than 80,000 people show up to cheer on the team wearing our brand, where one's loyalty is literally worn on their sleeve. Take for example, 2 historic rivals finding common ground through their outfitter and donning the same baselayer T-shirt for a football game, as our 2 partners, Notre Dame and the United States Naval Academy, did just 2 weeks ago in the name of respect for one another. We are not just  clothing athletes, we are telling stories. We are tapping into the emotion that is tied to the power of sport and we are giving them an authentic way to display their passion. 
We also talked at our Investor Day about our ongoing work with SAP. The vision here is a single-user database that combines the traditional consumer purchasing habit information with Under Armour's additional insights gained through our Connected Fitness platform. This work can be categorized into 2 main areas: architecting the future to create a business platform that will scale our organization and sustain our global growth and developing the consumer insight engine that will use data to drive this business to $7.5 billion and beyond. Our increased insights into the consumer will empower us with better information to make better business decisions to build better products while helping athletes make better choices in their own personal, health and fitness and, ultimately, enriching their lives. 
The second big area of investment is in our growth drivers. They are the same 5 that we talked about since our IPO: men's apparel, women's apparel, footwear, international and Direct-to-Consumer. And our strategy, which also remains the same today is simply to make women's larger than men's, to make footwear larger than apparel as a whole then sell that product country by country around the globe. And where we don't find an appropriate redistribution, augment that with our own Direct-to-Consumer E-Commerce and retail channels. And the one thing we will never forget to do and is written on the whiteboards in my office is don't forget to sell shirts and shoes. 
So let's start talking about footwear. The momentum that you see and read about around our footwear business is the result of the investments we've made starting back even before our IPO. But as we often say around here, we are just getting started. To give some perspective, we will produce 30 million pairs of shoes this year compared to our competition that produces around 0.5 billion pairs each year. This demonstrates the miles of runway in front of us for growth in this one category alone. We've already have seen a return on our investments in footwear through the 98%-plus sell-throughs for the Curry signature footwear line. We are incredibly excited for the Curry Two, which becomes globally available at retail this Saturday and was first unveiled by Stephen Curry during the road show tour of Asia last month. To support this launch, Stephen and Jamie Foxx have teamed up once again in a new digital campaign titled Flash, which was created by award-winning agency Droga5, and is available now for viewing across all our social platforms. 
Additional returns have come from the SpeedForm platform who have been tripling in revenue year-to-date, our Highlight football cleats, earning the #1 spot in the marketplace for the third straight year and new breakthrough innovations like the Fat Tire shoe, which launched in May and continues to disrupt the market and earn high praise including Gear of the Show at the 2015 winter Outdoor Retailer trade show.
Looking ahead to 2016, we plan to leverage our relationship with Jordan Spieth, the recently crowned PGA Tour player of the year by introducing our golf footwear brand, much like we did with our basketball footwear brand through NBA MVP Stephen Curry. You also will see a much deeper concerted effort to put resources into women's footwear as we brought in the depth of talent to help support this growing area of our business. 
As I said earlier, the third area of investment for us, to unlock the power of sports and new parts of our business like local manufacturing, sportswear and Connected Fitness. We unveiled our plans for Project Glory, our local-for-local manufacturing at Investor Day, but let me refresh you on how this investment will change the game for us and for the world. State-of-the-art footwear and apparel manufacturing facilities haven't modernized like other industries with end-to-end upwards of 150 people being needed to build a single product like a shoe. We know there's a better way. And through our SpeedForm Footwear platform and the innovative manufacturing approach that we took there, we've been able to reduce the number of human touches up to 30% and we believe there is plenty of runway left. So we see an opportunity to innovate the process, increasing our speed to market by introducing local-for-local manufacturing that will produce better product globally, products as great as our brand, in the most efficient way possible.
In 2016, we'll open our physical space for Project Glory, which we will call our Lighthouse. The lighthouse will be an advanced manufacturing innovation hub located right here in Baltimore. It will commercialize new, enabling technologies and processes that will first be integrated into our existing supply chain by our current partners before ultimately being rolled out by those same partners in new facilities around the world, changing the dynamics of speed to market, pricing, costing and labor, made in the U.S. for the U.S. market, made in Brazil for the Brazilian market and so on. Being an innovative company means not only bringing innovation into everything we make, but also into how we create better product more efficiently.
Also at Investor Day, we revealed our plans for a new category for Under Armour, sportswear. We will answer the call from our consumer for product that can be worn outside of the gym, court, pitch or field, delivering the same promise of functionality in form, fit and performance that they have come to expect from Under Armour. This category expands our vision of empowering all athletes on and off the sporting field. 
Our gateway to an engaged consumer, which will allow us to emerge in new categories such as sportswear, is Connected Fitness. As we move from changing the layout, we stress to changing the way they live, we are becoming part of the athlete's life 24/7. From sleep and activity to fitness and nutrition, we are directly interacting with our consumer, turning their data into a call to action in support of our mission to make all athletes better. This type of insight we've come to rely on in other areas of our lives such as our personal finances or the performances of our cars is now finally available for our own health. I look forward to sharing with you more on how we will leverage this opportunity with some very exciting announcements to come at CES in early January 2016.
We believe Connected Fitness will enrich the lives of our consumer and we also believe it will help inform us to make better decisions on behalf of our consumer. The information derived from our Connected Fitness platform delivers deep algorithmic capabilities that create a highly interactive relationship with our consumers, making it possible to engage with them in a more personal and relevant way as individuals. World-renowned adviser and best-selling author, Ram Charan, believes companies with these mathematical capabilities for personalization, companies he calls math houses, possess a huge advantage over companies that don't have these capabilities even if they have been highly successful in the past. Companies that will experience difficulty keeping up with a math house are referred to as a legacy company. A legacy company still lives in the era of mass production and mass markets with the customer experience and delivered second or thirdhand. A math house uses data to shorten the distance between a brand and the consumer. Today, the information we gain through the more than 150 million Connected Fitness registered users, including now, updated from Investor Day 6.5 billion foods logged and over 1.5 billion workouts logged just year-to-date across our 4 platforms, combined with the global point of sale, E-Commerce and transactional data from our partners has firmly secured or status as the math house of the health, fitness and nutrition industry. And we believe, as Ram had said, any organization that has not a math house now or is unable to become one soon is already a legacy company. 
The hidden benefit in entering these new spaces like Connected Fitness and sportswear are the organizational competencies that we gain as we build up these businesses. We are a team that adapts well whether it's moving from U.S. to global, apparel to footwear, men's to women's or wholesale to Direct-to-Consumer.
The theme of my presentation at Investor Day was based around a piece of advice given to me by former Navy Seal and Under Armour Director, Admiral Eric Olson. His advice was simply that when a map is different from the terrain, I would always tell my soldiers to go with the terrain. Led by our world-class leadership team, we continue to demonstrate our deep expertise in going with the terrain to evolve with the upwards and downwards strength we will inevitably see through any business cycle. Our 10 years now of both 30% top and equally 30% bottom line growth established since our IPO and our healthy, strong shirts and shoes business give us great confidence for the future and our Connected Fitness math house, which will empower us to understand the consumer at a higher level to help shape our cultural approach to continue to innovate and tap into the power of sports for the next 10 years and beyond. We are just getting started.

I'd now like to spend some time reviewing our third quarter results followed by our updated outlook for 2015 and our preliminary thoughts on 2016. Our net revenues for the third quarter of 2015 increased 28% to $1.2 billion. On a currency",1909,"Thanks, Kevin. I'd now like to spend some time reviewing our third quarter results followed by our updated outlook for 2015 and our preliminary thoughts on 2016. 
Our net revenues for the third quarter of 2015 increased 28% to $1.2 billion. On a currency-neutral basis, net revenues increased 31% for the period. 
Within our product categories, we grew apparel net revenues 23% to $866 million compared to $705 million in the prior year's quarter. From a product perspective, our new Armour Baselayer and expanded innovation platforms like Storm and ColdGear Infrared were key stories during the third quarter. On sports categories, we saw significant growth in golf and outdoor. 
Third quarter footwear net revenues increased 61% to $196 million from $122 million the prior year. Our strength in footwear remains broad based including our largest categories of running and basketball and extending to some of our newer categories such as hiking and global football. Key products included our latest addition to the SpeedForm platform with the SpeedForm Fortis running shoe as well as additional Curry One basketball styles ahead of the Curry Two launch this weekend.
Our accessories net revenues during the third quarter increased 22% to $104 million from $85 million last year, primarily driven by strong consumer demand for our line of bags. 
Our global Direct-to-Consumer net revenues increased 28% for the quarter, representing approximately 26% of net revenues. We continue to be encouraged by the success we are seeing with our 2015 Brand House openings. From a global standpoint, we ended the third quarter with 173 owned stores including 144 Factory House stores and 29 Brand House stores.
In E-Commerce, we launched 6 new country websites during the quarter, bringing our total to 24 global sites. We continue to utilize more targeted effective communication to our consumers and traffic remained strong benefiting from the remarkable 2015 success of our sports marketing assets. While very early in its evolution, we are also encouraged by some of our efforts to generate traffic to our E-Commerce sites from our Connected Fitness community.
Looking at our regions, North America net revenues increased 25% to $1.1 billion in the third quarter compared to $848 million in the prior year's quarter. On a currency-neutral basis, North America net revenues increased 26% based primarily on the drivers I just highlighted.
International net revenues increased 52% to $130 million in the third quarter and represented 11% of total net revenues. On a currency-neutral basis, international net revenues increased 68% for the period. In the EMEA region, we remained focus on core markets with our largest 2 countries, the U.K. and Germany, contributing the strongest growth during the period. Our E-Commerce strategy has also played a key role in broadening our reach and awareness in the regions as we launched 9 new local sites year-to-date. In Asia Pacific, the growth of our own DTC, combined with partner store expansion, continues to drive our business. The recent Stephen Curry tour and opening of our largest international Brand House in Shanghai have helped drive strong demand for our brand. And in Latin America, we continue to see balanced growth throughout the region following our market entry into many of these countries during 2014.
Moving on to margins. Third quarter gross margins contracted 80 basis points to 48.8% compared to 49.6% in the prior year's period. The following factors were the primary drivers during the quarter: first, the continued strength of the U.S. dollar negatively impacted gross margins by approximately 90 basis points versus the prior year; second, sales mix negatively impacted gross margin by approximately 50 basis points in the third quarter versus the primary -- prior year, primarily driven by the continued strong performance of our footwear business; also, on our ongoing focus to better flow our products to service our business resulted in higher freight expenses, which negatively impacted gross margin by approximately 20 basis points in the quarter versus the prior year. Partially offsetting these margin pressures, we continued to see favorable product margins in both our North America and international businesses, which benefited gross margin by approximately 90 basis points in the third quarter.
Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues delevered 60 basis points to 34.6% in the third quarter of 2015 from 34% in the prior year's period. SG&A details for the third quarter are as follows: marketing costs increased to 10.7% of net revenues for the quarter from 10.6% in the prior year period, reflecting higher marketing associated with our Connected Fitness business and our most recent global marketing campaigns for training and global football; other SG&A costs increased to 23.9% of net revenues for the quarter from 23.4% in the prior year, driven primarily by our Connected Fitness business and investments in our global Brand House strategy. 
Operating income for the third quarter increased 17% to $171 million compared with $146 million in the prior year period. 
Interest and other expense from the third quarter increased to $7 million compared with $5 million in the prior period, primarily reflecting increased interest expense associated with the financing of our Connected Fitness acquisitions.
Our third quarter tax rate of 38.8% was unfavorable to the 36.9% rate last year, primarily driven by nondeductible costs associated with our Connected Fitness acquisitions as well as increased losses in our newer Latin American businesses, partially driven by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. 
Our third quarter net income increased 13% to $100 million compared to $89 million in the prior year period while our diluted earnings per share increased to $0.45 from $0.41 in the prior year's period.
On the balance sheet, total cash and cash equivalents for the quarter decreased 36% to $159 million compared with $249 million at September 30, 2014. Inventory for the quarter increased 36% to $867 million compared to $637 million at September 30, 2014. Total debt increased to $905 million as compared to $192 million at September 30, 2014, primarily reflecting the financing of our Connected Fitness acquisition. 
Looking at our cash flows. Our investment and capital expenditures was $71 million for the third quarter compared to $26 million in the prior year's period, driven primarily by our investments in our global headquarters in Baltimore and our global retail strategy. 
Now moving on to our updated 2015 guidance. Based on current visibility, we expect 2015 net revenues of approximately $3.91 billion, representing growth of 27%, and 2015 operating income of approximately $408 million, representing growth of 15%. As we have highlighted on our last earnings call in July and during our recent Investor Day, we believe the decisions we make on where, when and how much we invest are a key driver of our success to date and it is our job to deliver both near- and long-term value while simultaneously investing in our growth.
In a year, we have seen unprecedented success from our athletes on a global scale. We believe the investments we are making today will help fuel our growth for years to come. As Kevin mentioned earlier, we have abundant opportunities that we are investing in to drive our long-term top line growth. With so many areas that require investment, we continue to be focused on driving operating income dollars and not necessarily operating margin.
This is why we have now raised our 2015 net revenues guidance by [indiscernible] with $150 million since January while at the same time maintaining the high end of our operating income target at $408 million. We are committed to a certain level of investment back into our business and we will continue to be opportunistic if and when possible during the fourth quarter.
As a reminder, our operating income guidance continues to include the dilutive impact of the Connected Fitness acquisitions consisting of onetime transaction costs in the first quarter, operating losses from these businesses and noncash amortization charges of the intangible assets generated from the acquisition.
Below operating results, we continue to expect a full year effective tax rate of approximately 41% compared to 39.2% in the prior year, primarily given the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, which continued to negatively impact our international profitability. 
So now I'd like to add some additional color on several items pertaining to the fourth quarter, starting with revenues. We believe we are well positioned to execute heading into the holidays as our investments in service are paying off in fresher, cleaner assortments across our distribution. As we expand our innovation stories like ColdGear Infrared and Storm across our sports categories, we also believe we are more diversified in our solutions for the athlete. Supported by the launch of Curry Two basketball shoes, we expect footwear growth will continue to outpace the growth rate for our overall business during the fourth quarter.
Our gross margin rate is now expected to decline approximately 100 basis points during the fourth quarter. Some of the same themes impacting our business the past few quarters will extend into the fourth quarter including pressure from the continued strength of the U.S. dollar, higher freight costs and a higher mix of footwear revenues. While higher than planned, the latter 2 factors are also key in our increased top line guidance for the year. In addition to these factors, driven by the recent higher growth rates in our footwear business, we are now planning higher excess footwear liquidation sales as part of our normal inventory management process, which will negatively impact gross margins in the fourth quarter. Partially offsetting these factors, we anticipate that we will continue to see improvements in our product margins.
In SG&A, we expect a lower rate of spend for the fourth quarter due to the timing of marketing spend while other SG&A is expected to grow approximately in line with our net revenues growth as we continue with our planned investments in the areas for our long-term growth including Connected Fitness, international and footwear. Also, as I mentioned earlier, we will remain opportunistic in investing incremental dollars during the fourth quarter in the event of more favorable and planned net revenues or gross margin rate. 
Switching over to inventory. As we outlined at our Investor Day, over the next few quarters, we are focused on delivering our products to our consumers more timely, specifically on key seasonal floor set dates. We anticipate this will result in elevated inventory growth rates over this period to flow product earlier. 
Finally, on capital expenditures. Based on our current visibility, we are now planning capital expenditures in the range of $350 million to $360 million for 2015 including approximately $140 million allocated across 3 areas to support long-term growth with our new domestic distribution center, the expansion of our corporate headquarters in Baltimore and initial investments in our new and expanded SAP platform. In addition, we have accelerated investments in key areas to drive revenue growth including the rollout of our global retail strategy and new E-Commerce sites. 
Before we turn it over to Q&A, I would also like to provide you with our preliminary outlook for 2016. Based on our current visibility, we are planning 2016 net revenues to grow at approximately 25% and 2016 operating income to grow at approximately 23%. Both of these metrics are in line with our long-term growth targets we established at our Investor Day last month.
We'll provide further color on 2016 during our earnings call in January. With that, let's turn it over to questions. Operator?"

And the second question, I know in your Investor Day and then today again you've mentioned the sportswear opportunity. Could you just give us a little more color around how Under Armour thinks about that huge opportunity in terms of partners and product categories or any insight you could give us?"

So first of all, internationally, we're really excited. We've crossed 11% of the total mix for the company, which is a big deal for us. It's been a long time coming.

We've crossed 11% of the total mix for the company, which is a big deal for us. It's been a long time coming. And becoming global is something you can't just say it, you actually have to act on it. I think it was really 2006 we launched our first shops in Europe. 2010, we opened our first Brand House with 1,000-square foot store in Shanghai. And it has been a lot of learnings and a lot of adjustment. It's not as easy as just opening stores, but it's into the product, it's into the localized fit, it's into localized merchandising. It's into the execution, the distribution, the manufacturing, so there are a lot of pieces and China is a great lesson for that. I haven't given these numbers publicly, but I think it's instructive of just sort of what our growth has been in China. So in 2012, for instance, I said we launched our first store at 1,000 square feet and it's incredibly successful. We were doing over $1 million of 1,000 square feet out of one store in Shanghai. We didn't have the right leadership when we went in there and we sort of toiled around for the next couple of years. By the end of 2012, we were doing $3 million of sales in China. We took somebody who was one of our -- I introduced to you a guy named Kevin Eskridge who's now running global merchandising for us, but I pulled him out of our outdoor group and sent him and his family to Shanghai. And the results that we had were the business went from $3 million in '12 to $7 million in '13 to roughly $30 million in 2014. The current plan this year is just over $75 million for '15. And as we look forward to 2016, that number is north of $150 million today. So we're incredibly bullish that the hockey stick approach has really begun to lay in for us. We're excited about what that's going to mean. In China, though, one thing we did, I think, as a nod to the market was our -- the visit that I did with the Curry with the Stephen Curry tour of 5 cities in 5 days. We actually launched the shoe that we're launching this Saturday globally. We launched it exclusively in China back at that tour. So China is very important to make sure that you show and demonstrate great respect, I think, for the market. And hopefully, it's just another sign of the things we're doing there in addition to opening our largest international Brand House store, 15,000 square feet, on Weihai Lu Road in one of the great shopping districts in downtown Shanghai. So we see great growth coming from there and it speaks to some of -- one of the numbers that I mentioned was we'll have more than 300 stores globally. I think it's close to 100 stores or so we'll be opening this year. Roughly 3/4 of the stores are actually going to be in China. So we see great opportunity there. It's going to be our second-largest controlled market and growing exponentially. The 30 stores that we opened in the third quarter, including 18 in September alone including the Weihai Lu Road, then E-Commerce revenues in the third quarter nearly equal the total number of 2014 business that we had in China. So a lot of big things and exciting things happening for us there. Let me jump on sports categories for you for a second because I think it's important and it's a good barometer, I think, on how our business is moving. As we outlined at Investor Day, we expect to move to 9 specific sports categories: men's training, women's training, studio running, outdoor, golf, basketball, team sports, global football and sportswear. Sportswear is one of those quiet discussions that we have, and we outlined at Investor Day the size and importance that sportswear represents for our current competitors. So collectively, our competition has roughly $50 billion in revenues, 25% of which they claim publicly derived specifically from sportswear. That's basically a $12.5 billion opportunity as we look at it. Today, we're competing with effectively 0. We feel like we've got the right leader in someone who came from this industry, worked for one of our chief competitors and responsible for helping to build out their sportswear category in Ben Pruess. And Ben is someone who is a process. I want to set people's expectations on sportswear at the same time. We issued $7.5 billion as our Investor Day goal for 2018. Sportswear isn't heavily considered in that. It's going to take time. It's going to take build. And I think understanding what we're going to need to do from an investment standpoint, which is why I think we've been so specific as Brad and I have been really hammering down the fact that while we expect to -- we can really grow and amp up our top line revenue, we want to be prudent with what we're doing on the bottom line. But this growth, this 25% CAGR that we've committed to, it will come at a price and that price is a continuing investment. And I think it's measured investment at the same time. And our 10-year track record of, I think, making appropriate -- the right investments is something that gives us great confidence that these are categories are going to pay dividends for investors in the future, but it's the right thing for us to do at the time and it's certainly our moment in time to make it happen"

Yes, definitely with footwear growing at the rate it's growing and obviously ASPs in footwear are much higher than apparel, that's part of the driver behind inventory growth. But probably the bigger driver of what we're doing right now year-over-year, specifically in Q3 and as we look into Q4, is more gauged around just the flow of inventory. So if you recall, looking back a year ago or so or maybe a little bit more than a year ago, we talked about some of the challenges that we had in flowing product on time for things like back-to-school and holiday. And we really got focused this year as we came into 2015 on making sure, to some degree at all costs almost, that we were going to flow product on time and we called out freight costs, specifically airfreight, as an impact to gross margins this year to do that. So that's probably the bigger driver. What you're seeing in inventory growth rate is we're really focused on hitting key floor set dates. So when you look at things like getting into the holidays of this year, making sure that product is flowing and ready to go, it's increasing our Q3 inventory levels. When you look at starting to set the floors right at the beginning of next year, in spring '16, what you're going to see is earlier flow of product in the back half of this year specifically as you get close to the end of this year. So as I talked about at Investor Day, when you kind of look at year-over-year growth rates and inventory, that's the bigger driver of this, is the flow of product. Obviously, we grew a little bit higher than revenue here in Q3. And I think what you'll see is even a little bit more so in Q4 as we're really focused on getting product out on the floor on time for our spring floor sets. That should start to normalize a little bit as we work through 2016 because we start to get into a comparison of that focus we had in 2015 to flow product better to. So as you start working through Q1 and Q2 of '16, you should start to normalize that and get that more in line with revenue growth."

I mean, we used that theme at Investor Day about the math and the terrain and I think we've demonstrated really great expertise in being able to adjust with the differing terrain. There's going to be many trends. We saw a lot of them the last 10 years. We're anticipating probably something similar in the next decade, or more importantly, anticipating what we haven't even thought about yet. But I think investments are important and a great way to talk about our team. Our core pillars we talk about is product story, service and team, and team obviously being the most important thing. There's a couple of places that I think are illustrative of where we have, and frankly, where we now we need to be more aggressive. Our women's business is a great example of that. Women's footwear is something that as recent as a year ago we had just a handful of people or less than that, really people treating women's footwear as a part-time job. And where, if you compare that to others in our industry, there's not dozens, there's hundreds of people working on these themes and so the investments that we're making from a few different sides are really important. I speak about being opportunistic with our investment in general and there's a few places that we think that we need to invest. First of all, our core business, investing in areas like marketing, supply chain and technology. And again, along with this, Camilo, it all comes down to team and people. But we do see that we are at this unique moment in time and it's the right time for us because of the year we have with some of our assets and athletes is things like what should we be doing from our marketing and our storytelling standpoint, from a supply chain about being a better customer and having the right team. Because right now we're okay, but we're still not level loading our factories the way that we could with the volumes that we're driving and being better with the best factories. And then when we're in the best factories, driving the A teams in those factories and having the best people in the factories working on our business. In technology, it's things like laying out the vision, as I mentioned earlier, with SAP about the single view of the consumer. Growth drivers for us, our existing growth drivers, I mentioned they're the same as they were -- the 5 growth drivers are the same as they were at our IPO, men's, women's, footwear, international and Direct-to-Consumer. I mean, footwear and international are places where I think we've done a great job. As you look at the growth we have in the footwear, we had 61% growth quarter, and in international we had a 69% growth quarter and 85% in constant currency basis. And there are things that we weren't getting a lot of credit for a few years ago when we told you we were spending money in these categories. So I think you're starting to see them really come to life. We're also investing in talent and people where, again, I think making sure that, A, there's a broad canvas, but the canvas isn't too wide either. We feel comfortable about the investments we're making because beyond our own growth drivers, there are new areas for you like Connected Fitness, sportswear, which I just spoke about, and again doubling down on some of the infrastructure we have. But Connected Fitness is one of those things that we're proud and I think we're bullish on the returns that we're beginning to see come back from it. And as we gave that bogey of $200 million we put out there for 2018, the real upside is something like Connected Fitness' the collective dollars it will help grow across all our existing growth drivers as well as the new ones that we're investing in and the dollars to come. But I feel we've done a good job. I just believe that we're in the process of hiring. I think on our website right now, there's over 350 jobs or something to that effect that we're looking for. There's -- obviously, there's a few key executive positions that we're looking to fill, and as Brad and I have been working through the transition heading to February, we've gotten a great response for this position. And we expect to have an A player in someone that's been there, done that and really has seen what it's like as we look to cross the $7.5 billion-plus range. So we're looking to bring experts and I think that's a unique thing about where we are today versus where we were even just a couple of years ago. We have a great attraction. I think this company is custom fit for some real professionals that would be excited by growth."

So last couple of years, it has been -- we've called out like a 1% to 2% growth rate potential in weather. I think every year, it probably becomes less impactful to us because of the diversification of our product and then also in our regions, too, on an international basis. So yes, I mean, there's a little bit of an impact there, but it's not tremendously significant. And obviously, as we look at our guidance for the fourth quarter, we're not anticipating any dramatic change in weather year-over-year either way in our guidance."

Look, it's the second warmest September, I think, on record that came out recently and I think there's a lot of conversation around it, but we're incredibly proud of the ability to still post a 28% growth rate in the quarter. And one thing we focus on really is going back 4 or 5 years where we realize how weather-dependent we were as a company with the pretty classic 60-40 split front half versus 40-60 split front half versus back half of the year. I think we've done a good job into many things like this, this quarter, not being so reliant on heavyweight fleece, but focusing more on sort of stylish lightweight fleeces. And we've really worked closely with our partners to create offerings that aren't just relying on big puffer jackets that are sitting in retail stores that if it doesn't snow aren't going to sell. So definitely, it's a work in process, but weather-proofing our business has been a real focus for our company and I think we're pretty proud of how we position versus maybe other people in our world."

It's like we've had some tremendous growth rates in footwear the last few quarters in the 40s, 50s and now 60s, 61% this quarter. So this is just the normal process of managing inventory as you work through selling in and selling through, which both have been very positive for us in the footwear side. You're ultimately always going to be left with some excess inventory in footwear. We've become, over the course of the last few years and this year, too, very focused on getting into the next season very clean on the footwear side. So looking at the excess footwear we had again, which is really just being generated from the tremendous growth and success we've had in footwear in general, we really got focused on getting through some of the footwear liquidation in Q4 and making sure that we were very clean getting into next year. So obviously, as you talk about footwear gross margins, just the regular gross margins of footwear being well below our apparel gross margins, that's also the case on the liquidation side where your footwear liquidation margins are going to be much less than your apparel liquidation side. As far as the avenues and vehicles to liquidate, Factory House obviously is one of them and we have talked about third party in the past also of moving some of our excess inventory through a third party also. Although small in revenue volume, obviously it does impact gross margin."

FX could be -- will be a big part of that year-over-year decline. If you remember, we came into this year talking about FX impacting our margins by about 50 basis points. Now we're up to about an 80 basis points full year impact. So obviously, the FX has worsened during the course of the year. So that's a big driver of it. Again, fourth quarter margins, airfreight, as we really get focused on flowing inventory, that's a little bit of a driver, too, and that's kind of increased during the course of the year as we've got kind of laser focused on better deliveries and better flow of product. Those are the big, big drivers. We talked about the footwear liquidation also being a driver in Q4. We came into this year, on the FX side, probably less prepared than we'll be coming out of the year relative to how we hedge currencies going forward. So we've done a better job during the course of this year offsetting some of the increased pressures on FX. We've built some better competencies in-house from a talent perspective and some better strategies around hedging that we'll continue to increase going forward. So I would expect that in the future, we're more prepared to offset some of those impacts that you're seeing right now. And obviously, as you get into 2016, we're going to start to compare to 2015 FX rates, so you would imagine that there'll be a much more favorable comparison unless something drastically changes in the FX front."

And it's one thing where I think we probably have been dragging a little bit. The women's example that I gave earlier, that's something, which was glaring and really obvious. But look, we've got growth coming from a lot of places. And so until you really turn attention you can focus on it, you're probably a bit vulnerable. So we've made, I think, 6 or 7 hires just in the last 45 days on our women's footwear team, really looking to become robust and build that out. And there's places where we've definitely taken an ROI approach to it where we're going to have the biggest impact. But at the same time, we don't want to apologize for footwear. It's a relatively small number and we also put a 60% number up this quarter, committing to a 40% CAGR through '18. We think there's great growth there and we're going to be the beneficiaries of that. But one thing I want to emphasize to people is that it is 10 years in making shoes for us, but it absolutely takes time. The first category we got into was American football cleats and that was 2006 and it was a big breakthrough and we had high teens, low 20s market share. And since that time, we're now pushing close to a 40% market share in football cleats with our sight set on being #1. And I say it only because it's a category we've been in the longest. And for 10 years in football cleats and 5 years in running shoes, imagine what we're going to look like in running shoes in another 5 years there. So -- but I guess the thing to say is making a great shoe is not as -- or be winning in footwear is not about making one great shoe. There are so many factors that are combined. And just like use of football cleats, when we were successful with the 20% market share, we were basically making shoes for a particular type of athlete. And the speed guys and the guys on the edges of a team weren't the guys that were wearing our product. And the reason we couldn't figure out is why won't they buy our speed shoes, our speed shoes are not good. And the fact is, is that's the kid where basketball is really important to him and he likes wearing the shoe on a football field that he wore on the basketball court. And until we launched a basketball shoe, we couldn't even become relevant there. And until we became relevant in basketball, he wasn't even going to consider us. And so it was about the aesthetic of the shoe, but it's so many factors more than just do you make a good speed cleat as to are you in basketball, do you have an asset like a Stephen Curry that gives the credibility to want to wear the shoe. And then beyond that is when we go to being in the biggest factories. It's not only being in the biggest or the best factories, but it's not having the B, C or D teams in the factories, but get to a point we have the A teams in the factories. And you're not going to get to that point where I mentioned 30 million pairs of shoes versus 0.5 billion to our competition until we have the ability to truly level load and give them the things that they need. And so as we sit here 10 years in, in football cleats in '06, baseball in '07, training shoes in '08, running shoes in '09, basketball shoes in '10, then we stop launching new categories. We're getting there, we're evolving. It just takes a little more time. So we absolutely believe in sort of the head-to-toe hooks that we're heading to. But I'll tell you, at our bones, we believe that we're as entitled as anyone else to be #1 in footwear. And the challenge goes to what I spoke about, about local-for-local manufacturing. We talked about innovation in something like footwear, I don't think our industry has been incredibly innovative at all. When you look and you compare the fact that 20 years ago, the technology that can fit on my fingernail today or in my iPhone or Samsung device it took a mainframe the size of a Greyhound bus just 20 years ago, and today, it's absolutely evolved. In footwear, we make shoes, we make apparel the exact same way we did 80 years ago. So I think finding innovation and finding ways to win is that there's not an individual shoe technology that makes someone innovative. So I think the approach that we have is holistic and will pay absolute dividends. But we are challenging our team to think much bigger. But a few, I think, highlights we have on the footwear side is that obviously basketball is something with Steph. Our basketball business, up over in triple digits, bringing SpeedForm technology to what that's going to mean for us in basketball as well, signing additional athletes, the #7 pick in this year's draft, Emmanuel Mudiay, is one of the breakout young stars this year as well. So doubling down there. Women's, we covered that. Our running business, we've had a great product in SpeedForm, but we're also bringing 6 new running models to market in 2016 including a product we have in the market right now called Fortis, which is our #1 selling shoe in our key sporting goods account. That's $90-ish and doing really well as well as another new -- our first all-knit upper offering in a product called Slingshot, which is doing really well. But across-the-board, outdoor with the Fat Tire shoe I mentioned in my notes earlier; football cleats having the #1 shoe in the market with the Highlight Cleat; soccer, our new Slay Your Next Giant campaign and our asset Memphis Depay, the striker for Manchester United, who's 22 years old and again another next big star; Jordan Spieth on launching golf footwear; our Youth footwear continues to be on fire as well. So there's a lot of sort of individual stories I think that are drawing to the bigger narrative and we haven't connected all the dots, I think, for the consumer yet where I mean the consumer I also mean our customers where we can be a great footwear brand when you walk into a store with an A-Z footwear experience. But I can tell you is that we know what that movie looks like. We've seen it before. And we're being in pros, we've seen it before as well. And it's just a matter of time for us to draw that. But I want to emphasize we think we can be the #1 brand in footwear. And what our team is preparing for is what's the next shoe coming from one of our current competitors. What we're thinking about is what are we going to do if Apple or Samsung decide to make a show, how are we going to answer that. So that's the type of, I think, leapfrog mentality and that moonshot thinking that we're challenging our team with. Let's not fight with where people are today. Let's think about where they're going in the future and what we can do to be great."

But if I could just take a second on our Connected Fitness. Today, more than 150 million athletes continue to add over 100,000 a day throughout 2015 downloading 1 of our 4 apps. I mean, the scale is extraordinary. At Investor Day, we mentioned there were 6 billion foods logged in time. Today, just a few weeks later over 6.5 billion foods logged. Workouts, 1.3 billion is the number we gave you at Investor Day. Today, it's more than 1.5 billion workouts. More than 200 million workouts have occurred just from the last few weeks. So the information we're gaining every day we think is incredible and it's going to continue to enable us to provide the consumer with really relevant information and insights, too. We'd like to use the words, to enrich lives. We think the bigger opportunity, though, is much bigger -- is much broader than $200 million target that we talked about and ultimately is going to help us sell more shirts and shoes. The math house idea, though, the ability to use data and analytics to drive business is something, which is -- I don't even think we've quantified yet. I used the example and I think it's a really good one, that Amazon, how they the credit 40% of their revenues what they call their recommendation engine, and that's basically you just base off of toothpaste. I know if I told you a tube of toothpaste -- 5 weeks ago a toothpaste has a 6-week life cycle and I can ask if you want me to send you a new tube. Not only do we know purchasing issue, but we can tie that to activity to fitness to sleep to nutrition and data and information that our consumers are voluntarily giving to us. And we recognize that as they do that, our job is becoming this destination, this daily dashboard of your health and fitness that we think we can become. And that's all built on trust. And as I've said many times is trust is one of those things that's built in drops and it can be lost in buckets, but we think that we have the credibility at this point and we think with some of the suite of products and apps and devices that we have as we're contemplating looking forward and partners we're looking with those devices to move forward, we've got a large announcement we're looking forward to making at CES in January and we think it's an incredibly exciting space that is just partially contemplated as we look forward. But the one thing that is clear, as excited as we are about our Connected Fitness and how it's going to enable us with this math house to be that much smarter about our overall business, ultimately, what it's going to do is help us sell more shirts and shoes."

The revenue slowed a little bit the last couple of quarters, which implies a slowdown in the same-store sales number, for lack of a better term. Can you help us understand is there -- are there any subtle things going on there we should be aware of? Any timing issues? Is it more on the E-Commerce side where maybe it's slowing a little bit?

So it's been up and down a little bit. A lot of that right now is going to be timing of new market entries on the E-Commerce side globally, retail on the global side to enter into certain markets and expansion to certain markets. Kevin talked a lot about China and the growth in China, the timing of some of that, obviously, Brand House in the States, too. So if you look across-the-board, the E-Commerce side of it has been the strongest of the growth drivers across all the quarters. Really, if you look back over the last 4 quarters, E-Commerce has kind of led the way from a growth rate perspective. The retail, although have been strong, has been below the E-Comm growth. When you look at just in general on the retail side, you have to remember that still the majority of our revenues on retail are being generated by North America Factory House channel. So although we talk about brand Houses Both domestically and globally what's going on in retail, the large majority of our retail revenue still sits in that kind of North America Factory House. And we've talked about over the course of the last 6, 7, 8 quarters that planning the slowdown of that growth rate as we open less doors going forward and focus on square footage growth that we plan the growth rate of North America Factory House to decline as we got into 2015 and the future. So that's, to some degree, what you're seeing is the impact of that North America Factory House growth rate, which we plan to kind of come down. Still healthy, but planned down. That's kind of what you're seeing, I think, from the perspective of some of the growth rates in DTC."

Back in 2005, we were a $281 million company. Compression apparel made up 2/3 of our business. The phrase Connected Fitness had not yet been coined, the day when we would feature a ballerina in a commercial seemed unlikely and Jordan Spieth had only just begun his journey to greatness by taking golf lessons at Brook Hollow Golf Club in Dallas at a tender age of 12 from pro, Cameron McCormick. 
What I knew back then and still believe today is that anything is possible because of the ever evolving power of sports. In just the last few months, I've seen firsthand the value to advertisers who understand that sports is the only thing left that viewers insist on watching live, like the emotion of 80,000 fans filling Twickenham Stadium including Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, and his Royal Highness, Prince Harry of Wales, on a fall Saturday in London to watch England take on Wales in the Rugby World Cup, while 4,000 miles away, another 80,000 were watching Notre Dame Football in South Bend. More than 10,000 fans lining up in Manila to get a glimpse of the NBA's most valuable player, Stephen Curry. The power of sports and its ability to transcend generations, technologies and trends is what makes other industries envious of the business that we are in. 
The power of sports is the engine that has fueled growth from day 1 and the reason for our confidence in the future. It is the foundation behind our doing business in just 4 countries in 2005 to now more than 60 today; growing our retail footprint from a single UA website and 4 domestic Factory House outlet stores in 2005 to now 24 global E-Commerce sites and more than 300 UA-owned retail destinations and partner doors around the world; building our team from around 600 employees in 2005 to more than 11,000 today; going from not producing a single shoe in 2005 to approximately 30 million pairs in 2015; recording 22 consecutive quarters of 20-plus percent revenue growth and 24 straight quarters of 20-plus percent revenue growth in our largest category, apparel; achieving our first $1 billion revenue quarter; saying confidently we're going to double our revenues to $7.5 billion by 2018; and our stock price appreciating more than 2,800% from our IPO price compared to roughly 60% for the S&P 500. 
It has been a great 10 years of public company and we've learned a lot during this time, but our focus remains the same and that is unlocking the equity we have created to continue to build the world's most important sports and fitness brand. To do that, we will continue to invest and we will do so in a prudent way that has driven our results over this past 10 years. 
At our Investor Day here in Baltimore last month, we spoke to the diversity of these investments. We are focused on 3 key areas where we are confident the return our investment will be increasingly evident as our business continues to grow globally. 
The first area is our core business including sports marketing assets, brand marketing, supply chain, investing in inventory to help us meet the unparalleled demand for the Under Armour brand. The second area is our growth drivers like international where we grew the business 69% year-to-date and footwear were we posted a third quarter growth rate of 61% and continue to invest in world-class talent. And finally are the new opportunities like local manufacturing, sportswear and Connected Fitness that may not meaningfully impact our top line results in the short term, but will bring a new dimension to our model and create new competencies within our organization in the years to come. 
Starting with our core business. We continue to find assets that are a fit with our brand, the most recent example being 2 weeks ago. We announced a new long-term partnership with the University of Wisconsin. It takes one trip to Madison, Wisconsin on a football Saturday to understand the value of college assets and the marketing landscape where more than 80,000 people show up to cheer on the team wearing our brand, where one's loyalty is literally worn on their sleeve. Take for example, 2 historic rivals finding common ground through their outfitter and donning the same baselayer T-shirt for a football game, as our 2 partners, Notre Dame and the United States Naval Academy, did just 2 weeks ago in the name of respect for one another. We are not just clothing athletes, we are telling stories. We are tapping into the emotion that is tied to the power of sport and we are giving them an authentic way to display their passion. 
We also talked at our Investor Day about our ongoing work with SAP. The vision here is a single-user database that combines the traditional consumer purchasing habit information with Under Armour's additional insights gained through our Connected Fitness platform. This work can be categorized into 2 main areas: architecting the future to create a business platform that will scale our organization and sustain our global growth and developing the Consumer Insight Engine that will use data to drive this business to $7.5 billion and beyond. Our increased insights into the consumer will empower us with better information to make better business decisions to build better products while helping athletes make better choices in their own personal, health and fitness and, ultimately, enriching their lives. 
The second big area of investment is in our growth drivers. They are the same 5 that we talked about since our IPO: men's apparel, women's apparel, footwear, international and Direct-to-Consumer. And our strategy, which also remains the same today is simply to make women's larger than men's, to make footwear larger than apparel as a whole then sell that product country by country around the globe. And where we don't find an appropriate redistribution, augment that with our own Direct-to-Consumer E-Commerce and retail channels. And the one thing we will never forget to do and is written on the whiteboards in my office is don't forget to sell shirts and shoes. 
So let's start talking about footwear. The momentum that you see and read about around our footwear business is the result of the investments we've made starting back even before our IPO. But as we often say around here, we are just getting started. To give some perspective, we will produce 30 million pairs of shoes this year compared to our competition that produces around 0.5 billion pairs each year. This demonstrates the miles of runway in front of us for growth in this one category alone. We've already have seen a return on our investments in footwear through the 98%-plus sell-throughs for the Curry signature footwear line. We are incredibly excited for the Curry Two, which becomes globally available at retail this Saturday and was first unveiled by Stephen Curry during the road show tour of Asia last month. To support this launch, Stephen and Jamie Foxx have teamed up once again in a new digital campaign titled Flash, which was created by award-winning agency Droga5, and is available now for viewing across all our social platforms. 
Additional returns have come from the SpeedForm platform who have been tripling in revenue year-to-date, our Highlight football cleats, earning the #1 spot in the marketplace for the third straight year and new breakthrough innovations like the Fat Tire shoe, which launched in May and continues to disrupt the market and earn high praise including Gear of the Show at the 2015 winter Outdoor Retailer trade show.
Looking ahead to 2016, we plan to leverage our relationship with Jordan Spieth, the recently crowned PGA Tour player of the year by introducing our golf footwear brand, much like we did with our basketball footwear brand through NBA MVP Stephen Curry. You also will see a much deeper concerted effort to put resources into women's footwear as we brought in the depth of talent to help support this growing area of our business. 
As I said earlier, the third area of investment for us, to unlock the power of sports and new parts of our business like local manufacturing, sportswear and Connected Fitness. We unveiled our plans for Project Glory, our local-for-local manufacturing at Investor Day, but let me refresh you on how this investment will change the game for us and for the world. State-of-the-art footwear and apparel manufacturing facilities haven't modernized like other industries with end-to-end upwards of 150 people being needed to build a single product like a shoe. We know there's a better way. And through our SpeedForm Footwear platform and the innovative manufacturing approach that we took there, we've been able to reduce the number of human touches up to 30% and we believe there is plenty of runway left. So we see an opportunity to innovate the process, increasing our speed to market by introducing local-for-local manufacturing that will produce better product globally, products as great as our brand, in the most efficient way possible.
In 2016, we'll open our physical space for Project Glory, which we will call our Lighthouse. The Lighthouse will be an advanced manufacturing innovation hub located right here in Baltimore. It will commercialize new, enabling technologies and processes that will first be integrated into our existing supply chain by our current partners before ultimately being rolled out by those same partners in new facilities around the world, changing the dynamics of speed to market, pricing, costing and labor, made in the U.S. for the U.S. market, made in Brazil for the Brazilian market and so on. Being an innovative company means not only bringing innovation into everything we make, but also into how we create better product more efficiently.
Also at Investor Day, we revealed our plans for a new category for Under Armour, sportswear. We will answer the call from our consumer for product that can be worn outside of the gym, court, pitch or field, delivering the same promise of functionality in form, fit and performance that they have come to expect from Under Armour. This category expands our vision of empowering all athletes on and off the sporting field. 
Our gateway to an engaged consumer, which will allow us to enter into new categories such as sportswear, is Connected Fitness. As we move from changing the way athletes dress to changing the way they live, we are becoming part of the athlete's life 24/7. From sleep and activity to fitness and nutrition, we are directly interacting with our consumer, turning their data into a call to action in support of our mission to make all athletes better. This type of insight we've come to rely on in other areas of our lives such as our personal finances or the performances of our cars is now finally available for our own health. I look forward to sharing with you more on how we will leverage this opportunity with some very exciting announcements to come at CES in early January 2016.
We believe Connected Fitness will enrich the lives of our consumer and we also believe it will help inform us to make better decisions on behalf of our consumer. The information derived from our Connected Fitness platform delivers deep algorithmic capabilities that create a highly interactive relationship with our consumers, making it possible to engage with them in a more personal and relevant way as individuals. World-renowned adviser and best-selling author, Ram Charan, believes companies with these mathematical capabilities for personalization, companies he calls math houses, possess a huge advantage over companies that don't have these capabilities even if they have been highly successful in the past. 
Companies that will experience difficulty keeping up with a math house are referred to as a legacy company. A legacy company still lives in the era of mass production and mass markets with the customer experience and delivered second or thirdhand. A math house uses data to shorten the distance between a brand and the consumer. Today, the information we gain through the more than 150 million Connected Fitness registered users, including now, updated from Investor Day 6.5 billion foods logged and over 1.5 billion workouts logged just year-to-date across our 4 platforms, combined with the global point of sale, E-Commerce and transactional data from our partners has firmly secured or status as the math house of the health, fitness and nutrition industry. And we believe, as Ram had said, any organization that has not a math house now or is unable to become one soon is already a legacy company. 
The hidden benefit in entering these new spaces like Connected Fitness and sportswear are the organizational competencies that we gain as we build up these businesses. We are a team that adapts well whether it's moving from U.S. to global, apparel to footwear, men's to women's or wholesale to Direct-to-Consumer.
The theme of my presentation at Investor Day was based around a piece of advice given to me by former Navy Seal and Under Armour Director, Admiral Eric Olson. His advice was simply that when a map is different from the terrain, I would always tell my soldiers to go with the terrain. Led by our world-class leadership team, we continue to demonstrate our deep expertise in going with the terrain to evolve with the upwards and downwards trends we will inevitably see through any business cycle. 
Our 10 years now of both 30% top and equally 30% bottom line growth established since our IPO and our healthy, strong shirts and shoes business give us great confidence for the future and our Connected Fitness math house, which will empower us to understand the consumer at a higher level to help shape our cultural approach to continue to innovate and tap into the power of sports for the next 10 years and beyond. We are just getting started.

I'd now like to spend some time reviewing our third quarter results followed by our updated outlook for 2015 and our preliminary thoughts on 2016. Our net revenues for the third quarter of 2015 increased 28% to $1.2 billion. On a currency",1910,"Thanks, Kevin. I'd now like to spend some time reviewing our third quarter results followed by our updated outlook for 2015 and our preliminary thoughts on 2016. 
Our net revenues for the third quarter of 2015 increased 28% to $1.2 billion. On a currency-neutral basis, net revenues increased 31% for the period. 
Within our product categories, we grew apparel net revenues 23% to $866 million compared to $705 million in the prior year's quarter. From a product perspective, our new Armour Baselayer and expanded innovation platforms like Storm and ColdGear Infrared were key stories during the third quarter. On sports categories, we saw significant growth in golf and outdoor. 
Third quarter footwear net revenues increased 61% to $196 million from $122 million the prior year. Our strength in footwear remains broad based including our largest categories of running and basketball and extending to some of our newer categories such as hiking and global football. Key products included our latest addition to the SpeedForm platform with the SpeedForm Fortis running shoe as well as additional Curry One basketball styles ahead of the Curry Two launch this weekend.
Our accessories net revenues during the third quarter increased 22% to $104 million from $85 million last year, primarily driven by strong consumer demand for our line of bags. 
Our global Direct-to-Consumer net revenues increased 28% for the quarter, representing approximately 26% of net revenues. We continue to be encouraged by the success we are seeing with our 2015 Brand House openings. From a global standpoint, we ended the third quarter with 173 owned stores including 144 Factory House stores and 29 Brand House stores.
In E-Commerce, we launched 6 new country websites during the quarter, bringing our total to 24 global sites. We continue to utilize more targeted effective communication to our consumers and traffic remained strong benefiting from the remarkable 2015 success of our sports marketing assets. While very early in its evolution, we are also encouraged by some of our efforts to generate traffic to our E-Commerce sites from our Connected Fitness community.
Looking at our regions, North America net revenues increased 25% to $1.1 billion in the third quarter compared to $848 million in the prior year's quarter. On a currency-neutral basis, North America net revenues increased 26% based primarily on the drivers I just highlighted.
International net revenues increased 52% to $130 million in the third quarter and represented 11% of total net revenues. On a currency-neutral basis, international net revenues increased 68% for the period. In the EMEA region, we remained focus on core markets with our largest 2 countries, the U.K. and Germany, contributing the strongest growth during the period. Our E-Commerce strategy has also played a key role in broadening our reach and awareness in the regions as we launched 9 new local sites year-to-date. In Asia-Pacific, the growth of our own DTC, combined with partner store expansion, continues to drive our business. The recent Stephen Curry tour and opening of our largest international Brand House in Shanghai have helped drive strong demand for our brand. And in Latin America, we continue to see balanced growth throughout the region following our market entry into many of these countries during 2014.
Moving on to margins. Third quarter gross margins contracted 80 basis points to 48.8% compared to 49.6% in the prior year's period. The following factors were the primary drivers during the quarter: first, the continued strength of the U.S. dollar negatively impacted gross margins by approximately 90 basis points versus the prior year; second, sales mix negatively impacted gross margin by approximately 50 basis points in the third quarter versus the primary -- prior year, primarily driven by the continued strong performance of our footwear business. Also, on our ongoing focus to better flow our products to service our business resulted in higher freight expenses, which negatively impacted gross margin by approximately 20 basis points in the quarter versus the prior year. Partially offsetting these margin pressures, we continued to see favorable product margins in both our North America and international businesses, which benefited gross margin by approximately 90 basis points in the third quarter.
Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues delevered 60 basis points to 34.6% in the third quarter of 2015 from 34% in the prior year's period. SG&A details for the third quarter are as follows: marketing costs increased to 10.7% of net revenues for the quarter from 10.6% in the prior year period, reflecting higher marketing associated with our Connected Fitness business and our most recent global marketing campaigns for training and global football; other SG&A costs increased to 23.9% of net revenues for the quarter from 23.4% in the prior year, driven primarily by our Connected Fitness business and investments in our global Brand House strategy. 
Operating income for the third quarter increased 17% to $171 million compared with $146 million in the prior year period. 
Interest and other expense from the third quarter increased to $7 million compared with $5 million in the prior period, primarily reflecting increased interest expense associated with the financing of our Connected Fitness acquisitions.
Our third quarter tax rate of 38.8% was unfavorable to the 36.9% rate last year, primarily driven by nondeductible costs associated with our Connected Fitness acquisitions as well as increased losses in our newer Latin American businesses, partially driven by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. 
Our third quarter net income increased 13% to $100 million compared to $89 million in the prior year period while our diluted earnings per share increased to $0.45 from $0.41 in the prior year's period.
On the balance sheet, total cash and cash equivalents for the quarter decreased 36% to $159 million compared with $249 million at September 30, 2014. Inventory for the quarter increased 36% to $867 million compared to $637 million at September 30, 2014. Total debt increased to $905 million as compared to $192 million at September 30, 2014, primarily reflecting the financing of our Connected Fitness acquisition. 
Looking at our cash flows. Our investment and capital expenditures was $71 million for the third quarter compared to $26 million in the prior year's period, driven primarily by our investments in our global headquarters in Baltimore and our global retail strategy. 
Now moving on to our updated 2015 guidance. Based on current visibility, we expect 2015 net revenues of approximately $3.91 billion, representing growth of 27%, and 2015 operating income of approximately $408 million, representing growth of 15%. As we have highlighted on our last earnings call in July and during our recent Investor Day, we believe the decisions we make on where, when and how much we invest are a key driver of our success to date and it is our job to deliver both near- and long-term value while simultaneously investing in our growth.
In a year, we have seen unprecedented success from our athletes on a global scale. We believe the investments we are making today will help fuel our growth for years to come. As Kevin mentioned earlier, we have abundant opportunities that we are investing in to drive our long-term top line growth. With so many areas that require investment, we continue to be focused on driving operating income dollars and not necessarily operating margin.
This is why we have now raised our 2015 net revenues guidance by a cume [ph] with $150 million since January while at the same time maintaining the high end of our operating income target at $408 million. We are committed to a certain level of investment back into our business and we will continue to be opportunistic if and when possible during the fourth quarter.
As a reminder, our operating income guidance continues to include the dilutive impact of the Connected Fitness acquisitions consisting of onetime transaction costs in the first quarter, operating losses from these businesses and noncash amortization charges of the intangible assets generated from the acquisition.
Below operating results, we continue to expect a full year effective tax rate of approximately 41% compared to 39.2% in the prior year, primarily given the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, which continued to negatively impact our international profitability. 
So now I'd like to add some additional color on several items pertaining to the fourth quarter, starting with revenues. We believe we are well positioned to execute heading into the holidays as our investments in service are paying off in fresher, cleaner assortments across our distribution. As we expand our innovation stories like ColdGear Infrared and Storm across our sports categories, we also believe we are more diversified in our solutions for the athlete. Supported by the launch of Curry Two basketball shoes, we expect footwear growth will continue to outpace the growth rate for our overall business during the fourth quarter.
Our gross margin rate is now expected to decline approximately 100 basis points during the fourth quarter. Some of the same themes impacting our business the past few quarters will extend into the fourth quarter including pressure from the continued strength of the U.S. dollar, higher freight costs and a higher mix of footwear revenues. While higher than planned, the latter 2 factors are also key in our increased top line guidance for the year. In addition to these factors, driven by the recent higher growth rates in our footwear business, we are now planning higher excess footwear liquidation sales as part of our normal inventory management process, which will negatively impact gross margins in the fourth quarter. Partially offsetting these factors, we anticipate that we will continue to see improvements in our product margins.
In SG&A, we expect a lower rate of spend for the fourth quarter due to the timing of marketing spend while other SG&A is expected to grow approximately in line with our net revenues growth as we continue with our planned investments in the areas for our long-term growth including Connected Fitness, international and footwear. Also, as I mentioned earlier, we will remain opportunistic in investing incremental dollars during the fourth quarter in the event of more favorable and planned net revenues or gross margin rate. 
Switching over to inventory. As we outlined at our Investor Day, over the next few quarters, we are focused on delivering our products to our consumers more timely, specifically on key seasonal floor set dates. We anticipate this will result in elevated inventory growth rates over this period to flow product earlier. 
Finally, on capital expenditures. Based on our current visibility, we are now planning capital expenditures in the range of $350 million to $360 million for 2015 including approximately $140 million allocated across 3 areas to support long-term growth with our new domestic distribution center, the expansion of our corporate headquarters in Baltimore and initial investments in our new and expanded SAP platform. In addition, we have accelerated investments in key areas to drive revenue growth including the rollout of our global retail strategy and new E-Commerce sites. 
Before we turn it over to Q&A, I would also like to provide you with our preliminary outlook for 2016. Based on our current visibility, we are planning 2016 net revenues to grow at approximately 25% and 2016 operating income to grow at approximately 23%. Both of these metrics are in line with our long-term growth targets we established at our Investor Day last month.
We'll provide further color on 2016 during our earnings call in January. With that, let's turn it over to questions. Operator?"

Could you just give us a little more color around how Under Armour thinks about that huge opportunity in terms of partners and product categories or any insight you could give us?"

So first of all, internationally, we're really excited. We've crossed 11% of the total mix for the company, which is a big deal for us. It's been a long time coming. And becoming global is something you can't just say it, you actually have to act o",952,"Great. So first of all, internationally, we're really excited. We've crossed 11% of the total mix for the company, which is a big deal for us. It's been a long time coming. And becoming global is something you can't just say it, you actually have to act on it. I think it was really [ph] 2006 we launched our first shops in Europe. 2010, we opened our first Brand House with 1,000-square foot store in Shanghai. And it has been a lot of learnings and a lot of adjustment. It's not as easy as just opening stores, but it's into the product, it's into the localized fit, it's into localized merchandising. It's into the execution, the distribution, the manufacturing, so there are a lot of pieces. And China is a great lesson for that. I haven't given these numbers publicly, but I think it's instructive of just sort of what our growth has been in China. So in 2012, for instance, I said we launched our first store at 1,000 square feet and it's incredibly successful. We were doing over $1 million of 1,000 square feet out of one store in Shanghai. We didn't have the right leadership when we went in there and we sort of toiled around for the next couple of years. By the end of 2012, we were doing $3 million of sales in China. We took somebody who was one of our -- I introduced to you a guy named Kevin Eskridge who's now running global merchandising for us, but I pulled him out of our outdoor group and sent him and his family to Shanghai. And the results that we had were the business went from $3 million in '12 to $7 million in '13 to roughly $30 million in 2014. The current plan this year is just over $75 million for '15. And as we look forward to 2016, that number is north of $150 million today. So we're incredibly bullish that the hockey stick approach has really begun to lay in for us. We're excited about what that's going to mean. In China, though, one thing we did, I think, as a nod to the market was our -- the visit that I did with the Curry with the Stephen Curry tour of 5 cities in 5 days, we actually launched the shoe that we're launching this Saturday globally. We launched it exclusively in China back at that tour. So in China, it's very important to make sure that you show and demonstrate great respect, I think, for the market. And hopefully, it's just another sign of the things we're doing there in addition to opening our largest international Brand House store, 15,000 square feet, on Weihai Lu Road in one of the great shopping districts in downtown Shanghai. So we see great growth coming from there and it speaks to some of -- one of the numbers that I mentioned was we'll have more than 300 stores globally. I think it's close to 100 stores or so we'll be opening this year. Roughly 3/4 of the stores are actually going to be in China. So we see great opportunity there. It's going to be our second-largest controlled market and growing exponentially. The 30 stores that we opened in the third quarter, including 18 in September alone including the Weihai Lu Road, then E-Commerce revenues in the third quarter nearly equal the total number of 2014 business that we had in China. So a lot of big things and exciting things happening for us there. Let me jump on sports categories for you for a second because I think it's important and it's a good barometer, I think, on how our business is moving. As we outlined at Investor Day, we expect to move to 9 specific sports categories: men's training, women's training, studio running, outdoor, golf, basketball, team sports, global football and sportswear. Sportswear is one of those quiet discussions that we have, and we outlined at Investor Day the size and importance that sportswear represents for our current competitors. So collectively, our competition has roughly $50 billion in revenues, 25% of which they claim publicly derived specifically from sportswear. That's basically a $12.5 billion opportunity as we look at it. Today, we're competing with effectively 0. We feel like we've got the right leader in someone who came from this industry, worked for one of our chief competitors and responsible for helping to build out their sportswear category in Ben Pruess. And Ben is someone who has a [ph] process. I want to set people's expectations on sportswear at the same time. We issued $7.5 billion as our Investor Day goal for 2018. Sportswear isn't heavily considered in that. It's going to take time. It's going to take build. And I think understanding what we're going to need to do from an investment standpoint, which is why I think we've been so specific as Brad and I have been really hammering down the fact that while we expect to really grow and amp up our top line revenue, we want to be prudent with what we're doing on the bottom line. But this growth, this 25% CAGR that we've committed to, it will come at a price and that price is a continuing investment. And I think it's measured investment at the same time. And our 10-year track record of, I think, making appropriate -- the right investments is something that gives us great confidence that these are categories are going to pay dividends for investors in the future, but it's the right thing for us to do at the time and it's certainly our moment in time to make it happen"

Yes, definitely with footwear growing at the rate it's growing and obviously ASPs in footwear are much higher than apparel, that's part of the driver behind inventory growth. But probably the bigger driver of what we're doing right now year-over-year, specifically in Q3 and as we look into Q4, is more gauged around just the flow of inventory. So if you recall, looking back a year ago or so or maybe a little bit more than a year ago, we talked about some of the challenges that we had in flowing product on time for things like back-to-school and holiday. And we really got focused this year as we came into 2015 on making sure, to some degree at all costs almost, that we were going to flow product on time and we called out freight costs, specifically airfreight, as an impact to gross margins this year to do that. So that's probably the bigger driver. What you're seeing in inventory growth rate is we're really focused on hitting key floor set dates. So when you look at things like getting into the holidays of this year, making sure that product is flowing and ready to go, it's increasing our Q3 inventory levels. When you look at starting to set the floors right at the beginning of next year, in spring '16, what you're going to see is earlier flow of product in the back half of this year specifically as you get close to the end of this year. So as I talked about at Investor Day, when you kind of look at year-over-year growth rates and inventory, that's the bigger driver of this, is the flow of product. Obviously, we grew a little bit higher than revenue here in Q3. And I think what you'll see is even a little bit more so in Q4 as we're really focused on getting product out on the floor on time for our spring floor sets. That should start to normalize a little bit as we work through 2016 because we start to get into a comparison of that focus we had in 2015 to flow product better too. So as you start working through Q1 and Q2 of '16, you should start to normalize that and get that more in line with revenue growth."

I mean, we used that theme at Investor Day about the map and the terrain and I think we've demonstrated really great expertise in being able to adjust with the differing terrain. There's going to be many trends. We saw a lot of them the last 10 years. We're anticipating probably something similar in the next decade, or more importantly, anticipating what we haven't even thought about yet. But I think investments are important and a great way to talk about our team. Our core pillars we talk about is product story, service and team, and team obviously being the most important thing. There's a couple of places that I think are illustrative of where we have, and frankly, where we now need to be more aggressive. Our women's business is a great example of that. Women's footwear is something that as recent as a year ago we had just a handful of people or less than that, really people treating women's footwear as a part-time job. And it's where, if you compare that to others in our industry, there's not dozens, there's hundreds of people working on these themes and so the investments that we're making from a few different sides are really important. I speak about being opportunistic with our investment in general and there's a few places that we think that we need to invest. First of all, our core business, investing in areas like marketing, supply chain and technology. And again, along with this, Camilo, it all comes down to team and people. But we do see that we are at this unique moment in time and it's the right time for us because of the year we have with some of our assets and athletes is things like what should we be doing from our marketing and our storytelling standpoint, from a supply chain about being a better customer and having the right team. Because right now we're okay, but we're still not level-loading our factories the way that we could with the volumes that we're driving and being better with the best factories. And then when we're in the best factories, driving the A teams in those factories and having the best people in the factories working on our business. In technology, it's things like laying out the vision, as I mentioned earlier, with SAP about the single view of the consumer. Growth drivers for us, our existing growth drivers, I mentioned they're the same as they were -- the 5 growth drivers are the same as they were at our IPO, men's, women's, footwear, international and Direct-to-Consumer. I mean, footwear and international are places where I think we've done a great job. As you look at the growth we have in the footwear, we had 61% growth quarter, and in international we had a 69% growth quarter and 85% in constant currency basis. And there are things that we weren't getting a lot of credit for a few years ago when we told you we were spending money in these categories. So I think you're starting to see them really come to life. We're also investing in talent and people where, again, I think making sure that, A, there's a broad canvas, but the canvas isn't too wide either. We feel comfortable about the investments we're making because beyond our own growth drivers, there are new areas for you like Connected Fitness, sportswear, which I just spoke about, and again doubling down on some of the infrastructure we have. But Connected Fitness is one of those things that we're proud and I think we're bullish on the returns that we're beginning to see come back from it. And as we gave that bogey of $200 million we put out there for 2018, the real upside is something like Connected Fitness' the collective dollars it will help grow across all our existing growth drivers as well as the new ones that we're investing in and the dollars to come. But I feel we've done a good job. I just believe that we're in the process of hiring. I think on our website right now, there's over 350 jobs or something to that effect that we're looking for. There's -- obviously, there's a few key executive positions that we're looking to fill, and as Brad and I have been working through the transition heading into February, we've gotten a great response for this position. And we expect to have an A player in someone that's been there, done that and really has seen what it's like as we look to cross the $7.5 billion-plus range. So we're looking to bring experts and I think that's a unique thing about where we are today versus where we were even just a couple of years ago. We have a great attraction. I think this company is custom fit for some real professionals that would be excited by growth."

I think every year, it probably becomes less impactful to us because of the diversification of our product and then also in our regions, too, on an international basis. So yes, I mean, there's a little bit of an impact there, but it's not tremendously significant. And obviously, as we look at our guidance for the fourth quarter, we're not anticipating any dramatic change in weather year-over-year either way in our guidance."

And one thing we focus on really is going back 4 or 5 years where we realize how weather-dependent we were as a company with the pretty classic 60-40 split front half versus 40-60 split front half versus back half of the year. I think we've done a good job in planning things like this quarter, not being so reliant on heavyweight fleece, but focusing more on sort of stylish lightweight fleeces. And we've really worked closely with our partners to create offerings that aren't just relying on big puffer jackets that are sitting in retail stores that if it doesn't snow aren't going to sell. So definitely, it's a work in process, but weather-proofing our business has been a real focus for our company and I think we're pretty proud of how we position versus maybe other people in our world."

It's like we've had some tremendous growth rates in footwear the last few quarters in the 40s, 50s and now 60s, 61% this quarter. So this is just the normal process of managing inventory as you work through selling in and selling through, which both have been very positive for us in the footwear side, you're ultimately always going to be left with some excess inventory in footwear. We've become, over the course of the last few years and this year, too, very focused on getting into the next season very clean on the footwear side. So looking at the excess footwear we had again, which is really just being generated from the tremendous growth and success we've had in footwear in general, we really got focused on getting through some of the footwear liquidation in Q4 and making sure that we were very clean getting into next year. So obviously, as you talk about footwear gross margins, just the regular gross margins of footwear being well below our apparel gross margins, that's also the case on the liquidation side where your footwear liquidation margins are going to be much less than your apparel liquidation side. As far as the avenues and vehicles to liquidate, Factory House obviously is one of them and we have talked about third party in the past also of moving some of our excess inventory through a third party also. Although small in revenue volume, obviously it does impact gross margin."

FX could be -- will be a big part of that year-over-year decline. If you remember, we came into this year talking about FX impacting our margins by about 50 basis points. Now we're up to about an 80 basis points full year impact. So obviously, the FX has worsened during the course of the year. So that's a big driver of it. Again, fourth quarter margins, airfreight, as we really get focused on flowing inventory, that's a little bit of a driver, too, and that's kind of increased during the course of the year as we've got kind of laser focused on better deliveries and better flow of product. Those are the big, big drivers. We talked about the footwear liquidation also being a driver in Q4. We came into this year, on the FX side, probably less prepared than we'll be coming out of the year relative to how we hedge currencies going forward. So we've done a better job during the course of this year offsetting some of the increased pressures on FX. We've built some better competencies in-house from a talent perspective and some better strategies around hedging that we'll continue to increase going forward. So I would expect that in the future, we're more prepared to offset some of those impacts that you're seeing right now. And obviously, as you get into 2016, we're going to start to compare to 2015 FX rates, so you would imagine that there'll be a much more favorable comparison unless something drastically changes in the FX front."

It doesn't mean you couldn't see in the wholesale also, but we can obviously react much quicker on the DTC side."

And it's one thing where I think we probably have been dragging a little bit. The women's example that I gave earlier, that's something, which was glaring and really obvious. But look, we've got growth coming from a lot of places. And so until you really turn attention you can focus on it, you're probably a bit vulnerable. So we've made, I think, 6 or 7 hires just in the last 45 days on our women's footwear team, really looking to become robust and build that out. And there's places where we've definitely taken an ROI approach to it where we're going to have the biggest impact. But at the same time, we don't want to apologize for footwear. It's a relatively small number and we also put a 60% number up this quarter, committing to a 40% CAGR through '18. We think there's great growth there and we're going to be the beneficiaries of that. But one thing I want to emphasize to people is that it is 10 years in making shoes for us, but it absolutely takes time. The first category we got into was American football cleats and that was 2006 and it was a big breakthrough and we had high teens, low 20s market share. And since that time, we're now pushing close to a 40% market share in football cleats with our sights set on being #1. And I say it only because it's a category we've been in the longest. And for 10 years in football cleats and 5 years in running shoes, imagine what we're going to look like in running shoes in another 5 years there. So -- but I guess the thing to say is making a great shoe is not as -- or be winning in footwear is not about making one great shoe. There are so many factors that are combined. And just like use of football cleats, when we were successful with the 20% market share, we were basically making shoes for a particular type of athlete. And the speed guys and the guys on the edges of a team weren't the guys that were wearing our product. And the reason we couldn't figure out is why won't they buy our speed shoes, are our speed shoes not good? And the fact is, is that's the kid where basketball is really important to him and he likes wearing the shoe on a football field that he wore on the basketball court. And until we launched a basketball shoe, we couldn't even become relevant there. And until we became relevant in basketball, he wasn't even going to consider us. And so it was about the aesthetic of the shoe, but it's so many factors more than just do you make a good speed cleat as to are you in basketball, do you have an asset like a Stephen Curry that gives the credibility to want to wear the shoe. And then beyond that is when we go to being in the biggest factories, it's not only being in the biggest or the best factories, but it's about having the B, C or D teams in the factories, but get to a point we have the A teams in the factories. And you're not going to get to that point where I mentioned 30 million pairs of shoes versus 0.5 billion to our competition until we have the ability to truly level load and give them the things that they need. And so as we sit here 10 years in, in football cleats in '06, baseball in '07, training shoes in '08, running shoes in '09, basketball shoes in '10, then we stop launching new categories. We're getting there, we're evolving. It just takes a little more time. So we absolutely believe in sort of the head-to-toe hooks that we're heading to. But I'll tell you, at our bones, we believe that we're as entitled as anyone else to be #1 in footwear. And the challenge goes to what I spoke about, about local-for-local manufacturing. When you talk about innovation in something like footwear, I don't think our industry has been incredibly innovative at all. When you look and you compare the fact that 20 years ago, the technology that can fit on my fingernail today or in my iPhone or Samsung device it took a mainframe the size of a Greyhound bus just 20 years ago, and today, it's absolutely evolved. In footwear, we make shoes, we make apparel the exact same way we did 80 years ago. So I think finding innovation and finding ways to win is that there's not an individual shoe technology that makes someone innovative. So I think the approach that we have is holistic and will pay absolute dividends. But we are challenging our team to think much bigger. But a few, I think, highlights we have on the footwear side is that obviously basketball is something with Steph. Our basketball business, up over in triple digits, bringing SpeedForm technology to what that's going to mean for us in basketball as well, signing additional athletes, the #7 pick in this year's draft, Emmanuel Mudiay, is one of the breakout young stars this year as well. So doubling down there. Women's, we covered that. Our running business, we've had a great product in SpeedForm, but we're also bringing 6 new running models to market in 2016 including a product we have in the market right now called Fortis, which is our #1 selling shoe in our key sporting goods account. That's $90-ish and doing really well as well as another new -- our first all-knit upper offering in a product called Slingshot, which is doing really well. But across-the-board, outdoor with the Fat Tire shoe I mentioned in my notes earlier; football cleats having the #1 shoe in the market with the Highlight Cleat; soccer, our new Slay Your Next Giant campaign and our asset Memphis Depay, the striker for Manchester United, who's 22 years old and again another next big star; Jordan Spieth on launching golf footwear; our Youth footwear continues to be on fire as well. So there's a lot of sort of individual stories, I think, that are drawing to the bigger narrative and we haven't connected all the dots, I think, for the consumer yet where I mean the consumer I also mean our customers where we can be a great footwear brand when you walk into a store with an A-Z footwear experience. But I can tell you is that we know what that movie looks like. We've seen it before. And we're bringing in pros who have seen it before as well. And it's just a matter of time for us to draw that. But I want to emphasize we think we can be the #1 brand in footwear. And what our team is preparing for is what's the next shoe coming from one of our current competitors. What we're thinking about is what are we going to do if Apple or Samsung decide to make a shoe, how are we going to answer that. So that's the type of, I think, leapfrog mentality and that moonshot thinking that we're challenging our team with. Let's not fight with where people are today. Let's think about where they're going in the future and what we can do to be great."

But if I could just take a second on our Connected Fitness. Today",520,"Yes, since Investor Day is when I had that time actually with Ram and he took us through the idea of math house, which I guess we knew it all along, but it was a great way to articulate it. But if I could just take a second on our Connected Fitness. Today, more than 150 million athletes continue to add over 100,000 a day throughout 2015 downloading 1 of our 4 apps. I mean, the scale is extraordinary. At Investor Day, we mentioned there were 6 billion foods logged in time. Today, just a few weeks later over 6.5 billion foods logged. Workouts, 1.3 billion is the number we gave you at Investor Day. Today, it's more than 1.5 billion workouts. More than 200 million workouts have occurred just from the last few weeks. So the information we're gaining every day we think is incredible and it's going to continue to enable us to provide the consumer with really relevant information and insights, too. We'd like to use the words, to enrich lives. We think the bigger opportunity, though, is much bigger -- is much broader than $200 million target that we talked about and ultimately is going to help us sell more shirts and shoes. The math house idea, though, the ability to use data and analytics to drive business is something, which is -- I don't even think we've quantified yet. I used the example and I think it's a really good one, that Amazon, how they the credit 40% of their revenues what they call their recommendation engine, and that's basically you just based off of toothpaste. I know if I told you a tube of toothpaste -- 5 weeks ago a toothpaste has a 6-week life cycle and I can ask if you want me to send you a new tube. Not only do we know purchasing history, but we can tie that to activity to fitness to sleep to nutrition and data and information that our consumers are voluntarily giving to us. And we recognize that as they do that, our job is becoming this destination, this daily dashboard of your health and fitness that we think we can become. And that's all built on trust. And as I've said many times is trust is one of those things that's built in drops and it can be lost in buckets, but we think that we have the credibility at this point and we think with some of the suite of products and apps and devices that we have as we're contemplating looking forward and partners we're looking with those devices to move forward, we've got a large announcement we're looking forward to making at CES in January and we think it's an incredibly exciting space that is just partially contemplated as we look forward. But the one thing that is clear, as excited as we are about our Connected Fitness and how it's going to enable us with this math house to be that much smarter about our overall business, ultimately, what it's going to do is help us sell more shirts and shoes."

Can you help us understand is there -- are there any subtle things going on there we should be aware of? Any timing issues? Is it more on the E-Commerce side where maybe it's slowing a little bit?

So it's been up and down a little bit. A lot of that right now is going to be timing of new market entries on the E-Commerce side globally, retail on the global side to enter into certain markets and expansion to certain markets. Kevin talked a lot about China and the growth in China, the timing of some of that, obviously, Brand House in the States, too. So if you look across-the-board, the E-Commerce side of it has been the strongest of the growth drivers across all the quarters. Really, if you look back over the last 4 quarters, E-Commerce has kind of led the way from a growth rate perspective. The retail, although have been strong, has been below the E-Comm growth. When you look at just in general on the retail side, you have to remember that still the majority of our revenues on retail are being generated by North America Factory House channel. So although we talk about brand Houses Both domestically and globally what's going on in retail, the large majority of our retail revenue still sits in that kind of North America Factory House. And we've talked about over the course of the last 6, 7, 8 quarters that planning the slowdown of that growth rate as we open less doors going forward and focus on square footage growth that we plan the growth rate of North America Factory House to decline as we got into 2015 and the future. So that's, to some degree, what you're seeing is the impact of that North America Factory House growth rate, which we plan to kind of come down. Still healthy, but planned down. That's kind of what you're seeing, I think, from the perspective of some of the growth rates in DTC."
