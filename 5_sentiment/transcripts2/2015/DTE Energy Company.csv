I think I'm going to be able to give you a very positive assessment both of what we accomplished this past year and what we feel we're positioned to deliver this year in 2015. So the agenda for the call is laid out on Slide 4. I'm going to begin with a look back on the past year and then I'll provide summary of energy policy developments both in Michigan and in Washington and I will wrap up my comments by taking you through a long-term growth update and then I'll turn things over to Peter Oleksiak to provide a financial update and some closing thoughts. 
So I'm going to frame my look back on 2014 within DTE Energy's system of priorities, and those priorities are laid out on Slide 5. Those of you who've been on this call in recent years should recognize this system of priorities. It does describe the way we think about our company and the way we run our company. And I'll take you through it briefly just to refamiliarize you. So we start things with our employees. And this is a core focus for the company with a simple comments to great company if your culture and energy people is in great. If you get that right, you can translate that into great customer service and to great continuous improvement and management of your costs. And you could also translate it into people who are willing to work hard to grow your company. And if you get those right, then I think great customer service and good management of costs and growth that plays into, for example, the state of Michigan's economic development agenda give you a good chance to shape a political and regulatory context that's constructive for the company. And if you combine a constructive regulatory context with a good growth strategy, we have a chance to produce really strong outcomes for you. And for us, that means consistent, predictable 5% to 6% more annual savings group combined with attractive dividend and strong balance sheet. 
So let me take you through the results around each of these priorities in the next few slides beginning on Slide 6 as a way of looking back on this past year's accomplishments. Starting with our employees. So we ranked in the top decile of Gallup's employee engagement survey. Gallup does this all over the globe. And we entered the top decile for the first time in our company's history, and I know what our year-end Christmas party this past year I picked up a couple of things that I was proud of us of from 2014, and this was 1 of the 2 because I think it's a big deal for us to continue sort of performance that we've had over the past 6 years. We also earned our second consecutive Gallup Workplace Award. We were top quartile for the second year in a row in our industry with safety results. And we also have a National Safety Council ranked us in the top 5% of 672 companies that they work with nationally, and it really looked at safety culture so I think this is another important outcome for us. On out continuous improvement front, interestingly, the Project Management Institute, which another one of these large global institutes, named DTE one the of three finalists for their global project management award. So I can tell you that we have always been this way. In fact, 6 or 8 years ago, I remember our first ranking under 0 to 5 scale, and we ranked at 0. And it was at that point we challenged our people to turn our ability to manage large projects into a world-class pluses, and they have worked hard since then and interesting to see them start to 0 and end up as a finalist to top of the list, so to speak. 
This continuous improvement mindset is translated to our own expenses. Again. our Expenses this past year were flat to 2008 levels and really comes to a lot of CI work around the company, and so that ranks us again among the top of the peer group in our industry on -- reductions. On a customer satisfaction front, we have some good news this past year. Our Gas business ranked #1 for both residential and business customer satisfaction. And both of those are firsts for our company, first time ever that we've been top of the list. We've been targeting this explicitly with our employees and it's great to achieve it. Our electric residential satisfaction is now third in our peer group and we're pretty clear with our employees that we want to take that to where the Gas business is. What we need to do to get it there is primarily to invest in strengthening our electric system. Reliability is our primary got to the top 1 in the satisfaction survey, so we are therefore investing in reliability. 
Moving to Slide 7, on political and regulatory front. I really do feel there positive momentum on Michigan's energy policy. I'll discuss that here in a few minutes. I won't dwell on it now. We dealt this past year -- our first electric great case in 4 years that will play out here in 2015. We reduced average customer rate last year by 6% in January of '14. We reduced rates another 6% actually in January of '15. So that's a good thing to have reached going down. And then we have Michigan's span, that spend with Michigan suppliers says 900. Actually, we just closed the books on the numbers, $922 million. We started some years back in 2010 at about half that level. It's been a great we are for us to play in the economic development and job creation agenda of the state. On the growth front, we invested over 2 billion this past year, more than double our depreciation levels. We had $1.8 billion in the utilities. One of our significant projects was the Echo Wind Park, it was 112-megawatt wind Park. That pushed us to right to our 10% on the renewable portfolio standard year in the states. We made fundamental progress on the NEXUS pipeline. I will discuss that in more detail here in a few minutes. Very active around the Bluestone pipeline in Pennsylvania. That was a significant area of investment last year and it will be this year as well. We relocated our 8 REF unit, and we have the ninth 1 underway and should be able to bring that online this year. 
On the financial front, our operating EPS came in at 4.60. Our revised guidance late last year was 4.52, so we came in at the high-end of our guidance range. We began last year with guidance of 4.30 so we cleared that by a pretty healthy margin. We did our about ROE what our gas and electric utilities and our total shareholder returns for the 1-, 3- and 5-year time frames for all top quartile and we're able to increase the dividend 5.3% as well. So I look back, I feel we had great year in 2014 and I also feel great about the way that we're positioned for 2015. 
So moving onto Slide 8. I'm now going to turn to a bit on energy policy both in Michigan and Washington and I will start that look on Slide 9. I just want to begin by saying that Michigan continues to have what I consider to be a sound balance political and regulatory context. I think the state is working hard to behave that way, to behave in a way that's productive for growth and productive for business. In addition to their normal workloads, several of our public service commissioners are giving a significant amount of time to helping the state conceptualized good future energy policy. So, for example, Chairman Quackenbush is an important adviser to the governor and the governor's team as they think through policy options. For Governor Snyder, he made it clear that updating energy policy is important adjusted to priority for him this year. He called out the need for new legislation in his state address and doing that he highlighted significant transformation in generation sources that our state will undertake over the next 10 to 15 years. As is Governor Snyder, he's carefully studied energy issues. He's given a lot of thought to future energy policy in our state and so I feel fortunate to have him leading as we shape policy that's really going to carry Michigan through an important period of evolution in the state energy sector. We also have good leadership in both the House and the Senate policy, and so I'll move to Slide 10 to talk about some of the players. Senator Mike Moss, pictured on the left there, is an extremely season -- when it comes to energy policy. Mike chairs the Senate Energy and Technology Committee. He was one of the principal architects of Michigan's 2008 energy legislation. He was in the House then. But Senator -- thoroughly understands the issues facing our state and the policies that we need to address. Representative Erik Nesbitt is also a very knowledgeable and experienced leader in energy issues. Eric chairs the House energy policy committee. He did that in this last term as well, so he's well off the curve and I'm confident that he also thoroughly understands the future energy policy needs of our state. And finally, Governor Snyder recently appointed Valerie Brader to head the newly formed agency on energy. The governor formed a new agency to better coordinate the various parts of state government involved in developing and executing energy policy, and Valerie is a trusted and very confident aide to the governor. I think very good choice for this role. She's been very close to energy issues to the governor's first term and that continues into his second term. 
So bottom line, as we head into really important energy policy and set of energy legislation deliberations this year, we have a really good group of leaders working the issue, and I think that bodes very well for constructive legislation as an outcome. Now in terms of the nature of the legislation, fundamentally, our state needs to do 2 things. And I think will be the focus of legislation. First, we need to address the remaining retail access in the Michigan market, and I think that all of the principal players in the discussion understand that clearly. And second, we need to establish a well-defined process for defining and improving the many investments that our state will make over the next 15 years to update and transform our power plant feet. So really going to need a process for thinking through the right portfolio mix, approving those investments, being flexible to change the investments redefine it as new large knowledge comes on board and so forth. That processes notify for does it simply because we have been through a transformation of the scale and a long, long time and so many to put that pace. And I also think that the policymakers understand and have their eye on that. 
Now the power plant feet transformation that I described is laid out on Slide 11. That transformation, of course, is driven by EPA's 111D regulation. That regulation will be finalize late summer this year. I am spending a lot of time in Washington trying to ensure that principally the final regulation is workable in terms of its reliability impacts and its impact on customers rates. And both of these issues are really a question of -- not the ultimate endpoint. I do sense that the EPA and the administration are listening to input on this front. So I'm hopeful that we can have the regular -- to a point that works for companies like ours. For Michigan as you can see, on the right-hand side of the slide, 111D will lead to a significant shift away from coal to a much heavier share of gas and renewables, and this mix shift will require an investment in our state on the order of $15 billion, $7 billion to $8 billion of that will be by DTE Energy and that's the need for updated energy policy in the state. It's a big transformation akin to what happened back in 1970s and '80s. 
So moving onto Slide 12. I'm not going to shift gears and provide an update on our long-term growth and investment prospects and I'll start that discussion on Slide 13. As I mentioned earlier, we had a strong finish to 2014. Our earnings finished at 4 6 this year, up about 12.5% over the prior year. Peter's going to give you more color on this in a minute, but I think it's fair to say that every one of our business units turned into strong performance this past year. Back in the fall of 2014, we provided an early outlook, EPS guidance for this year of $4.55. We're now increasing that guidance to $4.60. Again, Peter will give you more depth on that new guidance in a minute. But 1 way to look at it is that our guidance implies that the weather and trading upside that we saw in 2014 will now be internalized into our long-term growth in 2015. We also continue our dividend growth in 2014. As you see at the bottom of the slide, we have consistently said that as we grow our earnings we intend to grow our dividend in parallel and that's certainly still the plan. As you know, our stated goal for many years has been to grow our EPS in our dividend at 5% to 6% per year in a highly predictable and highly reliable fashion. Our actual earnings growth, as you can see at the top right of the slide, has been higher than that. It's closer to 7%. And I think we're in a position to continue the strong earnings growth, which is where I want to turn my attention to now. 
So as you can see on Slide 14, we are going to be pursuing a very full investment agenda over the next 5 years. Capital expenditures from 2015 to 2019 are projected to average to $2.3 billion a year, which is by far the highest 5-year average in DTE Energy's history. Our projected capital expenditures for this year, $2.6 billion, is also a record level. We've never been actually near that level. So we are clearly in the heart of a heavy capital investment era at the company. And as you can see from the graphic, each of our 4 growth business growth business is going to contribute to this investment and growth. The heaviest investment both this year and over the next 5 will be in our electric business. And contributing to that investment this year is our acquisition of the 700-megawatt gas-fired Renaissance power plant. We closed that acquisition in January. We also do have a second RFP out for another gas-fired plant. We do expect to act on that this year as well. As we make those investments in our utilities, we are intensely focused on keeping the rate impacts modest. I think we believe is a company that it will be those companies who manage the rate impacts of a heavy investment well that will emerge as winners for shareholders. So we're very focused on managing the rate impacts. On Slide 15, clearly, these investments plus general inflation put upward pressure on rates, but we have a number of factors of work that are offsetting that upward pressure. So in addition to the continuous improvement in cost management that I discussed earlier, there are over 600 million in surcharges that have rolled off in our electric business over the past 2 years. As a result, we're able to lower our average rates by 6% last January and by 6% again this January. In addition, we've been working with our legislature and commission on revised business cost of service rates. And the result of both the rate reductions and that work is that many of our large energy intensive companies will see rate reductions of 15% to 20% between 2013 and 2015. We did file our first electric great case in 4 years and December last year. And I think we're just pleased that this rate increase request will be playing out within the broader context of falling rates as I just described. In our gas utility, our gas renewal and meter replacement programs are covered by Infrastructure Recovery Mechanism. And as a result of that, we don't expect to need to file a gas rate case until 2016 or 2017. 
So turning now from our utilities to our non-utilities businesses, one area of continued significant investment and growth is our gas storage and pipeline business. And Slide 16 plays out the footprint of that business. Our current footprint extends essentially from Chicago to New York City. The Millennium Pipeline, the Bluestone Pipeline and the Bluestone Gathering system, which are on the eastern end of this footprint, were areas of significant investment activity for us this past year driven by drilling in the Marcellus Shale, and we do expect that to continue this year. Our gathering activity, for example, will be kind of full throttle. However, I want to focus my comments today on 2 assets on the Western end of the footprint: The proposed nexus pipeline and the Vector Pipeline. Vector transports gas between Chicago and the Michigan and Ontario markets. 
Moving onto Slide 17, we made a lot of progress over the past year in developing the nexus pipeline. I just want to review a little bit of that with you. So agreements were executed with LDCs and several producers in the Utica region that underpinned the pipe, and those agreements put us in a position to move forward and we are moving forward. We recently ramped up a supplemental open season. That open season focus on interest shippers we are expressing addition of receipt points. So, for example, receipt points upstream of Kensington Ohio, on Texas eastern. We were also responding to interest in potential laterals from nexus to addition load that the pipe that might serve. We also over the past year completed interconnect agreements for NEXUS with key pipelines, including Vector, including the DTE system, among them. And then finally and more recently, we submitted our prefiling. We have engaged an EPC contractor, that was announced yesterday floor will play that role. And we are right in the middle of public outreach activities those are well underway, too. So given all of that, we now have serious engineering to work on the pipe underway, and we expect to have the bulk of that engineering completed by the fall of this year, and we expect our final FERC application this fall as well. 
Now with respect To vector. Many of you are aware that we recently ramped up and open season by that pipe as well, and I'm pleased with the results. Both NEXUS and the Rover pipeline signed 15-plus year long-term agreements with Vector. And those agreements put the pipe on strong financial footing for the foreseeable future. A number of the existing shippers on Vector did not renew capacity commitments, so we did not invent need to expand the pipe to accommodate NEXUS and Rover. So I think if you look forward the growth and expansion of the Vector pipeline over time is now linked to the growth in expansion of NEXUS, Rover and generally to supply from the Utica Shale region. And given that, that supply is expected to by almost everybody was look at the expected to expand at a rapid pace, we would think that Vector will benefit from that. 
Moving on to Slide 18. You see laid out here in the earnings expectations for the gas storage and pipeline business. Earnings were $82 million this past year. We are targeting $145 million by 2019. Anything showed in color is earnings that we feel we have locked in with existing projects and assets. We do have $10 million there for additional development, but it's not a very big over a 5-year period so we hope we can do at least that, if not better. You can see that the pipeline platform is slated to more than double over the next 5 years. The gathering platform doubles as well. We're a little bit shrinkage in the storage platform. That's what the floor -- show, although I must say that I'd think it's all the various changes in the gas market play out have hopeful for storage but we market to the forwards. 
I'm going to turn out our Power & Industrial business on Slide 19. We're active in 3 lines of business in this unit. One of those is Industrial Energy Services, where we provide on-site services for large industrials and other large users of energy. In that business line, we have several pro-generation projects that are currently under development. We bought 1 online this past year. We have several more in development, 1 sizable one that's a it's late stage. So we expect that to be a good area of growth for this business line in the years ahead. In the renewable arena, we operate woodfired and gas-fired power plants. Growth here will come from expanded output of existing assets. So, for example, we have a plant last year that was bought on line a partial year and the full year performance will expand earnings. We also brought a several large sites this past year, so that sort of organic growth occurring in this line of business. Finally, reduced emissions fuel is where we are we reduce emissions from coal-fired plants. We brought on the eighth unit last year. The ninth unit is in late-stage negotiations. We expect that plant operating by midyear 2015. 
And on Slide 20, you see the earnings expectations for the Power & Industrial business. So P&I earned $90 million this past year. We expect it to grow to $145 million, projected at 90 to 100 this year, growing to 145. Again, anything you see in solid colors, our projects that we have in and so we expect the that growth will come. We do have a $20 million new development bogey that would be filled by things like cogeneration projects that I mentioned earlier. So we feel good about achieving this as well. So that wraps up my comments, and I'm going to turn things over to Peter Oleksiak now for a financial update. Peter, over to you."

Everyone who dialed in on a regular basis just know I'd like to give a quick shoutout to our Detroit Tigers. I feel compelled to do that here. Actually, 1 week, exactly 1 week away saw spring training starts, so noble predictions cautiously optimistic and we'll provide an update for early-season update in the first quarter call. 
So with that, sure commercial break. I'll like to start with our financial update and our year-end results on Slide 22. As Gary mentioned earlier, DTE Energy's 2014 operating earnings were $4.60 per share. For detailed breakdown of EPS by segment, please refer to the appendix Slide 32. The appendix also includes a reconciliation to GAAP reported earnings. 
Slide 22 shows our year-over-year operating earnings by segment. I will focus on the middle column, which is the 2014 results. Let me start first with the total earnings for our growth segments. 2014 operating earnings of $796 million were up $73 million or $0.37 per share. Our larger, subsidiary DTE Electric, earned $528 million and was up $44 million over last year driven by a revenue decoupling amortization in the first half of the year and lower O&M expenses driven by reduced benefit cost and lean actions taken in the second half of the year. 2014 was a great year for electric utility given the weather-related challenges it faced. It was also the final year of a 4-year rate case strategy. DTE Gas 2014 earnings of $140 million were just below 2013 earnings as colder winter weather was more than offset by higher O&M expenses, including reinvestment. The appendix contains detailed year-over-year earning walks for utilities. 
Moving down the page. Our gas storage and pipeline earnings of $82 million were $12 million higher than 2013. This increase was driven by higher short-term weather-related storage earnings and also continued growth in our pipeline and gathering earnings. Earnings for the year in the segment were partially offset by the ongoing impact of the accounting change related to one of our pipeline investments. Earnings for our Power & Industrial project segments of $90 million were up $20 million from 2013. This increase was driven primarily by higher reduced emissions fuel earnings that were mainly onetime in nature. In total, operating earnings for our gross segments were $4.48 per share, up 9% from $4.11 per share in 2013. Overall, 2014 was a great year for growth segments. To round out our operating earnings, we include the results of our Energy Trading business. At Energy Trading, 2014 earnings were $20 million, up from a $3 million loss in 2013 driven by accounting recognition of the strong economic performance. The economic contribution for 2014 was over double our targeted annual level of $20 million to $25 million, and that incremental performance flow through the accounting results. 
Slide 38 of the appendix contains our standard Energy Trading reconciliation tables economic and accounting performance. Now let me move the discussion ahead to this year on Slide 23. As Gerry mentioned, we are raising our guidance's midpoint for $4.55 per share to $4.60 per share. Slide 23 shows our updated operating earnings guidance for the 2015 by segment. We have a comparison here of our 2015 guidance of our great column compared to 2015 early outlook, which is in the Middle. I'm going to focus on where we have a green arrow on the page. The increasing guidance is mainly driven by our non-utilities. We're steadily increasing our gas storage and pipeline guidance range based on higher expected earnings from for the pipeline business. And we are increasing the guidance range for Power & Industrial project segments by $5 million for stronger performance in the renewables businesses. So earnings over all for growth segments are expected to increase from $4.48 per share to $4.60. This represents a 5.5% growth when you factor weather and normalization. You see here at the bottom of the page, our comment of lower share issue much in 2015. Right now we are targeting $200 million of equity issuance this year, which is $100 million lower than it was assumed in our early outlook. The driver of this change is the combination of strong 2014 cash and the recent extension of bonus depreciation. So the average shares outstanding for updated 2015 guidance is psyche the work that our early outlook. Both numbers down to 197 million shares. I just mentioned that the 2015 $4.60 EPS midpoint of guidance represents 5.5% growth when 2014 weather is normalized and the next page, Slide 24, lays of this comparison. The left side of chart starts with 2014 actual growth segment results then walk to the 2015 midpoint including to change for weather. As you all know, 2014 was one of the coldest winters in record providing favorably at our gas utility. This weather impact was a positive $0.12 for 2014. You can see in the next 2 columns that the growth year-over-year causes of $0.20 per share of utilities and $0.04 per share at our non-utilities. Earlier, I mentioned strong 2014 cash flows and we can see this on Slide 25. 2014, our cash from operations was $1.8 billion, down from 2013 levels but $200 million higher than our original 2014 guidance. The decrease year-over-year was primarily driven by lower surcharge collections and higher purchase power cost at DTE Electric. Capital spending was higher in 2014 due to increased investment and DTE Electric. Over all, free cash flow is down from 2013 but $400 million higher than original guidance. 
Looking forward to this year, Slide 26 provides our cash flow guidance for 2015. We see lower cash from operations this year driven by the elimination of our securitization bonds surcharge. The 15-year securitization bonds that facilitate the recovery of our plant assets are now fully recovered. On average our electric customers saw 6% decrease in the rates in the month of January. We look to significantly increase capital expenditures in 2015 due to increased generation investment other utilities and growth projects at our non-utility businesses. Earlier, Gerry described our investment in DTE Electric as we move to transition our generation from coal to natural gas renewables. In 2015, we are making investments in natural gas generation to shorter our summer capacity short fall. This strong 2014 cash flow performance it is up nicely for 2015. And the next slide, 27, you can see that our balance sheet remained strong would leverage at FFO metrics at or above targets. We plan to continue our focus on balance sheet strength in 2015. We did achieve our target of 0 equity issuance in 2014. And as I mentioned previously, we are targeting 200 million of equity issuance in 2015, down from the 300 million in our early outlook. We look to issue 800 million  to 900 million of equity over the next 3-year period, 2015 to 2017, but assuming most likely would have pace and timing of investment in our non-utility businesses. Showing that over the last few years and historically low interest rate environment we think rate for the financial results and our utility customers. With the refinancing done in low interest rate environment, we have saved more than $100 million of finalize interest expense since 2010. 
I know everyone wants to get to the Q&A portion of the call so let me wrap up on Slide 29 then we'll take your questions. 2014 was a very good year and we are well-positioned to have a successful 2015. DTE delivered on its growth targets over the years, actually exceeding our targets. We've provided nearly 7% annual EPS growth over the last 5 years. Our 2015 EPS guidance provide a 5.5% growth over 2014 segments after adjusting for the unusually cold weather in 2014. Part of our shareholder value creation is to continue to grow our current dividend with earnings. Our EPS growth coupled with our dividend have historically delivered total shareholder return above utility indices. As we laid out for you at EEI and now on this call, we have been put investment opportunities within our 2 utilities, Gas Midstream businesses and Power & Industrial project business. Collectively, these businesses will continue to have a clear line of sight of growth opportunities in front of them. Of that growth, which is the bulk of our growth over the next 5 years, our utility growth, I mean, is occurring in and growing Michigan economy and constructive and legislative environment. We know we have to earn this constructive environment every day. Our work on operational excellence, cost management and customer satisfaction will do good things for our customers and help ensure we keep that constructive regulation. So with that, I'll wrap it up, and thank you for joining us this morning, and Dana will now open for questions."

But in addition to that, my service, up with its capacity projections for the Midwest, the upper portion of my -- and the place where there's a capacity shortfall is Michigan. And MISO is projected at 3 gigawatts in Michigan. So in addition to the EPA actions, Michigan needs to act because it has a capacity shortage in 2016. And not surprisingly, the amount of that capacity short is pretty much one-to-one with what the retail access load or choice load on the state is. Because we and consumers are building for our customers and nobody's planning for building for those retail access customers. So that's come into the lands as well that the state needs to act to address that capacity shortfall in 2016 and that needs to be clear who's responsible for that. So that's a timing driver to that I think that's got a lot of people realizing that we can wait on the EPA. Even EPA if you think about it, we need to move now to the process in place because the EPA regulation finalize this late summer. We have probably 2 years then to submit plans. And the fact that you are submitting plans means that you've been through some process where you believe that you've come to agreement with stakeholders to actually build what you have in your plan. Well, there's a lot of neat stuff to happen over the next couple of years to come to agreement a big capital expenditures to pull that off. Everything that we build takes 3 or 5 years and the EPA has a midterm compliance date of 2020. That comes couple of years after we will now put our plans together. So anybody who thinks about this very long realizes that most companies are already, should already feel like they're up against it in terms of timing. And that's true in Michigan us well. And I think the folks who are spending some time with energy are beginning to realize that there is no luxury of additional time we need to act. So I think all of that's coming to drive the timing of this, Dan, that's positive. What I expect is that the governor will give address here in March. Actually roads valid initiative to raise money to fix the roads here that will occupy a lot of folks in the political arena in the early part of the year, that will play through and then I think both the governor and legislative leaders have said that energy becomes a principal priority, numerous people have spoken about trying to knock it off by midyear so we would expect that there will be a pretty point of discussion in the second quarter about where to take energy policy."

We also have load voids along the path of the pipe that realized they could build out modest laterals and use the pipe for things that work for them.

And what they're trying to do by doing that is encourage deployment. I think our state and our administration want to see good high-quality energy efficiency investments deployed in Michigan. So I am certain that it will be a core part of our response plan. And it's one of the ways, frankly, you can keep their rate impacts of this and affordability impact for customers more manageable. So what we're working hard to think about that rate energy efficiency investments. In terms of the impacts on growth, you've seen on country that it's muted slowed and in some cases put a slight negative on growth. A lot of basis been at that's this a long time. It does flatten growth, which is a good thing but it generally doesn't put it into -- I'm talking electric now, the said put it into a kind of a secular decline like you saw in the gas industry where there were significant volume reductions over time. I don't expect that in the electric industry because we keep adding electric and use load. And so the 2 are really offset each other. And so while we expect modest growth to flat growth in our electric demand, we don't expect decline and so we think that were going to -- we build the capacity we're expected to build out of the order of what we're dealing with now plus is a bit. That could be impacted by things like automotive load should think. If you get close some of the folks who know the standards, there's a lot of thought that as you it into later year in standard that's going to be hard to comply without shifts of petroleum into electric. And if that happens, in that really affects demand for electricity. So although sorts of things will affect it in the end and I hope that answered your question."

And good morning to all of you, and thanks for joining us. I think I'm going to be able to give you a very positive assessment, both of what we accomplished this past year and what we feel we're positioned to deliver this year in 2015. 
So the agenda for the call is laid out on Slide 4. I'm going to begin with a look back on the past year, and then I'll provide summary of energy policy developments, both in Michigan and in Washington, and I will wrap up my comments by taking you through a long-term out -- growth update. And then, I'll turn things over to Peter Oleksiak to provide a financial update and some closing thoughts. 
So I'm going to frame my look back on 2014 within DTE Energy's system of priorities, and those priorities are laid out on Slide 5. Those of you who've been on this call in recent years should recognize this system of priorities. It does describe the way we think about our company and the way we run our company. And I'll take you through it briefly just to refamiliarize yours -- refamiliarize you.
So we start things with our employees. And this is a core focus for the company. With a simple common sense, and it's hard to create a great company if your culture and the energy of your people isn't great. If you get that right, you can translate that into great customer service and to great continuous improvement and management of your costs. And you could also translate it into people who are willing to work hard to grow your company. And if you get those right, then I think great customer service and good management of costs and growth that plays into, for example, the state of Michigan's economic development agenda, give you a good chance to shape a political and regulatory context that's constructive for the company. And if you combine a constructive regulatory context with a good growth strategy, we have a chance to produce really strong outcomes for you. And for us, that means consistent, predictable 5% to 6% or more annual earnings growth, combined with an attractive dividend and a strong balance sheet. 
So let me take you through the results around each of these priorities in the next few slides beginning on Slide 6 as a way of looking back on this past year's accomplishments. 
Starting with our employees. So we ranked in the top decile of Gallup's employee engagement survey. Gallup does this all over the globe. And we entered the top decile for the first time in our company's history. And I know at our year-end Christmas party this past year, I picked out a couple of things that I was proudest of from 2014, and this was one of the 2 because I think it's a big deal for us to continue this sort of performance that we've had over the past 6 years. 
We also earned our second consecutive Gallup Great Workplace Award. We were top quartile for the second year in a row in our industry with safety results. 
And we also have the National Safety Council rank us in the top 5% of 672 companies that they work with nationally, and they really looked at safety culture. So I think this was another important outcome for us. 
On the continuous improvement front, interestingly, the Project Management Institute, which is another one of these large global institutes, named DTE one of 3 finalists for their global project management award. So I can tell you that we haven't always been this way. In fact, 6 or 8 years ago, I can remember our first ranking on their 0 to 5 scale, and we ranked a zero. And it was at that point that we challenged our people to turn our ability to manage large projects into a world-class process, and they have worked on it hard since then, and interesting to see them start at zero and end up as a finalist for topping the -- top of the list, so to speak. 
This continuous improvement mindset is translating to our O&M expenses. Again, our expenses this past year were flat to 2008 levels. It really comes through a lot of CI work around the company. And so that ranks us again among the top of the peer group in our industry on O&M reductions. 
On the customer satisfaction front, we had some good news this past year. Our Gas business ranked number one for both residential and business customer satisfaction. And both of those are firsts for our company, first time ever that we've been top of the list. We've been targeting this very explicitly with our employees, so it's great to achieve it. 
Our Electric residential satisfaction is now third in our peer group. And we're pretty clear with our employees that we want to take that to where the Gas business is. What we need to do to get it there is primarily to invest in strengthening our electric system. Reliability is our primary gap to the top one in that satisfaction survey, so we are, therefore, investing in reliability. 
Moving to Slide 7, on the political and regulatory front. I really do feel there's positive momentum on Michigan's energy policy. I'll discuss that here in a few minutes, so I won't dwell on it now. 
We did, this past year, file our first electric rate case in 4 years that will play out here in 2015. We reduced average customer rates last year by 6% in January of '14. We reduced rates another 6% actually in January of '15. So that's a good thing to have rates going down. 
And then, we had Michigan spend, and that spend with Michigan suppliers, it says $900 million. Actually, we just closed the books on the numbers, $922 million. We started some years back in 2010 at about half that level. It's been a great way for us to play into the economic development and job creation agenda of the state. 
On the growth front, we invested over $2 billion this past year, more than double our depreciation levels. We had $1.8 billion in the utilities. One of our significant projects was the Echo Wind Park, that was a 112-megawatt wind park, that pushed us right to our 10% on the Renewable Portfolio Standard here in the state. We made fundamental progress on the NEXUS Pipeline. I will discuss that in more detail here in a few minutes. We're very active around the Bluestone pipeline in Pennsylvania. That was a significant area of investment last year and it will be this year as well. We relocated our eighth REF unit and we have the ninth one underway, and we should be able to bring that online this year. 
On the financial front, our operating EPS came in at $4.60. Our revised guidance late last year was $4.52, so we came in at the high-end of our guidance range. We began last year with guidance of $4.30, so we cleared that by a pretty healthy margin. We did earn our allowed ROE, both our gas and electric utilities. And our total shareholder return for the 1-, 3- and 5-year timeframes for all top quartile. And we were able to increase the dividend 5.3% as well. 
So I look back, I feel we had a great year in 2014. And I also feel great about the way that we're positioned for 2015. 
So moving on to Slide 8. I am now going to turn to an update on energy policy, both in Michigan and Washington. And I will start that look on Slide 9. 
I just want to begin by saying that Michigan continues to have what I consider to be a sound, balanced political and regulatory context. I think the state is working hard to behave that way, to behave in a way that's productive for growth and productive for business. 
In addition to their normal workload, several of our public service commissioners are giving a significant amount of time to helping the state conceptualize good future energy policy. So for example, Chairman Quackenbush is an important advisor to the Governor and the Governor's team as they think through policy options. In fairness to Governor Snyder, he made it clear that updating energy policy is an important legislative priority for him this year. He called out the need for new legislation in his State of the State Address. And in doing that, he highlighted the significant transformation in generation sources that our state will undertake over the next 10 to 15 years. And as is his nature, Governor Snyder has carefully studied energy issues. He's given a lot of thought to future energy policy in our state. And so, I feel fortunate to have him leading as we shape policy that's really going to carry Michigan through a important period of evolution in the state's energy sector. 
We also have good leadership in both the House and the Senate on policy. And so, I'll move to Slide 10 to talk about some of the players. 
Senator Mike Nofs, pictured on the left there, is an extremely seasoned hand when it comes to energy policy. Mike chairs the Senate Energy and Technology Committee. He was one of the principal architects of Michigan's 2008 energy legislation. He was in the House then. But Senator Nofs thoroughly understands the issues facing our state and the policies that we need to address them. 
Representative Aric Nesbitt is also a very knowledgeable and experienced leader on energy issues. Aric chairs the House Energy Policy Committee. He did that last term as well. So he's well up the curve, and I'm confident that he also thoroughly understands the future energy policy needs of our state. 
And finally, Governor Snyder recently appointed Valerie Brader to head the newly formed agency on energy. The Governor formed a new agency to better coordinate the various parts of state government involved in developing and executing energy policy. And Valerie is a trusted and very confident aide to the Governor and, I think, a very good choice for this role. She's been very close to energy issues through the Governor's first term and that continues into his second term. 
So bottom line, as we head into a really important energy policy and set of energy legislation deliberations this year, we have a really good group of leaders working the issue. And I think that bodes very well for constructive legislation as an outcome. 
Now in terms of the nature of the legislation, fundamentally, our state needs to do 2 things. And I think will be the focus of legislation. First, we need to address the remaining retail access in the Michigan market. And I think that all of the principal players in the discussion understand that clearly. 
And second, we need to establish a well-defined process for defining and approving the many investments that our state will make over the next 15 years to update and transform our power plant fleet. So it really going to need a process for thinking through the right portfolio mix, approving those investments, being flexible to change the investments late -- and redefine it as we -- as new knowledge comes on board and so forth. That process is not defined for the state simply because we haven't been through a transformation of this scale in a long, long time, and so we need to put that in place. And I also think the policymakers understand and have their eye on that. 
Now the power plant fleet transformation that I described is laid out on Slide 11. That transformation, of course, is driven by EPA's 111(d) regulation. That regulation will be finalized late summer this year. I am spending a lot of time in Washington trying to ensure that, principally, that the final regulation is workable in terms of its reliability impacts and its impacts on customers rates. And both of these issues are really a question of pace not the ultimate endpoint. And I do sense that the EPA and the administration are listening to input on this front. So I'm hopeful that we can have the regulation brought to a point that works for companies like ours. 
For Michigan as you can see, on the right-hand side of this slide, 111(d) will lead to a significant shift away from coal to a much heavier share of gas and renewables. And this mix shift will require an investment in our state on the order of $15 billion, $7 billion to $8 billion of that will be by DTE Energy and thus, the need for updated energy policy in the state. It's a big transformation akin to what happened back in the 1970s and '80s. 
So moving on to Slide 12. I'm now going to shift gears and provide an update on our long-term growth and investment prospects, and I'll start that discussion on Slide 13. As I mentioned earlier, we had a strong finish to 2014. Our earnings finished at $4.60 a share, up about 12.5% over the prior year. Peter's going to give you more color on this in a minute. But I think it's fair to say that every one of our business units turned in a strong performance this past year. 
Back in the fall of 2014, we provided an early outlook, EPS guidance for this year of $4.55. We're now increasing that guidance to $4.60. Again, Peter will give you more depth on that new guidance in a minute. But one way to look at it is that our guidance implies that the weather and trading upside that we saw in 2014 will now be internalized into core long-term growth in 2015. 
We also continued our dividend growth in 2014, as you see at the bottom of the slide. We have consistently said that as we grow our earnings, we intend to grow our dividend in parallel, and that's certainly still the plan. 
As you know, our stated goal for many years has been to grow our EPS and our dividend at 5% to 6% per year in a highly predictable and highly reliable fashion. Our actual earnings growth, as you can see at the top right of the slide, has been higher than that. It's been closer to 7%. And I think we're in a position to continue this strong earnings growth, which is where I want to turn my attention to now. 
So as you can see on Slide 14, we are going to be pursuing a very full investment agenda over the next 5 years. Capital expenditures from 2015 to 2019 are projected to average to $2.3 billion a year, which is by far the highest 5-year average in DTE Energy's history. Our projected capital expenditures for this year, $2.6 billion, is also a record level. We've never been actually near that level. So we are clearly in the heart of a heavy capital investment era at the company. And as you can see from the graphic, each of our 4 growth business -- growth businesses is going to contribute to this investment and growth. 
The heaviest investment, both this year and over the next 5, will be in our Electric business. And contributing to that investment this year is our acquisition of the 700-megawatt gas-fired Renaissance power plant. We closed that acquisition in January. We also do have a second RFP out for another gas-fired plant. We do expect to act on that this year as well. 
Well, as we make those investments in our utilities, we are intensely focused on keeping the rate impacts modest. I think we believe as a company that it will be those companies who manage the rate impacts of a heavy investment era well that will emerge as the winners for shareholders. So we're very focused on managing the rate impacts. 
On Slide 15, clearly, these investments, plus general inflation, put upward pressure on rates. But we have a number of factors at work that are offsetting that upward pressure. So in addition to the continuous improvement in cost management that I discussed earlier, there are over $600 million in surcharges that have rolled off in our Electric business over the past 2 years. And as a result, we were able to lower average rates by 6% last January and by 6% again this January. 
In addition, we've been working with our legislature and commission on revised business cost of service rates. And the result of both the rate reductions and that work is that many of our large energy-intensive companies will see rate reductions of 15% to 20% between 2013 and 2015. 
We did file our first electric rate case in 4 years in December of last year. And I think we're just pleased that this rate increase request will be playing out within the broader context of falling rates as I just described. 
In our Gas utility, our gas main renewal and meter replacement programs are covered by an Infrastructure Recovery Mechanism. And as a result of that, we don't expect to need to file a gas rate case until 2016 or 2017. 
So turning now from our utilities to our non-utility businesses. One area of continued significant investment and growth is our Gas Storage & Pipelines business. And Slide 16 lays out the footprint of that business. 
Our current footprint extends essentially from Chicago to New York City. The Millennium Pipeline, the Bluestone Pipeline and the Bluestone Gathering System, which are on the eastern end of this footprint, were areas of significant investment activity for us this past year driven by drilling in the Marcellus Shale, and we do expect that to continue this year. Our gathering activity, for example, will be kind of full throttle. 
However, I want to focus my comments today on 2 assets on the western end of the footprint: The proposed NEXUS Pipeline and the Vector Pipeline. Vector transports gas between Chicago and the Michigan and Ontario markets. 
Moving on to Slide 17, we made a lot of progress over the past year in developing the NEXUS Pipeline. I just want to review a little bit of that with you. So agreements were executed with LDCs and several producers in the Utica region that underpinned the pipe. And those agreements put us in a position to move forward and we are moving forward. We recently ramped up a supplemental open season. That open season focused on interest shippers were expressing in additional receipt points. So for example, receipt points upstream of Kensington, Ohio, on Texas Eastern. We were also responding to interest in potential laterals from NEXUS to additional load that the pipe that might serve. 
We also, over the past year, completed interconnect agreements for NEXUS with key pipelines, including Vector, including the DTE system among them. 
And then finally and more recently, we submitted our prefiling. We have engaged an EPC contractor that was announced yesterday, Fluor will play that role. And we are right in the middle of public outreach activities. Those are well underway too. 
So given all of that, we now have serious engineering work on the pipe underway, and we expect to have the bulk of that engineering completed by the fall of this year. And we expect our final FERC application this fall as well. 
Now, with respect to Vector, many of you are aware that we recently ramped up an open season for that pipe as well. And I'm pleased with the results. Both NEXUS and the Rover Pipeline signed 15-plus year long-term agreements with Vector. And those agreements put the pipe on strong financial footing for the foreseeable future. A number of the existing shippers on Vector did not renew capacity commitments. So we did not, in the end, need to expand the pipe to accommodate NEXUS and Rover. 
So I think if you look forward, the growth and expansion of the Vector pipeline, over time, is now linked to the growth and expansion of NEXUS, Rover and, generally, to supply from the Utica Shale region. And given that, that supply is expected to, by almost everybody who's looked at it, expected to expand at a rapid pace. We would think that Vector will benefit from that. 
Moving on to Slide 18. You see laid out here the earnings expectations for the Gas Storage & Pipeline business. Earnings were $82 million this past year. We are targeting $145 million by 2019. Anything showed in color is earnings that we feel we have locked in with existing projects and assets. We do have $10 million there for additional development, but it's not a very big bogey over a 5-year period. So we hope we can do at least that, if not better. 
You can see that the pipeline platform is slated to more than double over the next 5 years. The gathering platform doubles as well. We have a little bit of shrinkage in the storage platform, that's what the forward show, although I must say that, I think, as all the various changes in the gas markets play out, I'm hopeful for storage, but we market to the forwards. 
I'm going to turn now to our Power & Industrial business on Slide 19. We're active in 3 lines of business in this unit. One of those is Industrial Energy Services, where we provide on-site services for large industrials and other large users of energy. In that business line, we have several cogeneration projects that are currently under development. We brought one online this past year. We have several more in development, one sizable one that's late stage. So we expect that to be a good area of growth for this business line in the years ahead. 
In the Renewable arena, we operate wood-fired and landfill gas-fired power plants. Growth here will come from expanded output at existing assets. So for example, we had a plant last year that was brought online at partial year, and the full year performance will expand earnings. We also brought on several large landfill gas sites this past year. So it's that sort of organic growth that's growing this line of business. 
Finally, Reduced Emission Fuels, where we reduced emissions from coal-fired plants. We brought on the eighth unit last year. The ninth unit is in late-stage negotiations. We expect that plant operating by midyear 2015. 
And on Slide 20, you see the earnings expectations for the Power & Industrial business. So P&I earned $90 million this past year. We expect it to grow to $145 million, projected at $90 million to $100 million this year, growing to $145 million. Again, anything you see in solid colors are projects that we have in hand so the -- we expect that, that growth will come. We do have a $20 million new development bogey that would be filled by things like the cogeneration projects that I mentioned earlier. So we feel good about achieving this as well. 
So that wraps up my comments, and I'm going to turn things over to Peter Oleksiak now for a financial update. Peter, over to you."

Everyone who dials in on a regular basis just all know that I'd like to give a quick shout out to our Detroit Tigers. I feel compelled to do that here. Actually, one week, exactly one week away saw spring train",1505,"Thanks, Gerry, and good morning to everyone. Everyone who dials in on a regular basis just all know that I'd like to give a quick shout out to our Detroit Tigers. I feel compelled to do that here. Actually, one week, exactly one week away saw spring training starts. So noble predictions, cautiously optimistic and we'll provide an update or an early season update in the first quarter call. 
So with that, after a commercial break, I'd like to start with our financial update and our year-end results in Slide 22. As Gerry mentioned earlier, DTE Energy's 2014 operating earnings were $4.60 per share. For a detailed breakdown of EPS by segment, please refer to the appendix, Slide 32. The appendix also includes a reconciliation to GAAP reported earnings. 
Slide 22 shows our year-over-year operating earnings by segment. I will focus on the middle column, which is the 2014 results. Let me start first with the total earnings for our growth segments. 
2014 operating earnings of $796 million were up $73 million or $0.37 per share. Our largest subsidiary, DTE Electric, earned $528 million and was up $44 million over last year, driven by a revenue decoupling amortization in the first half of the year and lower O&M expenses driven by reduced benefit costs and lean actions taken in the second half of the year. 2014 was a great year for electric utility given the weather-related challenges it faced. It was also the final year of a 4-year rate case layout [ph] strategy. 
DTE Gas 2014 earnings of $140 million were just below 2013 earnings as colder winter weather was more than offset by higher O&M expenses, including reinvestment. The appendix contains detailed year-over-year earning walks for -- to utilities. 
Moving down the page. Our Gas Storage & Pipelines earnings of $82 million were $12 million higher than 2013. This increase was driven by higher short-term weather-related storage earnings and also continued growth in our pipeline and gathering earnings. Earnings for the year in the segment were partially offset by the ongoing impact of the accounting change related to one of our pipeline investments. 
Earnings for our Power & Industrial Projects segments of $90 million were up $20 million from 2013. This increase was driven primarily by higher Reduced Emissions Fuel earnings that were mainly onetime in nature. 
In total, operating earnings for our growth segments were $4.48 per share, up 9% from $4.11 per share in 2013. Overall, 2014 was a great year for growth segments. 
To round out our operating earnings, we include the results of our Energy Trading business. At Energy Trading, 2014 earnings were $20 million, up from a $3 million loss in 2013, driven by accounting recognition of the strong economic performance. The economic contribution for 2014 was over double our targeted annual level of $20 million to $25 million, and that incremental performance flow through the accounting results.  Slide 38 of the appendix contains our standard Energy Trading reconciliation, joining both economic and accounting performance. 
Now let me move the discussion ahead to this year in Slide 23. As Gerry mentioned, we are raising our guidance midpoint for $4.55 per share to $4.60 per share. Slide 23 shows our updated operating earnings guidance for the 2015 by segment. We have a comparison here of our 2015 guidance, the far right column, compared to the 2015 early outlook, which is in the middle. I'm going to focus on where we have a green arrow on the page. 
The increase in guidance is mainly driven by our non-utilities. We're slightly increasing our Gas Storage & Pipeline guidance range based on higher expected earnings from -- for the Pipeline business. And we are increasing the guidance range for our Power & Industrial Projects segments by $5 million for strong performance in the Renewables businesses. 
So our earnings overall for our growth segments are expected to increase from $4.48 per share to $4.60. This represents a 5.5% growth when you factor weather and normalization. 
You see near the bottom of the page our comment of lower share issuance in 2015. Right now, we are targeting $200 million of equity issuance this year, which is $100 million lower than it was assumed in our early outlook. The driver of this change is a combination of strong 2014 cash and the recent extension of bonus depreciation. So the average shares outstanding for updated 2015 guidance is slightly lower than our early outlook. Both numbers round to 197 million shares. 
I just mentioned that the 2015 $4.60 EPS midpoint of guidance represents a 5.5% growth when 2014 weather is normalized. And the next page, Slide 24, lays out this comparison. The left side of the chart starts with 2014 actual growth segment results then walk [ph] to the 2015 midpoint, including the change for weather. As you all know, 2014 was one of the coldest winters on record, providing favorability at our gas utility. This weather impact was a positive $0.12 for 2014. You can see in the next 2 columns that the growth year-over-year consists of $0.20 per share of utilities and $0.04 per share at our non-utilities. 
Earlier, I mentioned strong 2014 cash flows, and we can see this on Slide 25. In 2014, our cash from operations was $1.8 billion, down from 2013 levels, but $200 million higher than our original 2014 guidance. The decrease year-over-year was primarily driven by lower surcharge collections and higher purchase power costs at DTE Electric. Capital spending was higher in 2014 due to increased investment at our DTE Electric. Overall, free cash flow is down from 2013, but $400 million higher than original guidance. 
Looking forward to this year, Slide 26 provides our cash flow guidance for 2015. We see lower cash from operations this year driven by the elimination of our securitization bond surcharge. The 15-year securitization bonds that facilitated the recovery of our then nuclear plant assets are now fully recovered. 
On average, our Electric customers saw a 6% decrease in their rates in the month of January. We look to significantly increase capital expenditures in 2015 due to increased generation investment at the utilities and growth projects at our non-utility businesses. 
Earlier, Gerry described our investment in DTE Electric as we move to transition our generation from coal to natural gas renewables. In 2015, we are making investments in natural gas generation to shore up our summer capacity short fall. 
The strong 2014 cash flow performance has set us up nicely for 2015. And on the next slide, 27, you can see that our balance sheet remains strong, with leverage at FFO metrics at or above targets. We plan to continue our focus on balance sheet strength in 2015. 
We did achieve our target of zero equity issuance in 2014. And as I mentioned previously, we are targeting $200 million of equity issuance in 2015, down from the $300 million in our early outlook. We look to issue $800 million to $900 million of equity over the next 3-year period, 2015 to 2017, with the swing most likely with the pace and timing of investment in our non-utility businesses. 
Issuing debt over the last few years in this historically low interest rate environment have been great for the financial results and our utility customers. With the refinancing done in this low interest rate environment, we have saved more than $100 million of annualized interest expense since 2010. 
I know everyone wants to get to the Q&A portion of the call, so let me wrap up on Slide 29, then we'll take your questions. 
2014 was a very good year and we are well-positioned to have a successful 2015. DTE has delivered on its growth targets over the years, actually exceeding our targets. We have provided nearly 7% annual EPS growth over the last 5 years. Our 2015 EPS guidance provides a 5.5% growth over 2014 segments after adjusting for the unusually cold weather in 2014. Part of our shareholder value equation is to continue to grow our earn -- dividend with earnings. Our EPS growth, coupled with our dividend, has historically delivered total shareholder return above utility indices. 
As we laid out for you at EEI and now on this call, we have meaningful investment opportunities within our 2 utilities, our Gas Midstream businesses and our Power & Industrial Projects business. Collectively, these businesses will continue to have a clear line of sight of growth opportunities in front of them. 
Our ledger growth, which is the bulk of our growth over the next 5 years -- our utility growth, I mean, is occurring in a growing Michigan economy and constructive regulatory and legislative environment. We know we have to earn this constructive environment every day. Our work on operational excellence, cost management and customer satisfaction will do good things for our customers, and help make sure we keep that constructive regulation. 
So with that, I'll wrap it up, and thank you for joining us this morning. And Dana, we'll now be open for questions."

And what I meant to imply was that our work with Southwestern around Bluestone last year was just extremely busy. 
They, as they disclosed on their calls, really are focusing capital there because it's a good place for them to earn returns. And as they focus their drilling there, we need to -- we're between them and the market. So we are extremely busy this past year. 
I will tell you that maybe the most important continuous improvement project we had in our company this year was driving down gathering costs for Southwestern and becoming best in industry in undertaking that, because your ability to earn additional opportunities with gatherers is driven by how well you do it and never being in their way in terms of getting to market and just being consistent. 
We did, as you know, I think, expand our agreement with them. So that will be leading to other activity with them in that region in a expanded geography, so that's going to keep us busy for the next couple of years. And we do, in that business line, have an explicit goal to take the skill set that we have developed in Michigan and are working there in Pennsylvania to places like the Utica Shale and, more broadly, in the Marcellus Shale. So that's probably what I was getting at."

And I think the future growth of Vector really now comes as NEXUS and Rover mature and as volumes grow in the Utica and -- if you look at anybody's projections of the Utica, they're going to see aggressive growth there. And we fully expect that -- those volumes to go both north and south and to the mid-Atlantic, but a healthy portion will find their way north because they're good markets and recently have had a good basis differential. So we'd expect as the overall volumes of the region grow, we'll get our portion of those and that's really what will drive Vector's growth. 
In terms of timeframe, most of the projections you see of that growth on Vector happen pretty -- or that growth in the Utica happen at a pretty aggressive pace over the next 5 years. So we don't have anything firm now, but we would expect, as that growth comes, that Vector should benefit."

It's not like a big deal for our state, it's every state. But they're beginning to understand what a big deal it is for Michigan. 
But in addition to that, Dan, MISO has come out with its capacity projections for the midwest, the upper portion of MISO, and the place where there's a capacity shortfall is Michigan. And MISO has projected it at 3 gigawatts in Michigan. So in addition to the EPA actions, Michigan needs to act because it has a capacity shortage in 2016. 
And not surprisingly, the amount of that capacity short is pretty much one-to-one with what the retail access load or choice load in the state is because we and consumers are building for our customers, and nobody is planning for building for those retail access customers. So that's come in to the lens as well, that the state needs to act to address that capacity shortfall in 2016. And it needs to be clear about who's responsible for that. So that's a timing driver too. And I think it's got a lot of people realizing that we can't wait on the EPA. 
Even EPA, if you think about it, we need to move now to have the processes in place because this EPA regulation finalizes late summer. We have probably 2 years then to submit plans. And the fact that you're submitting plans means that you've been through some process where you believe that you've come to agreement with stakeholders to actually build what you have in your plan. Well, there's a lot that needs to happen over the next couple of years to come to an agreement on big capital expenditures to pull that off. 
Everything that we build takes 3 to 5 years, and the EPA has an interim compliance date of 2020. That comes a couple of years after we will have put our plans together. So anybody who thinks about this very long realizes that most companies are already -- should already feel like they're up against it in terms of timing. And that's true in Michigan as well.  And I think that the folks who are spending some time with energy are beginning to realize that there is no luxury of additional time. We need to act. So I think all of that is coming together to drive the timing of this, Dan. And that's positive. 
What I expect is that the Governor will give a address here in March. It was actually a roads ballot initiative to raise money to fix the roads here, that will occupy a lot of folks in the political arena in the early part of the year, that will play through. And then, I think, both the Governor and legislative leaders have said that energy becomes a principal priority. Numerous people have spoken about trying to knock it off by midyear, so we would expect that there will be a pretty point of discussion in the second quarter about where to take energy policy."

What I would characterize on the additional open season is that DTE -- and I expect it was very similar, we like to have 80% plus of the pipe contracted with firm contracts before we head into the engineering and construction. We, with the initial open season and the work we did this past year, we achieved that, so we're moving ahead. 
But on any of these pipelines, the process that of expanding take really happens continuously right through the day you start the pipe. And so as our pipe has become more real, and people realize we're moving ahead with it, people then begin to say, ""Well, maybe we ought to look at attachments."" 
So we, as I mentioned in my comments, we got interest in additional load upstream of the pipe, upstream from Kensington. We also have load points along the path of the pipe that realized they could build out modest laterals and use the pipe for things that work for them. So those are the sorts of things that are coming in. 
And I -- as we think about the pipe, we're really trying now to evaluate and finalize the ultimate capacity of the pipe. And the work we're doing with these additional expressions of interest is going to help us clarify just what final capacity we want for the pipe and so forth. 
So I hope that helps. I don't know that it's so much an expansion as it is trying to land on the capacity we built for the pipe and build additional support to undergird it."

Back when Vector was built, Canadian volumes flooding the Chicago market, and it was a pipe, in many ways, to take that gas into storage in Michigan and at Dawn.

And that play just really wasn't there or the same strength that it had in the past. So that was behind their not renewing.

It's clear from the way the EPA has handled energy efficiency, and if you're in the interworkings of the rule, they -- it's really a carbon intensity target, and they've put energy efficiency in the denominator, so it actually behaves like megawatts. And what they're trying to do by doing that is encourage deployment. 
I think our state and our administration want to see good high-quality energy efficiency investments deployed in Michigan. So I am certain that it will be a core part of our response plan. And it's one of the ways, frankly, you can keep the rate impacts of this and the affordability impacts for customers more manageable. So we're working hard to think about the rate -- energy efficiency investments. 
In terms of the impacts on growth, you've seen it around the country that it's muted, slowed and, in some cases, put a slight negative tilt on growth. In a lot places, they've been at this a long time, it does flatten growth, which is a good thing, but it generally doesn't put it into some -- I'm talking electric now, doesn't put it into a kind of a secular decline like you saw in the gas industry where there were significant volume reductions over time. I don't expect that in the electric industry because we keep adding electric and use load. And so the 2 are really offsetting each other. And so while we expect modest growth to flat growth in our electric demand, we don't expect decline. And so we think that were going to be -- we're build -- the capacity we're expecting to build out of is on the order of what we're dealing with now plus a bit. 
That could be impacted by things like automotive load shifting. If you get close to some of the folks who know the CAFE standards, there's a lot of thought that as you get into later years of the CAFE standards, it's going to be hard to comply without shift of petroleum into electric. And if that happens, that really affects demand for electricity. 
So all those sorts of things will affect it in the end. And I hope that answered your question."

And this is a core focus for the company, with a simple common sense that it's hard to create a great company if your culture and the energy of your people isn't great. If you get that right, you can translate that into great customer service and to great continuous improvement and management of your costs. And you can also translate it into people who are willing to work hard to grow your company. And if you get those right, then I think great customer service and good management of costs and growth that plays into, for example, the state of Michigan's economic development agenda, give you a good chance to shape a political and regulatory context that's constructive for the company. And if you combine a constructive regulatory context with a good growth strategy, we have a chance to produce really strong outcomes for you. And for us, that means consistent, predictable 5% to 6% or more annual earnings growth, combined with an attractive dividend and a strong balance sheet. 
So let me take you through the results around each of these priorities in the next few slides, beginning on Slide 6, as a way of looking back on this past year's accomplishments. 
Starting with our employees. So we ranked in the top decile of Gallup's employee engagement survey. Gallup does this all over the globe. And we entered the top decile for the first time in our company's history. And I know at our year-end Christmas party this past year, I picked out a couple of things that I was proudest of from 2014, and this was one of the 2. Because I think it's a big deal for us to continue this sort of performance that we've had over the past 6 years. 
We also earned our second consecutive Gallup Great Workplace Award. We were top quartile for the second year in a row in our industry with safety results. 
And we also have the National Safety Council rank us in the top 5% of 672 companies that they work with nationally, and they really look at safety culture. So I think this was another important outcome for us. 
On the continuous improvement front, interestingly, the Project Management Institute, which is another one of these large global institutes, named DTE one of 3 finalists for their global project management award. So I can tell you that we haven't always been this way. In fact, 6 or 8 years ago, I can remember our first ranking on their 0 to 5 scale, and we ranked a 0. And it was at that point that we challenged our people to turn our ability to manage large projects into a world-class process. And they have worked on it hard since then, and interesting to see them start at 0 and end up as a finalist for topping the -- top of the list, so to speak. 
This continuous improvement mindset is translating to our O&M expenses. Again, our expenses this past year were flat to 2008 levels. It really comes through a lot of CI work around the company. And so that ranks us again among the top of the peer group in our industry on O&M reductions. 
On the customer satisfaction front, we had some good news this past year. Our Gas business ranked #1 for both residential and business customer satisfaction. And both of those are firsts for our company -- first time ever that we've been top of the list. We've been targeting this very explicitly with our employees, so it's great to achieve it. 
Our Electric residential satisfaction is now third in our peer group. And we're pretty clear with our employees that we want to take that to where the Gas business is. What we need to do to get it there is primarily to invest in strengthening our electric system. Reliability is our primary gap to the top 1 in that satisfaction survey, so we are, therefore, investing in reliability. 
Moving to Slide 7, on the political and regulatory front. I really do feel there's positive momentum on Michigan's energy policy. I'll discuss that here in a few minutes, so I won't dwell on it now. 
We did, this past year, file our first electric rate case in 4 years. That will play out here in 2015. We reduced average customer rates last year by 6% in January of '14. We reduced rates another 6% actually in January of '15. So that's a good thing to have rates going down. 
And then, we had Michigan spend, and that's spend with Michigan suppliers, it says $900 million. Actually, we just closed the books on the numbers, $922 million. We started some years back in 2010 at about half that level. It's been a great way for us to play into the economic development and job creation agenda of the state. 
On the growth front, we invested over $2 billion this past year, more than double our depreciation levels. We had $1.8 billion in the utilities. One of our significant projects was the Echo Wind Park, that was a 112-megawatt wind park, that pushed us right to our 10% on the Renewable Portfolio Standard here in the state. We made fundamental progress on the NEXUS Pipeline. I will discuss that in more detail here in a few minutes. We're very active around the Bluestone pipeline in Pennsylvania. That was a significant area of investment last year, and it will be this year as well. We relocated our eighth REF unit, and we have the ninth one underway. And we should be able to bring that online this year. 
On the financial front, our operating EPS came in at $4.60. Our revised guidance late last year was $4.52, so we came in at the high end of our guidance range. We began last year with guidance of $4.30, so we cleared that by a pretty healthy margin. We did earn our allowed ROE at both our gas and electric utilities. And our total shareholder return for the 1-, 3- and 5-year timeframes were all top quartile. And we were able to increase the dividend 5.3% as well. 
So I look back on all that, I feel we had a great year in 2014. And I also feel great about the way that we're positioned for 2015. 
So moving on to Slide 8. I am now going to turn to an update on energy policy, both in Michigan and Washington. And I will start that look on Slide 9. 
I just want to begin by saying that Michigan continues to have what I consider to be a sound, balanced political and regulatory context. I think the state is working hard to behave that way, to behave in a way that's productive for growth and productive for business. 
In addition to their normal workload, several of our public service commissioners are giving a significant amount of time to helping the state conceptualize good future energy policy. So for example, Chairman Quackenbush is an important adviser to the Governor and the Governor's team as they think through policy options. And as for Governor Snyder, he made it clear that updating energy policy is an important legislative priority for him this year. He called out the need for new legislation in his State of the State Address. And in doing that, he highlighted the significant transformation in generation sources that our state will undertake over the next 10 to 15 years. And as is his nature, Governor Snyder has carefully studied energy issues. He's given a lot of thought to future energy policy in our state. And so I feel fortunate to have him leading as we shape policy that's really going to carry Michigan through an important period of evolution in the state's energy sector. 
We also have good leadership in both the House and the Senate on policy. And so I'll move to Slide 10 to talk about some of the players. 
Senator Mike Nofs, pictured on the left there, is an extremely seasoned hand when it comes to energy policy. Mike chairs the Senate Energy and Technology Committee. He was one of the principal architects of Michigan's 2008 energy legislation. He was in the House then. But Senator Nofs thoroughly understands the issues facing our state and the policies that we need to address them. 
Representative Aric Nesbitt is also a very knowledgeable and experienced leader on energy issues. Aric chairs the House Energy Policy Committee. He did that last term as well. So he's well up the curve. And I'm confident that he also thoroughly understands the future energy policy needs of our state. 
And finally, Governor Snyder recently appointed Valerie Brader to head the newly formed agency on energy. The Governor formed the new agency to better coordinate the various parts of state government involved in developing and executing energy policy. And Valerie is a trusted and very competent aide to the Governor and, I think, a very good choice for this role. She's been very close to energy issues through the Governor's first term and that continues into his second term. 
So bottom line, as we head into a really important energy policy and set of energy legislation deliberations this year, we have a really good group of leaders working the issue. And I think that bodes very well for constructive legislation as an outcome. 
Now in terms of the nature of the legislation, fundamentally, our state needs to do 2 things. And I think will be the focus of legislation. First, we need to address the remaining retail access in the Michigan market. And I think that all of the principal players in the discussion understand that clearly. 
And second, we need to establish a well-defined process for defining and approving the many investments that our state will make over the next 15 years to update and transform our power plant fleet. So it -- really going to need a process for thinking through the right portfolio mix, approving those investments, being flexible to change the investment slate and redefine it as we -- as new knowledge comes on board and so forth. That process is not defined for the state simply because we haven't been through a transformation of this scale in a long, long time. And so we need to put that in place. And I also think the policymakers understand and have their eye on that. 
Now the power plant fleet transformation that I described is laid out on Slide 11. That transformation, of course, is driven by EPA's 111(d) regulation. That regulation will be finalized late summer this year. I am spending a lot of time in Washington trying to ensure that, principally, that the final regulation is workable in terms of its reliability impacts and its impacts on customers rates. And both of these issues are really a question of pace not the ultimate endpoint. And I do sense that the EPA and the administration are listening to input on this front. So I'm hopeful that we can have the regulation brought to a point that works for companies like ours. 
For Michigan as you can see, on the right-hand side of this slide, 111(d) will lead to a significant shift away from coal to a much heavier share of gas and renewables. And this mix shift will require an investment in our state on the order of $15 billion, $7 billion to $8 billion of that will be by DTE Energy, and thus the need for updated energy policy in the state. It's a big transformation, akin to what happened back in the 1970s and '80s. 
So moving on to Slide 12. I'm now going to shift gears and provide an update on our long-term growth and investment prospects, and I'll start that discussion on Slide 13. As I mentioned earlier, we had a strong finish to 2014. Our earnings finished at $4.60 a share, up about 12.5% over the prior year. Peter's going to give you more color on this in a minute. But I think it's fair to say that every one of our business units turned in a strong performance this past year. 
Back in the fall of 2014, we provided an early-outlook EPS guidance for this year of $4.55. We're now increasing that guidance to $4.60. Again, Peter will give you more depth on that new guidance in a minute. But one way to look at it is that our guidance implies that the weather and trading upside that we saw in 2014 will now be internalized into core long-term growth in 2015. 
We also continued our dividend growth in 2014, as you see at the bottom of the slide. We have consistently said that as we grow our earnings we intend to grow our dividend in parallel, and that's certainly still the plan. 
As you know, our stated goal for many years has been to grow our EPS and our dividend at 5% to 6% per year in a highly predictable and highly reliable fashion. Our actual earnings growth, as you can see at the top right of the slide, has been higher than that. It's been closer to 7%. And I think we're in a position to continue this strong earnings growth, which is where I want to turn my attention to now. 
So as you can see on Slide 14, we are going to be pursuing a very full investment agenda over the next 5 years. Capital expenditures from 2015 to 2019 are projected to average to $2.3 billion a year, which is by far the highest 5-year average in DTE Energy's history. Our projected capital expenditures for this year, $2.6 billion, is also a record level. We've never been actually near that level. So we are clearly in the heart of a heavy capital investment era at the company. And as you can see from the graphic, each of our 4 growth business -- growth businesses is going to contribute to this investment and growth. 
The heaviest investment, both this year and over the next 5, will be in our Electric business. And contributing to that investment this year is our acquisition of the 700-megawatt gas-fired Renaissance power plant. We closed that acquisition in January. We also do have a second RFP out for another gas-fired plant. We do expect to act on that this year as well. 
Well, as we make those investments in our utilities, we are intensely focused on keeping the rate impacts modest. I think we believe as a company that it will be those companies who manage the rate impacts of a heavy investment era well that will emerge as the winners for shareholders. So we're very focused on managing the rate impacts. 
On Slide 15, clearly these investments plus general inflation put upward pressure on rates. But we have a number of factors at work that are offsetting that upward pressure. So in addition to the continuous improvement in cost management that I discussed earlier, there are over $600 million in surcharges that have rolled off in our Electric business over the past 2 years. And as a result, we were able to lower average rates by 6% last January and by 6% again this January. 
In addition, we've been working with our legislature and commission on revised business cost of service rates. And the result of both the rate reductions and that work is that many of our large energy-intensive companies will see rate reductions of 15% to 20% between 2013 and 2015. 
We did file our first electric rate case in 4 years in December of last year. And I think we're just pleased that this rate increase request will be playing out within the broader context of falling rates as I just described. 
In our Gas utility, our gas main renewal and meter replacement programs are covered by an Infrastructure Recovery Mechanism. And as a result of that, we don't expect to need to file a gas rate case until 2016 or 2017. 
So turning now from our utilities to our non-utility businesses. One area of continued significant investment and growth is our Gas Storage & Pipelines business. And Slide 16 lays out the footprint of that business. 
Our current footprint extends essentially from Chicago to New York City. The Millennium Pipeline, the Bluestone Pipeline and the Bluestone Gathering System, which are on the eastern end of this footprint, were areas of significant investment activity for us this past year, driven by drilling in the Marcellus Shale. And we do expect that to continue this year. Our gathering activity, for example, will be kind of full throttle. 
However, I want to focus my comments today on 2 assets on the western end of the footprint: The proposed NEXUS Pipeline and the Vector Pipeline. Vector transports gas between Chicago and the Michigan and Ontario markets. 
Moving on to Slide 17. We made a lot of progress over the past year in developing the NEXUS Pipeline. I just want to review a little bit of that with you. So agreements were executed with LDCs and several producers in the Utica region that underpinned the pipe. And those agreements put us in a position to move forward, and we are moving forward. We recently ramped up a supplemental open season. That open season focused on interest shippers who were expressing in additional receipt points. So for example, receipt points upstream of Kensington, Ohio, on Texas Eastern. We were also responding to interest in potential laterals from NEXUS to additional load that the pipe might serve. 
We also, over the past year, completed interconnect agreements for NEXUS with key pipelines, including Vector, including the DTE system among them. 
And then finally and more recently, we submitted our FERC prefiling. We have engaged an EPC contractor. That was announced yesterday. Fluor will play that role. And we are right in the middle of public outreach activities. Those are well underway, too. 
So given all of that, we now have serious engineering work on the pipe underway, and we expect to have the bulk of that engineering completed by the fall of this year. And we expect our final FERC application this fall as well. 
Now with respect to Vector, many of you are aware that we recently wrapped up an open season for that pipe as well. And I'm pleased with the results. Both NEXUS and the Rover Pipeline signed 15-plus year long-term agreements with Vector. And those agreements put the pipe on strong financial footing for the foreseeable future. A number of the existing shippers on Vector did not renew capacity commitments. So we did not, in the end, need to expand the pipe to accommodate NEXUS and Rover. 
So I think if you look forward, the growth and expansion of the Vector pipeline over time, is now linked to the growth and expansion of NEXUS, Rover and, generally, to supply from the Utica Shale region. And given that, that supply is expected to, by almost everybody who's looked at it, expected to expand at a rapid pace, we would think that Vector will benefit from that. 
Moving on to Slide 18. You see laid out here the earnings expectations for the Gas Storage & Pipeline business. Earnings were $82 million this past year. We are targeting $145 million by 2019. Anything showed in color is earnings that we feel we have locked in with existing projects and assets. We do have $10 million there for additional development, but that's not a very big bogey over a 5-year period. So we hope we can do at least that, if not better. 
You can see that the pipeline platform is slated to more than double over the next 5 years. The gathering platform doubles as well. We have a little bit of shrinkage in the storage platform, that's what the forwards show. Although I must say that, I think, as all the various changes in the gas markets play out, I'm hopeful for storage, but we mark it to the forwards. 
I'm going to turn now to our Power & Industrial business on Slide 19. We're active in 3 lines of business in this unit. One of those is Industrial Energy Services, where we provide on-site services for large industrials and other large users of energy. In that business line, we have several cogeneration projects that are currently under development. We brought one online this past year. We have several more in development, one sizable one that's late-stage. So we expect that to be a good area of growth for this business line in the years ahead. 
In the Renewable arena, we operate wood-fired and landfill gas-fired power plants. Growth here will come from expanded output at existing assets. So for example, we had a plant last year that was brought online at a partial year, and with the full year performance will expand earnings. We also brought on several large landfill gas sites this past year. So it's that sort of organic growth that's growing this line of business. 
Finally, Reduced Emission Fuels, where we reduced emissions from coal-fired plants. We brought on the eighth unit last year. The ninth unit is in late-stage negotiations. We expect to have that plant operating by midyear 2015. 
And on Slide 20, you see the earnings expectations for the Power & Industrial business. So P&I earned $90 million this past year. We expect it to grow to $145 million -- projected at $90 million to $100 million this year, growing to $145 million. Again, anything you see in solid colors are projects that we have in hand so the -- we expect that, that growth will come. We do have a $20 million new development bogey that would be filled by things like the cogeneration projects that I mentioned earlier. So we feel good about achieving this as well. 
So that wraps up my comments, and I'm going to turn things over to Peter Oleksiak now for a financial update. Peter, over to you."

Everyone who dials in on a regular basis to this call knows that I like to give a quick shout out to our Detroit Tigers. I feel compelled to do that here. Actually, one week, exactly one week away saw spring training starts. So no Bowl predictions, cautiously optimistic, and we'll provide an update for an early season update in the first quarter call. 
So with that, short commercial break, I'd like to start with our financial update and our year-end results in Slide 22. As Gerry mentioned earlier, DTE Energy's 2014 operating earnings were $4.60 per share. For a detailed breakdown of EPS by segment, please refer to the appendix, Slide 32. The appendix also includes a reconciliation to GAAP reported earnings. 
Slide 22 shows our year-over-year operating earnings by segment. I will focus on the middle column, which is the 2014 results. Let me start first with the total earnings for our growth segments. 
2014 operating earnings of $796 million were up $73 million or $0.37 per share. Our largest subsidiary, DTE Electric, earned $528 million and was up $44 million over last year, driven by our revenue decoupling amortization in the first half of the year and lower O&M expenses driven by reduced benefit costs and Lean actions taken in the second half of the year. 2014 was a great year for our electric utility given the weather-related challenges it faced. It was also the final year of a 4-year rate case layout [ph] strategy. 
DTE Gas 2014 earnings of $140 million were just below 2013 earnings, as colder winter weather was more than offset by higher O&M expenses, including reinvestment. The appendix contains detailed year-over-year earning walks [ph] for our 2 utilities. 
Moving down the page. Our Gas Storage & Pipelines earnings of $82 million were $12 million higher than 2013. This increase was driven by higher short-term weather-related storage earnings and also continued growth in our pipeline and gathering earnings. Earnings for the year in this segment were partially offset by the ongoing impact of the accounting change related to one of our pipeline investments. 
Earnings for our Power & Industrial Projects segments of $90 million were up $20 million from 2013. This increase was driven primarily by higher Reduced Emissions Fuel earnings that were mainly onetime in nature. 
In total, operating earnings for our growth segments were $4.48 per share, up 9% from $4.11 per share in 2013. Overall, 2014 was a great year for our growth segments. 
To round out our operating earnings, we include the results of our Energy Trading business. At Energy Trading, 2014 earnings were $20 million, up from a $3 million loss in 2013, driven by accounting recognition of the strong economic performance. The economic contribution for 2014 was over double our targeted annual level of $20 million to $25 million, and that incremental performance flowed through the accounting results.  Slide 38 of the appendix contains our standard Energy Trading reconciliation, showing both economic and accounting performance. 
Now let me move the discussion ahead to this year in Slide 23. As Gerry mentioned, we are raising our guidance midpoint for $4.55 per share to $4.60 per share. Slide 23 shows our updated operating earnings guidance for the 2015 by segment. We have a comparison here of our 2015 guidance, the far right column, compared to the 2015 early outlook, which is in the middle. I'm going to focus on where we have a green arrow on the page. 
The increase in guidance is mainly driven by our non-utilities. We're slightly increasing our Gas Storage & Pipeline guidance range based on higher expected earnings from -- for the Pipeline business. And we are increasing the guidance range for our Power & Industrial Projects segments by $5 million for strong performance in the Renewables businesses. 
So our earnings overall for our growth segments are expected to increase from $4.48 per share to $4.60. This represents a 5.5% growth when you factor weather normalization. 
You see near the bottom of the page our comment of lower share issuance in 2015. Right now, we are targeting $200 million of equity issuance this year, which is $100 million lower than it was assumed in our early outlook. The driver of this change is a combination of strong 2014 cash and the recent extension of bonus depreciation. So the average shares outstanding for updated 2015 guidance is slightly lower than our early outlook. Both numbers round to 197 million shares. 
I just mentioned that the 2015 $4.60 EPS midpoint of guidance represents a 5.5% growth when 2014 weather is normalized. And the next page, Slide 24, lays out this comparison. The left side of the chart starts with 2014 actual growth segment results then walks [ph] to the 2015 midpoint, including the change for weather. As you all know, 2014 was one of the coldest winters on record, providing favorability at our gas utility. This weather impact was a positive $0.12 for 2014. You can see in the next 2 columns that the growth year-over-year consists of $0.20 per share at the utilities and $0.04 per share at our non-utilities. 
Earlier I mentioned strong 2014 cash flows, and we can see this on Slide 25. In 2014, our cash from operations was $1.8 billion, down from 2013 levels, but $200 million higher than our original 2014 guidance. The decrease year-over-year was primarily driven by lower surcharge collections and higher purchase power costs at DTE Electric. Capital spending was higher in 2014 due to increased investment at our DTE Electric. Overall, free cash flow is down from 2013, but $400 million higher than original guidance. 
Looking forward to this year, Slide 26 provides our cash flow guidance for 2015. We see lower cash from operations this year driven by the elimination of our securitization bond surcharge. The 15-year securitization bonds that facilitated the recovery of our then-nuclear plant assets are now fully recovered. 
On average, our Electric customers saw a 6% decrease in their rates in the month of January. We look to significantly increase capital expenditures in 2015 due to increased generation investment at the utilities and growth projects at our non-utility businesses. 
Earlier, Gerry described our investment in DTE Electric as we move to transition our generation from coal to natural gas renewables. In 2015, we are making investments in natural gas generation to shore up our summer capacity short fall. 
The strong 2014 cash flow performance has set us up nicely for 2015. And on the next slide, 27, you can see that our balance sheet remains strong, with leverage at FFO metrics at or above targets. We plan to continue our focus on balance sheet strength in 2015. 
We did achieve our target of 0 equity issuance in 2014. And as I mentioned previously, we are targeting $200 million of equity issuance in 2015, down from the $300 million in our early outlook. We look to issue $800 million to $900 million of equity over the next 3-year period, 2015 to 2017, with the swing most likely with the pace and timing of investment in our non-utility businesses. 
Issuing debt over the last few years in this historically low interest rate environment has been great for the financial results and our utility customers. With the refinancing done in this low interest rate environment, we have saved more than $100 million of annualized interest expense since 2010. 
I know everyone wants to get to the Q&A portion of the call, so let me wrap up on Slide 29, then we'll take your questions. 
2014 was a very good year, and we are well-positioned to have a successful 2015. DTE has delivered on its growth targets over the years, actually exceeding our targets. We have provided nearly 7% annual EPS growth over the last 5 years. Our 2015 EPS guidance provides a 5.5% growth over 2014 segments after adjusting for the unusually cold weather in 2014. Part of our shareholder value equation is to continue to grow our earn -- dividend with earnings. Our EPS growth, coupled with our dividend, has historically delivered total shareholder return above utility indices. 
As we laid out for you at EEI and now on this call, we have meaningful investment opportunities within our 2 utilities, our Gas Midstream businesses and our Power & Industrial Projects business. Collectively, these businesses will continue to have a clear line of sight of growth opportunities in front of them. 
Our electric growth, which is the bulk of our growth over the next 5 years -- our utility growth, I mean, is occurring in a growing Michigan economy and constructive regulatory and legislative environment. We know we have to earn this constructive environment every day. Our work on operational excellence, cost management and customer satisfaction will do good things for our customers and help make sure we keep that constructive regulation. 
So with that, I'll wrap it up, and thank you for joining us this morning. And Dana, we'll now be open for questions."

And what I meant to imply was that our work with Southwestern around Bluestone last year was, just say, extremely busy. 
They, as they have disclosed on their calls, really are focusing capital there because it's a good place for them to earn returns. And as they focus their drilling there, we need to -- we're between them and the market. So we were extremely busy this past year. 
I will tell you that maybe the most important continuous improvement project we had in our company this year was driving down gathering costs for Southwestern and becoming best-in-industry at undertaking that. Because your ability to earn additional opportunities with gatherers is driven by how well you do it and never being in their way in terms of getting to market and just being consistent. 
We did, as you know, I think, expand our agreement with them. So that will be leading to other activity with them in that region, in a expanded geography. So that's going to keep us busy for the next couple of years.

And I think the future growth of Vector really now comes as NEXUS and Rover mature and as volumes grow in the Utica and -- if you look at anybody's projections of the Utica, they're going to see aggressive growth there. And we fully expect that -- those volumes to go both north and south and to the mid-Atlantic, but a healthy portion will find their way north, because they're good markets and recently have had a good basis differential. So we'd expect as the overall volumes of the region grow, we'll get our portion of those, and that's really what will drive Vector's growth. 
In terms of timeframe, most of the projections you see of that growth on Vector happen pretty -- or that growth in the Utica happen at a pretty aggressive pace over the next 5 years. So we don't have anything firm now, but we would expect, as that growth comes, that Vector should benefit."

It's not like a big deal for our state, it's every state. But they're beginning to understand what a big deal it is for Michigan. 
But in addition to that, Dan, MISO has come out with its capacity projections for the Midwest, the upper portion of MISO, and the place where there's a capacity shortfall is Michigan. And MISO has projected it at 3 gigawatts in Michigan. So in addition to the EPA actions, Michigan needs to act because it has a capacity shortage in 2016. 
And not surprisingly, the amount of that capacity short is pretty much one-to-one with what the retail access load, or choice load, in the state is. Because we and consumers are building for our customers, and nobody is planning for building for those retail access customers. So that's come in to the lens as well, that the state needs to act to address that capacity shortfall in 2016. And it needs to be clear about who's responsible for that. So that's a timing driver, too. And I think it's got a lot of people realizing that we can't wait on the EPA. 
Even EPA, if you think about it, we need to move now to have the processes in place. Because this EPA regulation finalizes late summer. We have probably 2 years then to submit plans. And the fact that you're submitting plans means that you've been through some process where you believe that you've come to agreement with stakeholders to actually build what you have in your plan. Well, there's a lot that needs to happen over the next couple of years to come to an agreement on big capital expenditures to pull that off. 
Everything that we build takes 3 to 5 years, and the EPA has an interim compliance date of 2020. That comes a couple of years after we will have put our plans together. So anybody who thinks about this very long realizes that most companies are already -- should already feel like they're up against it in terms of timing. And that's true in Michigan as well.  And I think that the folks who are spending some time with energy are beginning to realize that there is no luxury of additional time. We need to act. So I think all of that is coming together to drive the timing of this, Dan. And that's positive. 
What I expect is that the Governor will give a address here in March. There was actually a roads ballot initiative to raise money to fix the roads here that will occupy a lot of folks in the political arena in the early part of the year. That will play through. And then, I think, both the Governor and legislative leaders have said that energy becomes a principal priority. Numerous people have spoken about trying to knock it off by midyear. So we would expect that there will be a pretty pointed discussion in the second quarter about where to take energy policy."

And we -- with the initial open season and the work we did this past year, we achieved that, so we're moving ahead. 
But on any of these pipelines, the process then of expanding take really happens continuously right through the day you start the pipe. And so as our pipe has become more real, and people realize we're moving ahead with it, people then begin to say, ""Well, maybe we ought to look at attachments."" 
So we, as I mentioned in my comments, we got interest in additional load upstream of the pipe, upstream from Kensington. We also have load points along the path of the pipe that realized they could build out modest laterals and use the pipe for things that worked for them. So those are the sorts of things that are coming in. 
And I -- as we think about the pipe, we're really trying now to evaluate and finalize the ultimate capacity of the pipe. And the work we're doing with these additional expressions of interest is going to help us clarify just what final capacity we want for the pipe and so forth.

It's clear from the way the EPA has handled energy efficiency, and if you're in the inner workings of the rule, they -- it's really a carbon intensity target, and they've put energy efficiency in the denominator, so it actually behaves like megawatts. And what they're trying to do by doing that is encourage deployment. 
I think our state and our administration want to see good, high-quality energy-efficiency investments deployed in Michigan. So I am certain that it will be a core part of our response plan. And it's one of the ways, frankly, you can keep the rate impacts of this and the affordability impacts for customers more manageable. So we're working hard to think about the right energy efficiency investments. 
In terms of the impacts on growth, you've seen it around the country that it's muted, slowed and, in some cases, put a slight negative tilt on growth. In a lot places that have been at this a long time, it does flatten growth, which is a good thing, but it generally doesn't put it into some -- I'm talking electric now, doesn't put it into a kind of a secular decline like you saw in the gas industry, where there were significant volume reductions over time. I don't expect that in the electric industry, because we keep adding electric end-use load. And so the 2 are really offsetting each other. And so while we expect modest growth to flat growth in our electric demand, we don't expect decline. And so we think that were going to be -- we're build -- the capacity we're expecting to build out is on the order of what we're dealing with now plus a bit. 
That could be impacted by things like automotive load shifting. If you get close to some of the folks who know the CAFE standards, there's a lot of thought that, as you get into later years of the CAFE standards, it's going to be hard to comply without shift of petroleum into electric. And if that happens, that really affects demand for electricity. 
So all those sorts of things will affect it in the end. And I hope that answered your question."

I hope everyone is enjoying the start of the spring season. This is definitely my favorite time of year. Like how the weather is gradually getting warmer, especially after going through another cold winter, as many of you know, the real reason I like this time of year is that it brings in another baseball season for my Detroit Tigers. As I said on the year-end call, I'll provide an update and I'm excited to report that the Tigers are starting out the season with one of the better records in baseball, and we just came off a pretty tough season with the New York Yankees, so hats off to the Yankees. There's a saying in baseball that you can't win the pennant in April, but you can lose it. The Tigers have set themselves up nicely the first month of the season. Sitting here in the middle of hockey, I also have to mention the Detroit Red Wings and the 24th consecutive playoff appearance, we are hoping for a deep run in the playoffs.
Now I'd like to transition from talking about the hot sports teams in Detroit to DTE. Let me start first by saying that DTE's position, certainly positioned to have a good year as well. Jeff and Mark will be going through first quarter results in more detail, but I'll just say that we had a very successful quarter and are on track to achieve our earnings and balance sheet targets in 2015. 
Before we move to quarter results, I would like to do a quick overview of our business strategy, as well as some highlights of what's happening at DTE and in Michigan. We can move on to Slide 5. This slide provides an overview of our business strategy and investment pieces. Our growth plan for the next 10 years at both utilities are highly visible. Our Electric utility growth is driven by environmental spend in the near term and renewal of our generation fleet in the longer term, which will be the natural replacement of our aging coal fleet. Our Gas utility growth is driven by infrastructure investments and the mainland pipe replacement. Complementing our utility growth are meaningful growth opportunities in the non-utility businesses, which provides diversity in earnings and geography. Our 2 utilities are deploying capital at a very constructive regulatory environment and we are working hard to earn this constructive environment everyday. Our efforts began with a highly engaged workforce. 
We found out last week that we won the Gallup Great Workplace Award. We're the only utility to win that award and actually 1 of 3 years in a row. We also have a continued focus on continuous improvement. The combination of these 2 and continuous improvement enables us to continue our cost savings track record and the utility's ability to consistently earn or operates returns. We also continued to focus on operational excellence and customer satisfaction that we believe are distinctive in our industry. We have certainly seen positive results on this front as currently, DTE Gas is ranked highest by JD Power among our peers for residential and business customer satisfaction. 
Our dividend continues to grow as we grow earnings and our goal is to maintain a strong BBB credit rating. This strategy provides for a consistent 5% to 6% annual EPS growth. 5, 6, gives you some highlights of progress in 2015. Let me start first with Michigan's energy policy. This is a major area of focus this year and I know that the people on this call are very interested in a status update. I feel there is positive momentum for construction legislation. We expect this to occur by the end of the year and quite possibly, by midyear. This is the priority of the governor and we call out publicly the need to get legislation done this year. The House lead, Aric Nesbitt, has introduced legislation and the Senate lead, Mike Nofs is about to. The process is in full motion. I'll touch more on energy policy in a few minutes. 
Quick update on the various rate filings for our 2 utilities. We expect the rate order for electric cost of service filing by June. This filing will deliver refined cost of service rates to our customers and our business customers will see sizable rate reductions. The rate case processes ongoing for electric general rate case filing to be put in at December of last year. This is the first rate case we have filed in 4 years and is predominantly a recovery of the $3 billion of capital investment deployed since our last filing. We expect to set complement rates in early July and receive a final order by the end of the year. For DTE Gas, we expect to receive an order this year for expanded Infrastructure Recovery Mechanism application. If it approved, while double the annual miles of our mainline replacement program. 
As you know DTE Electric completed the acquisition of a 700-megawatts gas-fired peaking plant earlier this year. We also received the results of our recent RFP for up to 350 megawatts of additional peaking generation, are currently in late stage negotiations. We look to announce the transaction next month and close this transaction later this year. With this purchase, our full service customers capacity requirements will be covered during the summer time frame. We felt it was very important to secure Michigan's base generation for our full service customers given the projected capacity shortfall in the state of Michigan next summer. On the non-utility front, we are definitely moving on all cylinders with progress on a number of projects and our gas storage and pipeline business, we are working through the details of a successful open season for The Millennium Pipeline. We have talked about this potential expansion given the need for the East Coast LDCs and the critical role the Millennium Pipeline plays in delivering Marcellus gas to market. This is another major milestone for Gas Pipeline business and helps firm up future year growth. We'll share the details of the expansion once we are through finalizing commercial terms of the contracts.
For our NEXUS Pipeline, we have enough commitments and additional prospects to move forward with a 1.5 BCF pipe. Currently, we are progressing through the FERC prefiling process quite nicely. Most recent activities around finalizing right aways and the final path for the pipe. Our goal is to file the FERC application early fourth quarter this year. We also expect the fourth quarter and service date for both the NEXUS Pipeline as well as the Millennium expansion I touched on earlier. In our Power & Industrial segment, we have a number of projects moving along including an 8 megawatts on-site cogeneration project that went into service this quarter. For our REF business, we spend a contract to operate a third-party REF facility that begins operations in the second quarter this year. This operating agreement will run through 2020 and is already included in the guidance we provided. Regarding area of relocations, we are continuing to work on the relocation of our ninth unit and expect this later this year, as well as potential optimization opportunities with our other units. We're off to a strong start across our portfolio of businesses and we are optimistic on having another successful year in 2015.
Let me now move to updates on Michigan economy and the update of energy policy legislation.
On the road, we get asked quite a bit on how the economy is progressing in Michigan and with the city of Detroit, but Slide 7 is a positive commercial update for both. We continue to see economic momentum in our state. Michigan's unemployment rate in March was 5.6%, which is the lowest since September 2001. Year-over-year, Michigan's unemployment rate has dropped a full 2 percentage points. This is the second-largest improvement in the country. We continue to see improvement in other economic indicators including increases in residential customer and business customer accounts, and our forecasts show this trend continuing. You can see on the page in Michigan is showing growth by moving up 8 spots in the state ranking of real gross domestic product. Michigan now is in the upper 50% of all states in terms of growth. 
I also want to highlight the city of Detroit economic rebirth. I believe the city has come along way since the bankruptcy filing in many fronts. One indicator that we show on this slide is that Detroit's metro area ranking #8 in the U.S. through the number of new expansion projects. This rebirth is largely due to the strong leadership we have in the city. Detroit mayor, Mike Dougan is very focused on the financial and operational strength of the city. DTE, as well as other city partners, are working with them to help continue this momentum. 
Moving on to Slide 8, I'm now going to turn to an update on energy policy. As I mentioned earlier Governor Schneider has made it clear that energy policy is important, legislative priority for him this year. We called out the need for new legislation in the state of the State Address and provide a more detailed goals in his energy message in March. Highlighting the significant transformation of the generation sources that are stable undertake over the next 10 to 15 years. Michigan also has strong leadership in both the House and the Senate and energy policy. Representative Aric Nesbitt chairs the House Energy Policy Committee. We're confident that he truly understands the future energy policy needs of our state. Representative Nesbitt introduced legislation in March that's consistent with the governor's goals of reliability and adaptability. We also recommended the elimination of the broken retail Lexus program we have here in Michigan, which we support. Senator Mike Nofs, chair the Senate at Energy and Technology Committee and is very seasoned when it comes to energy policy. He's one of the principal architects of the Michigan's 2008 energy legislation, as a member of the House back then. He will be introducing legislation shortly and a recent interview has indicated it will include design changes to the retail NEXUS program to make it more fair and also contain a longer-term generation integrated resource planning process, which will give us upfront review and approval of our coal plant retirement replacement. We expect legislation to be completed this year and I'm confident that Michigan had strong leaders in place that understand energy and utility dynamics, and will provide this year, constructive legislation for Michigan's future. 
In a minute, I'll turn the call over to Jeff and Mark to review the quarter results, but before that, I just want to highlight that we are on track to achieve our earnings guidance. 
So on Slide 9, the slide shows our EPS history and our target of 5% to 6% growth. I mentioned before, we expect to grow our dividend with earnings. The chart shows our current 2015 guidance midpoint of $4.60 with the next page showing our earnings guidance by segment. 
So you can see on Slide 10 that we are holding our EPS guidance range of $4.48 to $4.72 for 2015. The slide shows 2015 year-to-date actuals compared to the full year guidance. Just like last year, weather favorability help provide the strong quarter for the utilities, particularly on the gas side, as we again hit one of the coldest winters on record. Our non-utilities also had a strong first quarter. Jeff will take you through the details of our quarter results shortly. Last year, we will reserve this first quarter favorability as contingency for summer weather variability. So bottom line, there are no changes in guidance at this time, but we're off to a strong start. 
And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Jeff Jewell, our Vice President and Controller to provide more details in the first quarter results."

Let's turn to Slide 12 to review the quarterly earnings performance. For the quarter, DTE Energy's operating earnings were $1.65 per share and for reference, our reported earnings were $1.53 per share. You can find the reconciliation of the first quarter reported to operating earnings on Slide 24. As you know, Michigan and the rest of the Northeast in the first quarter of both 2014 and 2015 experienced significantly below normal temperatures including setting a couple of records. For us, the majority of the weather fluctuations can be seen in our Gas segment. Here are a couple of data points. 
First quarter of 2014 set the record for the coldest quarter in over 60 years. The first quarter of 2015 was the third coldest and February itself set the record for that month. Now for the quarter-over-quarter results. Our growth segments first quarter operating earnings in 2015 were lower by $10 million or $0.06 per share. Electric segment was equal to the first quarter of 2014. This was primarily due to fewer storms year-over-year, which drove lower operating maintenance expenses, offset by increased rate base growth cost driven by increased capital investments. The gas segment was lower by $18 million driven by the extreme weather experienced in the first quarter of 2014. The major contributors to the quarter-over-quarter decline were the weather of $11 million and weather-related storage and transport of $7 million.
Gas storage and pipeline earnings were $6 million above the prior year. This increase was primarily due to the volume growth in the Bluestone Pipeline and Susquehanna gathering assets, partially offset by weather driven storage earnings in 2014. Our Power & Industrial project segment was up $18 million versus 2014. A good portion of this variance was due to our REF business. As we saw last year, the performance in REF can vary depending on the underlying volumes and the timing of new relocations. As a result, we expect much of the REF favorability to reverse out over the balance of the year, more than offsetting underlying growth from new relocations and projects. In addition, we do expect some of the $18 million of favorability to flow through from growth in our Renewables and on-site businesses, related to new investments that came online in 2014 and early 2015. 
Our corporate and other segment came in unfavorable by $16 million versus last year. This variance is due largely to an effective tax rate adjustment, which will reverse within the year. As a result, we remain comfortable with our earnings guidance range for this segment. Again, the overall gross segment results for the quarter were $282 million or $1.58 per share. 
At Energy Trading, operating results for the quarter came in at $12 million with economic net income of $20 million. Both the Power and the Gas business lines contributed to these results. Please refer to page 23 of the appendix to review Energy Trading standard reconciliation page, which shows both economic and accounting performance.
That concludes the update on our earnings for the quarter. I'd like to now turn the discussion over to Mark who will cover cash flow and balance sheet metrics."
266598,290930113,794205,"DTE Energy Company, Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2015",2015-04-24,"Earnings Calls","DTE Energy Company","Executives","Thanks, Jeff, and good morning to everyone on the call. Let me open by saying that our cash flow and balance sheet remains strong and continue to support our long-term growth plans. I'm going to begin on Slide 14 with a look at our cash flows through th",467,"Thanks, Jeff, and good morning to everyone on the call. Let me open by saying that our cash flow and balance sheet remains strong and continue to support our long-term growth plans. 
I'm going to begin on Slide 14 with a look at our cash flows through the first quarter of the year. Cash from operations in the first quarter is $800 million, which is up from the first quarter of last year. The favorability we're seeing is for the cost several business units and most of it is timing-related, so we're sticking with our guidance of $1.7 billion of cash from operations for the full year. 
Capital spending is also higher in the first quarter due to increased investments at the Electric utility, partially offset by lower capital spending at our non-utility businesses. We issued $500 million of long-term debt in the first quarter, which drove a reduction in our commercial paper balance and somewhat unceremoniously in the first quarter, we made a final payment on the securitization bonds. Back in 2001, we issued $1.8 billion of securitization bonds to recover the costs of our nuclear plant and those bonds are now paid off.
Moving to Slide 15, which plays out our capital investments in a little more detail. DTE Electric CapEx is higher due to our $240 million investment and the 700-megawatt gas peaker in January of this year. And compared to last year CapEx in our non-utility business is down in the first quarter. But that's just the result of how the investments show up across the quarters, we refer to that as the lumpy nature of our non-utility projects. For the first quarter, our capital spending is on track to our plan and in line with our full year guidance of $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion.
Let me wrap up on Slide 16 with a look at our balance sheet metrics. Our plan for 2015 is to maintain our strong balance sheet and end the year within our targeted range for both leverage and FFO to debt. In the first quarter, we issued nearly $200 million of equity through our internal mechanisms and that fulfills the equity needs for this year and we continue to plan for $800 million to $900 million of equity through 2017. To fund the growth at DTE Electric, we issued $500 million of 30-year debt at a very attractive rate. In fact, it's the lowest rate 30-year debt we've issued since the Eisenhower administration.

We also have skills now in developing laterals and gatherings, so we're hoping opportunities around NEXUS as well on the laterals and gathering projects. The great thing about those projects is that the gathering project, you make money on that, it goes into a lateral, which I'll make money on that. It goes into NEXUS on and make money on that. It goes on to Vector, helps make money on that, so the amplification of value to that value chain. So that's how we're seeing NEXUS will progress over the next few years, after it's in service."

I hope everyone is enjoying the start of the spring season. This is definitely my favorite time of year. Like how the weather is gradually getting warmer, especially after going through another cold winter, but as many of you know, the real reason I like this time of year is that it brings in another baseball season for my Detroit Tigers. I said on our year-end call that I'll provide an update and I'm excited to report that the Tigers are starting out the season with one of the better records in baseball, and we just came off a pretty tough series with the New York Yankees, so hats off to the Yankees. There is a saying in baseball that you can't win the pennant in April, but you can lose it. The Tigers have set themselves up nicely the first month of the season. Sitting here in the middle of Hockeytown, I also have to mention the Detroit Red Wings and their 24th consecutive playoff appearance. We are hoping for a deep run in the playoffs.
Now I'd like to transition from talking about the hot sports teams in Detroit to DTE. Let me start first by saying that DTE's position, certainly positioned to have a good year as well. Jeff and Mark will be going through first quarter results in more detail, but I'll just say that we had a very successful quarter and are on track to achieve our earnings and balance sheet targets in 2015. 
Before we move to quarter results, I would like to do a quick overview of our business strategy as well as some highlights of what's happening at DTE and in Michigan. We can move on to Slide 5. This slide provides an overview of our business strategy and investment pieces. Our growth plan for the next 10 years at both utilities are highly visible. Our electric utility growth is driven by environmental spend in the near term and renewal of our generation fleet in the longer term, which will be the natural replacement of our aging coal fleet. Our gas utility growth is driven by infrastructure investments and the mainland pipe replacement. Complementing our utility growth are meaningful growth opportunities at our non-utility businesses, which provides diversity in earnings and geography. Our 2 utilities are deploying capital at a very constructive regulatory environment, and we are working hard to earn this constructive environment everyday. Our efforts begin with a highly engaged workforce. 
We found out last week that we won the Gallup Great Workplace Award. We're the only utility to win that award and actually won it 3 years in a row. We also have a continued focus on continuous improvement. The combination of these 2, our employee engagement and continuous improvement, enables us to continue our cost savings track record and the utility's ability to consistently earn their authorized returns. We also continue to focus on operational excellence and customer satisfaction that we believe are distinctive in our industry. We have certainly seen positive results on this front as currently DTE Gas is ranked highest by J.D. Power among our peers for residential and business customer satisfaction. 
Our dividend continues to grow as we grow earnings, and our goal is to maintain a strong BBB credit rating. This strategy provides for a consistent 5% to 6% annual EPS growth.
Slide 6 gives you some highlights of progress in 2015. Let me start first with Michigan's energy policy. This is a major area of focus this year and I know that the people on this call are very interested in a status update. I feel there is positive momentum for constructive legislation. We expect this to occur by the end of the year, and quite possibly, by midyear. This is the priority of the governor and he called out publicly the need to get legislation done this year. The House lead, Aric Nesbitt, has introduced legislation, and the Senate lead, Mike Nofs, is about to. The process is in full motion. I'll touch more on energy policy in a few minutes. 
Quick update on the various rate filings for our 2 utilities. We expect the rate order for our electric cost of service filing by June. This filing will deliver refined cost of service rates to our customers and our business customers will see sizable rate reductions. The rate case process is ongoing for electric general rate case filing to be put in at December of last year. This is the first rate case we had filed in 4 years and is predominantly a recovery of the $3 billion of capital investment deployed since our last filing. We expect to supplement rates in early July and receive a final order by the end of the year. For DTE Gas, we expect to receive an order this year for our expanded Infrastructure Recovery Mechanism application, and if approved, will allow us to double the annual miles of our mainline replacement program. 
As you know DTE Electric completed the acquisition of a 700 megawatt gas-fired peaking plant earlier this year. We also received the results of our recent RFP for up to 350 megawatts of additional peaking generation and are currently in late-stage negotiations. We look to announce the transaction next month and close this transaction later this year. With this purchase, our full-service customers' capacity requirements will be covered during the summer time frame. We felt it was very important to secure Michigan's base generation for our full-service customers given the projected capacity shortfall in the state of Michigan next summer.
On the non-utility front, we are definitely moving on all cylinders with progress on a number of projects. In our Gas Storage & Pipeline business, we are working through the details of a successful open season for the Millennium Pipeline. We have talked about this potential expansion given the need to the East Coast LDCs and the critical role the Millennium Pipeline plays in delivering Marcellus gas to market. This is another major milestone for our gas pipeline business and helps firm up future year growth. We'll share the details of the expansion once we are through finalizing commercial terms of the contracts.
For our NEXUS Pipeline, we have enough commitments and additional prospects to move forward with a 1.5 Bcf pipe. Currently, we are progressing through the FERC prefiling process quite nicely. Most recent activities around finalizing right-of-ways and the final path for the pipe. Our goal is to file the FERC application early fourth quarter this year. We also expect a fourth quarter end service date for both the NEXUS Pipeline as well as the Millennium expansion I touched on earlier.
In our Power & Industrial segment, we have a number of projects moving along, including an 8 megawatt on-site cogeneration project that went into service this quarter. For our REF business, we have signed a contract to operate a third-party REF facility that begins operations in the second quarter this year. This operating agreement will run through 2020 and has already been included in the guidance we provided. REF relocations, we are continuing to work on the relocation of our ninth unit and expect this later this year, as well as potential optimization opportunities with our other units. We are off to a strong start across our portfolio of businesses and we are optimistic on having another successful year in 2015.
Let me now move to updates on Michigan economy and the update of energy policy legislation.
On the road, we get asked quite a bit on how the economy is progressing in Michigan and with the city of Detroit, but Slide 7 is a positive commercial update for both. We continue to see economic momentum in our state. Michigan's unemployment rate in March was 5.6%, which is the lowest since September 2001. Year-over-year, Michigan's unemployment rate has dropped a full 2 percentage points. This is the second-largest improvement in the country. We continue to see improvement in other economic indicators including increases in residential customer and business customer accounts, and our forecasts show this trend continuing. You can see on the page that Michigan is showing growth by moving up 8 spots in the state ranking of real gross domestic product. Michigan now is in the upper 50% of all states in terms of growth.
I also want to highlight the city of Detroit's economic rebirth. I believe the city has come a long way since the bankruptcy filing on many fronts. One indicator that we show on this slide is the Detroit's metro area ranking #8 in the U.S. with a number of new expansion projects. The city's rebirth is largely due to the strong leadership we have in the city. Detroit mayor, Mike Duggan, is very focused on the financial and operational strength of the city. DTE, as well as other city partners, are working with them to help continue this momentum. 
Moving on to Slide 8. I'm now going to turn to an update on energy policy. As I mentioned earlier, Governor Snyder has made it clear that energy policy is an important legislative priority for him this year. He called out the need for new legislation in his State of the State Address and provided more detailed goals in his energy message in March, highlighting the significant transformation of the generation sources that our state will undertake over the next 10 to 15 years. Michigan also has strong leadership in both the House and the Senate on energy policy. Representative Aric Nesbitt chairs the House Energy Policy Committee. We're confident that he truly understands the future energy policy needs of our state. Representative Nesbitt introduced legislation in March that's consistent with the governor's goals of reliability and adaptability. He also recommended the elimination of the broken retail access program we have here in Michigan, which we support. Senator Mike Nofs, chairs the Senate Energy and Technology Committee and is very seasoned when it comes to energy policy. He is one of the principal architects of the Michigan's 2008 energy legislation as a member of the House back then. He will be introducing legislation shortly. In a recent interview, he has indicated that will include design changes to the retail access program to make it more fair and will also contain a longer-term generation integrated resource planning process, which will give us upfront review and approval of our coal plant retirement and replacement. We expect legislation to be completed this year, and I'm confident that Michigan has the strong leaders in place that understand energy and utility dynamics and will provide this year constructive legislation for Michigan's future. 
In a minute, I'll turn the call over to Jeff and Mark to review the quarter results, but before that I just want to highlight that we're on track to achieve our earnings guidance. 
So on Slide 9, the slide shows our EPS history and our target of 5% to 6% growth. As I mentioned before, we expect to grow our dividend with earnings. The chart shows our current 2015 guidance midpoint of $4.60 with the next page showing our earnings guidance by segment. 
So you can see on Slide 10 that we are holding our EPS guidance range of $4.48 to $4.72 for 2015. The slide shows 2015 year-to-date actuals compared to the full year guidance. Just like last year, weather favorability helped provide a strong quarter for the utilities, particularly on the gas side, as we again hit one of the coldest winters on record. Our non-utilities also had a strong first quarter. Jeff will take you through the details of our quarter results shortly. Last year, we will reserve this first quarter favorability as contingency for summer weather variability. So bottom line, there are no changes in guidance at this time, but we're off to a strong start. 
And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Jeff Jewell, our Vice President and Controller, to provide more details on the first quarter results."

Let's turn to Slide 12 to review the quarterly earnings performance. For the quarter, DTE Energy's operating earnings were $1.65 per share, and for reference, our reported earnings were $1.53 per share. You can find the reconciliation of the first quarter reported to operating earnings on Slide 24. As you know, Michigan and the rest of the Northeast in the first quarter of both 2014 and 2015 experienced significantly below-normal temperatures including setting a couple of records. For us, the majority of the weather fluctuations can be seen in our gas segment. Here are a couple of data points. 
First quarter of 2014 set the record for the coldest quarter in over 60 years. The first quarter of 2015 was the third coldest and February itself set the record for that month. 
Now for the quarter-over-quarter results. Our growth segments' first quarter operating earnings in 2015 were lower by $10 million or $0.06 per share. The electric segment was equal to the first quarter of 2014. This was primarily due to fewer storms year-over-year, which drove lower operating and maintenance expenses, offset by increased rate base growth costs, driven by increased capital investments. The gas segment was lower by $18 million, driven by the extreme weather experienced in the first quarter of 2014. The major contributors to the quarter-over-quarter decline were the weather of $11 million and weather-related storage and transport of $7 million.
Gas Storage & Pipelines earnings were $6 million above the prior year. This increase was primarily due to the volume growth in the Bluestone Pipeline and Susquehanna gathering assets, partially offset by weather-driven storage earnings in 2014. Our Power & Industrial project segment was up $18 million versus 2014. A good portion of this variance was due to our REF business. As we saw last year, the performance in REF can vary depending on the underlying volumes and the timing of new relocations. As a result, we expect much of the REF favorability to reverse out over the balance of the year, more than offsetting underlying growth from new relocations and projects. In addition, we do expect some of the $18 million of favorability to flow through from growth in our renewables and on-site businesses related to new investments that came online in 2014 and early 2015. 
Our corporate and other segment came in unfavorable by $16 million versus last year. This variance is due largely to an effective tax rate adjustment, which will reverse within the year. As a result, we remain comfortable with our earnings guidance range for this segment. Again, the overall gross segment results for the quarter were $282 million or $1.58 per share. 
At Energy Trading, operating results for the quarter came in at $12 million with economic net income of $20 million. Both the power and the gas business lines contributed to these results. Please refer to Page 23 of the appendix to review Energy Trading standard reconciliation page, which shows both economic and accounting performance.
That concludes the update on our earnings for the quarter. I'd like to now turn the discussion over to Mark, who will cover cash flow and balance sheet metrics."
266598,290930113,794535,"DTE Energy Company, Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2015",2015-04-24,"Earnings Calls","DTE Energy Company","Executives","Thanks, Jeff, and good morning to everyone on the call. Let me open by saying that our cash flow and balance sheet remains strong and continue to support our long-term growth plans. I'm going to begin on Slide 14 with a look at our cash flows through th",468,"Thanks, Jeff, and good morning to everyone on the call. Let me open by saying that our cash flow and balance sheet remains strong and continue to support our long-term growth plans. 
I'm going to begin on Slide 14 with a look at our cash flows through the first quarter of the year. Cash from operations in the first quarter is $800 million, which is up from the first quarter last year. The favorability we're seeing is spread across several business units and most of it is timing related, so we're sticking with our guidance of $1.7 billion of cash from operations for the full year. 
Capital spending is also higher in the first quarter due to increased investments at the electric utility, partially offset by lower capital spending at our non-utility businesses. We issued $500 million of long-term debt in the first quarter, which drove a reduction in our commercial paper balance. And somewhat unceremoniously in the first quarter, we made a final payment on the securitization bonds. Back in 2001, we issued $1.8 billion of securitization bonds to recover the costs of our Fermi 2 nuclear plant and those bonds are now paid off.
Moving to Slide 15, which lays out our capital investments in little more detail. DTE Electric CapEx is higher due to our $240 million investment and the 700 megawatt gas peaker in January of this year. And compared to last year, CapEx in our non-utility business is down in the first quarter. But that's just the result of how the investments show up across the quarters. We refer to that as the lumpy nature of our non-utility projects. Through the first quarter, our capital spending is on track to our plan and in line with our full year guidance of $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion.
Let me wrap up on Slide 16 with a look at our balance sheet metrics. Our plan for 2015 is to maintain our strong balance sheet and end the year within our targeted range for both leverage and FFO to debt. In the first quarter, we issued nearly $200 million of equity through our internal mechanisms and that fulfills the equity needs for this year, and we continue to plan for $800 million to $900 million of equity through 2017. To fund the growth at DTE Electric, we issued $500 million of 30-year debt at a very attractive rate. In fact, it's the lowest rate 30-year debt we've issued since the Eisenhower administration. As of the end of March, we had a healthy $1.9 billion of available liquidity, and earlier this month, we successfully amended and extended our credit facilities, increasing the size to $1.9 billion and extending the term to April of 2020.
And now I'll hand the discussion back over to Peter to wrap up."

I said on our year-end call that I'd provide an update, and I'm excited to report that the Tigers are starting out the season with one of the better records in baseball, and we just came off a pretty tough series with the New York Yankees, so hats off to the Yankees. There is a saying in baseball that you can't win the pennant in April, but you can lose it. The Tigers have set themselves up nicely the first month of the season.

Now I'd like to transition from talking about the hot sports teams in Detroit to DTE. Let me start first by saying that DTE's positioned -- certainly positioned to have a good year as well. Jeff and Mark will be going through first quarter results in more detail, but I'll just say that we had a very successful quarter and are on track to achieve our earnings and balance sheet targets in 2015. 
Before we move to quarter results, I would like to do a quick overview of our business strategy as well as some highlights of what's happening at DTE and in Michigan. We can move on to Slide 5. This slide provides an overview of our business strategy and investment thesis. Our growth plans for the next 10 years at both utilities are highly visible. Our electric utility growth is driven by environmental spend in the near term and renewal of our generation fleet in the longer term, which will be the natural replacement of our aging coal fleet. Our gas utility growth is driven by infrastructure investments and the mainline pipe replacement. Complementing our utility growth are meaningful growth opportunities at our non-utility businesses, which provide diversity in earnings and geography. Our 2 utilities are deploying capital at a very constructive regulatory environment, and we are working hard to earn this constructive environment every day. Our efforts begin with a highly engaged workforce.
We found out last week that we won the Gallup Great Workplace Award. We're the only utility to win that award, and actually, we won it 3 years in a row. We also have a continued focus on continuous improvement. The combination of these 2, our employee engagement and continuous improvement, enables us to continue our cost savings track record and our utilities' ability to consistently earn their authorized returns. We also continue to focus on operational excellence and customer satisfaction that we believe are distinctive in our industry. We have certainly seen positive results on this front as currently DTE Gas is ranked highest by J.D. Power among our peers for residential and business customer satisfaction. 
Our dividend continues to grow as we grow earnings, and our goal is to maintain a strong BBB credit rating. This strategy provides for a consistent 5% to 6% annual EPS growth.
Slide 6 gives you some highlights of progress in 2015. Let me start first with Michigan's energy policy. This is a major area of focus this year, and I know that the people on this call are very interested in a status update. I feel there is positive momentum for constructive legislation. We expect this to occur by the end of the year and, quite possibly, by midyear. This is the priority of the governor, and he called out publicly the need to get legislation done this year. The House lead, Aric Nesbitt, has introduced legislation, and the Senate lead, Mike Nofs, is about to. The process is in full motion. I'll touch more on energy policy in a few minutes. 
Quick update on the various rate filings for our 2 utilities. We expect a rate order for our electric cost of service filing by June. This filing would deliver refined cost of service rates to our customers, and our business customers will see sizable rate reductions. The rate case process is ongoing for electric general rate case filing that we put in at December of last year. This is the first rate case we had filed in 4 years and is predominantly a recovery of the $3 billion of capital investment deployed since our last filing. We expect to supplement [ph] rates in early July and receive a final order by the end of the year. For DTE Gas, we expect to receive an order this year for our expanded Infrastructure Recovery Mechanism application that, if approved, will allow us to double the annual miles of our mainline replacement program. 
As you know DTE Electric completed the acquisition of a 700 megawatt gas-fired peaking plant earlier this year. We also received the results of our recent RFP for up to 350 megawatts of additional peaking generation and are currently in late-stage negotiations. We look to announce the transaction next month and close this transaction later this year. With this purchase, our full-service customers' capacity requirements will be covered during the summer time frame. We felt it was very important to secure Michigan's base generation for our full-service customers given the projected capacity shortfall in the state of Michigan next summer.
On the non-utility front, we are definitely moving on all cylinders with progress on a number of projects. In our Gas Storage & Pipeline business, we are working through the details of a successful open season for the Millennium Pipeline. We have talked about this potential expansion given the need for the East Coast LDCs and the critical role the Millennium Pipeline plays in delivering Marcellus gas to market. This is another major milestone for our gas pipeline business and helps firm up future year growth. We'll share the details of the expansion once we are through finalizing commercial terms of the contracts.
For our NEXUS Pipeline, we have enough commitments and additional prospects to move forward with a 1.5 Bcf pipe. Currently, we are progressing through the FERC prefiling process quite nicely. The most recent activity is around finalizing right-of-ways and the final path for the pipe. Our goal is to file the FERC application early fourth quarter this year. We also expect a fourth quarter end service date for both the NEXUS Pipeline as well as the Millennium expansion I touched on earlier.
In our Power & Industrial segment, we have a number of projects moving along, including an 8 megawatt on-site cogeneration project that went into service this quarter. For our REF business, we have signed a contract to operate a third-party REF facility that begins operations in the second quarter this year. This operating agreement will run through 2020 and has already been included in the guidance we provided. Regarding REF relocations, we are continuing to work on the relocation of our ninth unit and expect this later this year, as well as potential optimization opportunities with our other units. We are off to a strong start across our portfolio of businesses, and we are optimistic on having another successful year in 2015.
Let me now move to updates on Michigan economy and the update of energy policy legislation.
On the road, we get asked quite a bit on how the economy is progressing in Michigan and with the city of Detroit. Slide 7 is a positive commercial update for both. We continue to see economic momentum in our state. Michigan's unemployment rate in March was 5.6%, which is the lowest since September 2001. Year-over-year, Michigan's unemployment rate has dropped a full 2 percentage points. This is the second-largest improvement in the country. We continue to see improvement in other economic indicators, including increases in residential customer and business customer accounts, and our forecasts show this trend continuing. You can see on the page that Michigan is showing growth by moving up 8 spots in the state ranking of real gross domestic product. Michigan now is in the upper 50% of all states in terms of growth.
I also want to highlight the city of Detroit's economic rebirth. I believe the city has come a long way since the bankruptcy filing on many fronts. One indicator that we show on this slide is that Detroit's metro area ranking #8 in the U.S. with a number of new expansion projects. The city's rebirth is largely due to the strong leadership we have in the city. Detroit mayor, Mike Duggan, is very focused on the financial and operational strength of the city. DTE, as well as other city partners, are working with them to help continue this momentum. 
Moving on to Slide 8. I'm now going to turn to an update on energy policy. As I mentioned earlier, Governor Snyder has made it clear that energy policy is an important legislative priority for him this year. He called out the need for new legislation in his State of the State Address and provided more detailed goals in his energy message in March, highlighting the significant transformation and the generation of sources that our state will undertake over the next 10 to 15 years. Michigan also has strong leadership in both the House and the Senate on energy policy. Representative Aric Nesbitt chairs the House Energy Policy Committee. We're confident that he thoroughly understands the future energy policy needs of our state. Representative Nesbitt introduced legislation in March that is consistent with the governor's goals of reliability and adaptability. He also recommended the elimination of the broken retail access program we have here in Michigan, which we support. Senator Mike Nofs chairs the Senate Energy and Technology Committee and is very seasoned when it comes to energy policy. He is one of the principal architects of the Michigan's 2008 energy legislation as a member of the House back then. He will be introducing legislation shortly. In a recent interview, he has indicated that will include design changes to the retail access program to make it more fair and will also contain a longer-term generation integrated resource planning process, which will give us upfront review and approval of our coal plant retirement and replacement. We expect legislation to be completed this year and are confident that Michigan has strong leaders in place that understand energy and utility dynamics and will provide this year constructive legislation for Michigan's future. 
In a minute, I'll turn the call over to Jeff and Mark to review the quarter results, but before that I just want to highlight that we are on track to achieve our earnings guidance. 
So on Slide 9, the slide shows our EPS history and our target of 5% to 6% growth. As I mentioned before, we expect to grow our dividend with earnings. The chart shows our current 2015 guidance midpoint of $4.60 with the next page showing our earnings guidance by segment. 
So you can see on Slide 10 that we are holding our EPS guidance range of $4.48 to $4.72 for 2015. The slide shows 2015 year-to-date actuals compared to the full year guidance. Just like last year, weather favorability helped provide a strong quarter for the utilities, particularly on the gas side, as we again had one of the coldest winters on record. Our non-utilities also had a strong first quarter. Jeff will take you through the details of our quarter results shortly. Like last year, we will reserve this first quarter favorability as contingency for summer weather variability. So bottom line, there are no changes in guidance at this time, but we're off to a strong start.
And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Jeff Jewell, our Vice President and Controller, to provide more details on the first quarter results."

Let's turn to Slide 12 to review the quarterly earnings performance. For the quarter, DTE Energy's operating earnings were $1.65 per share, and for reference, our reported earnings were $1.53 per share. You can find the reconciliation of the first quarter reported to operating earnings on Slide 24. As you know, Michigan and the rest of the Northeast in the first quarter of both 2014 and 2015 experienced significantly below-normal temperatures, including setting a couple of records. For us, the majority of the weather fluctuations can be seen in our gas segment. Here are a couple of data points. 
First quarter of 2014 set the record for the coldest quarter in over 60 years. The first quarter of 2015 was the third coldest, and February itself set the record for that month. 
Now for the quarter-over-quarter results. Our growth segments' first quarter operating earnings in 2015 were lower by $10 million or $0.06 per share. The electric segment was equal to the first quarter of 2014. This was primarily due to fewer storms year-over-year, which drove lower operating and maintenance expenses, offset by increased rate base growth costs, driven by increased capital investments. The gas segment was lower by $18 million, driven by the extreme weather experienced in the first quarter of 2014. The major contributors to the quarter-over-quarter decline were the weather of $11 million and weather-related storage and transport of $7 million.
Gas Storage & Pipelines earnings were $6 million above the prior year. This increase was primarily due to the volume growth in the Bluestone Pipeline and Susquehanna gathering assets, partially offset by weather-driven storage earnings in 2014. Our Power & Industrial project segment was up $18 million versus 2014. A good portion of this variance was due to our REF business. As we saw last year, the performance in REF can vary depending on the underlying volumes and the timing of new relocations. As a result, we expect much of the REF favorability to reverse out over the balance of the year, more than offsetting underlying growth from new relocations and projects. In addition, we do expect some of the $18 million of favorability to flow through from growth in our renewables and on-site businesses related to new investments that came online in 2014 and early 2015.
Our corporate and other segment came in unfavorable by $16 million versus last year. This variance is due largely to an effective tax rate adjustment, which will reverse within the year. As a result, we remain comfortable with our earnings guidance range for this segment. Again, the overall gross segment results for the quarter were $282 million or $1.58 per share. 
At Energy Trading, operating results for the quarter came in at $12 million, with economic net income of $20 million. Both the power and the gas business lines contributed to these results. Please refer to Page 23 of the appendix to review Energy Trading standard reconciliation page, which shows both economic and accounting performance.
That concludes the update on our earnings for the quarter. I'd like to now turn the discussion over to Mark, who will cover cash flow and balance sheet metrics."
266598,290930113,794639,"DTE Energy Company, Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2015",2015-04-24,"Earnings Calls","DTE Energy Company","Executives","Thanks, Jeff, and good morning to everyone on the call. Let me open by saying that our cash flow and balance sheet remain strong and continue to support our long-term growth plans. I'm going to begin on Slide 14 with a look at our cash flows through the",470,"Thanks, Jeff, and good morning to everyone on the call. Let me open by saying that our cash flow and balance sheet remain strong and continue to support our long-term growth plans. 
I'm going to begin on Slide 14 with a look at our cash flows through the first quarter of the year. Cash from operations in the first quarter is $800 million, which is up from the first quarter of last year. The favorability we're seeing is spread across several business units, and most of it is timing related. So we're sticking with our guidance of $1.7 billion of cash from operations for the full year. 
Capital spending is also higher in the first quarter due to increased investments at the electric utility, partially offset by lower capital spending at our non-utility businesses. We issued $500 million of long-term debt in the first quarter, which drove a reduction in our commercial paper balance. And somewhat unceremoniously in the first quarter, we made the final payment on the securitization bonds. Back in 2001, we issued $1.8 billion of securitization bonds to recover the costs of our Fermi 2 nuclear plant, and those bonds are now paid off.
Moving to Slide 15, which lays out our capital investments in a little more detail. DTE Electric CapEx is higher due to our $240 million investment in a 700 megawatt gas peaker in January of this year. And compared to last year, CapEx in our non-utility business is down in the first quarter. But that's just the result of how the investments show up across the quarters. We refer to that as the lumpy nature of our non-utility projects. Through the first quarter, our capital spending is on track to our plan and in line with our full year guidance of $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion.
Let me wrap up on Slide 16 with a look at our balance sheet metrics. Our plan for 2015 is to maintain our strong balance sheet and end the year within our targeted range for both leverage and FFO to debt. In the first quarter, we issued nearly $200 million of equity through our internal mechanisms, and that fulfills the equity needs for this year, and we continue to plan for $800 million to $900 million of equity through 2017. To fund the growth at DTE Electric, we issued $500 million of 30-year debt at a very attractive rate. In fact, it's the lowest rate 30-year debt we've issued since the Eisenhower administration. As of the end of March, we had a healthy $1.9 billion of available liquidity, and earlier this month, we successfully amended and extended our credit facilities, increasing the size to $1.9 billion and extending the term to April of 2020.
And now I'll hand the discussion back over to Peter to wrap up."

So you do see variability that occurs during the year on those coal plants. So we did see, on a quarter-over-quarter basis, more coal plant production. We are anticipating relatively normalized production for the balance of the year, so we'll see that favorability bleed off for the balance of the year. Underlying that, there is some growth.

As usual I'd like to start the call by giving a quick update on our Detroit Tigers. Good news the Tigers won 47 games, the bad news is that they lost 48, just like the first half of July, weather in the Detroit area has been colder-than-normal, the Tigers have cooled off as well this month. We're hoping that the summer heats up, so do the Tiger bats and I'm still holding out some hope for a playoff.
Unlike the Tigers, here at DTE, we certainly have had successful first half of the year and I believe we're well positioned to continue the success in the balance of 2015. It's obvious, our earnings release we are raising our 2015 EPS guidance on strong year-to-date results. Jeff and Mark will be going through the second quarter results in more detail.
But before we move on to that, I'd like to do a quick overview of our business strategy, as well as some highlights on what's happening in DTE in Michigan. Slide 5 provides an overview of our business strategy and investment pieces. Our growth plans for next 10 years on both utilities are highly visible. Our utility growth is driven by environmental spend in the near term, and renewal of our generation fleet and upgrading the distribution system in the longer term. Our gas utility growth is driven by infrastructure investments and the mainline pipe replacement.
Our 2 utilities are deploying capital in a very constructive regulatory environment, and we are working hard to earn this constructive environment every day. I'll be updating you on some of the regulatory proceedings our utilities are currently working through. Complimenting our utility growth are meaningful growth opportunities in our non-utility businesses, which provides diversity in earnings and geography.
Our highly engaged workforce continues to be the key to our success. Last quarter, I told you about the third consecutive Workplace Award and just recently DTE Energy received the Development  by Design Award from the Gallup organization. The award recognized DTE's focus on creating personnel, team and organizational success through employee training programs, though we definitely continue to make strides in our employee engagement efforts. We have a strong focus on continuous improvement and feel we are distinctive in the industry on our approach and outcomes. The combination of this 2, employee engagement and continuous improvement, enables us to deliver both sustainable cost savings track record and to consistently earn authorized returns at both of our utilities.
We are also very focused on operational excellence and customer satisfaction that we believe also are distinctive in our industry. We have certainly seen positive results on this front, as currently DTE Gas is ranked highest by J.D. Power among our peers for residential and business customer satisfaction.
And earlier this month, we found out that DTE Electric was ranked in second overall customer satisfaction with the residential customers and J.D. Power's 2015 study.
Our dividend continues to grow as we grow earnings and our goal is to maintain a strong BBB credit rating. This strategy provides consistent 5% to 6% annual EPS growth.
Slide 6, provide some highlights of progress in 2015. First on our list is our announcement that we're increasing our operating EPS guidance for this year. We're increase from an EPS midpoint of $4.60 to a midpoint of $4.72. This is driven by strong performance in our Gas Storage & Pipeline business, as well as our Energy Trading operations.  I'll provide a more detailed overview of guidance in a few minutes.
Keeping inline with our commitment to grow our dividend with our earnings, we have increased our dividend. Our annual dividend per share was increased from $2.76 to $2.92 versus the 5.8% increase.
Regarding Michigan's Energy policy, I feel there's positive momentum for the constructive legislation by the end of the year. This continued to be a priority of the government called the publicly to get legislation done this year. Back in March, Representative Eric introduced legislation. And recently the Senate introduced legislation for the process of moving along. I'll touch more on the energy policy in a few minutes.
I also want to give a quick update on the various rate proceedings for our 2 utilities. Our electric utilities raised on July 1 for the ongoing general rate proceeding. We expect to receive a final order by the end of the year.
We also implemented our new cost to service rates, which resulted in rate reductions for many of our business customers. For DTE Gas, we expect to receive an order this year for an expanded Infrastructure Recovery Mechanism that if approved, will allow us to double our annual miles of our mainline replacement program.
We continue to make significant progress in our non-utility businesses.
In our Gas Storage & Pipeline business, Millennium had a successful open season we're working through final contracts now. We expect an expansion of greater than 0.2 Bcf. In addition, we are constructing a new 8-mile lateral out of Millennium to serve a proposed 650 megawatts combined cycle plant with approximately 0.1 b day of natural gas. This progress is expected to be service in the fourth quarter of 2017. This is another major milestone that helped our future year growth.
The NEXUS Pipeline project is also moving forward nicely towards its fourth quarter 2017 in-service date. The FERC meetings are complete and we're relatively routine. We recently signed a number of connection agreements that could provide potential load across up to 1.3 Bcf per day. This demonstrates strong market support for the project and also strengthens the longer-term earnings potential for the pipe. We filed our resource reports in June with the FERC as scheduled and our next major milestone will be to file the FERC application in the fourth quarter of this year.
We are also now very focused on optimizing our Reduced Emissions Fuel business. Currently, we have ARF facilities operating at 8 sites and are in the process of relocating under utilized facilities to our ninth site, which should be operational in the fourth quarter.
In addition, this quarter we're operating a third-party REF facility. This agreement will run through 2020. We continue to work towards further optimization of this business line as this has been a great return business for us, which has generated very significant cash flows to fund our non-utility growth projects.
So you can see, we had a successful first half of the year, giving us confidence to reach our earnings goal in 2015. Let me now move to updates on the Michigan improvements and the economy.
Turning to Slide 7, we're highlighting the progress the Michigan and the city of Detroit are making. I know many of you are interested in how the local economy is doing, and we continue to see economic momentum in the state. Michigan's unemployment rate in June is 5.5%. This rate has been around 5.5% the last 3 months, roughly in line with the national average. Michigan's unemployment rate hasn't been at this level since 2001.
Michigan is identified at a site selection magazine being the seventh most competitive state for job creation, as well as the #1 state for new manufacturing jobs since 2009. We continue to see and other economic indicators, including increases in residential customer and business customer accounts, and our forecast shows this trend continuing.
I do want to highlight the city of Detroit's economic progress. One indicator that we show on this slide is the Detroit Metro area ranking #8 in the U.S. for a number of new expansion projects. The city has come a long way since the bankruptcy. And with the strong leadership we have in place, I'm confident the city will continue to move forward. DTE, as well as other city partners, are working with them to continue this momentum.
You will see on Slide 8 that the additional changes in the state are taking place at the Michigan Public Service Commission has welcomed Norm Saari, as the new Commissioner, replacing outgoing Commissioner, Greg White, whose term has ended. Commissioner Saari has a deep background in public policy and governmental and community affairs, both in state government and direct utility experience. This is Governor's Snyder's third appointment. The Governor has been a great talent selection. The Commission has helped Michigan Regulatory Environment to be one of the most constructive in the country. We believe that Commissioner Saari will continue to support our environment.
Moving on to Slide 9. I'm now going to turn to an update on the energy policy. We mentioned earlier  Governor Snyder has made it clear that energy policy is an important legislative priority for him this year. He called of a need for legislation during the state address and provide a more detailed goal on his energy message in March, highlighting this significant transformation and generation sources that are stable to undertake over the next 10 to 15 years.
And over the last few months, both the House and Senate energy leaderships had introduced proposal legislation to adjust changes in the state. Representative Aric Nesbitt, who chairs the House Energy Policy Committee, introduced legislation in March that's consistent with the Governor's goal to reliability and adaptability. He also recommend the elimination of the retail access program we have in Michigan, which we support.
Senator Mike Nofs, who chairs the Senate Energy and Technology Committee, introduced legislation in June, which is also in the Governor's goals. He is recommending to maintain the 10% cap on retail open access, but with a onetime election to enter into long-term capacity commitment with an alternative supplier or to return to the utility.
A Customer could choose to return the utility with a 3-year notice and as a onetime permanent election to return to the utility. We expect legislation to be completed this year and we're confident that Michigan has strong leaders in place that understand energy and utilities dynamics and provide constructive legislation for Michigan's future. All the proposals and legislation drawing board represented positive move forward.
In a moment, I'll turn the call over to Jeff to give you the quarter's results. But before that, I wanted to highlight some of our outlook and guidance increase. On Slide 10, the slide shows our EPS history with our target of 5% to 6% growth. As I mentioned before, we expect to grow our dividend with earnings evidenced by our recent increase. The chart shows a revised 2015 guidance midpoint of $4.72, as well as our EPS guidance midpoint of $4.66 for our growth segments. The 5% to 6% future growth, as I mentioned, is of our new guidance growth segment of $4.66 per share. And our commitment is to grow both earnings and dividend we are just doing that.
Let me get into a little more detail on Page 11. We're increasing our 2015 EPS guidance range to $4.54[ph] to $4.90 for DTE Energy. This is a $0.12 increase in the midpoint from our prior range of $4.48[ph] to $4.72. Our EPS guidance range for our growth segments is now $4.54 to $4.78. Our guidance increase is driven by strong start of the year in our Gas Storage & Pipeline segment with increased pipeline and gathering earnings.
Slide 15 operating earnings guidance for this segment has increased from a range of $80 million to $88 million to a range of $90 million to $98 million. The majority of this increase is due to strong underlying performance in the business and, therefore, we expect the majority to flow into 2016.
For Energy Trading business, we have raised our earnings guidance to a range of 0 to $20 million for 2015. Energy Trading is now part of our growth segments and our original guidance is set at 0 since we do not align this business to achieve our earnings target. As this year is progressing, we're recognizing the strong economic performance and adjust under 2015 guidance accordingly.
Trading does have seasonality tied to the fiscal part of its business and those contracts makes -- mostly make money in the first and fourth quarter.
And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Jeff Jewell, our Vice President, Controller, to provide more details on the second quarter earnings results."

I will be discussing quarter-over-quarter earnings, results on Page 13. And on Page 14, I will review our electric sales in order to provide more insight into what we're experiencing.
Now turning to Page 13. For the quarter, DTE Energy's operating earnings were $137 million or $0.76 per share. And for reference, our reported earnings were $0.61 per share. You can find the reconciliation of the second quarter reported and operating earnings on Slide 26.
For the quarter-over-quarter, our growth segment second quarter operating earnings in 2015 were lower by $4 million or $0.03 per share. The electric segment was lower by $18 million. This is primarily due to increased cost associated with rate base growth and unfavorable weather, partially offset by lower O&M.
The Gas segment was lower by $3 million, driven by unfavorable weather in the second quarter of 2015.
Gas Storage & Pipelines earnings were $7 million above the prior year. This increase was primarily due to the volume growth in the Bluestone pipeline and gathering assets.
Our Power & Industrial project segment was up $5 million versus 2014. Quarter-over-quarter favorability was primarily driven by strong performance across the business lines.
Our Corporate and Other segment came in favorable by $5 million versus last year. This variance is mainly due to tax-related timing differences.
The overall growth segment results for the quarter were $134 million or $0.75 per share. Energy Trading operating results for the quarter came in at a positive $3 million, with economic net income of $19 million. Both the Power and Gas business lines contributed to these results. Please refer to Page 24 of the Appendix to review the Energy Trading standard reconciliation page, which shows both economic and accounting performance.
Now let's turn to Page 14 to discuss our electric sales results. For the first half of the year, temperature-normalized electric sales were down 0.7%. We are very encouraged by the drivers of this change year-to-date and for the future. This the change reflects both the underlying economic growth in all sectors and that energy efficiency is making positive impact to reduce customer average usage. The economic increases are being driven by population growth, occupancy rate strength, income growth and manufacturing auto production levels that have surpassed prerecession levels.
Energy efficiency, which is producing positive results for our customers, is a key component of our overall operational and financial plans and a key priority for the Governor. This efficiency translates into reduction in the average energy bill for our residential customers, which is one of the key components of our long-term strategy to create affordability headroom as we embark in a very intensive capital investment program.
Therefore, we are changing our sales forecast as we anticipate our load growth over the next few years to be close to flat as underlying economic growth and energy efficiency play on.
That concludes the update in our earnings and sales for the quarter. I'd like to now turn the discussion over to Mark, who will cover cash flow and balance sheet metrics."

In addition to the solid earnings result that Jeff just described, we delivered solid cash flow and capital investments in the first half of the year as well. All of that is underpinned by the strength of our balance sheet.
Slide 15 lays out our cash flows and CapEx for the first half of the year. Cash from operations is $1.2 billion, which is up slightly over last year and in line with our plan. We saw strong cash flow performance across all the business units, and we're reaffirming our full year cash from operations guidance of $1.7 billion.
We invested $1.1 billion of CapEx from the first half of the year. And on the right side of the page, you can see the breakout by business unit. DTE Electric is higher due primarily to the acquisition of gas beaker back in the first quarter, partially offset by the timing of wind investment between years. And there's some year-over-year timing differences in our non-utility businesses as well. Total year-to-date CapEx is on track with our plan and consistent with our full year guidance of $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion.
Finally, to fund this CapEx program and to pay off commercial paper balances, we issued $800 million in long-term debt financing in the first half of the year.
Now we'll move to Slide 17 and look at our budget metrics. In short, our budget remained strong and we project ending the year within our targeted range of leverage and FFO to debt. We issued $200 million of equity back in the first quarter, which fulfilled our equity needs for the year and there's no change in our plans to issue $800 million to $900 million of new equity through 2017.
We continue to take advantage of the low interest rates by issuing $300 million of 7-year debt to the parent company, which is where we fund most investments at our non-utilities.
During the quarter, we met with the rating agencies and they all reaffirmed our current ratings and outlook, which demonstrates our commitment to maintaining a strong BBB credit rating.
And lastly, after renewing our credit facility back in April, we ended the second quarter with comfortable $2.2 billion of available liquidity.
And now, I'll hand the discussion back over to Peter to wrap up."

We had  a very good quarter, as well as first half of the year and we're confident that this year's performance will allow us to achieve or increase 2015 EPS guidance. We increased our annual dividend, 5.8% to $2.92 per share, keeping our dividend growth in line with earnings. We anticipate successful outcomes this year for both our utility regulatory filings, as well as Michigan energy's policy reform.

And some that the level of new models that are -- which is great news for our auto companies that are being produced here. For the energy efficiency, I guess, first, I just want to talk about that a little bit there and we're really pleased with the level of energy efficiency in our service territory, and we've been really working hard at this over the last 5 years and I believe we're on the leading edge as some of our -- some areas in energy efficiency, especially in delivering tools to our customers to save energy. If you recall, and if you saw the March energy address the Governor gave, he held up his smartphone and had DTE insight there. So we've actually kind of cracked the code in our technology and how do we deliver that realtime to our customers and about usage. So even though energy efficiency increases, maybe over time the electric rate overtime, but it does lower customer bills, which provides headwind for rate increases to cover capital investments. So I know your question, Julien, was what does that do from rate case strategy. Our rate case timing really tied to the capital investment we have over and above depreciation. So it's really going to be tied, but it doesn't impact the timing of that. And what we're seeing actually that it will provide headwind for us from a customer perspective to get recovery of the new capital investment."

On the gathering side and is evidenced by this year-to-date results and our guidance increase, we're seeing great results on the gathering business. This is a business that we started in 2012 with a partnership with Southwest Energy. So as we've been going down our learning curve and cost curve, it's really helped us with that relationship. And that's a business that we like as well because as we get into new projects, like NEXUS, the idea there is to do a very similar blueprint of what we're seeing in Millennium, now that you work with producers get gathering and laterals that will feed into NEXUS.

Good news, the Tigers have won 47 games. Bad news is they've lost 48. Just like the first half of July weather here in Detroit area has been colder than normal, the Tigers have cooled off as well this month. We're hoping that the summer heats up, so do the Tiger bats. And I'm still holding out some hope for a playoff berth.
Unlike the Tigers, here at DTE, we certainly have had a successful first half of the year. And I believe we're well positioned to continue the success in the balance of 2015. As all of you saw on our earnings release, we are raising our 2015 EPS guidance on strong year-to-date results. Jeff and Mark will be going through the second quarter results in more detail. But before we move on to that, I'd like to do a quick overview of our business strategy as well as some highlights on what's happening at DTE in Michigan. 
Slide 5 provides an overview of our business strategy and investment thesis. Our growth plans for the next 10 years at both utilities are highly visible. Our electric utility growth is driven by environmental spend in the near term and renewal of our generation fleet and upgrading the distribution system in the longer term. Our gas utility growth is driven by infrastructure investments and the mainline pipe replacement. Our 2 utilities are deploying capital in a constructive regulatory environment, and we are working hard to earn this constructive environment every day. I'll be updating you on some of the regulatory proceedings our utilities are currently working through. Complementing our utility growth are meaningful growth opportunities in our nonutility businesses, which provide diversity in earnings and geography.
Our highly engaged workforce continues to be the key to our success. Last quarter, I told you about the third consecutive Gallup Great Workplace Award. And just recently, DTE Energy received the Development by Design Award from the Gallup organization. The award recognizes DTE's focus on creating personnel, team and organizational success through employee training programs, though we definitely continue to make strides in our employee engagement efforts. We have a strong focus on continuous improvement and feel we are distinctive in the industry on our approach and outcomes. The combination of these 2, employee engagement and continuous improvement, enables us to deliver both sustainable cost savings track record and to consistently earn authorized returns at both of our utilities.
We are also very focused on operational excellence and customer satisfaction that we believe also are distinctive in our industry. We have certainly seen positive result on this front as currently DTE Gas is ranked highest by J.D. Power among our peers for residential and business customer satisfaction. And earlier this month, we found out that DTE Electric was ranked second in overall customer satisfaction with electric utility residential customers in J.D. Power's 2015 study. Our dividend continues to grow as we grow earnings. And our goal is to maintain a strong BBB credit rating. This strategy provides for consistent 5% to 6% annual EPS growth.
Slide 6 provides some highlights of progress in 2015. First on our list is our announcement that we're increasing our operating EPS guidance for this year. We're increasing from an EPS midpoint of $4.60 to a midpoint of $4.72. This is driven by strong performance in our Gas Storage & Pipeline business as well as our Energy Trading operations. I'll provide a more detailed overview of guidance in a few minutes. Keeping inline with our commitment to grow our dividend with earnings, we have recently increased our dividend. Our annual dividend per share was increased from $2.76 to $2.92, which is a 5.8% increase.
Regarding Michigan's energy policy, I feel there is positive momentum for the constructive legislation by the end of the year. This continues to be a priority of the governor, and he called out publicly the need to get legislation done this year. Back in March, Representative Aric Nesbitt introduced legislation. And recently, the Senator Mike Nofs introduced legislation, so the process is definitely moving along. I'll touch more on the energy policy in a few minutes.
I also want to give a quick update on the various rate proceedings for our 2 utilities. Our electric utility's self-help [indiscernible] on July 1 for the ongoing general rate proceeding. We expect to receive a final order by the end of the year. We also implemented our new cost of service rates, which resulted in rate reductions for many of our business customers. For DTE Gas, we expect to receive an order this year for an expanded Infrastructure Recovery Mechanism that if approved will allow us to double our annual miles of our mainline replacement program. We continue to make significant progress in our nonutility businesses.
In our Gas Storage & Pipeline business, Millennium had a successful open season, and we're working through final contracts now. We expect an expansion of greater than 0.2 Bcf. In addition, we are constructing a new 8-mile lateral off Millennium to serve a proposed 650 megawatt combined cycle plant with approximately 0.1 B/day [ph] of natural gas. These projects are expected to be service in the fourth quarter of 2017. This is another major milestone that helps firm up future year growth.
The NEXUS Pipeline project is also moving forward nicely towards its fourth quarter 2017 in-service date. The FERC scoping meetings are complete, and we're relatively routine. We recently signed a number of Tampa [ph] interconnection agreements that could provide potential aggregate load across Northern Ohio up to 1.3 Bcf per day. This demonstrates strong market support for the project and also strengthens the longer-term earnings potential for the pipe. We filed our resource reports in June with the FERC as scheduled. And our next major milestone will be to file the FERC application in the fourth quarter of this year.
We are also now very focused on optimizing our Reduced Emissions Fuel business. Currently, we have REF facilities operating at 8 sites and are in the process of relocating underutilized facilities to a ninth site, which should be operational in the fourth quarter. In addition, this quarter, we are operating a third-party REF facility. This [indiscernible] agreement will run through 2020. We'll continue to work towards further optimization of this business line as this has been a great return business for us, which has generated very significant cash flows to help fund our nonutility growth projects. So you can see, we've had a successful first half of the year, giving us confidence to reach our earnings goal in 2015. Let me now move to updates on the Michigan improvements and the economy.
So turning to Slide 7. We're highlighting the progress that Michigan and the city of Detroit are making. I know many of you are interested in how the local economy is doing, and we continue to see economic momentum in the state. Michigan's unemployment rate in June is 5.5%. This rate has been around 5.5% the last 3 months, roughly in line with the national average. Michigan's unemployment rate hasn't been at this level since 2001. Michigan is identified by the Site Selection Magazine as being the seventh most competitive state for job creation as well as the #1 state for new manufacturing jobs since 2009. We continue to see in other economic indicators, including increases in residential customer and business customer accounts, and our forecast shows this trend continuing. 
I do want to highlight the city of Detroit's economic progress. One indicator that we show on this slide is the Detroit metro area ranking #8 in the U.S. for a number of new or expansion projects. The city has come a long way since the bankruptcy. And with the strong leadership we have in place, I'm confident the city will continue to move forward. DTE as well as other city partners are working with them to continue this momentum.
You will see on Slide 8 that the additional changes in the state are taking place as the Michigan Public Service Commission has welcomed Norm Saari as the new commissioner, replacing outgoing commissioner Greg White, whose term has ended. Commissioner Saari has a deep background in public policy and governmental and community affairs both in the state government and direct utility experience. This is Governor Snyder's third appointment. The governor had been great at talent selection. The commission has helped the Michigan regulatory environment to be one of the most constructive in the country. We believe that Commissioner Saari will continue this supportive environment.
Moving on to Slide 9. I'm now going to turn to an update on the energy policy. We have mentioned earlier, Governor Snyder has made it clear that energy policy is an important legislative priority for him this year. He called up a need for legislation during the State of the State address and provided a more detailed goals on his energy message in March, highlighting the significant transformation of generation sources that are stable to undertake over the next 10 to 15 years. And over the last few months, both the House and Senate energy leaderships had introduced proposed legislation to adjust needed changes in the state. Representative Aric Nesbitt, who chairs the House Energy Policy Committee, introduced legislation in March that's consistent with the governor's goal to reliability and adaptability. He also recommended the elimination of the retail access program we have here in Michigan, which we support. 
Senator Mike Nofs, who chairs the Senate Energy and Technology Committee, introduced legislation in June, which is also similar to the governor's goals. He's recommending to maintain a 10% cap on retail open access but with a onetime election to enter into long-term capacity commitment with an alternative supplier or to return to the utility. A customer could choose to return to the utility with 3-year notice and as a onetime permanent election to return to the utility. We expect legislation to be completed this year, and we're confident that Michigan has strong leaders in place that understand energy and utility dynamics and provide constructive legislation for Michigan's future. All the proposals in the legislative drawing board represent a positive move forward. In a moment, I'll turn the call over to Jeff to review the quarterly results. But before that, I want to highlight -- drive some highlights of our outlook and guidance increase. 
On Slide 10, this slide shows our EPS history with our target of 5% to 6% growth. As I mentioned before, we expect to grow our dividend with earnings, evidenced by our recent increase. The chart shows a revised 2015 guidance midpoint of $4.72 as well as our EPS guidance midpoint of $4.66 for our growth segments. The 5% to 6% future growth, as I mentioned, is off our new guidance growth segment [indiscernible] of $4.66 per share. And our commitment is to grow both earnings and our dividends, and we are just doing that.
Let me get into a little more detail on Page 11. We're increasing our 2015 EPS guidance range to $4.54 to $4.90 for DTE Energy. This is a 12% increase in the midpoint from our prior range of $4.4 to $4.72. Our EPS guidance range for our growth segments is now $4.54 to $4.78. Our guidance increase is driven by strong start of the year in our Gas Storage & Pipeline segment with increased pipeline and gathering earnings. 2015 operating earnings guidance for this segment has increased from a range of $80 million to $88 million to a range of $90 million to $98 million. The majority of this increase is due to strong underlying performance in the business. And therefore, we expect a majority of this favorability to flow into 2016.
For Energy Trading business, we have raised our earnings guidance to a range of 0 to $20 million for 2015. Energy Trading is now part of our growth segments. And our original guidance is set at 0 as we do not rely on this business to achieve our earnings target. As this year is progressing, we're recognizing the strong economic performance and adjusting our 2015 guidance accordingly. Trading does have seasonality tied to the fiscal part of its business. And those contracts mostly make money in the first and fourth quarter.
And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Jeff Jewell, our Vice President and Controller, to provide more details on the second quarter earnings results."

I will be discussing quarter-over-quarter earnings results on Page 13. And on Page 14, I will review our electric sales in order to provide more insight into what we are experiencing.
Now turning to Page 13. For the quarter, DTE Energy's operating earnings were $137 million or $0.76 per share. And for reference, our reported earnings were $0.61 per share. You can find the reconciliation of the second quarter reported operating earnings on Slide 26. For the quarter-over-quarter results, our growth segments second quarter operating earnings in 2015 were lower by $4 million or $0.03 per share. The electric segment was lower by $18 million. This is primarily due to increased cost associated with rate base growth and unfavorable weather, partially offset by lower O&M. The gas segment was lower by $3 million, driven by unfavorable weather in the second quarter of 2015. 
Gas Storage & Pipelines earnings were $7 million above the prior year. This increase was primarily due to the volume growth in the Bluestone Pipeline and Gathering assets. Our Power & Industrial Projects segment was up $5 million versus 2014. Quarter-over-quarter, favorability was primarily driven by strong performance across the business lines. Our Corporate & Other segment came in favorable by $5 million versus last year. This variance is mainly due to tax-related timing differences. The overall growth segment results for the quarter were $134 million or $0.75 per share. At Energy Trading, operating results for the quarter came in at positive $3 million with economic net income of $19 million. Both the power and gas business lines contributed to these results. Please refer to Page 24 of the appendix to review the Energy Trading standard reconciliation page, which shows both economic and accounting performance.
Now let's turn to Page 14 to discuss our electric sales results. For the first half of the year, temperature-normalized electric sales were down 0.7%. We are very encouraged by the drivers of this change year-to-date and for the future. This net change reflects both the underlying economic growth in all sectors and that energy efficiency is making positive impact to reduce customer average usage. The economic increases are being driven by population growth, occupancy rate strength, income growth and manufacturing auto production levels that have surpassed prerecession levels.
Energy efficiency, which is producing positive results for our customers, is a key component of our overall operational and financial plans and a key priority for the governor. This efficiency translates into reductions in the average energy bill for our residential customers, which is one of the key components of our long-term strategy to create affordability headroom as we embark in a very intensive capital investment program. Therefore, we are changing our sales forecast as we anticipate our load growth over the next few years to be close to flat as underlying economic growth and energy efficiency play out.
That concludes the update on our earnings and sales for the quarter. I'd like to now turn the discussion over to Mark, who will cover cash flow and balance sheet metrics."

In addition to the solid earnings results that Jeff just described, we delivered solid cash flow and capital investments in the first half of the year as well. And all of that is underpinned by the strength of our balance sheet.
Slide 16 lays out our cash flows and CapEx through first half of the year. Cash from operations is $1.2 billion, which is up slightly over last year and in line with our plan. We saw strong cash flow performance across all the business units and are reaffirming our full year cash from operations guidance of $1.7 billion. We invested $1.1 billion of CapEx from the first half of the year. And on the right side of the page, you can see the breakout by business unit. 
DTE Electric is higher due primarily to the acquisition of a gas peaker back in the first quarter, partially offset by the timing of wind investments between years. And there's some year-over-year timing differences in our nonutility businesses as well. Both total year-to-date CapEx is on track with our plan and consistent with our full year guidance of $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion. Finally, to fund this CapEx program and to pay down commercial paper balances, we issued $800 million in long-term debt financing in the first half of the year.
Now we'll move to Slide 17 with a look at our balance sheet metrics. In short, our balance sheet remains strong and we project ending the year within our targeted range for both leverage and FFO to debt. We issued $200 million of equity back in the first quarter, which fulfilled our equity needs for the year. And there is no change in our plans to issue $800 million to $900 million of new equity through 2017. We continue to take advantage of the low interest rates by issuing $300 million of 7-year debt at the parent company, which is where we fund most investments at our nonutilities. 
During the quarter, we met with the rating agencies, and they all reaffirmed our current ratings and outlook, which demonstrates our commitment to maintaining a strong BBB credit rating. And lastly, after renewing our credit facility back in April, we ended the second quarter with a comfortable $2.2 billion of available liquidity. And now I'll hand the discussion back over to Peter to wrap up."

There are model turnovers, so they're creating brand-new vehicles and new models. You'll see that from time-to-time. That's really what that's related. That is really onetime in nature. And some that is just the level of new models that are -- which is great news for our auto companies that are being produced here. For the energy efficiency, I guess, first, I just want to talk about that a little bit. We're really pleased with the level of energy efficiency in our service territory. And we've been really working hard at this over the last 5 years. And I believe we're on the leading edge of some of our -- some of the areas at energy efficiency, especially in delivering tools to our customers to save energy. If you recall and if you actually saw the March energy address the governor gave, he actually held up his smartphone that had the DTE Insight app there. So we've actually kind of cracked the code off our AMI technology and how do we deliver that real time to our customers to use it. So even though energy efficiency increases maybe over time the electric rate over time, but it does lower customer bills, which provides headroom for rate increases needed to cover new capital investments. So I know your question, Julien, was what does that do from a rate case strategy? Our rate case timing is really tied to the capital investment we have over and above depreciation. So that's really going to be tied. It really doesn't impact the timing of that. And what we're seeing actually is that it will provide headroom for us from a total customer bulk perspective to get recovery of the new capital investment."

So they are still in the process of considering ownership on the project. On the gathering side, and as evidenced by this year-to-date results and our guidance increase, we're seeing great results on our gathering business. This is a business that we started in 2012 with the partnership with Southwestern Energy. So as we've been going down our learning curve and cost curve, it's really helped us with that relationship. And that's a business that we like as well because as we get into new projects, like NEXUS, the idea there is to do a very similar blueprint of what we're seeing in Millennium that you work with producers, good gathering and laterals that will feed into NEXUS. So we'll continue to look at those opportunities. And I do believe in the future, they will be there for us related to NEXUS."

Now both the Nofs and the Nesbitt proposals versus having a mandate kind of working that and integrating that as part of this integrated resource playing process. And the governor has been really public around energy efficiency. So it's going to be part of our generation planning. We'll be leveled out, we'll covered off in energy efficiency. And as you know, even the Clean Power Plan, the EPA requirements gives you credit for energy efficiency."

Good news, the Tigers have won 47 games. Bad news is they've lost 48. Just like the first half of July weather here in Detroit area has been colder than normal, the Tigers have cooled off as well this month. We're hoping that the summer heats up, so do the Tiger bats. And I'm still holding out some hope for a playoff berth.
Unlike the Tigers, here at DTE, we certainly have had a successful first half of the year. And I believe we're well positioned to continue the success in the balance of 2015. As all of you saw on our earnings release, we are raising our 2015 EPS guidance on strong year-to-date results. Jeff and Mark will be going through the second quarter results in more detail. But before we move on to that, I'd like to do a quick overview of our business strategy as well as some highlights on what's happening at DTE in Michigan. 
Slide 5 provides an overview of our business strategy and investment thesis. Our growth plans for the next 10 years at both utilities are highly visible. Our electric utility growth is driven by environmental spend in the near term and renewal of our generation fleet and upgrading the distribution system in the longer-term. Our gas utility growth is driven by infrastructure investments and the mainline pipe replacement. Our 2 utilities are deploying capital in a constructive regulatory environment, and we are working hard to earn this constructive environment every day. I'll be updating you on some of the regulatory proceedings our utilities are currently working through. Complementing our utility growth are meaningful growth opportunities in our nonutility businesses, which provide diversity in earnings and geography.
Our highly engaged workforce continues to be the key to our success. Last quarter, I told you about the third consecutive Gallup Great Workplace Award. And just recently, DTE Energy received the Development by Design Award from the Gallup organization. The award recognizes DTE's focus on creating personnel, team and organizational success through employee training programs, though we definitely continue to make strides in our employee engagement efforts. We have a strong focus on continuous improvement and feel we are distinctive in the industry on our approach and outcomes. The combination of these 2, employee engagement and continuous improvement, enables us to deliver both sustainable cost savings track record and to consistently earn authorized returns at both of our utilities.
We are also very focused on operational excellence and customer satisfaction that we believe also are distinctive in our industry. We have certainly seen positive result on this front as currently DTE Gas is ranked highest by J.D. Power among our peers for residential and business customer satisfaction. And earlier this month, we found out that DTE Electric was ranked second in overall customer satisfaction with electric utility residential customers in J.D. Power's 2015 study. Our dividend continues to grow as we grow earnings. And our goal is to maintain a strong BBB credit rating. This strategy provides for consistent 5% to 6% annual EPS growth.
Slide 6 provides some highlights of progress in 2015. First on our list is our announcement that we're increasing our operating EPS guidance for this year. We're increasing from an EPS midpoint of $4.60 to a midpoint of $4.72. This is driven by strong performance in our Gas, Storage & Pipeline business as well as our Energy Trading operations. I'll provide a more detailed overview of guidance in a few minutes. Keeping inline with our commitment to grow our dividend with earnings, we have recently increased our dividend. Our annual dividend per share was increased from $2.76 to $2.92, which is a 5.8% increase.
Regarding Michigan's energy policy, I feel there is positive momentum for the constructive legislation by the end of the year. This continues to be a priority of the governor, and he called out publicly the need to get legislation done this year. Back in March, Representative Aric Nesbitt introduced legislation. And recently, the Senate Lead Mike Nofs introduced legislation, so the process is definitely moving along. I'll touch more on the energy policy in a few minutes.
I also want to give a quick update on the various rate proceedings for our 2 utilities. Our electric utility's self-help minute[ph] rate on July 1 for the ongoing general rate proceeding. We expect to receive a final order by the end of the year. We also implemented our new cost of service rates, which resulted in rate reductions for many of our business customers. For DTE Gas, we expect to receive an order this year for an expanded Infrastructure Recovery Mechanism that if approved will allow us to double our annual miles of our mainline replacement program. We continue to make significant progress in our nonutility businesses.
In our Gas Storage & Pipeline business, Millennium had a successful open season, and we're working through final contracts now. We expect an expansion of greater than 0.2 Bcf. In addition, we are constructing a new 8-mile lateral off Millennium to serve a proposed 650 megawatt combined cycle plant with approximately 0.1 B/day of natural gas. These projects are expected to be service in the fourth quarter of 2017. This is another major milestone that helps firm up future year growth.
The NEXUS Pipeline project is also moving forward nicely towards its fourth quarter 2017 in-service date. The FERC scoping meetings are complete, and we're relatively routine. We recently signed a number of Tampa [ph] interconnection agreements that could provide potential aggregate load across Northern Ohio up to 1.3 Bcf per day. This demonstrates strong market support for the project and also strengthens the longer-term earnings potential for the pipe. We filed our resource reports in June with the FERC as scheduled. And our next major milestone will be to file the FERC application in the fourth quarter of this year.
We are also now very focused on optimizing our Reduced Emissions Fuel business. Currently, we have REF facilities operating at 8 sites and are in the process of relocating underutilized facilities to a ninth site, which should be operational in the fourth quarter. In addition, this quarter, we are operating a third-party REF facility. This operating agreement will run through 2020. We'll continue to work towards further optimization of this business line as this has been a great return business for us, which has generated very significant cash flows to help fund our nonutility growth projects. So you can see, we've had a successful first half of the year, giving us confidence to reach our earnings goal in 2015. Let me now move to updates on the Michigan improvements and the economy.
So turning to Slide 7. We're highlighting the progress that Michigan and the city of Detroit are making. I know many of you are interested in how the local economy is doing, and we continue to see economic momentum in the state. Michigan's unemployment rate in June is 5.5%. This rate has been around 5.5% the last 3 months, roughly in line with the national average. Michigan's unemployment rate hasn't been at this level since 2001. Michigan is identified by the Site Selection Magazine as being the seventh most competitive state for job creation as well as the #1 state for new manufacturing jobs since 2009. We continue to see in other economic indicators, including increases in residential customer and business customer accounts, and our forecast shows this trend continuing. 
I do want to highlight the city of Detroit's economic progress. One indicator that we show on this slide is the Detroit metro area ranking #8 in the U.S. for a number of new or expansion projects. The city has come a long way since the bankruptcy. And with the strong leadership we have in place, I'm confident the city will continue to move forward. DTE as well as other city partners are working with them to help continue this momentum.
You will see on Slide 8 that the additional changes in the state are taking place as the Michigan Public Service Commission has welcomed Norm Saari as the new commissioner, replacing outgoing commissioner Greg White, whose term has ended. Commissioner Saari has a deep background in public policy and governmental and community affairs both in the state government and direct utility experience. This is Governor Snyder's third appointment. The governor had been great at talent selection. The commission has helped the Michigan regulatory environment to be one of the most constructive in the country. We believe that Commissioner Saari will continue this supportive environment.
Moving on to Slide 9. I'm now going to turn to an update on the energy policy. We have mentioned earlier, Governor Snyder has made it clear that energy policy is an important legislative priority for him this year. He called up a need for legislation during the State of the State address and provided a more detailed goals on his energy message in March, highlighting the significant transformation of generation sources that are stable to undertake over the next 10 to 15 years. And over the last few months, both the House and Senate energy leaderships had introduced proposed legislation to adjust needed changes in the state. Representative Aric Nesbitt, who chairs the House Energy Policy Committee, introduced legislation in March that's consistent with the governor's goal to reliability and adaptability. He also recommended the elimination of the retail access program we have here in Michigan, which we support. 
Senator Mike Nofs, who chairs the Senate Energy and Technology Committee, introduced legislation in June, which is also similar to the governor's goals. He's recommending to maintain a 10% cap on retail open access but with a onetime election to enter into long-term capacity commitment with an alternative supplier or to return to the utility. A customer could choose to return to the utility with 3-year notice and as a onetime permanent election to return to the utility. We expect legislation to be completed this year, and we're confident that Michigan has strong leaders in place that understand energy and utility dynamics and provide constructive legislation for Michigan's future. All the proposals in the legislative drawing board represent a positive move forward. In a moment, I'll turn the call over to Jeff to review the quarterly results. But before that, I want to highlight -- drive some highlights of our outlook and guidance increase. 
On Slide 10, this slide shows our EPS history with our target of 5% to 6% growth. As I mentioned before, we expect to grow our dividend with earnings, evidenced by our recent increase. The chart shows a revised 2015 guidance midpoint of $4.72 as well as our EPS guidance midpoint of $4.66 for our growth segments. The 5% to 6% future growth, as I mentioned, is off our new guidance growth segment dividend[ph]  point of $4.66 per share. And our commitment is to grow both earnings and our dividends, and we are just doing that.
Let me get into a little more detail on Page 11. We're increasing our 2015 EPS guidance range to $4.54 to $4.90 for DTE Energy. This is a 12% increase in the midpoint from our prior range of $4.48 to $4.72. Our EPS guidance range for our growth segments is now $4.54 to $4.78. Our guidance increase is driven by strong start of the year in our Gas Storage & Pipeline segment with increased pipeline and gathering earnings. 2015 operating earnings guidance for this segment has increased from a range of $80 million to $88 million to a range of $90 million to $98 million. The majority of this increase is due to strong underlying performance in the business. And therefore, we expect a majority of this favorability to flow into 2016.
For Energy Trading business, we have raised our earnings guidance to a range of 0 to $20 million for 2015. Energy Trading is now part of our growth segments. And our original guidance is set at 0 as we do not rely on this business to achieve our earnings target. As this year is progressing, we're recognizing the strong economic performance and adjusting our 2015 guidance accordingly. Trading does have seasonality tied to the fiscal part of its business. And those contracts mostly make money in the first and fourth quarter.
And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Jeff Jewell, our Vice President and Controller, to provide more details on the second quarter earnings results."

I will be discussing quarter-over-quarter earnings results on Page 13. And on Page 14, I will review our electric sales in order to provide more insight into what we are experiencing.
Now turning to Page 13. For the quarter, DTE Energy's operating earnings were $137 million or $0.76 per share. And for reference, our reported earnings were $0.61 per share. You can find the reconciliation of the second quarter reported operating earnings on Slide 26. For the quarter-over-quarter results, our growth segments second quarter operating earnings in 2015 were lower by $4 million or $0.03 per share. The electric segment was lower by $18 million. This is primarily due to increased cost associated rate base growth and unfavorable weather, partially offset by lower O&M. The gas segment was lower by $3 million, driven by unfavorable weather in the second quarter of 2015. 
Gas Storage & Pipelines earnings were $7 million above the prior year. This increase was primarily due to the volume growth in the Bluestone Pipeline and Gathering assets. Our Power & Industrial Projects segment was up $5 million versus 2014. Quarter-over-quarter, favorability was primarily driven by strong performance across the business lines. Our Corporate & Other segment came in favorable by $5 million versus last year. This variance is mainly due to tax-related timing differences. The overall growth segment results for the quarter were $134 million or $0.75 per share. At Energy Trading, operating results for the quarter came in at positive $3 million with economic net income of $19 million. Both the power and gas business lines contributed to these results. Please refer to Page 24 of the appendix to review the Energy Trading standard reconciliation page, which shows both economic and accounting performance.
Now let's turn to Page 14 to discuss our electric sales results. For the first half of the year, temperature-normalized electric sales were down 0.7%. We are very encouraged by the drivers of this change year-to-date and for the future. This net change reflects both the underlying economic growth in all sectors and that energy efficiency is making positive impact to reduce customer average usage. The economic increases are being driven by population growth, occupancy rate strength, income growth and manufacturing auto production levels that have surpassed prerecession levels.
Energy efficiency, which is producing positive results for our customers, is a key component of our overall operational and financial plans and a key priority for the governor. This efficiency translates into reductions in the average energy bill for our residential customers, which is one of the key components of our long-term strategy to create affordability headroom as we embark in a very intensive capital investment program. Therefore, we are changing our sales forecast as we anticipate our load growth over the next few years to be close to flat as underlying economic growth and energy efficiency play out.
That concludes the update on our earnings and sales for the quarter. I'd like to now turn the discussion over to Mark, who will cover cash flow and balance sheet metrics."

In addition to the solid earnings results that Jeff just described, we delivered solid cash flow and capital investments for the first half of the year as well. And all of that is underpinned by the strength of our balance sheet.
Slide 16 lays out our cash flows and CapEx through first half of the year. Cash from operations is $1.2 billion, which is up slightly over last year and in line with our plan. We saw strong cash flow performance across all the business units and are reaffirming our full year cash from operations guidance of $1.7 billion. We invested $1.1 billion of CapEx from the first half of the year. And on the right side of the page, you can see the breakout by business unit. 
DTE Electric is higher due primarily to the acquisition of a gas peaker back in the first quarter, partially offset by the timing of wind investments between years. And there's some year-over-year timing differences in our nonutility businesses as well. Both total year-to-date CapEx is on track with our plan and consistent with our full year guidance of $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion. Finally, to fund this CapEx program and to pay down commercial paper balances, we issued $800 million in long-term debt financing in the first half of the year.
Now we'll move to Slide 17 with a look at our balance sheet metrics. In short, our balance sheet remains strong and we project ending the year within our targeted range for both leverage and FFO to debt. We issued $200 million of equity back in the first quarter, which fulfilled our equity needs for the year. And there is no change in our plans to issue $800 million to $900 million of new equity through 2017. We continue to take advantage of the low interest rates by issuing $300 million of 7-year debt at the parent company, which is where we fund most investments at our nonutilities. 
Early in the quarter, we met with the rating agencies, and they all reaffirmed our current ratings and outlook, which demonstrates our commitment to maintaining a strong BBB credit rating. And lastly, after renewing our credit facility back in April, we ended the second quarter with a comfortable $2.2 billion of available liquidity. And now I'll hand the discussion back over to Peter to wrap up."

There are model turnovers, so they're creating brand-new vehicles and new models. You'll see that from time-to-time. That's really what that's related. That is really onetime in nature. And some that is just the level of new models that are -- which is great news for our auto companies that are being produced here. For the energy efficiency, I guess, first, I just want to talk about that a little bit. We're really pleased with the level of energy efficiency in our service territory. And we've been really working hard at this over the last 5 years. And I believe we're on the leading edge of some of our -- some areas of energy efficiency, especially in delivering tools to our customers to save energy. If you recall and if you actually saw the March energy address the Governor gave, he actually held up his smartphone that had the DTE Insight app there. So we've actually kind of cracked the code off our AMI technology and how do we deliver that real time to our customers to use it. So even though energy efficiency increases maybe over time the electric rate over time, but it does lower customer bills, which provides headroom for rate increases needed to cover new capital investments. So I know your question, Julien, was what does that do from a rate case strategy? Our rate case timing is really tied to the capital investment we have over and above depreciation. So that's really going to be tied. It really doesn't impact the timing of that. And what we're seeing actually is that it will provide headroom for us from a total customer bulk perspective to get recovery of the new capital investment."

On the gathering side, and as evidenced by this year-to-date results and our guidance increase, we're seeing great results on our gathering business. This is a business that we started in 2012 with the partnership with Southwestern Energy. So as we've been going down our learning curve and cost curve, it's really helped us with that relationship. And that's a business that we like as well because as we get into new projects, like NEXUS, the idea there is to do a very similar blueprint of what we're seeing in Millennium that you work with producers, good gathering and laterals that will feed into NEXUS.

So the utilities, a lot of them at this point in time, is tied to weather and weather-related type of income. And on the nonutilities, just continued strong performance. For our midstream segment, we have upped the guidance for that segment. So we're comfortable now with that range.

Good news, the Tigers have won 47 games. Bad news is they've lost 48. Just like the first half of July weather here in Detroit area has been colder than normal, the Tigers have cooled off as well this month. We're hoping that the summer heats up, so do the Tiger bats. And I'm still holding out some hope for a playoff berth.
Unlike the Tigers, here at DTE, we certainly have had a successful first half of the year. And I believe we're well positioned to continue the success in the balance of 2015. As all of you saw on our earnings release, we are raising our 2015 EPS guidance on strong year-to-date results. Jeff and Mark will be going through the second quarter results in more detail. But before we move on to that, I'd like to do a quick overview of our business strategy as well as some highlights on what's happening at DTE in Michigan. 
Slide 5 provides an overview of our business strategy and investment thesis. Our growth plans for the next 10 years at both utilities are highly visible. Our electric utility growth is driven by environmental spend in the near term and renewal of our generation fleet and upgrading the distribution system in the longer-term. Our gas utility growth is driven by infrastructure investments and the mainline pipe replacement. Our 2 utilities are deploying capital in a constructive regulatory environment, and we are working hard to earn this constructive environment every day. I'll be updating you on some of the regulatory proceedings our utilities are currently working through. Complementing our utility growth are meaningful growth opportunities in our nonutility businesses, which provide diversity in earnings and geography.
Our highly engaged workforce continues to be the key to our success. Last quarter, I told you about the third consecutive Gallup Great Workplace Award. And just recently, DTE Energy received the Development by Design Award from the Gallup organization. The award recognizes DTE's focus on creating personnel, team and organizational success through employee training programs, though we definitely continue to make strides in our employee engagement efforts. We have a strong focus on continuous improvement and feel we are distinctive in the industry on our approach and outcomes. The combination of these 2, employee engagement and continuous improvement, enables us to deliver both sustainable cost savings track record and to consistently earn authorized returns at both of our utilities.
We are also very focused on operational excellence and customer satisfaction that we believe also are distinctive in our industry. We have certainly seen positive result on this front as currently DTE Gas is ranked highest by J.D. Power among our peers for residential and business customer satisfaction. And earlier this month, we found out that DTE Electric was ranked second in overall customer satisfaction with electric utility residential customers in J.D. Power's 2015 study. Our dividend continues to grow as we grow earnings. And our goal is to maintain a strong BBB credit rating. This strategy provides for consistent 5% to 6% annual EPS growth.
Slide 6 provides some highlights of progress in 2015. First on our list is our announcement that we're increasing our operating EPS guidance for this year. We're increasing from an EPS midpoint of $4.60 to a midpoint of $4.72. This is driven by strong performance in our Gas, Storage & Pipeline business as well as our Energy Trading operations. I'll provide a more detailed overview of guidance in a few minutes. Keeping in line with our commitment to grow our dividend with earnings, we have recently increased our dividend. Our annual dividend per share was increased from $2.76 to $2.92, which is a 5.8% increase.
Regarding Michigan's energy policy, I feel there is positive momentum for the constructive legislation by the end of the year. This continues to be a priority of the governor, and he called out publicly the need to get legislation done this year. Back in March, Representative Aric Nesbitt introduced legislation. And recently, the Senate Lead Mike Nofs introduced legislation, so the process is definitely moving along. I'll touch more on the energy policy in a few minutes.
I also want to give a quick update on the various rate proceedings for our 2 utilities. Our electric utility's self-help minute[ph] rate on July 1 for the ongoing general rate proceeding. We expect to receive a final order by the end of the year. We also implemented our new cost of service rates, which resulted in rate reductions for many of our business customers. For DTE Gas, we expect to receive an order this year for an expanded Infrastructure Recovery Mechanism that if approved will allow us to double our annual miles of our mainline replacement program. We continue to make significant progress in our nonutility businesses.
In our Gas Storage & Pipeline business, Millennium had a successful open season, and we're working through final contracts now. We expect an expansion of greater than 0.2 Bcf. In addition, we are constructing a new 8-mile lateral off Millennium to serve a proposed 650 megawatt combined cycle plant with approximately 0.1 B/day of natural gas. These projects are expected to be service in the fourth quarter of 2017. This is another major milestone that helps firm up future year growth.
The NEXUS Pipeline project is also moving forward nicely towards its fourth quarter 2017 in-service date. The FERC scoping meetings are complete, and we're relatively routine. We recently signed a number of Tampa [ph] interconnection agreements that could provide potential aggregate load across Northern Ohio up to 1.3 Bcf per day. This demonstrates strong market support for the project and also strengthens the longer-term earnings potential for the pipe. We filed our resource reports in June with the FERC as scheduled. And our next major milestone will be to file the FERC application in the fourth quarter of this year.
We are also now very focused on optimizing our Reduced Emissions Fuel business. Currently, we have REF facilities operating at 8 sites and are in the process of relocating underutilized facilities to a ninth site, which should be operational in the fourth quarter. In addition, this quarter, we are operating a third-party REF facility. This operating agreement will run through 2020. We'll continue to work towards further optimization of this business line as this has been a great return business for us, which has generated very significant cash flows to help fund our nonutility growth projects. So you can see, we've had a successful first half of the year, giving us confidence to reach our earnings goal in 2015. Let me now move to updates on the Michigan improvements and the economy.
So turning to Slide 7. We're highlighting the progress that Michigan and the city of Detroit are making. I know many of you are interested in how the local economy is doing, and we continue to see economic momentum in the state. Michigan's unemployment rate in June is 5.5%. This rate has been around 5.5% the last 3 months, roughly in line with the national average. Michigan's unemployment rate hasn't been at this level since 2001. Michigan is identified by the Site Selection Magazine as being the seventh most competitive state for job creation as well as the #1 state for new manufacturing jobs since 2009. We continue to see in other economic indicators, including increases in residential customer and business customer accounts, and our forecast shows this trend continuing. 
I do want to highlight the city of Detroit's economic progress. One indicator that we show on this slide is the Detroit metro area ranking #8 in the U.S. for a number of new or expansion projects. The city has come a long way since the bankruptcy. And with the strong leadership we have in place, I'm confident the city will continue to move forward. DTE as well as other city partners are working with them to help continue this momentum.
You will see on Slide 8 that the additional changes in the state are taking place as the Michigan Public Service Commission has welcomed Norm Saari as the new commissioner, replacing outgoing commissioner Greg White, whose term has ended. Commissioner Saari has a deep background in public policy and governmental and community affairs both in the state government and direct utility experience. This is Governor Snyder's third appointment. The governor had been great at talent selection. The commission has helped the Michigan regulatory environment to be one of the most constructive in the country. We believe that Commissioner Saari will continue this supportive environment.
Moving on to Slide 9. I'm now going to turn to an update on the energy policy. We have mentioned earlier, Governor Snyder has made it clear that energy policy is an important legislative priority for him this year. He called up a need for legislation during the State of the State address and provided a more detailed goals on his energy message in March, highlighting the significant transformation of generation sources that are stable to undertake over the next 10 to 15 years. And over the last few months, both the House and Senate energy leaderships had introduced proposed legislation to adjust needed changes in the state. Representative Aric Nesbitt, who chairs the House Energy Policy Committee, introduced legislation in March that's consistent with the governor's goal to reliability and adaptability. He also recommended the elimination of the retail access program we have here in Michigan, which we support. 
Senator Mike Nofs, who chairs the Senate Energy and Technology Committee, introduced legislation in June, which is also similar to the governor's goals. He's recommending to maintain a 10% cap on retail open access but with a onetime election to enter into long-term capacity commitment with an alternative supplier or to return to the utility. A customer could choose to return to the utility with 3-year notice and as a onetime permanent election to return to the utility. We expect legislation to be completed this year, and we're confident that Michigan has strong leaders in place that understand energy and utility dynamics and provide constructive legislation for Michigan's future. All the proposals in the legislative drawing board represent a positive move forward. In a moment, I'll turn the call over to Jeff to review the quarterly results. But before that, I want to highlight -- drive some highlights of our outlook and guidance increase. 
On Slide 10, this slide shows our EPS history with our target of 5% to 6% growth. As I mentioned before, we expect to grow our dividend with earnings, evidenced by our recent increase. The chart shows a revised 2015 guidance midpoint of $4.72 as well as our EPS guidance midpoint of $4.66 for our growth segments. The 5% to 6% future growth, as I mentioned, is off our new guidance growth segment dividend[ph]  point of $4.66 per share. And our commitment is to grow both earnings and our dividends, and we are just doing that.
Let me get into a little more detail on Page 11. We're increasing our 2015 EPS guidance range to $4.54 to $4.90 for DTE Energy. This is a 12% increase in the midpoint from our prior range of $4.48 to $4.72. Our EPS guidance range for our growth segments is now $4.54 to $4.78. Our guidance increase is driven by strong start of the year in our Gas Storage & Pipeline segment with increased pipeline and gathering earnings. 2015 operating earnings guidance for this segment has increased from a range of $80 million to $88 million to a range of $90 million to $98 million. The majority of this increase is due to strong underlying performance in the business. And therefore, we expect a majority of this favorability to flow into 2016.
For Energy Trading business, we have raised our earnings guidance to a range of 0 to $20 million for 2015. Energy Trading is now part of our growth segments. And our original guidance is set at 0 as we do not rely on this business to achieve our earnings target. As this year is progressing, we're recognizing the strong economic performance and adjusting our 2015 guidance accordingly. Trading does have seasonality tied to the fiscal part of its business. And those contracts mostly make money in the first and fourth quarter.
And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Jeff Jewell, our Vice President and Controller, to provide more details on the second quarter earnings results."

I will be discussing quarter-over-quarter earnings results on Page 13. And on Page 14, I will review our electric sales in order to provide more insight into what we are experiencing.
Now turning to Page 13. For the quarter, DTE Energy's operating earnings were $137 million or $0.76 per share. And for reference, our reported earnings were $0.61 per share. You can find the reconciliation of the second quarter reported operating earnings on Slide 26. For the quarter-over-quarter results, our growth segments second quarter operating earnings in 2015 were lower by $4 million or $0.03 per share. The electric segment was lower by $18 million. This is primarily due to increased cost associated rate base growth and unfavorable weather, partially offset by lower O&M. The gas segment was lower by $3 million, driven by unfavorable weather in the second quarter of 2015. 
Gas Storage & Pipelines earnings were $7 million above the prior year. This increase was primarily due to the volume growth in the Bluestone Pipeline and Gathering assets. Our Power & Industrial Projects segment was up $5 million versus 2014. Quarter-over-quarter, favorability was primarily driven by strong performance across the business lines. Our Corporate & Other segment came in favorable by $5 million versus last year. This variance is mainly due to tax-related timing differences. The overall growth segment results for the quarter were $134 million or $0.75 per share. At Energy Trading, operating results for the quarter came in at positive $3 million with economic net income of $19 million. Both the power and gas business lines contributed to these results. Please refer to Page 24 of the appendix to review the Energy Trading standard reconciliation page, which shows both economic and accounting performance.
Now let's turn to Page 14 to discuss our electric sales results. For the first half of the year, temperature-normalized electric sales were down 0.7%. We are very encouraged by the drivers of this change year-to-date and for the future. This net change reflects both the underlying economic growth in all sectors and that energy efficiency is making positive impact to reduce customer average usage. The economic increases are being driven by population growth, occupancy rate strength, income growth and manufacturing auto production levels that have surpassed prerecession levels.
Energy efficiency, which is producing positive results for our customers, is a key component of our overall operational and financial plans and a key priority for the governor. This efficiency translates into reductions in the average energy bill for our residential customers, which is one of the key components of our long-term strategy to create affordability headroom as we embark in a very intensive capital investment program. Therefore, we are changing our sales forecast as we anticipate our load growth over the next few years to be close to flat as underlying economic growth and energy efficiency play out.
That concludes the update on our earnings and sales for the quarter. I'd like to now turn the discussion over to Mark, who will cover cash flow and balance sheet metrics."

In addition to the solid earnings results that Jeff just described, we delivered solid cash flow and capital investments for the first half of the year as well. And all of that is underpinned by the strength of our balance sheet.
Slide 16 lays out our cash flows and CapEx through first half of the year. Cash from operations is $1.2 billion, which is up slightly over last year and in line with our plan. We saw strong cash flow performance across all the business units and are reaffirming our full year cash from operations guidance of $1.7 billion. We invested $1.1 billion of CapEx from the first half of the year. And on the right side of the page, you can see the breakout by business unit. 
DTE Electric is higher due primarily to the acquisition of a gas peaker back in the first quarter, partially offset by the timing of wind investments between years. And there's some year-over-year timing differences in our nonutility businesses as well. Both total year-to-date CapEx is on track with our plan and consistent with our full year guidance of $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion. Finally, to fund this CapEx program and to pay down commercial paper balances, we issued $800 million in long-term debt financing in the first half of the year.
Now we'll move to Slide 17 with a look at our balance sheet metrics. In short, our balance sheet remains strong and we project ending the year within our targeted range for both leverage and FFO to debt. We issued $200 million of equity back in the first quarter, which fulfilled our equity needs for the year. And there is no change in our plans to issue $800 million to $900 million of new equity through 2017. We continue to take advantage of the low interest rates by issuing $300 million of 7-year debt at the parent company, which is where we fund most investments at our nonutilities. 
Early in the quarter, we met with the rating agencies, and they all reaffirmed our current ratings and outlook, which demonstrates our commitment to maintaining a strong BBB credit rating. And lastly, after renewing our credit facility back in April, we ended the second quarter with a comfortable $2.2 billion of available liquidity. And now I'll hand the discussion back over to Peter to wrap up."

There are model turnovers, so they're creating brand-new vehicles and new models. You'll see that from time-to-time. That's really what that's related. That is really onetime in nature. And some that is just the level of new models that are -- which is great news for our auto companies that are being produced here. For the energy efficiency, I guess, first, I just want to talk about that a little bit. We're really pleased with the level of energy efficiency in our service territory. And we've been really working hard at this over the last 5 years. And I believe we're on the leading edge of some of our -- some areas of energy efficiency, especially in delivering tools to our customers to save energy. If you recall and if you actually saw the March energy address the Governor gave, he actually held up his smartphone that had the DTE Insight app there. So we've actually kind of cracked the code off our AMI technology and how do we deliver that real time to our customers to use it. So even though energy efficiency increases maybe over time the electric rate over time, but it does lower customer bills, which provides headroom for rate increases needed to cover new capital investments. So I know your question, Julien, was what does that do from a rate case strategy? Our rate case timing is really tied to the capital investment we have over and above depreciation. So that's really going to be tied. It really doesn't impact the timing of that. And what we're seeing actually is that it will provide headroom for us from a total customer bulk perspective to get recovery of the new capital investment."

On the gathering side, and as evidenced by this year-to-date results and our guidance increase, we're seeing great results on our gathering business. This is a business that we started in 2012 with the partnership with Southwestern Energy. So as we've been going down our learning curve and cost curve, it's really helped us with that relationship. And that's a business that we like as well because as we get into new projects, like NEXUS, the idea there is to do a very similar blueprint of what we're seeing in Millennium that you work with producers, good gathering and laterals that will feed into NEXUS.

DTE continue to have a successful year in 2015. As you know, we raised our operating earnings guidance a few weeks ago at our Analyst Day. I feel very confident we'd be able to comfortably achieve our guidance. We had a very successful third quarter, and we expect a solid quarter to finish the year. We also provided a 2016 early outlook during our Analyst Day, and I'm confident we can reach our 2016 EPS target as well.
Jeff and Mark will be going through third quarter results in more detail. But before we move onto that, I'd like to do a quick overview of our business strategy as well as some highlights of what's happening at DTE.
Through to Slide 5. Slide 5 provides an overview of the business strategy and investment thesis. Our growth plans in the next 10 years of both utilities are highly visible. Our electric utility growth is driven by the renewal of our generation fleet and replacing and upgrading the electric distribution system. Our gas utility growth is driven by infrastructure investments, the main line replacement, pipe replacement and a system expansion to accommodate the increased volumes for the NEXUS Pipeline into the metro pipeline.
Complementing our utility growth are meaningful growth opportunities in our nonutility businesses, which provides diversity in earnings and geography. Constructive regulatory environment, engaged employees, continuous improvement and top-level customer satisfaction continue to be priorities that drive DTE success. A constructive regulatory environment is important, and the utilities are investing significant capital in the State of Michigan. And we know fostering this environment is a two-way street. I'll be updating you on some of the regulatory proceedings our utilities are currently working through. A highly engaged workforce continues to be a key to our success, and we have described our success throughout the year with the recognition we have received from the Gallup organization over the last 3 years. Our focus on continuous improvement is distinctive in the industry as the utilities continue to be leaders in maintaining cost. The combination of these 2, employee engagement and continuous improvement, enables us to deliver both sustainable cost, savings track record and to consistently earn returns at both of our utilities. 
We are also very focused and customer satisfaction, demonstrated by our gas utility currently ranked highest by J.D. Power among our peers business customer satisfaction. Both DTE Electric and DTE Gas are ranked second in satisfaction of residential customers. Rounding out our business strategy is dividend growth and solid credit rating. Our dividend continues to grow us to grow earnings, and the goal is to maintain a strong BBB credit rating. This strategy provides for consistent 5% to 6% annual EPS growth.
Slide 6 provides some highlights of progress in 2015. As I mentioned earlier at our Analyst Day, we raised our 2015 operating EPS guidance and provided a 2016 operating EPS early outlook. I'll provide a more detailed overview of guidance in a few minutes. Today, we are revising our cash flow capital guidance for 2015, and Mark will provide more details on this in a few minutes. Regarding Michigan's energy policy, there's positive momentum for construction legislation by the end of the year. The governor and other energy leaders have called this a major priority. There's legislation that has been developed in both the House and the senate, and the more extensive hearings have now been concluded. There'd been a dozen hearings on the House now on the proposed legislation and 8 in the senate, so this legislation is moving along nicely. 
I also want to give a quick update on the various rate proceedings for our 2 utilities. Our electric utility self-implemented rates in July 1 for ongoing general rate proceeding. We expect to receive a final order by the end of the year. We also implemented the new cost of service rates, which resulted in rate reductions for most of our business customers at the same time of self-implementation. For DTE Gas, we expect to receive an order this year for an expanded Infrastructure Recovery Mechanism that if approved will allow us to double the annual miles of our mainline replacement program. For next gas general rate case, we're looking to file in late 2015 or early 2016. We're finalizing our plans. We feel this time optimal time to file. As you know, we haven't filed a rate case at our gas utility in nearly 4 years. We continue to make significant progress in our nonutility businesses. 
Let me hit on a couple of developments in our gas storage and pipeline business. Millennium is currently working on a 200 Mcf/day expansion, which is expected to go in service in the fourth quarter of 2017. In addition, Millennium to is constructing an 8-mile value lateral to supply 130 Mcf to a new natural gas plant in Pennsylvania. This is expected on service in April of 2017. We've increased our ownership in the NEXUS Pipeline project from 33% to 50%, which increases our planned investment to approximately $1 billion. We've executed a number of key milestones including the contracting for the major pipe materials earlier this month. Our next key milestones on the NEXUS project is the FERC filing, which will happen later this year. We have commitments we need to move forward with the construction of the pipe. We have recently signed a number of interconnect agreements that could provide potential aggregate load across Northern Ohio for up to 1.4 Bcf a day. This demonstrates strong market support for the project and also strengthens the longer-term earnings potential for the pipe, and we continue to see increasing production forecast for the Appalachian region. You can see we have a lot of positive things going on at both our utilities and nonutilities, giving us confidence to reach our earnings goals in 2015. 
I'd like to move on to provide more detail on Michigan's energy legislation, but before I do that, let me give you a quick update on Michigan's economy. The state economic indicators are looking very strong. We show some of the actual forecasted of metrics in the appendix, but I'd like to highlight Michigan's unemployment rate for September, which is 5%. This is actually lower than the national rate of 5.1%, and it's worth noting because of the first time in Michigan's unemployment rate is below the national average in 15 years. So things continue to move in the right direction in our state. 
So now let me move on to the state energy policy reform in Slide 7. Slide 7 is a slide you've seen before showing Michigan's leaders who are helping to move the state's energy policy reform to its completion. We're definitely fortunate to have these individuals who really understand what good energy policy looks like. The governor identified the need for energy policy reform as one of his top priorities, and he has not wavered from that all year. He's taken time to study and understand our industry and on what good policy moving forward would be. He has good advisers And with Senator Nofs and Representative Nesbitt, we have 2 very competent energy leaders in the Senate and the House. So we have a situation where all 3 entities: the administration, the House and the Senate, are clear that Michigan does need to develop new policy to control its future. There's definitely progress happening. It gives us confidence of a timely resolution to the energy policy reform. Both the Senate and the House Energy Committee have included extensive hearings on the legislative package. Nofs and Nesbitt are working with committee members with both committee possibly by next month.
So now I would like to turn to some specifics of legislation that's under development in the House and the Senate on Page 8, starting with the retail open access. Leadership in both the House and the Senate realize that the current system is broken, so both are proposing reforms. Both proposals, as they stand now, would cast the current program at 10% but with stricter and more fair provisions. Actually, the House until recently had planned to eliminate retail open access altogether, but as part of the alignment process now proposing to stay at the 10% cap. But importantly, both the House and the Senate would require a onetime election to return to utility, which means there'll be no longer 3 options to move back and forth between the marketplace and the regulated rates. To make the cost of capacity more fair and reliable generation service in the state, the Senate is proposing a 3-year capacity commitment. The House is targeting a 5-year capacity commitment for those customers who stay -- would like to stay in retail open access. Integrated resource planning, or IRP, is the second key element of legislation the proposals enable preapprovals. So once it's decided on what generation mix there should be, there'll be a process for preapproving investments in assuring that they are prudent and similar to our current certificate of need process or comp process but on a portfolio basis. This new IRP process will fit nicely into the state's implementation plan for the Clean Power Plan. Finally, the legislation is going to the deal with a number of regulatory reforms. Both the House and the Senate are proposing a move from our current 12-month cycle and rate approvals with a 6-month implementation to a simple 10-man cycle. There's also work in establishing a fair net metering policy, which I think is important as we head towards building more renewables. Revenue decoupling is also being proposed for electric utilities. We would like to have this option to enable recovery of the impact and energy efficiency in between rate proceedings. 
So I think the state of Michigan is well positioned to have energy legislation by year-end. That's important so that as a state we can move on in a constructive way to make the investment that we need to transform Michigan's energy infrastructure. 
Let's go on to Slide 9. This slide shows our EPS history and our target of 5% to 6% growth. As I mentioned before, we expect to grow our dividend with earnings as evidenced by recent increase, which is at the high end of our earnings growth target. The chart shows our revised 2015 guidance midpoint of 2 -- $4.78 as well as the EPS guidance midpoint of $4.69 for our growth segment. The 5% to 6% future growth I mentioned is off our new 2016 early outlook midpoint of $4.93 per share. The $4.93 midpoint represents a 7% increase from the 2015 original guidance. 
So let me get into a little more detail on Page 10. On Slide 10 shows our current 2015 EPS guidance and our 2016 EPS early outlook. I want to focus on our 2015 guidance. Our current EPS guidance range is $4.65 to $4.91 for total DTE Energy and $4.59 to $4.79 for our growth segments. You can see next to the guidance numbers arrows indicating where we think the year may play off for each segment. We have green arrows up -- next to all of our nonutility businesses as these businesses have a repeat of the strong performance in the fourth quarter, similar to what we experienced in the first 3 quarters this year than we are seeing earnings fall in the upper end of these ranges. For our Gas, Storage & Pipeline, we are seeing strong performance on both pipeline and gathering earnings. Our power industrial product segment has seen outperformance in our REF business, and we are seeing a strong economic performance at our Energy Trading operations. Our corporate and other segment is trading towards the lower end of guidance, driven by taxes. I mentioned the strong financial performance we've seen this year, so I'd like to turn the call over to Jeff Jewell to provide more details of the earnings results."

I'll be going over quarter-over-quarter results on Page 12. And on Page 13, I will provide more detail into DTE Electric's quarter-over-quarter operating earnings variance. Now turning to Page 12. For the quarter",552,"Thanks, Peter, and good morning, everyone. I'll be going over quarter-over-quarter results on Page 12. And on Page 13, I will provide more detail into DTE Electric's quarter-over-quarter operating earnings variance. Now turning to Page 12. For the quarter, DTE Energy's operating earnings were $252 million or $1.40 per share, and for reference, our reported earnings were $1.47 per share. You can find the reconciliation of the third quarter reported to operating earnings on Page 27. For the quarter, our growth segment's operating earnings in 2015 were $75 million or $0.40 per share higher than 2014.
Electric segment was higher by $79 million. This favorability was due to warmer weather, self-implemented rates and lower storm expenses in 2015. I'll provide more detail on Page 13. DTE Gas was higher by $5 million. This was primarily driven by reinvestment spend in 2014 and increased revenue associated with the infrastructure and recovery mechanism surcharge. Gas, Storage & Pipeline's earnings were $7 million favorable to the prior year. This increase was primarily due to increased volumes on the Bluestone pipeline and increased investments in our gathering assets. Our Industrial Projects segment was lower by $6 million versus 2014, due primarily to timing of major coke battery maintenance project expenses and related installment sale contract that ended in the second quarter of 2015. Our corporate and other segment came in unfavorable by $10 million versus last year. This variance was mainly due to timing of federal and state tax accruals. These items were considered in our year-end guidance. Again, the overall growth segment results for the quarter were $253 million or $1.40 per share. Energy Trading posted a $1 million operating loss for the quarter and economic net income of $14 million. Both the power and gas business lines contributed to these results.
Please refer to Page 25 of the appendix to review the Energy Trading standard reconciliation page, which shows both economic and accounting performance. Overall, DTE Energy's operating earnings or $252 million or $1.40 per share for the quarter.
Now let's turn to Page 13 to discuss our electric performance. Electric segment earnings were $79 million higher quarter-over-quarter. The variance was driven by 3 major contributors: increased rates, returns in near normal weather and lower store O&M. DTE Electric self implemented a rate increase on July 1 as part of its ongoing rate case. This was partially offset by increased rate base growth due to investment in the generation and distribution operations. The next major contributor was weather. If you recall, summer weather in 2014 was much cooler than normal while this summer was near normal. This resulted in increased sales of approximately 700 gigawatts hours when compared to the same period last year. Please refer to Page 24 of the appendix for sales of earnings detail.
Finally, we experienced lower storm activity in the third quarter of 2015. This is a significant decrease when compared to 2014 where we saw multiple storms including the storm in September of 2014 that impacted more than 400,000 or 20% of our customers.
In conclusion for the quarter, DTE Electric's operating earnings were $79 million higher than 2014.
That concludes the update for our earnings for the quarter. I'd like to now turn the discussion over to Mark who will cover cash flow and balance sheet metrics."

In addition to the solid earnings results, our cash flow and balance sheet are strong and continue to support our long-term growth plans.

In addition to the solid earnings results, our cash flow and balance sheet are strong and continue to support our long-term growth plans. Slide 15 lays out our cash flow and CapEx through the third quarter. Cash from operations is $1.5 billion, and we saw a strong performance across all business units, putting us a little ahead of our plan for the year. We invested $1.7 billion of CapEx to the third quarter. And on the right side of the page, you can see the breakout by business unit. DTE Electric is up due to higher operational investments and higher new generation spend with the acquisition of the gas back in the first quarter, partially offset by the timing of some wind investments between years. And year-to-date, the nonutilities are on pace with last year.
To fund this CapEx program and to refinance maturing debt, we issued $1 billion of long-term debt this year.
Let me turn now to Slide 16 and the revised cash flow and CapEx guidance that touched on. As I mentioned a moment ago, we are seeing strong cash flow this year and, therefore, we're increasing our cash from operations guidance by $100 million. We're also making a small change to our CapEx guidance. And on the right side of the page, you can see the breakout of capital spending by business units. We still expect to spend a little over $1.8 billion at DTE Electric and $280 million at DTE Gas. And we expect our nonutilities businesses to invest $350 million for the year or about $100 million lower than the low point of the original guidance. This change captures the timing of some of the growth projects and will have no effect on the growth plans that we provided at our Investor Day last month. This brings our total CapEx to nearly $2.5 billion for the year, which is up more than 15% over last year. And back on the left side of the page, we reduced our debt financing need to correspond with this $200 million increase in free cash flow.
Now I'll move to Slide 17 to look at our balance sheet metrics. Our balance sheet remains strong, and we project ending the year within our targeted range for both leverage and FFO to debt. We issued $200 million of equity back in the first quarter, and that will fill our equity needs for this year. At our investor event last month, we disclosed equity needs of $800 million from 2016 through 2018. Earlier this year, we renewed our credit facility through 2020, and we ended the quarter with $1.8 billion of available liquidity.
As we outlined at our Investor Day, we have a financial planning approach, and we'll continue to rely on the strength of our balance sheet to fuel our long-term growth plans. And I will hand the discussion back over to Peter to wrap up."

With that, they slipped firmly into last place by the end of the season. I guess, all I can say is there's always next year, and our focus now is on the Red Wings making another playoff run. And I will not be mentioning the Lions and the Pistons on this call. 
DTE has continued to have a successful year in 2015. As you know, we raised our operating earnings guidance a few weeks ago at our Analyst Day. I feel very confident we'd be able to comfortably achieve our guidance. We had a very successful third quarter and we expect a solid quarter to finish the year. We also provided a 2016 early outlook during our Analyst Day, and I'm confident we can reach our 2016 EPS target as well.
Jeff and Mark will be going through third quarter results in more detail. But before we move on to that, I'd like to do a quick overview of our business strategy as well as some highlights on what's happening at DTE.
If we turn to Slide 5. Slide 5 provides an overview of the business strategy and investment thesis. Our growth plans in the next 10 years at both utilities are highly visible. Our Electric utility growth is driven by the renewal of our generation fleet and replacing and upgrading the electric distribution system. Our Gas utility growth is driven by infrastructure investments, the main line replacement -- pipe replacement and a system expansion to accommodate the increased volumes for the NEXUS Pipeline into the Vector pipeline.
Complementing our utility growth are meaningful growth opportunities in our nonutility businesses, which provide diversity in earnings and geography. Constructive regulatory environment, engaged employees, continuous improvement and top-level customer satisfaction continue to be priorities that drive DTE's success. A constructive regulatory environment is important as our 2 utilities are investing significant capital in the state of Michigan. And we know fostering this environment is a two-way street. I'll be updating you on some of the regulatory proceedings our utilities are currently working through. 
A highly engaged workforce continues to be a key to our success, and we have described our success throughout the year with the recognition we have received from the Gallup organization over the last 3 years. 
Our focus on continuous improvement is distinctive in the industry as the utilities continue to be leaders in maintaining costs. The combination of these two, employee engagement and continuous improvement, enables us to deliver both a sustainable cost, savings track record and to consistently earn authorized returns at both of our utilities. 
We're also very focused on customer satisfaction, demonstrated by our Gas utility currently ranked highest by J.D. Power among our peers for business customer satisfaction. Both DTE Electric and DTE Gas are ranked second in satisfaction of residential customers. 
Rounding out our business strategy is dividend growth and solid credit rating. Our dividend continues to grow us as we grow earnings, and our goal is to maintain a strong BBB credit rating. This strategy provides for consistent 5% to 6% annual EPS growth.
Slide 6 provides some highlights of progress in 2015. As I mentioned earlier at our Analyst Day, we raised our 2015 operating EPS guidance and provided 2016 operating EPS early outlook. I'll provide a more detailed overview of guidance in a few minutes. Today, we are revising our cash flow and capital guidance for 2015 and Mark will provide more details on this in a few minutes. 
Regarding Michigan's energy policy, there is positive momentum for construction of legislation by the end of the year. The governor and other energy leaders have called this a major priority. There's draft legislation that has been developed in both the House and the Senate and the more extensive hearings have now been concluded. There've been a dozen hearings in the House now on the proposed legislation and 8 in the Senate, so this legislation is moving along nicely. 
Also want to give a quick update on the various rate proceedings for our 2 utilities. Our Electric utility self-implemented rates in July 1 for ongoing general rate proceeding. We expect to receive a final order by the end of the year. We also implemented the new cost of service rates, which resulted in rate reductions for most of our business customers at the same time of self-implementation. 
For DTE Gas, we expect to receive an order this year for an expanded Infrastructure Recovery Mechanism that, if approved, will allow us to double the annual miles of our mainline replacement program. For the next gas general rate case, we're looking to file in late 2015 or early 2016. We're finalizing our plans. We feel this time frame is optimal time to file. As you know, we haven't filed a rate case at our Gas utility in nearly 4 years. 
We continue to make significant progress in our nonutility businesses. 
Let me hit on a couple of developments in our Gas Storage and Pipeline business. Millennium is currently working on a 200 Mcf/day expansion, which is expected to go in service in the fourth quarter of 2017. In addition, Millennium, too, is constructing an 8-mile Valley Lateral to supply 130 Mcf to a new natural gas plant in Pennsylvania. This is expected to be in service in April of 2017. 
We've increased our ownership in the NEXUS Pipeline project from 33% to 50%, which increases our planned investment to approximately $1 billion. We've executed a number of key milestones including the contracting for the major pipe materials earlier this month. Our next key milestone on the NEXUS project is the FERC filing, which will happen later this year. We have commitments we need to move forward with the construction of the pipe. We have recently signed a number of tap and interconnect agreements that could provide potential aggregate load across Northern Ohio for up to 1.4 Bcf a day. This demonstrates strong market support for the project and also strengthens the longer-term earnings potential for the pipe. And we continue to see increasing production forecast for the Appalachian region. 
So you can see we have a lot of positive things going on at both our utilities and nonutilities, giving us confidence to reach our earnings goals in 2015. 
I'd like to move on to provide more detail on Michigan's energy legislation, but before I do that, let me give you a quick update on Michigan's economy. The state economic indicators are looking very strong. We show some of the actual forecasted metrics in the appendix, but I'd like to highlight Michigan's unemployment rate for September, which was 5%. This is actually lower than the national rate of 5.1% and it's worth noting because it's the first time Michigan's unemployment rate is below the national average in 15 years. So things continue to move in the right direction in our state. 
So now let me move on to the state's energy policy reform on Slide 7. Slide 7 is a slide you've seen before showing Michigan's leaders who are helping to move the state's energy policy reform to its completion. We're definitely fortunate to have these individuals who really understand what good energy policy looks like. The Governor identified the need for energy policy reform as one of his top priorities and he has not wavered from that all year. He's taken time to study and understand our industry and land [ph] on what good policy moving forward would be. He has good advisers with John Quackenbush and Valerie Brader. And with Senator Nofs and Representative Nesbitt, we have 2 very competent energy leaders in the Senate and the House. 
So we have a situation where all 3 entities, the administration, the House and the Senate, are clear that Michigan does need to develop new policy to control its future. There's definitely progress happening. It gives us confidence of a timely resolution to the energy policy reform. Both the Senate and the House Energy Committee have concluded extensive hearings on the legislative package. Nofs and Nesbitt are working with committee members who would vote in a committee possibly by next month.
So now I'd like to turn to some specifics on legislation that's under development in the House and the Senate with Page 8, starting with the Retail Open Access. Leadership in both the House and the Senate realize that the current system is broken, so both are proposing reforms. Both proposals, as they stand now, would cap the current program at 10%, but with stricter and more fair provisions. Actually, the House, until recently, had planned to eliminate retail open access altogether, but as part of the alignment process, House is now proposing to stay at the 10% cap. But importantly, both the House and the Senate would require a onetime election to return the utility, which means there'll be no longer a free option to move back and forth between the marketplace and our regulated rates. To make the cost of capacity more fair and to ensure a reliable generation service in the state, the Senate is proposing a 3-year capacity commitment. The House is targeting a 5-year capacity commitment for those customers who stay -- would like to stay on retail open access. 
Integrated Resource Planning, or IRP, is the second key element of legislation. The proposals enable preapprovals. So once it's decided on what generation mix there should be, there'll be a process for preapproving investments and assuring that they are prudent, and similar to our current Certificate of Need process or CON process, but on a portfolio basis. This new IRP process will fit nicely into the state's implementation plan for the Clean Power Plan. 
Then finally, the legislation is going to deal with a number of regulatory reforms. Both the House and the Senate are proposing a move from a current 12-month cycle and rate approvals with a 6-month  implementation to a simple 10-month cycle. There's also work on establishing a fair net metering policy, which I think is important as we head towards building more renewables. Revenue decoupling is also being proposed for electric utilities. We would like to have this option to enable recovery of the impact of energy efficiency in between rate proceedings. 
So I think the state of Michigan is well positioned to have energy legislation by year-end. That's important so that as a state we can move on in a constructive way to make the investments that we need to transform Michigan's energy infrastructure. 
Let's go on to Slide 9. This slide shows our EPS history and our target of 5% to 6% growth. As I mentioned before, we expect to grow our dividend with earnings evidenced by a recent increase, which was at the high end of our earnings growth target. The chart shows a revised 2015 guidance midpoint of  $4.78 as well as the EPS guidance midpoint of $4.69 for our growth segments. The 5% to 6% future growth I mentioned is off our new 2016 early outlook midpoint of $4.93 per share. The $4.93 midpoint represents a 7% increase from the 2015 original guidance. 
So let me get into a little more detail on Page 10. So on Slide 10, it shows our current 2015 EPS guidance and our 2016 EPS early outlook. I want to focus on our 2015 guidance. Our current EPS guidance range is $4.65 to $4.91 for total DTE Energy and $4.59 to $4.79 for our growth segments. 
You can see next to the guidance numbers arrows indicating where we think the year might play off for each segment. We have green arrows up -- next to all of our nonutility businesses. If these businesses have a repeat of the strong performance in the fourth quarter, similar to what we've experienced in the first 3 quarters this year, then we are seeing earnings fall in the upper end of these ranges. For our Gas Storage and Pipeline, we are seeing strong performance on both pipeline and gathering earnings. Our Power and Industrial Projects segment is seeing stellar performance in our REF business, and we are seeing a strong economic performance at our Energy Trading operations. Our Corporate and Other segment is trading towards the lower end of guidance, driven by taxes. 
I mentioned the strong financial performance we have seen this year, so I'd like to turn the call over to Jeff Jewell to provide more details on the earnings results."

For the quart",552,"Thanks, Peter, and good morning, everyone. I'll be going over quarter-over-quarter results on Page 12. And on Page 13, I will provide more detail into DTE Electric's quarter-over-quarter operating earnings variance. 
Now turning to Page 12. For the quarter, DTE Energy's operating earnings were $252 million or $1.40 per share, and for reference, our reported earnings were $1.47 per share. You can find the reconciliation of the third quarter reported to operating earnings on Page 27. 
For the quarter, our growth segments' operating earnings in 2015 were $75 million or $0.40 per share higher than 2014. Electric segment was higher by $79 million. This favorability was due to warmer weather, self-implemented rates and lower storm expenses in 2015. I'll provide more detail on Page 13. 
DTE Gas was higher by $5 million. This was primarily driven by reinvestment spend in 2014 and increased revenue associated with the Infrastructure Recovery Mechanism surcharge. Gas Storage and Pipelines earnings were $7 million favorable to the prior year. This increase was primarily due to increased volumes on the Bluestone pipeline and increased investments in our gathering assets. Our Power and Industrial Projects segment was lower by $6 million versus 2014, due primarily to timing of major coke battery maintenance project expenses and a steel-related installment sale contract that ended in the second quarter of 2015. Our Corporate and Other segment came in unfavorable by $10 million versus last year. This variance was mainly due to timing of federal and state tax accruals. These items were considered in our year-end guidance. 
Again, the overall growth segment results for the quarter were $253 million or $1.40 per share. 
Energy Trading posted a $1 million operating loss for the quarter and economic net income of $14 million. Both the power and gas business lines contributed to these results. Please refer to Page 25 of the appendix to review the Energy Trading standard reconciliation page, which shows both economic and accounting performance. 
Overall, DTE Energy's operating earnings were  $252 million or $1.40 per share for the quarter.
Now let's turn to Page 13 to discuss our Electric performance. Electric segment earnings were $79 million higher quarter-over-quarter. The variance was driven by 3 major contributors: increased rates, return to near-normal weather and lower store O&M. DTE Electric self-implemented a rate increase on July 1 as part of its ongoing rate case. This was partially offset by increased rate base growth due to investment in the generation and distribution operations. 
The next major contributor was weather. If you recall, summer weather in 2014 was much cooler than normal while this summer was near normal. This resulted in increased sales of approximately 700 gigawatts hours when compared to the same period last year. Please refer to Page 24 of the appendix for sales of earnings detail.
Finally, we experienced lower storm activity in the third quarter of 2015. This is a significant decrease when compared to 2014 where we saw multiple storms including the storm in September of 2014 that impacted more than 400,000 or 20% of our customers.
In conclusion, for the quarter, DTE Electric's operating earnings were $79 million higher than 2014.
That concludes the update for our earnings for the quarter. I'd like to now turn the discussion over to Mark who will cover cash flow and balance sheet metrics."

In addition to the solid earnings results, our cash flow and balance sheet are strong and continue to support our long-term growth plans. Slide 15 lays out our cash flow and CapEx through the third quarter. Cash from operations is $1.5 billion and we saw a strong performance across all business units, putting us a little ahead of our plan for the year. 
We invested $1.7 billion of CapEx through the third quarter, and on the right side of the page, you can see the breakout by business unit. DTE Electric is up due to higher operational investments and higher new generation spend with the acquisition of the gas peaker back in the first quarter, partially offset by the timing of some wind investments between years. And year-to-date, the nonutilities are on pace with last year. To fund this CapEx program and to refinance maturing debt, we issued $1 billion in long-term debt this year.
Let me turn now to Slide 16 and the revised cash flow and CapEx guidance that Peter touched on. As I mentioned a moment ago, we are seeing strong cash flow this year and therefore we're increasing our cash from operations guidance by $100 million. We're also making a small change to our CapEx guidance. And on the right side of the page, you can see the breakout of capital spending by business unit. We still expect to spend a little over $1.8 billion at DTE Electric and $280 million at DTE Gas, and we expect our nonutility businesses to invest $350 million for the year or about $100 million lower than the low point of the original guidance. This change captures the timing of some of the growth projects of Power and Industrial and will have no effect on the growth plans that we provided at our Investor Day last month. This brings our total CapEx to nearly $2.5 billion for the year, which is up more than 15% over last year. And back on the left side of the page, we reduced our debt financing need to correspond with this $200 million increase in free cash flow.
Now I'll move to Slide 17 with a look at our balance sheet metrics. Our balance sheet remained strong, and we project ending the year within our targeted range for both leverage and FFO-to-debt. We issued $200 million of equity back in the first quarter and that fulfilled our equity needs for this year. At our investor event last month, we disclosed modest equity needs of $800 million from 2016 through 2018. 
Earlier this year, we renewed our credit facility through 2020, and we ended the quarter with $1.8 billion of available liquidity.
As we outlined at our Investor Day, we have a financial planning approach and we'll continue to rely on the strength of our balance sheet to fuel our long-term growth plans. 
And now I'll hand the discussion back over to Peter to wrap up."

With that, they slipped firmly into last place by the end of the season. I guess, all I can say is there's always next year, and our focus now is on the Red Wings making another playoff run. And I will not be mentioning the Lions and the Pistons on this call. 
DTE has continued to have a successful year in 2015. As you know, we raised our operating earnings guidance a few weeks ago at our Analyst Day. I feel very confident that we'd be able to comfortably achieve our guidance. We had a very successful third quarter and we expect a solid quarter to finish the year. We also provided a 2016 early outlook during our Analyst Day, and I'm confident we can reach our 2016 EPS targets as well.
Jeff and Mark will be going through third quarter results in more detail. But before we move on to that, I'd like to do a quick overview of our business strategy as well as some highlights on what's happening at DTE.
If we turn to Slide 5. Slide 5 provides an overview of the business strategy and investment thesis. Our growth plans in the next 10 years at both utilities are highly visible. Our Electric utility growth is driven by the renewal of our generation fleet and replacing and upgrading the electric distribution system. Our Gas utility growth is driven by infrastructure investments, the main line replacement -- pipe replacement and a system expansion to accommodate the increased volumes for the NEXUS Pipeline into the Vector pipeline.
Complementing our utility growth are meaningful growth opportunities in our nonutility businesses, which provide diversity in earnings and geography. Constructive regulatory environment, engaged employees, continuous improvement and top-level customer satisfaction continue to be priorities that drive DTE's success. A constructive regulatory environment is important as our 2 utilities are investing significant capital in the state of Michigan. And we know fostering this environment is a two-way street. I'll be updating you on some of the regulatory proceedings our utilities are currently working through. 
A highly engaged workforce continues to be a key to our success, and we have described our success throughout the year with the recognition we have received from the Gallup organization over the last 3 years. 
Our focus on continuous improvement is distinctive in the industry as the utilities continue to be leaders in maintaining costs. The combination of these two, employee engagement and continuous improvement, enables us to deliver both a sustainable cost, savings track record and to consistently earn authorized returns at both of our utilities. 
We're also very focused on customer satisfaction, demonstrated by our Gas utility currently ranked highest by J.D. Power among our peers for business customer satisfaction. Both DTE Electric and DTE Gas are ranked second in satisfaction of residential customers. 
Rounding out our business strategy is dividend growth and solid credit rating. Our dividend continues to grow us as we grow earnings, and our goal is to maintain a strong BBB credit rating. This strategy provides for consistent 5% to 6% annual EPS growth.
Slide 6 provides some highlights of progress in 2015. As I mentioned earlier at our Analyst Day, we raised our 2015 operating EPS guidance and provided 2016 operating EPS early outlook. I'll provide a more detailed overview of guidance in a few minutes. Today, we are revising our cash flow and capital guidance for 2015 and Mark will provide more details on this in a few minutes. 
Regarding Michigan's energy policy, there is positive momentum for construction of legislation by the end of the year. The governor and other energy leaders have called this a major priority. There's draft legislation that has been developed in both the House and the Senate and the more extensive hearings have now been concluded. There've been a dozen hearings in the House now on the proposed legislation and 8 in the Senate, so this legislation is moving along nicely. 
Also want to give a quick update on the various rate proceedings for our 2 utilities. Our Electric utility self-implemented rates in July 1 for ongoing general rate proceeding. We expect to receive a final order by the end of the year. We also implemented the new cost of service rates, which resulted in rate reductions for most of our business customers at the same time of self-implementation. 
For DTE Gas, we expect to receive an order this year for an expanded Infrastructure Recovery Mechanism that, if approved, will allow us to double the annual miles of our mainline replacement program. For the next gas general rate case, we're looking to file in late 2015 or early 2016. We're finalizing our plans. We feel this time frame is optimal time to file. As you know, we haven't filed a rate case at our Gas utility in nearly 4 years. 
We continue to make significant progress in our nonutility businesses. 
Let me hit on a couple of developments in our Gas Storage and Pipeline business. Millennium is currently working on a 200 Mcf/day expansion, which is expected to go in service in the fourth quarter of 2017. In addition, Millennium is constructing an 8-mile Valley Lateral to supply 130 Mcf to a new natural gas plant in Pennsylvania. This is expected to be in service in April of 2017. 
We've increased our ownership in the NEXUS Pipeline project from 33% to 50%, which increases our planned investment to approximately $1 billion. We've executed a number of key milestones including the contracting for the major pipe materials earlier this month. Our next key milestone on the NEXUS project is the FERC filing, which will happen later this year. We have commitments we need to move forward with the construction of the pipe. We have recently signed a number of tap and interconnect agreements that could provide potential aggregate load across Northern Ohio for up to 1.4 Bcf a day. This demonstrates strong market support for the project and also strengthens the longer-term earnings potential for the pipe. And we continue to see increasing production forecast for the Appalachian region. 
So you can see we have a lot of positive things going on at both our utilities and nonutilities, giving us confidence to reach our earnings goals in 2015. 
I'd like to move on to provide more detail on Michigan's energy legislation, but before I do that, let me give you a quick update on Michigan's economy. The state economic indicators are looking very strong. We show some of the actual forecasted metrics in the appendix, but I'd like to highlight Michigan's unemployment rate for September, which was 5%. This is actually lower than the national rate of 5.1% and it's worth noting because it's the first time Michigan's unemployment rate is below the national average in 15 years. So things continue to move in the right direction in our state. 
So now let me move on to the state's energy policy reform on Slide 7. Slide 7 is a slide you've seen before showing Michigan's leaders who are helping to move the state's energy policy reform to its completion. We're definitely fortunate to have these individuals who really understand what good energy policy looks like. The Governor identified the need for energy policy reform as one of his top priorities and he has not wavered from that all year. He's taken time to study and understand our industry and land on what good policy moving forward would be. He has good advisers with John Quackenbush and Valerie Brader. And with Senator Nofs and Representative Nesbitt, we have 2 very competent energy leaders in the Senate and the House. 
So we have a situation where all 3 entities, the administration, the House and the Senate, are clear that Michigan does need to develop new policy to control its future. There's definitely progress happening. It gives us confidence of a timely resolution to the energy policy reform. Both the Senate and the House Energy Committee have concluded extensive hearings on the legislative package. Nofs and Nesbitt are working with committee members with votes in a committee possibly by next month.
So now I'd like to turn to some specifics on legislation that's under development in the House and the Senate with Page 8, starting with the Retail Open Access. Leadership in both the House and the Senate realize that the current system is broken, so both are proposing reforms. Both proposals, as they stand now, would cap the current program at 10%, but with stricter and more fair provisions. Actually, the House, until recently, had planned to eliminate retail open access altogether, but as part of the alignment process, House is now proposing to stay at the 10% cap. But importantly, both the House and the Senate would require a onetime election to return to the utility, which means there'll be no longer a free option to move back and forth between the marketplace and our regulated rates. To make the cost of capacity more fair and to ensure a reliable generation service in the state, the Senate is proposing a 3-year capacity commitment. The House is targeting a 5-year capacity commitment for those customers who stay -- would like to stay on retail open access. 
Integrated Resource Planning, or IRP, is the second key element of legislation. The proposals enable preapprovals. So once it's decided on what generation mix there should be, there'll be a process for preapproving investments and assuring that they are prudent, and similar to our current Certificate of Need process or CON process, but on a portfolio basis. This new IRP process will fit nicely into the state's implementation plan for the Clean Power Plan. 
Then finally, the legislation is going to deal with a number of regulatory reforms. Both the House and the Senate are proposing a move from our current 12-month cycle and rate approvals with a 6-month  supplementation to a simple 10-month cycle. There's also work on establishing a fair net metering policy, which I think is important as we head towards building more renewables. Revenue decoupling is also being proposed for electric utilities. We would like to have this option to enable recovery of the impact of energy efficiency in between rate proceedings. 
So I think the state of Michigan is well positioned to have energy legislation by year-end. That's important so that as a state we can move on in a constructive way to make the investments that we need to transform Michigan's energy infrastructure. 
Let's go on to Slide 9. This slide shows our EPS history and our target of 5% to 6% growth. As I mentioned before, we expect to grow our dividend with earnings evidenced by a recent increase, which was at the high end of our earnings growth target. The chart shows a revised 2015 guidance midpoint of  $4.78 as well as the EPS guidance midpoint of $4.69 for our growth segments. The 5% to 6% future growth I mentioned is off our new 2016 early outlook midpoint of $4.93 per share. The $4.93 midpoint represents a 7% increase from the 2015 original guidance. 
So let me get into a little more detail on Page 10. So on Slide 10, it shows our current 2015 EPS guidance and our 2016 EPS early outlook. I want to focus on our 2015 guidance. Our current EPS guidance range is $4.65 to $4.91 for total DTE Energy and $4.59 to $4.79 for our growth segments. 
You can see next to the guidance numbers arrows indicating where we think the year might play out for each segment. We have green arrows up -- next to all of our nonutility businesses. If these businesses have a repeat of the strong performance in the fourth quarter, similar to what we've experienced in the first 3 quarters this year, then we are seeing earnings fall in the upper end of these ranges. For our Gas Storage and Pipeline, we are seeing strong performance on both pipeline and gathering earnings. Our Power and Industrial Projects segment is seeing stellar performance in our REF business, and we are seeing a strong economic performance at our Energy Trading operations. Our Corporate and Other segment is trading towards the lower end of guidance, driven by taxes. 
I mentioned the strong financial performance we have seen this year, so I'd like to turn the call over to Jeff Jewell to provide more details on the earnings results."

For the quart",552,"Thanks, Peter, and good morning, everyone. I'll be going over quarter-over-quarter results on Page 12. And on Page 13, I will provide more detail into DTE Electric's quarter-over-quarter operating earnings variance. 
Now turning to Page 12. For the quarter, DTE Energy's operating earnings were $252 million or $1.40 per share, and for reference, our reported earnings were $1.47 per share. You can find the reconciliation of the third quarter reported to operating earnings on Page 27. 
For the quarter, our growth segments' operating earnings in 2015 were $75 million or $0.40 per share higher than 2014. Electric segment was higher by $79 million. This favorability was due to warmer weather, self-implemented rates and lower storm expenses in 2015. I'll provide more detail on Page 13. 
DTE Gas was higher by $5 million. This was primarily driven by reinvestment spend in 2014 and increased revenue associated with the Infrastructure Recovery Mechanism surcharge. Gas Storage and Pipelines earnings were $7 million favorable to the prior year. This increase was primarily due to increased volumes on the Bluestone pipeline and increased investments in our gathering assets. Our Power and Industrial Projects segment was lower by $6 million versus 2014, due primarily to timing of major coke battery maintenance project expenses and a steel-related installment sale contract that ended in the second quarter of 2015. Our Corporate and Other segment came in unfavorable by $10 million versus last year. This variance was mainly due to timing of federal and state tax accruals. These items were considered in our year-end guidance. 
Again, the overall growth segment results for the quarter were $253 million or $1.40 per share. 
Energy Trading posted a $1 million operating loss for the quarter and economic net income of $14 million. Both the power and gas business lines contributed to these results. Please refer to Page 25 of the appendix to review the Energy Trading standard reconciliation page, which shows both economic and accounting performance. 
Overall, DTE Energy's operating earnings were  $252 million or $1.40 per share for the quarter.
Now let's turn to Page 13 to discuss our Electric performance. Electric segment earnings were $79 million higher quarter-over-quarter. The variance was driven by 3 major contributors: increased rates, return to near-normal weather and lower storm O&M. DTE Electric self-implemented a rate increase on July 1 as part of its ongoing rate case. This was partially offset by increased rate base growth due to investment in the generation and distribution operations. 
The next major contributor was weather. If you recall, summer weather in 2014 was much cooler than normal while this summer was near normal. This resulted in increased sales of approximately 700 gigawatt hours when compared to the same period last year. Please refer to Page 24 of the appendix for sales of earnings detail.
Finally, we experienced lower storm activity in the third quarter of 2015. This is a significant decrease when compared to 2014 where we saw multiple storms including the storm in September of 2014 that impacted more than 400,000 or 20% of our customers.
In conclusion, for the quarter, DTE Electric's operating earnings were $79 million higher than 2014.
That concludes the update for our earnings for the quarter. I'd like to now turn the discussion over to Mark who will cover cash flow and balance sheet metrics."

In addition to the solid earnings results, our cash flow and balance sheet are strong and continue to support our long-term growth plans.

In addition to the solid earnings results, our cash flow and balance sheet are strong and continue to support our long-term growth plans. Slide 15 lays out our cash flow and CapEx through the third quarter. Cash from operations is $1.5 billion and we saw a strong performance across all business units, putting us a little ahead of our plan for the year. 
We invested $1.7 billion of CapEx through the third quarter, and on the right side of the page, you can see the breakout by business unit. DTE Electric is up due to higher operational investments and higher new generation spend with the acquisition of the gas peaker back in the first quarter, partially offset by the timing of some wind investments between years. And year-to-date, the nonutilities are on pace with last year. To fund this CapEx program and to refinance maturing debt, we issued $1 billion in long-term debt this year.
Let me turn now to Slide 16 and the revised cash flow and CapEx guidance that Peter touched on. As I mentioned a moment ago, we are seeing strong cash flow this year and therefore we're increasing our cash from operations guidance by $100 million. We're also making a small change to our CapEx guidance. And on the right side of the page, you can see the breakout of capital spending by business unit. We still expect to spend a little over $1.8 billion at DTE Electric and $280 million at DTE Gas, and we expect our nonutility businesses to invest $350 million for the year or about $100 million lower than the low point of the original guidance. This change captures the timing of some of the growth projects of Power and Industrial and will have no effect on the growth plans that we provided at our Investor Day last month. This brings our total CapEx to nearly $2.5 billion for the year, which is up more than 15% over last year. And back on the left side of the page, we reduced our debt financing need to correspond with this $200 million dollar increase in free cash flow.
Now I'll move to Slide 17 with a look at our balance sheet metrics. Our balance sheet remained strong, and we project ending the year within our targeted range for both leverage and FFO-to-debt. We issued $200 million of equity back in the first quarter and that fulfilled our equity needs for this year. At our investor event last month, we disclosed modest equity needs of $800 million from 2016 through 2018. 
Earlier this year, we renewed our credit facility through 2020, and we ended the quarter with $1.8 billion of available liquidity.
As we outlined at our Investor Day, we have a financial planning approach that will continue to rely on the strength of our balance sheet to fuel our long-term growth plans. 
And now I'll hand the discussion back over to Peter to wrap up."

With that, they slipped firmly into last place by the end of the season. I guess, all I can say is there's always next year, and our focus now is on the Red Wings making another playoff run. And I will not be mentioning the Lions and the Pistons on this call. 
DTE has continued to have a successful year in 2015. As you know, we raised our operating earnings guidance a few weeks ago at our Analyst Day. I feel very confident that we'd be able to comfortably achieve our guidance. We had a very successful third quarter and we expect a solid quarter to finish the year. We also provided a 2016 early outlook during our Analyst Day, and I'm confident we can reach our 2016 EPS targets as well.
Jeff and Mark will be going through third quarter results in more detail. But before we move on to that, I'd like to do a quick overview of our business strategy as well as some highlights on what's happening at DTE.
If we turn to Slide 5. Slide 5 provides an overview of the business strategy and investment thesis. Our growth plans in the next 10 years at both utilities are highly visible. Our Electric utility growth is driven by the renewal of our generation fleet and replacing and upgrading the electric distribution system. Our Gas utility growth is driven by infrastructure investments, the main line replacement -- pipe replacement and a system expansion to accommodate the increased volumes for the NEXUS Pipeline into the Vector pipeline.
Complementing our utility growth are meaningful growth opportunities in our nonutility businesses, which provide diversity in earnings and geography. Constructive regulatory environment, engaged employees, continuous improvement and top-level customer satisfaction continue to be priorities that drive DTE's success. A constructive regulatory environment is important as our 2 utilities are investing significant capital in the state of Michigan. And we know fostering this environment is a two-way street. I'll be updating you on some of the regulatory proceedings our utilities are currently working through. 
A highly engaged workforce continues to be a key to our success, and we have described our success throughout the year with the recognition we have received from the Gallup organization over the last 3 years. 
Our focus on continuous improvement is distinctive in the industry as the utilities continue to be leaders in maintaining costs. The combination of these two, employee engagement and continuous improvement, enables us to deliver both a sustainable cost, savings track record and to consistently earn authorized returns at both of our utilities. 
We're also very focused on customer satisfaction, demonstrated by our Gas utility currently ranked highest by J.D. Power among our peers for business customer satisfaction. Both DTE Electric and DTE Gas are ranked second in satisfaction of residential customers. 
Rounding out our business strategy is dividend growth and solid credit rating. Our dividend continues to grow us as we grow earnings, and our goal is to maintain a strong BBB credit rating. This strategy provides for consistent 5% to 6% annual EPS growth.
Slide 6 provides some highlights of progress in 2015. As I mentioned earlier at our Analyst Day, we raised our 2015 operating EPS guidance and provided 2016 operating EPS early outlook. I'll provide a more detailed overview of guidance in a few minutes. Today, we are revising our cash flow and capital guidance for 2015 and Mark will provide more details on this in a few minutes. 
Regarding Michigan's energy policy, there is positive momentum for construction of legislation by the end of the year. The governor and other energy leaders have called this a major priority. There's draft legislation that has been developed in both the House and the Senate and the more extensive hearings have now been concluded. There've been a dozen hearings in the House now on the proposed legislation and 8 in the Senate, so this legislation is moving along nicely. 
Also want to give a quick update on the various rate proceedings for our 2 utilities. Our Electric utility self-implemented rates in July 1 for ongoing general rate proceeding. We expect to receive a final order by the end of the year. We also implemented the new cost of service rates, which resulted in rate reductions for most of our business customers at the same time of self-implementation. 
For DTE Gas, we expect to receive an order this year for an expanded Infrastructure Recovery Mechanism that, if approved, will allow us to double the annual miles of our mainline replacement program. For the next gas general rate case, we're looking to file in late 2015 or early 2016. We're finalizing our plans. We feel this time frame is optimal time to file. As you know, we haven't filed a rate case at our Gas utility in nearly 4 years. 
We continue to make significant progress in our nonutility businesses. 
Let me hit on a couple of developments in our Gas Storage and Pipeline business. Millennium is currently working on a 200 Mcf/day expansion, which is expected to go in service in the fourth quarter of 2017. In addition, Millennium is constructing an 8-mile Valley Lateral to supply 130 Mcf to a new natural gas plant in Pennsylvania. This is expected to be in service in April of 2017. 
We've increased our ownership in the NEXUS Pipeline project from 33% to 50%, which increases our planned investment to approximately $1 billion. We've executed a number of key milestones including the contracting for the major pipe materials earlier this month. Our next key milestone on the NEXUS project is the FERC filing, which will happen later this year. We have commitments we need to move forward with the construction of the pipe. We have recently signed a number of tap and interconnect agreements that could provide potential aggregate load across Northern Ohio for up to 1.4 Bcf a day. This demonstrates strong market support for the project and also strengthens the longer-term earnings potential for the pipe. And we continue to see increasing production forecast for the Appalachian region. 
So you can see we have a lot of positive things going on at both our utilities and nonutilities, giving us confidence to reach our earnings goals in 2015. 
I'd like to move on to provide more detail on Michigan's energy legislation, but before I do that, let me give you a quick update on Michigan's economy. The state economic indicators are looking very strong. We show some of the actual forecasted metrics in the appendix, but I'd like to highlight Michigan's unemployment rate for September, which was 5%. This is actually lower than the national rate of 5.1% and it's worth noting because it's the first time Michigan's unemployment rate is below the national average in 15 years. So things continue to move in the right direction in our state. 
So now let me move on to the state's energy policy reform on Slide 7. Slide 7 is a slide you've seen before showing Michigan's leaders who are helping to move the state's energy policy reform to its completion. We're definitely fortunate to have these individuals who really understand what good energy policy looks like. The Governor identified the need for energy policy reform as one of his top priorities and he has not wavered from that all year. He's taken time to study and understand our industry and land on what good policy moving forward would be. He has good advisers with John Quackenbush and Valerie Brader. And with Senator Nofs and Representative Nesbitt, we have 2 very competent energy leaders in the Senate and the House. 
So we have a situation where all 3 entities, the administration, the House and the Senate, are clear that Michigan does need to develop new policy to control its future. There's definitely progress happening. It gives us confidence of a timely resolution to the energy policy reform. Both the Senate and the House Energy Committee have concluded extensive hearings on the legislative package. Nofs and Nesbitt are working with committee members with votes in a committee possibly by next month.
So now I'd like to turn to some specifics on legislation that's under development in the House and the Senate with Page 8, starting with the Retail Open Access. Leadership in both the House and the Senate realize that the current system is broken, so both are proposing reforms. Both proposals, as they stand now, would cap the current program at 10%, but with stricter and more fair provisions. Actually, the House, until recently, had planned to eliminate retail open access altogether, but as part of the alignment process, House is now proposing to stay at the 10% cap. But importantly, both the House and the Senate would require a onetime election to return to the utility, which means there'll be no longer a free option to move back and forth between the marketplace and our regulated rates. To make the cost of capacity more fair and to ensure a reliable generation service in the state, the Senate is proposing a 3-year capacity commitment. The House is targeting a 5-year capacity commitment for those customers who stay -- would like to stay on retail open access. 
Integrated Resource Planning, or IRP, is the second key element of legislation. The proposals enable preapprovals. So once it's decided on what generation mix there should be, there'll be a process for preapproving investments and assuring that they are prudent, and similar to our current Certificate of Need process or CON process, but on a portfolio basis. This new IRP process will fit nicely into the state's implementation plan for the Clean Power Plan. 
Then finally, the legislation is going to deal with a number of regulatory reforms. Both the House and the Senate are proposing a move from our current 12-month cycle and rate approvals with a 6-month supplementation to a simple 10-month cycle. There's also work on establishing a fair net metering policy, which I think is important as we head towards building more renewables. Revenue decoupling is also being proposed for electric utilities. We would like to have this option to enable recovery of the impact of energy efficiency in between rate proceedings. 
So I think the state of Michigan is well positioned to have energy legislation by year-end. That's important so that as a state we can move on in a constructive way to make the investments that we need to transform Michigan's energy infrastructure. 
Let's go on to Slide 9. This slide shows our EPS history and our target of 5% to 6% growth. As I mentioned before, we expect to grow our dividend with earnings evidenced by a recent increase, which was at the high end of our earnings growth target. The chart shows a revised 2015 guidance midpoint of $4.78 as well as the EPS guidance midpoint of $4.69 for our growth segments. The 5% to 6% future growth I mentioned is off our new 2016 early outlook midpoint of $4.93 per share. The $4.93 midpoint represents a 7% increase from the 2015 original guidance. 
So let me get into a little more detail on Page 10. So on Slide 10, it shows our current 2015 EPS guidance and our 2016 EPS early outlook. I want to focus on our 2015 guidance. Our current EPS guidance range is $4.65 to $4.91 for total DTE Energy and $4.59 to $4.79 for our growth segments. 
You can see next to the guidance numbers arrows indicating where we think the year might play out for each segment. We have green arrows up -- next to all of our nonutility businesses. If these businesses have a repeat of the strong performance in the fourth quarter, similar to what we've experienced in the first 3 quarters this year, then we are seeing earnings fall in the upper end of these ranges. For our Gas Storage and Pipeline, we are seeing strong performance on both pipeline and gathering earnings. Our Power and Industrial Projects segment is seeing stellar performance in our REF business, and we are seeing a strong economic performance at our Energy Trading operations. Our Corporate and Other segment is trading towards the lower end of guidance, driven by taxes. 
I mentioned the strong financial performance we have seen this year, so I'd like to turn the call over to Jeff Jewell to provide more details on the earnings results."

And on Page 13, I will provide more detail into DTE Electric's quarter-over-quarter operating earnings variance. 
Now turning to Page 12. For the quarter, DTE Energy's operating earnings were $252 million or $1.40 per share, and for reference, our reported earnings were $1.47 per share. You can find the reconciliation of the third quarter reported to operating earnings on Page 27. 
For the quarter, our growth segments' operating earnings in 2015 were $75 million or $0.40 per share higher than 2014. Electric segment was higher by $79 million. This favorability was due to warmer weather, self-implemented rates and lower storm expenses in 2015. I'll provide more detail on Page 13. 
DTE Gas was higher by $5 million. This was primarily driven by reinvestment spend in 2014 and increased revenue associated with the Infrastructure Recovery Mechanism surcharge. Gas Storage and Pipelines earnings were $7 million favorable to the prior year. This increase was primarily due to increased volumes on the Bluestone pipeline and increased investments in our gathering assets. Our Power and Industrial Projects segment was lower by $6 million versus 2014, due primarily to timing of major coke battery maintenance project expenses and a steel-related installment sale contract that ended in the second quarter of 2015. Our Corporate and Other segment came in unfavorable by $10 million versus last year. This variance was mainly due to timing of federal and state tax accruals. These items were considered in our year-end guidance. 
Again, the overall growth segment results for the quarter were $253 million or $1.40 per share. 
Energy Trading posted a $1 million operating loss for the quarter and economic net income of $14 million. Both the power and gas business lines contributed to these results. Please refer to Page 25 of the appendix to review the Energy Trading standard reconciliation page, which shows both economic and accounting performance. 
Overall, DTE Energy's operating earnings were $252 million or $1.40 per share for the quarter.
Now let's turn to Page 13 to discuss our Electric performance. Electric segment earnings were $79 million higher quarter-over-quarter. The variance was driven by 3 major contributors: increased rates, return to near-normal weather and lower storm O&M. DTE Electric self-implemented a rate increase on July 1 as part of its ongoing rate case. This was partially offset by increased rate base growth due to investment in the generation and distribution operations. 
The next major contributor was weather. If you recall, summer weather in 2014 was much cooler than normal while this summer was near normal. This resulted in increased sales of approximately 700 gigawatt hours when compared to the same period last year. Please refer to Page 24 of the appendix for sales of earnings detail.
Finally, we experienced lower storm activity in the third quarter of 2015. This is a significant decrease when compared to 2014 where we saw multiple storms including the storm in September of 2014 that impacted more than 400,000 or 20% of our customers.
In conclusion, for the quarter, DTE Electric's operating earnings were $79 million higher than 2014.
That concludes the update for our earnings for the quarter. I'd like to now turn the discussion over to Mark who will cover cash flow and balance sheet metrics."
266598,313168330,881412,"DTE Energy Company, Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 23, 2015",2015-10-23,"Earnings Calls","DTE Energy Company","Executives","Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. In addition to the solid earnings results, our cash flow and balance sheet are strong and continue to support our long-term growth plans.

In addition to the solid earnings results, our cash flow and balance sheet are strong and continue to support our long-term growth plans. Slide 15 lays out our cash flow and CapEx through the third quarter. Cash from operations is $1.5 billion and we saw a strong performance across all business units, putting us a little ahead of our plan for the year. 
We invested $1.7 billion of CapEx through the third quarter, and on the right side of the page, you can see the breakout by business unit. DTE Electric is up due to higher operational investments and higher new generation spend with the acquisition of the gas peaker back in the first quarter, partially offset by the timing of some wind investments between years. And year-to-date, the nonutilities are on pace with last year. To fund this CapEx program and to refinance maturing debt, we issued $1 billion in long-term debt this year.
Let me turn now to Slide 16 and the revised cash flow and CapEx guidance that Peter touched on. As I mentioned a moment ago, we are seeing strong cash flow this year and therefore we're increasing our cash from operations guidance by $100 million. We're also making a small change to our CapEx guidance. And on the right side of the page, you can see the breakout of capital spending by business unit. We still expect to spend a little over $1.8 billion at DTE Electric and $280 million at DTE Gas, and we expect our nonutility businesses to invest $350 million for the year or about $100 million lower than the low point of the original guidance. This change captures the timing of some of the growth projects of Power and Industrial and will have no effect on the growth plans that we provided at our Investor Day last month. This brings our total CapEx to nearly $2.5 billion for the year, which is up more than 15% over last year. And back on the left side of the page, we reduced our debt financing need to correspond with this $200 million increase in free cash flow.
Now I'll move to Slide 17 with a look at our balance sheet metrics. Our balance sheet remained strong, and we project ending the year within our targeted range for both leverage and FFO-to-debt. We issued $200 million of equity back in the first quarter and that fulfilled our equity needs for this year. At our investor event last month, we disclosed modest equity needs of $800 million from 2016 through 2018. 
Earlier this year, we renewed our credit facility through 2020, and we ended the quarter with $1.8 billion of available liquidity.
As we outlined at our Investor Day, we have a financial planning approach that will continue to rely on the strength of our balance sheet to fuel our long-term growth plans. 
And now I'll hand the discussion back over to Peter to wrap up."

Let me finish the presentation with a quick summary on Slide 19 and then we can open the line for questions. We had 3 solid quarters so far this year and we're confident that this year's performance will allow us to achieve our 2015 EPS guidance. We also anticipate constructive outcomes this year in both our utility regulatory filings as well as Michigan's energy policy reform. Our balance sheet and cash flow metrics remain strong and our investments in our utility and nonutility businesses support our target 5% to 6% EPS growth going forward. 
I'd like to thank you all for joining our call this morning, and I hope to see you -- many of you at the EEI Conference in a couple of weeks. Gerry Anderson will be giving a formal presentation on November 10 that will be webcasted on our Investor Relations website, so we can -- hope you all can join us.
