We're reporting solid results for the first quarter of 2015 with healthy revenue, orders and earnings growth.

We're reporting solid results for the first quarter of 2015 with healthy revenue, orders and earnings growth. In summary, we are reporting net earnings of $0.92 per diluted share including a $0.07 restructuring charge. Revenues of $738 million, up 4% or up 6% on a constant-currency basis. Record Oncology service revenues of $254 million, an 81 basis point improvement in the company's gross margin to 44.3% of sales; strong orders in our major businesses and a 13% increase in our quarter-ending backlog to $3.1 billion. Oncology Systems orders totaled $562 million for the quarter, up 5% or up 8% on a constant currency basis. On a trailing 12-month basis, worldwide reported Oncology orders grew by 5%. Consistent with the recent geographic reorganization of the Oncology Systems business, we consolidated the Rest of World region into 3 geographic regions: the Americas, APAC and EMEA. For comparison purposes, the earnings release contains a table providing quarterly results for these regions for 2013 and 2014. 
In the first quarter of 2015, Oncology orders rose 17% and APAC and 12% in EMEA while declining by 2% in the Americas. In North America, orders fell by 3% versus strong 13% growth in the year-ago quarter. Robust APAC quarter performance is driven mainly by China where orders grew by 42% with a help of the tender wind with The market in China appears to be returning to more typical investment levels following a period of delays and uncertainty. During the quarter, the FDA granted approval for Varian to supply our EDGE radiosurgery system to customers in China. This opens the door to for Varian leading technology to address the growing lung cancer burden there. 
Looking at a whole at the BRICA countries of Brazil, Russia, India, China and Africa, we achieved first quarter order growth of 30%. BRICA again accounted for more than 15% of total Oncology orders in the quarter. A strong performance in Africa where we booked more than $20 million in orders from projects in Algeria, Egypt and South Africa helped our EMEA geographic region achieve orders growth of 12% or 18% in a constant currency basis. Elsewhere in young, we saw strong orders performance in France, Turkey and Hungary. 
Turning to Latin America, ongoing demand from the the private market in Brazil as well as purchases in Colombia helped drive order growth in the region. As I mentioned at the outset, orders in North America declined slightly versus very strong first quarter performance last year. The consolidation in this market we've seen greater quarter-to-quarter variability. On a longer-term, trailing 12-month basis, North America Oncology orders grew 4%. At this point, the sales funnel looks good. 
Orders in our Oncology service business were robust raising -- rising by 14% to $254 million, representing some 45% of the total Oncology Systems business during the quarter. This puts us on course to receive our goal of reaching $1 billion of service revenue this year. We also made great progress in our software business during the quarter with double-digit growth in treatment planning and Oncology information systems. We had a big clinical milestone during the quarter when RapidPlan was used for the first time to plan an advanced IMRT treatment for a 76-year-old prostate cancer patient in the U.K. RapidPlan makes it easier and faster for clinicians to generate higher-quality treatment plans. We've taken orders for more than 100 RapidPlan installations to date. During the quarter, we were pleased to see a promising new lung study showing improved survival rate using stereotactic body radiation therapy or SBRT in combination with the chemotherapy agent called The study by senior author Dr. Robert Timmerman of UT Southwestern in Texas, which is partially funded by Varian, showed overall survival times extending from historic 6 to 9 months to 20 months. The results of this Phase II clinical trial involving 24 patients with Stage 4 non-small cell lung cancer were published the Journal of Clinical Oncology of the American Society of Clinical Oncology. 
Turning to our Imaging Components segment. Orders rose by a robust 34% to $163 million versus a very weak year-ago period when orders declined. We saw a specially strong growth in our panel business where orders rose by 65%. Among the highlights in our panel business was a big multimillion dollar win with a customer in Korea. We also started commercial shipment of our new customized veterinarian imaging package that includes both panels and workstations. As you can see in our 2014 annual report, these wireless panels are being used in a sound excellent portable system to image thoroughbred horses. At quarter end, we announced our intention to make an approximate EUR 32 million public tender offer to acquire all the shares of Mavis Medical Solutions in Germany. The tender was formally launched yesterday. Nevis develops and supply image analysis software used to screen for breast, lung, liver, prostate and colon cancer. We hope to complete this tender process early in our third quarter. This will be an important step in our strategy to extend the Imaging Components to software portfolio. 
The company's other category is comprised of the Varian Particle Therapy business and technology center recorded quarters of $1 million. The sales funnel continue to look good, and we submitted 5 new Proton centers during the quarter. We made progress in our active Proton projects generating $9 million of revenue. Our customer's financing of the Maryland Proton project was not sufficiently completed to enable us to book it during the quarter. Before I hand it over to Elisha, I'm pleased to report that at the World Economic Forum in Davos last week, Varian was included in the global 100 ranking of the world's most sustainable companies. Varian is a top-ranked health care equipment company and included on the list. We are proud to be recognized for our commitment to sustainability. Now I'll turn it over to Elisha"

While Dow has already covered gross orders, I want to talk further about a constant currency growth rates for the quarter. In comparing quarter-over-quarter exchange rates, both the euro and the yen weakened significantly against the dollar, which reduced our total company order growth rate by about 2 points. Total Oncology orders for the quarter increased 5% in dollars and 8% in constant currency. Oncology's EMEA orders increased 12% in dollars and 18% in constant currency. Oncology APAC orders increased 17% in dollars and 23% in constant currency primarily due to the yen. There was no currency impact in the Americas. The company ended the quarter with a $3.1 billion backlog, up 13%. Backlog adjustments during the quarter totaled $34 million, bringing net orders for the company to $692 million. First quarter revenues for the total company increased 4% in dollars and 6% in constant currency. Oncology posted a 4% gain in revenues during the quarter with significant shift towards North America and services. North America constituted 52% of total Oncology revenues versus 42% in the year-ago quarter. Service revenues grew by 14% over the year-ago quarter. Imaging Components posted first quarter revenue growth of 3% with growth in panels and Security and Inspection Products, partially offset by declines into [ph] The total company gross margin for the quarter was 44.3%, up 81 basis points. Oncology Systems gross margins improved by 68 basis points to 45.6% due to favorable geographic and product mix. While we are pleased with the margin performance in the quarter, we continue to believe that Oncology consisting long-term gross margins in the 43% to 44% range. Imaging Components gross margin for the quarter rose 85 basis points to 42.2% due to a higher mix of panels as well as improved quality cost. First quarter SG&A expenses were $140 million including an $11 million restructuring charge to reduce headcount. This charge increased SG&A as a percentage of revenues by 140 basis points in the quarter. SG&A was also impacted by a $5 million increase in our bad debt reserve in the quarter to reflect uncertainty in our ability to exchange our Venezuelan Bolivar collections into dollars. 
First quarter R&D expenses were $57 million or 8% of revenues, equal to the year-ago quarter as a percentage of revenue. 
Moving down the income statement. First quarter operating earnings totaled $130 million, down from the year-ago quarter, due in large part to the restructuring charge. Depreciation and amortization totaled $17 million for the quarter. The effective tax rate was 28.5%, down almost 3 points from the year-ago quarter, due largely to the R&D tax credit extension granted in late December. We continue to expect that the tax rate will be 28% to 30% for the fiscal year. Fully diluted shares outstanding decreased almost $6 million from the year-ago quarter to $101.6 million due to our ongoing share repurchase program. Diluted EPS was $0.92 for the quarter, including the $0.07 restructuring charge. 
Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $904 million, debt of $525 million and stockholders equity of $1.6 billion. DSO at 85 improved by 9 days from the year-ago quarter. First quarter cash flow from operations increased significantly from the year-ago quarter to $79 million or 85% of net income. Primary uses of cash were $22 million for CapEx and $126 million towards the repurchase of 1.5 million shares of stock. At the end of the quarter, we had 4.75 million shares remaining under the existing repurchase authorization that extends through calendar year 2015. Now I'll turn it back over to Dow for the outlook"

The company got off to a good start in the first quarter of fiscal 2015 with revenues and earnings coming in ahead of expectations. Our outlook for the full fiscal year is heavily impacted by the recent dramatic swing in currency exchange rates, which we believe will significantly reduce revenues and earnings in the balance of the year. We now believe that total company revenues for fiscal year 2015 could increase by about 5%. Given our earnings momentum in the first quarter, we believe that we can maintain our prior guidance of $4.16 to $4.20 for diluted share for the fiscal year despite significant currency headwind. Given current exchange rates and the expected timing of shipments in the year, we believe total company revenues for the second quarter should increase by about 2% versus the year-ago period. Net earnings per diluted share for the second quarter could be in the range of $0.98 to $1.02. Our guidance includes guidance of Proton projects that are not yet financed or booked into the backlog. If these projects are booked during the year, the potential upside in revenues and profits could be significant. We're now ready for your questions."

So let me give you the walk from the prior guidance to the new guidance, and let me preface by saying to simplify it I'll just start at the midpoint and the year-ago guidance and take it to the midpoint in the quarter ago guidance and take it to the midpoint today. Just at the 50,000-foot level, we really had a double whammy of recently when the yen and the euro when we have significant revenue in both of those currencies weakened by 8% to 10%. Added to that, the Swiss franc strengthened by about 20%, and we don't have much revenue in Franks but we have a significant amount of expenses in Swiss francs. So when that altogether, we started the 4 21 which is the midpoint of the prior guidance and you assume we beat the midpoint by $0.14 in Q1, and then we have a negative $0.20 impact to EPS for the balance of that year due to FX, and I'll come back and talk a little bit more about that. That gives you the $4.15, and then we believe as we look out at the momentum that we have in the quarter and the gross margin in and the geographic mix in the product mix along with some cost control initiatives that we will be able to get an additional $0.06 or so for the balance of that year, and that gives you back to the $4.21. So let me spend just a minute on how we get to the $0.20 impact from FX. The revenue for Q2 through Q4, we are estimating just based on what we are expecting shipments to be and where current exchange rates are, to be down about $50 million. And we are roughly 50% naturally hedged, so we have a $25 million net impact from that loss of revenue. And then on top of that, our service costs we're expecting are to go up between $5 million to $7 million based on the stronger Franc. And when you tax effect that, it gets you at the midpoint of $0.20 for the balance of the year."

About -- let's see, the tax is going up about 3 points versus a year ago quarter. This is just the timing of the geographic mix of profit for the year.

We believe to continue to see double-digit growth in these emerging markets kind of quickly doing this we, China as we talked about last year, there were kind of producing aberrations. There was not a lot of volume coming from government. They retooled their purchasing processes. We're seeing those straightened out, which I think the good news is that we hear a little bit pent-up demand there. So I think we'll see that come. The Africa's continues to be kind of a surprise for us, let's say 3 or 4 years ago, it was a really low number and we had a terrific year last year, and we started out this year very good in Africa as well. Maybe one of the things just going back to China -- one of the things we're seen besides the kind of government strength is we're seeing the emergence of a private market in China, and I think that's something that other -- and diagnostic imaging, it's been around for a long time but historically, gives you a little bit of that, but not a lot of that. I think we started to see a little bit more of the private market emerge in China. In Latin America, first quarter was okay. We've done better in terms of growth, but we still had a good growth in the first quarter. Grew 5% in the first quarter in Latin America, that I think we'll keep growing there. We -- clearly, there's a lot of volatility and uncertainty with exchange rates and what's going on and how does that going to impact Latin America, but we haven't seen that yet in those markets. The one market that's quiet is Russia. We have not seen much there at all. India, I'd say will be -- in the year, it looks really good."

So Oncology, I mean, obviously, we were very, very pleased with the 45.6% gross margin in the quarter, which is well ahead of our long-term margin expectation for Oncology. That was driven by product mix shift and services software clearly driving that as well as a 10-point shift in revenue to North America. So we had kind of a perfect storm for a change where both the product and geographic mix moved largely in our favor. For the year, what that means is based on that Q1 performance, I think Oncology will come closer to a 44% margin rate, which means for the balance of the year, we continue to think they'll be in that 43% to 44% range."

We're reporting solid results for the first quarter of 2015 with healthy revenue, orders and earnings growth. In summary, we are reporting net earnings of $0.92 per diluted share including a $0.07 restructuring charge. Revenue",980,"Good afternoon, and welcome. We're reporting solid results for the first quarter of 2015 with healthy revenue, orders and earnings growth. In summary, we are reporting net earnings of $0.92 per diluted share including a $0.07 restructuring charge. Revenues of $738 million, up 4%, or up 6% on a constant-currency basis. Record Oncology service revenues of $254 million, an 81 basis point improvement in the company's gross margin to 44.3% of sales; strong orders in our major businesses; and a 13% increase in our quarter-ending backlog to $3.1 billion. Oncology Systems orders totaled $562 million for the quarter, up 5%, or up 8% on a constant-currency basis. On a trailing 12-month basis, worldwide reported Oncology orders grew by 5%. Consistent with the recent geographic reorganization of the Oncology Systems business, we consolidated the Rest of World region into 3 geographic regions: the Americas, APAC and EMEA. For comparison purposes, the earnings release contains a table providing quarterly results for these regions for 2013 and 2014.
In the first quarter of 2015, Oncology orders rose 17% in APAC and 12% in EMEA, while declining by 2% in the Americas. In North America, orders fell by 3% versus strong 13% growth in the year-ago quarter. Robust APAC quarter performance is driven mainly by China where orders grew by 42% with the help of a tender win with the PLA. The market in China appears to be returning to more typical investment levels following a period of delays and uncertainty. During the quarter, the SFDA granted approval for Varian to supply our EDGE radiosurgery system to customers in China. This opens the door for Varian's leading technology to address the growing lung cancer burden there.
Looking, as a whole, at the BRICA countries of Brazil, Russia, India, China and Africa, we achieved first quarter order growth of 30%. BRICA again accounted for more than 15% of total Oncology orders in the quarter. A strong performance in Africa, where we booked more than $20 million in orders from projects in Algeria, Egypt and South Africa, helped our EMEA geographic region achieve orders growth of 12% or 18% on a constant-currency basis. Elsewhere in EMEA, we saw strong orders performance in France, Turkey and Hungary.
Turning to Latin America. Ongoing demand from the private market in Brazil as well as purchases in Colombia helped to drive order growth in the region. As I mentioned at the outset, orders in North America declined slightly versus very strong first quarter performance last year. The consolidation in this market, we've seen greater quarter-to-quarter variability. On a longer-term, trailing 12-month basis, North America Oncology orders grew 4%. At this point, the sales funnel looks good.
Orders in our Oncology service business were robust, rising by 14% to $254 million, representing some 45% of the total Oncology Systems business during the quarter. This puts us on course to exceed our goal of reaching $1 billion of service revenues this year. We also made great progress in our Software business during the quarter, with double-digit growth in treatment planning and Oncology information systems. We had a big clinical milestone during the quarter when RapidPlan was used for the first time to plan an advanced IMRT treatment for a 76-year-old prostate cancer patient in the U.K. RapidPlan makes it easier and faster for clinicians to generate higher-quality treatment plans. We've taken orders for more than 100 RapidPlan installations to date. During the quarter, we were pleased to see a promising new lung study showing improved survival rate using stereotactic body radiation therapy, or SBRT, in combination with a chemotherapy agent called erlotinib. The study by senior author Dr. Robert Timmerman of UT Southwestern Medical Center in Texas, which was partially funded by Varian, showed overall survival times extending from historic 6 to 9 months to 20 months. The results of this Phase II clinical trial involving 24 patients with Stage 4 non-small cell lung cancer were published the Journal of Clinical Oncology of the American Society of Clinical Oncology.
Turning to our Imaging Components segment. Orders rose by a robust 34% to $163 million versus a very weak year-ago period when orders declined. We saw specially strong growth in our panel business where orders rose by 65%. Among the highlights in our panel business was a big multimillion-dollar win with a customer in Korea. We also started commercial shipments of our new customized veterinarian imaging package that includes both panels and workstations. As you can see in our 2014 annual report, these wireless panels are being used in a Sound-Eklin portable system to image thoroughbred horses. At quarter-end, we announced our intention to make an approximate EUR 32 million public tender offer to acquire all the shares of MeVis Medical Solutions in Germany. The tender was formally launched yesterday. MeVis develops and supplies image analysis software used to screen for breast, lung, liver, prostate and colon cancer. We hope to complete this tender process early in our third quarter. This would be an important step in our strategy to expand the Imaging Components software portfolio.
The company's other category, comprised of the Varian Particle Therapy business and the Ginzton Technology Center, recorded orders of $1 million. The sales funnel continues to look good, and we submitted 5 new Proton centers during the quarter. We made progress on our active proton projects, generating $9 million of revenue. Our customer's financing of the Maryland proton project was not sufficiently completed to enable us to book it during the quarter. Before I hand it over to Elisha, I'm pleased to report that at the World Economic Forum in Davos last week, Varian was included in the global 100 ranking of the world's most sustainable companies. Varian is the top-ranked health care equipment company included on the list. We are proud to be recognized for our commitment to sustainability. Now I'll turn it over to Elisha."

While Dow has already covered gross orders, I want to talk further about the constant currency growth rates for the quarter. In comparing quarter-over-quarter exchange rates, both the euro and the yen weakened significantly against the dollar, which reduced our total company order growth rate by about 2 points. Total Oncology orders for the quarter increased 5% in dollars and 8% in constant currency. Oncology's EMEA orders increased 12% in dollars and 18% in constant currency. Oncology APAC orders increased 17% in dollars and 23% in constant currency primarily due to the yen. There was no currency impact in the Americas. The company ended the quarter with a $3.1 billion backlog, up 13%. Backlog adjustments during the quarter totaled $34 million, bringing net orders for the company to $692 million. First quarter revenues for the total company increased 4% in dollars and 6% in constant currency. Oncology posted a 4% gain in revenues during the quarter with significant shift towards North America and services. North America constituted 52% of total Oncology revenues versus 42% in the year-ago quarter. Service revenues grew by 14% over the year-ago quarter. Imaging Components posted first quarter revenue growth of 3%, with growth in panels and Security and Inspection Products, partially offset by declines in tubes. The total company gross margin for the quarter was 44.3%, up 81 basis points. Oncology Systems gross margins improved by 68 basis points to 45.6% due to favorable geographic and product mix. While we are pleased with the margin performance in the quarter, we continue to believe that Oncology can sustain long-term gross margins in the 43% to 44% range. Imaging Components gross margin for the quarter rose 85 basis points to 42.2% due to a higher mix of panels as well as improved quality cost. First quarter SG&A expenses were $140 million including an $11 million restructuring charge to reduce headcount. This charge increased SG&A as a percentage of revenues by 140 basis points in the quarter. SG&A was also impacted by a $5 million increase in our bad debt reserve in the quarter to reflect uncertainty in our ability to exchange our Venezuelan bolivar collections into dollars.
First quarter R&D expenses were $57 million or 8% of revenues, equal to the year-ago quarter as a percentage of revenue.
Moving down the income statement. First quarter operating earnings totaled $130 million, down from the year-ago quarter due in large part to the restructuring charge. Depreciation and amortization totaled $17 million for the quarter. The effective tax rate was 28.5%, down almost 3 points from the year-ago quarter due largely to the R&D tax credit extension granted in late December. We continue to expect that the tax rate will be 28% to 30% for the fiscal year. Fully diluted shares outstanding decreased almost $6 million from the year-ago quarter to $101.6 million due to our ongoing share repurchase program. Diluted EPS was $0.92 for the quarter, including the $0.07 restructuring charge.
Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $904 million, debt of $525 million and stockholders' equity of $1.6 billion. DSO at 85 improved by 9 days from the year-ago quarter. First quarter cash flow from operations increased significantly from the year-ago quarter to $79 million or 85% of net income. Primary uses of cash were $22 million for CapEx and $126 million toward the repurchase of 1.5 million shares of stock. At the end of the quarter, we had 4.75 million shares remaining under the existing repurchase authorization that extends through calendar year 2015. Now I'll turn it back over to Dow for the outlook."

The company got off to a good start in the first quarter of fiscal 2015 with revenues and earnings coming in ahead of expectations. Our outlook for the full fiscal year is heavily impacted by the recent dramatic swing in currency exchange rates, which we believe will significantly reduce revenues and earnings in the balance of the year. We now believe that total company revenues for fiscal year 2015 could increase by about 5%. Given our earnings momentum in the first quarter, we believe that we can maintain our prior guidance of $4.16 to $4.26 per diluted share for the fiscal year despite significant currency headwind. Given current exchange rates and the expected timing of shipments in the year, we believe total company revenues for the second quarter should increase by about 2% versus the year-ago period. Net earnings per diluted share for the second quarter could be in the range of $0.98 to $1.02. Our guidance excludes contracted proton projects that are not yet financed or booked into backlog. If these projects are booked during the year, the potential upside in revenues and profits could be significant. We're now ready for your questions."

So let me give you the walk from the prior guidance to the new guidance, and let me preface by saying, to simplify it, I'll just start at the midpoint in the year-ago guidance and take you to the midpoint in the quarter-ago guidance and take you to the midpoint today. Just at the 50,000-foot level, we really had a double whammy recently when the yen and the euro, where we have significant revenue in both of those currencies, weakened by 8% to 10%. Added to that, the Swiss franc strengthened by about 20%, and we don't have much revenue in francs but we have a significant amount of expenses in Swiss francs. So when you put that altogether, we start at the $4.21, which is the midpoint of the prior guidance, and you assume we beat the midpoint by $0.14 in Q1, and then we have a negative $0.20 impact to EPS for the balance of the year due to FX, and I'll come back and talk a little bit more about that, that gives you the $4.15. And then we believe, as we look out at the momentum that we had in the quarter and the gross margin and the geographic mix and the product mix, along with some cost control initiatives, that we will be able to get an additional $0.06 or so for the balance of the year, and that gets you back to the $4.21. So let me spend just a minute on how we get to the $0.20 impact from FX. The revenue for Q2 through Q4, we are estimating, just based on what we are expecting shipments to be and where current exchange rates are, to be down about $50 million. And we are roughly 50% naturally hedged. So we have a $25 million net impact from that loss of revenue. And then on top of that, our Swiss costs, we are expecting are going to go up between $5 million to $7 million based on the stronger franc. And when you tax effect that, it gets you at a midpoint of $0.20 for the balance of the year."

If I could, you mentioned the Q2 guidance, let me just do a very quick walk because, first, it looks like it is very low relative to the year-ago period. Some of this is just timing. About -- let's see, the tax is going up about 3 points versus the year-ago quarter. This is just the timing of the geographic mix of profits in the year. That negatively impacted Q2 EPS by about $0.05, and then the FX impact for Q2 is about $0.06.

So it was a little bit stronger in the quarter than we usually see. I don't know that we'll keep popping 14% in the service business, but we should be in that double-digit range. What's driving it is, really everywhere, it's -- we're getting installed base growth in the emerging markets. So you've got product coming out of warranty, driving the emergency markets -- emerging markets. You've got TrueBeam, which we're actually celebrating our 1,000th TrueBeam this next quarter. It's our most successful product in the history of both our company and the industry for 4.5 years, we've gotten to our 1,000th unit. The capture rate on TrueBeam is higher and the price is a little bit higher, so that's driving the service content. And then we've moved a lot of our kind of software as a service to the service business, and so that's part of the growth there as well, which is a nice transition to our Software business. Our Software business has had 2 very good quarters in a row. It's a business we're investing in aggressively, both organically and inorganically, with some of the things that we did last year. Velocity is making a nice addition to our product line, and we saw very good orders growth in our Software business in both the fourth quarter and the first quarter."

And the Middle East, the good news is that they need radiation oncology. They're still competitive, and they're pumping oil like crazy. And we've seen continued investment there.

We're reporting solid results for the first quarter of 2015 with healthy revenue, orders and earnings growth. In summary, we are reporting net earnings of $0.92 per diluted share, including a $0.07 restructuring charge. Revenues of $738 million, up 4%, or up 6% on a constant currency basis. Record Oncology Service revenues of $254 million, an 81 basis point improvement in the company's gross margin to 44.3% of sales; strong orders in our major businesses; and a 13% increase in our quarter-ending backlog to $3.1 billion. Oncology Systems orders totaled $562 million for the quarter, up 5%, or up 8% on a constant currency basis. On a trailing 12-month basis, worldwide reported Oncology orders grew by 5%. Consistent with the recent geographic reorganization of the Oncology Systems business, we consolidated the Rest of World region into 3 geographic regions: the Americas, APAC and EMEA. For comparison purposes, the earnings release contains a table providing quarterly results for these regions for 2013 and 2014.
In the first quarter of 2015, Oncology orders rose 17% in APAC and 12% in EMEA, while declining by 2% in the Americas. In North America, orders fell by 3%, versus strong 13% growth in the year-ago quarter. The robust APAC quarter performance is driven mainly by China, where orders grew by 42% with the help of a tender win with the PLA. The market in China appears to be returning to more typical investment levels following a period of delays and uncertainty. During the quarter, the SFDA granted approval for Varian to supply our EDGE radiosurgery system to customers in China. This opens the door for Varian's leading technology to address the growing lung cancer burden there.
Looking as a whole at the BRICA countries of Brazil, Russia, India, China and Africa, we achieved first quarter order growth of 30%. BRICA again accounted for more than 15% of total Oncology orders in the quarter. A strong performance in Africa, where we booked more than $20 million in orders from projects in Algeria, Egypt and South Africa, helped our EMEA geographic region achieve orders growth of 12%, or 18% on a constant currency basis. Elsewhere in EMEA, we saw strong orders performance in France, Turkey and Hungary.
Turning to Latin America. Ongoing demand from the private market in Brazil, as well as purchases in Colombia, helped to drive order growth in the region. As I mentioned at the outset, orders in North America declined slightly versus very strong first quarter performance last year. With consolidation in this market, we've seen greater quarter-to-quarter variability. On a longer-term, trailing 12-month basis, North America Oncology orders grew 4%. At this point, the sales funnel looks good.
Orders in our Oncology Service business were robust, rising by 14% to $254 million, representing some 45% of the total Oncology Systems business during the quarter. This puts us on course to exceed our goal of reaching $1 billion of Service revenues this year. We also made great progress in our Software business during the quarter, with double-digit growth in treatment planning and Oncology information systems. We hit a big clinical milestone during the quarter when RapidPlan was used for the first time to plan an advance IMRT treatment for a 76-year-old prostate cancer patient in the U.K. RapidPlan makes it easier and faster for clinicians to generate higher-quality treatment plans. We've taken orders for more than 100 RapidPlan installations to date. During the quarter, we were pleased to see a promising new lung study showing improved survival rates using stereotactic body radiation therapy, or SBRT, in combination with a chemotherapy agent called erlotinib. The study by senior author Dr. Robert Timmerman of UT Southwestern Medical Center in Texas, which was partially funded by Varian, showed overall survival times extending from historic 6 to 9 months to 20 months. The results of this Phase II clinical trial involving 24 patients with Stage 4 non-small cell lung cancer were published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology of the American Society of Clinical Oncology.
Turning to our Imaging Components segment. Orders rose by a robust 34% to $163 million, versus a very weak year-ago period when orders declined. We saw specially strong growth in our panel business where orders rose by 65%. Among the highlights in our panel business was a big multimillion-dollar win with a customer in Korea. We also started commercial shipments of our new customized veterinarian imaging package that includes both panels and workstations. As you can see in our 2014 annual report, these wireless panels are being used in a Sound-Eklin portable system to image thoroughbred horses. At quarter-end, we announced our intention to make an approximate EUR 32 million public tender offer to acquire all the shares of MeVis Medical Solutions in Germany. The tender was formally launched yesterday. MeVis develops and supplies image analysis software used to screen for breast, lung, liver, prostate and colon cancer. We hope to complete this tender process early in our third quarter. This would be an important step in our strategy to expand the Imaging Components software portfolio.
The company's other category, comprised of the Varian Particle Therapy business and the Ginzton Technology Center, recorded orders of $1 million. The sales funnel continues to look good, and we submitted 5 new proton tenders during the quarter. We made progress on our active proton projects, generating $9 million of revenue. Our customer's financing of the Maryland proton project was not sufficiently completed to enable us to book it during the quarter. Before I hand it over to Elisha, I'm pleased to report that at the World Economic Forum in Davos last week, Varian was included in the global 100 ranking of the world's most sustainable companies. Varian is the top-ranked health care equipment company included on the list. We are proud to be recognized for our commitment to sustainability. Now I'll turn it over to Elisha."

While Dow has already covered gross orders, I want to talk further about the constant currency growth rates for the quarter. In comparing quarter-over-quarter exchange rates, both the euro and the yen weakened significantly against the dollar, which reduced our total company order growth rate by about 2 points. Total Oncology orders for the quarter increased 5% in dollars and 8% in constant currency. Oncology's EMEA orders increased 12% in dollars and 18% in constant currency. Oncology APAC orders increased 17% in dollars and 23% in constant currency, primarily due to the yen. There was no currency impact in the Americas. The company ended the quarter with a $3.1 billion backlog, up 13%. Backlog adjustments during the quarter totaled $34 million, bringing net orders for the company to $692 million. First quarter revenues for the total company increased 4% in dollars and 6% in constant currency. Oncology posted a 4% gain in revenues during the quarter, with significant shift towards North America and Services. North America constituted 52% of total Oncology revenues, versus 42% in the year-ago quarter. Service revenues grew by 14% over the year-ago quarter. Imaging Components posted first quarter revenue growth of 3%, with growth in panels and Security and Inspection Products, partially offset by declines in tubes. The total company gross margin for the quarter was 44.3%, up 81 basis points. Oncology Systems gross margin improved by 68 basis points to 45.6%, due to favorable geographic and product mix. While we are pleased with the margin performance in the quarter, we continue to believe that Oncology can sustain long-term gross margins in the 43% to 44% range. Imaging Components gross margin for the quarter rose 85 basis points to 42.2%, due to a higher mix of panels as well as improved quality costs. First quarter SG&A expenses were $140 million, including an $11 million restructuring charge to reduce headcount. This charge increased SG&A as a percentage of revenues by 140 basis points in the quarter. SG&A was also impacted by a $5 million increase in our bad debt reserve in the quarter to reflect uncertainty in our ability to exchange our Venezuelan bolivar collections into dollars.
First quarter R&D expenses were $57 million, or 8% of revenues, equal to the year-ago quarter as a percentage of revenue.
Moving down the income statement. First quarter operating earnings totaled $130 million, down from the year-ago quarter, due in large part to the restructuring charge. Depreciation and amortization totaled $17 million for the quarter. The effective tax rate was 28.5%, down almost 3 points from the year-ago quarter, due largely to the R&D tax credit extension granted in late December. We continue to expect that the tax rate will be 28% to 30% for the fiscal year. Fully diluted shares outstanding decreased almost $6 million from the year-ago quarter to $101.6 million, due to our ongoing share repurchase program. Diluted EPS was $0.92 for the quarter, including the $0.07 restructuring charge.
Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $904 million, debt of $525 million and stockholders' equity of $1.6 billion. DSO at 85 improved by 9 days from the year-ago quarter. First quarter cash flow from operations increased significantly from the year-ago quarter to $79 million or 85% of net income. Primary uses of cash were $22 million for CapEx and $126 million toward the repurchase of 1.5 million shares of stock. At the end of the quarter, we had 4.75 million shares remaining under the existing repurchase authorization that extends through calendar year 2015. Now I'll turn it back to Dow for the outlook."

The company got off to a good start in the first quarter of fiscal 2015, with revenues and earnings coming in ahead of expectations. Our outlook for the full fiscal year is heavily impacted by the recent dramatic swing in currency exchange rates, which we believe will significantly reduce revenues and earnings in the balance of the year. We now believe that total company revenues for fiscal year 2015 could increase by about 5%. Given our earnings momentum in the first quarter, we believe that we can maintain our prior guidance of $4.16 to $4.26 per diluted share for the fiscal year despite significant currency headwinds. Given current exchange rates and the expected timing of shipments in the year, we believe total company revenues for the second quarter should increase by about 2% versus the year-ago period. Net earnings per diluted share for the second quarter could be in the range of $0.98 to $1.02. Our guidance excludes contracted proton projects that are not yet financed or booked into backlog. If these projects are booked during the year, the potential upside in revenues and profits could be significant. We're now ready for your questions."

So let me give you the walk from the prior guidance to the new guidance, and let me preface by saying, to simplify it, I'll just start at the midpoint in the year-ago guidance and take you to the midpoint in the quarter-ago guidance and take you to the midpoint today. Just at the 50,000-foot level, we really had a double whammy recently when the yen and the euro, where we have significant revenue in both of those currencies, weakened by 8% to 10%. Added to that, the Swiss franc strengthened by about 20%, and we don't have much revenue in francs, but we have a significant amount of expenses in Swiss francs. So when you put that all together, we start at the $4.21, which is the midpoint of the prior guidance, and you assume we beat the midpoint by $0.14 in Q1, and then we have a negative $0.20 impact to EPS for the balance of the year due to FX, and I'll come back and talk a little bit more about that, that gets you to $4.15. And then we believe, as we look out at the momentum that we had in the quarter and the gross margin and the geographic mix and the product mix, along with some cost control initiatives, that we will be able to get an additional $0.06 or so for the balance of the year, and that gets you back to the $4.21. So let me spend just a minute on how we get to the $0.20 impact from FX. The revenue for Q2 through Q4, we are estimating, just based on what we are expecting shipments to be and where current exchange rates are, to be down about $50 million. And we are roughly 50% naturally hedged. So we have a $25 million net impact from that loss of revenue. And then on top of that, our Swiss costs we are expecting are going to go up between $5 million to $7 million based on the stronger franc. And when you tax effect that, it gets you at a midpoint of $0.20 for the balance of the year."

We've seen the same capital surveys that everybody else have seen. I think the surveys are usually ahead of where people actually spend the money, but I'd say our funnel looks good."

So when I first saw the strong margins in the first quarter, you talked about the positive revenue mix. It felt like maybe that was just pulling into first quarter and out of second quarter, especially with that second quarter guidance being a little lighter than most models. But obviously, fundamentally, you must be feeling better. And I'm just trying to figure out, fundamentally, is it the strong growth you're seeing in Imaging?

Plus we do think, just given the geographic mix and the margin performance and the Service growth and these cost control initiatives that we took late in the calendar year, that we will have a little bit more that we added to guidance for the balance of the year. If I could, you mentioned the Q2 guidance, let me just do a very quick walk because, first, it looks like it is very low relative to the year-ago period. Some of this is just timing. About -- let's see, the tax is going up about 3 points versus the year-ago quarter. This is just the timing of the geographic mix of profits in the year. That negatively impacted Q2 EPS by about $0.05, and then the FX impact for Q2 is about $0.06. So if you were to strip out those effects, we would have high single-digit growth quarter-over-quarter for Q2."

And I think that's something that other -- in diagnostic imaging, it's been around for a long time, we historically have seen a little bit of that, but not a lot. I think we're starting to see a little bit more of the private market emerge in China. Latin America, the first quarter was okay, we've done better in terms of growth.

We haven't seen that slow down so far. Might it? I mean it's a reasonable question to ask. Frankly, some of the growth that we're seeing in Africa is we're seeing a lot of growth in sub-Saharan Africa. And with the exception of Nigeria, there's not a lot of oil in the rest of sub-Saharan Africa. So that's kind of good news on the rest of the African continent. We did see some big volume in Eastern Europe, Russia, 12, 18 months ago, we took a big order in Kazakhstan. And we maybe have seen that tail off a little bit here recently. But -- so I think Russia -- and we didn't do much last year in Russia, so growing off of nothing is going to still be kind of nothing. And the Middle East, the good news is that they need radiation oncology. They're still competitive, and they're pumping oil like crazy. And we've seen continued investment there. So we haven't seen that tail off yet. It'll be interesting to watch Brazil. I think that market has remained strong. We've got, obviously, the big tender we won a year ago. But we continue to see the private market, which tends to buy a higher configuration. But it'll be interesting to see where the market goes there."

TrueBeam was the best product when we introduced it, but we think the second best product on the market is the Trilogy, and both products have just gotten better in the last 4 years. So we are in a terrific market position in the high end of the market. Just this week, we've had the number of customers here through Palo Alto singing praises of our TrueBeam product. So I think we really have a terrific position on TrueBeam. One of the things that our customers are looking at is total cost of ownership. And total cost of ownership isn't always about price, it's about throughput, it's about versatility, it's about volume, it's about brand and reputation in the market and then it's also about cost. And we've, I think, done a really nice job in our sales team of pushing the differentiation of the product from a total cost point of view. And on the Software side, our Software products just keep getting better and better. And I think we're really beginning to turn some heads. I think we've been turning heads for a long time in treatment planning. Our treatment planning position is terrific, and I really think over the last 6, 12 months in Oncology Information Systems, especially with the investments we've made in our ARIA product and now these new extensions for QA and analytics, really getting some traction there."

We're reporting solid results for the first quarter of 2015 with healthy revenue, orders and earnings growth. In summary, we are reporting net earnings of $0.92 per diluted share, including a $0.07 restructuring charge. Revenues of $738 million, up 4%, or up 6% on a constant currency basis. Record Oncology Service revenues of $254 million, an 81 basis point improvement in the company's gross margin to 44.3% of sales; strong orders in our major businesses; and a 13% increase in our quarter-ending backlog to $3.1 billion. Oncology Systems orders totaled $562 million for the quarter, up 5%, or up 8% on a constant currency basis. On a trailing 12-month basis, worldwide reported Oncology orders grew by 5%. Consistent with the recent geographic reorganization of the Oncology Systems business, we consolidated the Rest of World region into 3 geographic regions: the Americas, APAC and EMEA. For comparison purposes, the earnings release contains a table providing quarterly results for these regions for 2013 and 2014.
In the first quarter of 2015, Oncology orders rose 17% in APAC and 12% in EMEA, while declining by 2% in the Americas. In North America, orders fell by 3%, versus strong 13% growth in the year-ago quarter. The robust APAC quarter performance is driven mainly by China, where orders grew by 42% with the help of a tender win with the PLA. The market in China appears to be returning to more typical investment levels following a period of delays and uncertainty. During the quarter, the SFDA granted approval for Varian to supply our EDGE radiosurgery system to customers in China. This opens the door for Varian's leading technology to address the growing lung cancer burden there.
Looking as a whole at the BRICA countries of Brazil, Russia, India, China and Africa, we achieved first quarter order growth of 30%. BRICA again accounted for more than 15% of total Oncology orders in the quarter. A strong performance in Africa, where we booked more than $20 million in orders from projects in Algeria, Egypt and South Africa, helped our EMEA geographic region achieve orders growth of 12%, or 18% on a constant currency basis. Elsewhere in EMEA, we saw strong orders performance in France, Turkey and Hungary.
Turning to Latin America. Ongoing demand from the private market in Brazil, as well as purchases in Colombia, helped to drive order growth in the region. As I mentioned at the outset, orders in North America declined slightly versus very strong first quarter performance last year. With consolidation in this market, we've seen greater quarter-to-quarter variability. On a longer-term, trailing 12-month basis, North America Oncology orders grew 4%. At this point, the sales funnel looks good.
Orders in our Oncology Service business were robust, rising by 14% to $254 million, representing some 45% of the total Oncology Systems business during the quarter. This puts us on course to exceed our goal of reaching $1 billion of Service revenues this year. We also made great progress in our Software business during the quarter, with double-digit growth in treatment planning and Oncology information systems. We hit a big clinical milestone during the quarter when RapidPlan was used for the first time to plan an advance IMRT treatment for a 76-year-old prostate cancer patient in the U.K. RapidPlan makes it easier and faster for clinicians to generate higher-quality treatment plans. We've taken orders for more than 100 RapidPlan installations to date. During the quarter, we were pleased to see a promising new lung study showing improved survival rates using stereotactic body radiation therapy, or SBRT, in combination with a chemotherapy agent called erlotinib. The study by senior author Dr. Robert Timmerman of UT Southwestern Medical Center in Texas, which was partially funded by Varian, showed overall survival times extending from historic 6 to 9 months to 20 months. The results of this Phase II clinical trial involving 24 patients with Stage 4 non-small cell lung cancer were published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology of the American Society of Clinical Oncology.
Turning to our Imaging Components segment. Orders rose by a robust 34% to $163 million, versus a very weak year-ago period when orders declined. We saw specially strong growth in our panel business where orders rose by 65%. Among the highlights in our panel business was a big multimillion-dollar win with a customer in Korea. We also started commercial shipments of our new customized veterinarian imaging package that includes both panels and workstations. As you can see in our 2014 annual report, these wireless panels are being used in a Sound-Eklin portable system to image thoroughbred horses. At quarter-end, we announced our intention to make an approximate EUR 32 million public tender offer to acquire all the shares of MeVis Medical Solutions in Germany. The tender was formally launched yesterday. MeVis develops and supplies image analysis software used to screen for breast, lung, liver, prostate and colon cancer. We hope to complete this tender process early in our third quarter. This would be an important step in our strategy to expand the Imaging Components software portfolio.
The company's other category, comprised of the Varian Particle Therapy business and the Ginzton Technology Center, recorded orders of $1 million. The sales funnel continues to look good, and we submitted 5 new proton tenders during the quarter. We made progress on our active proton projects, generating $9 million of revenue. Our customer's financing of the Maryland proton project was not sufficiently completed to enable us to book it during the quarter. Before I hand it over to Elisha, I'm pleased to report that at the World Economic Forum in Davos last week, Varian was included in the global 100 ranking of the world's most sustainable companies. Varian is the top-ranked health care equipment company included on the list. We are proud to be recognized for our commitment to sustainability. Now I'll turn it over to Elisha."

While Dow has already covered gross orders, I want to talk further about the constant currency growth rates for the quarter. In comparing quarter-over-quarter exchange rates, both the euro and the yen weakened significantly against the dollar, which reduced our total company order growth rate by about 2 points. Total Oncology orders for the quarter increased 5% in dollars and 8% in constant currency. Oncology's EMEA orders increased 12% in dollars and 18% in constant currency. Oncology APAC orders increased 17% in dollars and 23% in constant currency, primarily due to the yen. There was no currency impact in the Americas. The company ended the quarter with a $3.1 billion backlog, up 13%. Backlog adjustments during the quarter totaled $34 million, bringing net orders for the company to $692 million. First quarter revenues for the total company increased 4% in dollars and 6% in constant currency. Oncology posted a 4% gain in revenues during the quarter, with significant shift towards North America and Services. North America constituted 52% of total Oncology revenues, versus 42% in the year-ago quarter. Service revenues grew by 14% over the year-ago quarter. Imaging Components posted first quarter revenue growth of 3%, with growth in panels and Security and Inspection Products, partially offset by declines in tubes. The total company gross margin for the quarter was 44.3%, up 81 basis points. Oncology Systems gross margin improved by 68 basis points to 45.6%, due to favorable geographic and product mix. While we are pleased with the margin performance in the quarter, we continue to believe that Oncology can sustain long-term gross margins in the 43% to 44% range. Imaging Components gross margin for the quarter rose 85 basis points to 42.2%, due to a higher mix of panels as well as improved quality costs. First quarter SG&A expenses were $140 million, including an $11 million restructuring charge to reduce headcount. This charge increased SG&A as a percentage of revenues by 140 basis points in the quarter. SG&A was also impacted by a $5 million increase in our bad debt reserve in the quarter to reflect uncertainty in our ability to exchange our Venezuelan bolivar collections into dollars.
First quarter R&D expenses were $57 million, or 8% of revenues, equal to the year-ago quarter as a percentage of revenue.
Moving down the income statement. First quarter operating earnings totaled $130 million, down from the year-ago quarter, due in large part to the restructuring charge. Depreciation and amortization totaled $17 million for the quarter. The effective tax rate was 28.5%, down almost 3 points from the year-ago quarter, due largely to the R&D tax credit extension granted in late December. We continue to expect that the tax rate will be 28% to 30% for the fiscal year. Fully diluted shares outstanding decreased almost $6 million from the year-ago quarter to $101.6 million, due to our ongoing share repurchase program. Diluted EPS was $0.92 for the quarter, including the $0.07 restructuring charge.
Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $904 million, debt of $525 million and stockholders' equity of $1.6 billion. DSO at 85 improved by 9 days from the year-ago quarter. First quarter cash flow from operations increased significantly from the year-ago quarter to $79 million or 85% of net income. Primary uses of cash were $22 million for CapEx and $126 million toward the repurchase of 1.5 million shares of stock. At the end of the quarter, we had 4.75 million shares remaining under the existing repurchase authorization that extends through calendar year 2015. Now I'll turn it back to Dow for the outlook."

The company got off to a good start in the first quarter of fiscal 2015, with revenues and earnings coming in ahead of expectations. Our outlook for the full fiscal year is heavily impacted by the recent dramatic swing in currency exchange rates, which we believe will significantly reduce revenues and earnings in the balance of the year. We now believe that total company revenues for fiscal year 2015 could increase by about 5%. Given our earnings momentum in the first quarter, we believe that we can maintain our prior guidance of $4.16 to $4.26 per diluted share for the fiscal year despite significant currency headwinds. Given current exchange rates and the expected timing of shipments in the year, we believe total company revenues for the second quarter should increase by about 2% versus the year-ago period. Net earnings per diluted share for the second quarter could be in the range of $0.98 to $1.02. Our guidance excludes contracted proton projects that are not yet financed or booked into backlog. If these projects are booked during the year, the potential upside in revenues and profits could be significant. We're now ready for your questions."

So let me give you the walk from the prior guidance to the new guidance, and let me preface by saying, to simplify it, I'll just start at the midpoint in the year-ago guidance and take you to the midpoint in the quarter-ago guidance and take you to the midpoint today. Just at the 50,000-foot level, we really had a double whammy recently when the yen and the euro, where we have significant revenue in both of those currencies, weakened by 8% to 10%. Added to that, the Swiss franc strengthened by about 20%, and we don't have much revenue in francs, but we have a significant amount of expenses in Swiss francs. So when you put that all together, we start at the $4.21, which is the midpoint of the prior guidance, and you assume we beat the midpoint by $0.14 in Q1, and then we have a negative $0.20 impact to EPS for the balance of the year due to FX, and I'll come back and talk a little bit more about that, that gets you to $4.15. And then we believe, as we look out at the momentum that we had in the quarter and the gross margin and the geographic mix and the product mix, along with some cost control initiatives, that we will be able to get an additional $0.06 or so for the balance of the year, and that gets you back to the $4.21. So let me spend just a minute on how we get to the $0.20 impact from FX. The revenue for Q2 through Q4, we are estimating, just based on what we are expecting shipments to be and where current exchange rates are, to be down about $50 million. And we are roughly 50% naturally hedged. So we have a $25 million net impact from that loss of revenue. And then on top of that, our Swiss costs we are expecting are going to go up between $5 million to $7 million based on the stronger franc. And when you tax effect that, it gets you at a midpoint of $0.20 for the balance of the year."

But it sounds like the incremental FX headwind is around $0.20. I'm not sure if that's incremental since you last updated or not, and we can talk about that offline. But if you're absorbing that in guidance, it seems like, fundamentally, the year is obviously coming in stronger already, 1 quarter in, you fundamentally feel better about the year. So when I first saw the strong margins in the first quarter, you talked about the positive revenue mix. It felt like maybe that was just pulling into first quarter and out of second quarter, especially with that second quarter guidance being a little lighter than most models. But obviously, fundamentally, you must be feeling better. And I'm just trying to figure out, fundamentally, is it the strong growth you're seeing in Imaging? Is it the Software and Services side of Oncology? Just where fundamentally are you feeling better maybe today than you were 3 months ago when you first gave guidance?"

Plus we do think, just given the geographic mix and the margin performance and the Service growth and these cost control initiatives that we took late in the calendar year, that we will have a little bit more that we added to guidance for the balance of the year. If I could, you mentioned the Q2 guidance, let me just do a very quick walk because, first, it looks like it is very low relative to the year-ago period. Some of this is just timing. About -- let's see, the tax is going up about 3 points versus the year-ago quarter. This is just the timing of the geographic mix of profits in the year. That negatively impacted Q2 EPS by about $0.05, and then the FX impact for Q2 is about $0.06. So if you were to strip out those effects, we would have high single-digit growth quarter-over-quarter for Q2."

Maybe one other thing that -- just going back to China, one other thing that we're seeing besides that kind of government strength is we're seeing the emergence of a private market in China. And I think that's something that other -- in diagnostic imaging, it's been around for a long time, we historically have seen a little bit of that, but not a lot. I think we're starting to see a little bit more of the private market emerge in China. Latin America, the first quarter was okay, we've done better in terms of growth. But we still had a good growth in the first quarter, I think we were up 5% in the first quarter in Latin America -- that -- and I think we'll keep growing there.

For the second quarter of fiscal 2015 we generated good earnings that were achieved in the face of significant currency headwinds. In summary, we are reporting net earnings of $1.05 per diluted share, revenues of $759 million, down 2% in dollars but up 2% in constant currency, excellent cost control efforts that helped our gross and operating margins, double-digit Oncology orders growth in the Americas that largely offset declines in EMEA and APAC, challenges in our Imaging Components business with declines in orders in revenues and 2 big wins in our Proton business. 
Let's talk about each of the businesses in more detail starting with Oncology. Second quarter gross orders for Oncology Systems rose by 15% in North America and by nearly 10% in China, partially offsetting currency-related weakness across the bulk of the international market. Oncology gross orders totaled $581 million for the quarter, down 5% versus the year-ago quarter but equal to the year-ago quarter on a constant-currency basis. 
Looking at Oncology's 3 geographies. Gross orders in the Americas rose 12% in dollars and constant currency. Gross orders in EMEA declined 24% in dollars and 13% in constant currency principally due to weakness in Africa and India, where we had strong orders in the year-ago quarter and business tends to be lumpy. In APAC, gross orders fell by 15% in dollars and 8% in constant currency principally due to weakness in Japan. 
For the first half, Oncology gross orders growth rates were as follows: Worldwide, even in dollars and up 4% in constant currency; Americas, up 5% in both dollars and constant currency; EMEA, down 8% in dollars and up 1% in constant currency; and APAC, down 1% in dollars and up 5% in constant currency. 
Our strong order growth in North America during the quarter was highlighted by several large long-term deals. The largest of which was a project with HCA to equip its Sarah Cannon Cancer Center in Tennessee with 7 linear accelerators including 6 TrueBeam systems. This installation will also have our new RapidPlan and inside of analytics software using analytics tools for treatment planning and information management. The HCA order is an example of the move toward consolidated networks making purchasing decisions aimed at standardizing clinical operations. The need for integrated clinical solutions drove many customer decisions during the quarter to replace competitive hardware and software products for multiple vendors in favor of a single Varian system. 
Clinical integration of treatment planning and delivery as well as information management for safe, efficient and effective workflow is a key Varian advantage. In Latin America, currency headwinds led to some purchasing delays that resulted in modest decline in orders. In EMEA, we had sizable wins in Germany, Bulgaria, Finland and in the U.K. Aspire Healthcare, one of the U.K.'s biggest private hospital chains, ordered 2 TrueBeam together with our full software suite for our plans in radiotherapy and radiosurgery facility in Chelmsford, Essex. In APAC, weakness in Japan and Australia overshadowed our growth in China. In Japan, orders were flat in constant currency and down in dollars. The market remained sluggish. However, we gained share there during the quarter. Currency was also a culprit in Australia where a stronger dollar caused some customers to hold back on purchasing decisions. In China, we booked an $18 million order following a public tender by the People of Liberation Army. During the quarter, we also successfully launched the EDGE Radiosurgery System in front of more than 250 customers at the Annual ChinaMed Exhibition in Beijing. China remains a healthy market for us. 
Order activity during the quarter was slow in other emerging markets including Brazil, India, Africa and Russia. Russia in particular remains very quiet. 
The long-term need for cancer treatment products remains high in developing markets where the number of diagnosed cases is rising and where radiation therapy is among the most cost-effective treatments. In past calls, we have talked about expanding our product portfolio to offer more to customers in global markets. 
Over the weekend, at the ESTRO show in Barcelona, Varian announced VitalBeam, a significant addition to our line of linear accelerators. VitalBeam leverages Varian's basic TrueBeam technology to provide clinics with new cost competitive options for delivering image-guided radiotherapy. It can be equipped with accessories including RapidArc, respiratory gating, onboard imaging and 80 or 120-leaf collimators. VitalBeam is a scalable and upgradable system that affordably meets the critical needs of hospitals today and as they grow in the future. It's optimized for advanced radiotherapy. VitalBeam is targeted at the core radiotherapy market where it can serve as a workhorse in busy clinics. 
Customer interest at ESTRO was very high and we plan to make it available to customers in Europe first while seeking clearances around the Rest of the World. CE Mark, FDA (510(k) and other international regulatory approvals have not yet been obtained. VitalBeam is currently not available for sale in any market. We will continue to invest in R&D to bring more products like VitalBeam to market. 
In March, we held our Annual Research Partners Symposium, a 2.5-day scientific meeting in Atlanta on the future of cancer care. It attracted 150 leading clinicians and research partners from 71 institutions in 15 countries. They shared ideas and presentations on their work with knowledge-based planning, data analytics, stereotactic radiosurgery and advanced imaging technology. It was an exciting meeting and we can see a clear path for the development of significant new treatment capabilities that would dramatically improve the speed and precision of radiotherapy and radiosurgery. The next steps will be every bit as exciting as IMRT, IGRT, SBRT, RapidArc, RapidPlan and TrueBeam. 
Let me turn now to our Imaging Components business. Gross orders for our Imaging Components fell by 24% to $156 million for the quarter and revenues fell by 8% to $155 million. Imaging Components had a tough comparison with very high panel orders in the year-ago quarter as a result of orders that slipped from the first to the second quarter last year. Additionally, orders in sales for tubes and panels were impacted by pricing pressures related to devaluations in the yen and the euro. 
Very strong dollar is causing some customers to reduce inventories in source or look elsewhere for lower-cost alternatives to our components. Orders in sales of our Security and Inspection products also fell sharply in the quarter. And just for these, products have been delayed. And it appears that customers have already ordered most of what they need for the next few quarters as they work through the backlog. 
For the first half, orders for tubes and panels were up 6% and sales were flat. However, orders in sales for our Security products were down significantly. While we remain optimistic about the long-term growth prospects, we believe that this business will continue to face challenging conditions in the near term. 
The company's Other category, comprised of the Varian Particle Therapy business and the Ginzton Technology Center, recorded gross orders of $44 million and generated $14 million in revenue. It was a big quarter for our proton business, we won a public tender and booked an order for a ProBeam installation at [indiscernible] in Denmark. In addition, Varian was announced as the preferred bidder for 2 Proton Therapy Centers that would be constructed in the United Kingdom over the next 2 years. The contracts for these projects are due to be signed during the summer and we expect to book the equipment portion of these orders at that time. With a strong backlog and sales pipeline, we are starting to see some real momentum in our Particle Therapy business. 
Now I'll turn it over to Elisha."

Before I walk you through the P&L, let me touch on backlog. The company ended the quarter with a $3.1 billion backlog. Backlog adjustments during the quarter totaled $53 million, bringing net orders for the company to $729 million. The adjustment includes $12 million related to currency exchange rates. 
Second quarter revenues for the total company decreased 2% in dollars and increased 2% in constant currency. Total company revenues in the Americas were up 11% in dollars and up 12% in constant currency. EMEA revenues were down 1% in dollars but up 10% in constant currency. APAC revenues were down 25% in dollars and down 21% in constant currency. For the first half, total company revenues were flat in dollars and up 4% in constant currency. 
Oncology Systems posted a 2% decline in revenues during the quarter, bringing the revenue growth for the first half to 1%. Imaging Components posted a second quarter revenue decline of 8% with small declines in our tubes and flat panel products and a 45% decline in our Security and Inspection Products. For the first half, Imaging Components revenues were down 3% from the year-ago period with gains in flat panels more than offset by declines in tubes as well as significant declines in Security and Inspection products. Revenues for the Other category increased significantly from the year-ago quarter as we continued production and installation of several proton projects that are in our backlog. 
Total company gross margin for the quarter rose 30 basis points to 42.5% with increases in all of our businesses. Oncology Systems gross margin increased 18 basis points from the year-ago quarter to 43% as favorable product and geographic mix more than offset the negative currency impact on revenue. 
For the first half, Oncology's gross margin increased nearly 0.5 point to 44.3%. The Imaging Components gross margin for the quarter increased by 216 basis points to 43.7% due largely to a higher mix of panel products, product cost reductions and improved quality cost. For the first half, Imaging Components gross margin increased nearly 1.5 points to 42.9%. 
Second quarter SG&A expenses were $117 million or 15% of revenues, an improvement of 250 basis points as a percent of revenues from the year-ago quarter when we had a large patent litigation settlement. SG&A includes a $3 million charge during the quarter to complete the restructuring that was largely implemented last quarter. I think it's worth mentioning that SG&A expenses were down significantly from last quarter as the cost savings from the restructuring have started to flow through the P&L. 
Second quarter R&D expenses were $59 million or 8% of revenues even as a percentage of revenue with the year-ago quarter. And for the first half, R&D expenses were about even as a percentage of revenue at 8%. 
Moving down the income statement. Second quarter operating earnings totaled $146 million or 19% of revenues. Depreciation and amortization totaled $16 million for the quarter and $33 million for the first half. The effective tax rate at 28% was up 35 basis points from the year-ago period when we benefited from a patent litigation settlement. We now believe the tax rate for the full fiscal year will be 27% to 29%. 
Fully diluted shares outstanding decreased from the year-ago quarter to 101 million shares due largely to our ongoing repurchase program. Diluted earnings per share was $1.05 for the second quarter including the $0.02 restructuring charge. 
Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $862 million, debt of $513 million and stockholders' equity of $1.67 billion. DSO at 88 was improved 7 days from the year-ago quarter. 
Second quarter cash flow from operations was $53 million, less than net income, primarily due to working capital increases in inventory and accounts receivable. For the first half, cash flow from operations was $132 million. 
Primary uses of cash were $76 million toward the repurchase of about 825,000 shares of stock. At the end of the quarter, we had 3.9 million shares remaining under the existing repurchase authorization that extends through calendar year 2015. 
Now I'll turn it back to Dow for the outlook."

We believe that for fiscal year 2015, total company earnings will be in the range of $4.02 to $4.14 per diluted share and net revenues will increase by about 1% to 2% in dollars and by about 5% in constant currency. We now expect that challenges in our Imaging Components business and currency headwinds will more than offset the earnings momentum of the first half. We estimate that Imaging Components could negatively impact earnings by about $0.08 to $0.12 per diluted share. Additionally, since our guidance last quarter the strength of the dollar has diminished our earnings expectations by another $0.06 to $0.10 per diluted share. 
For the third quarter of fiscal 2015, we believe total company revenues should be about equal to the prior-year period in dollars and up about 4% in constant currency. Net earnings per diluted share for the third quarter could be in the range of $0.90 to $0.94 per diluted share. The outlook for the third quarter and full fiscal year 2015 excludes any impact of proton orders not yet booked into the backlog. 
Let me finish with a comment on the significant impact of the strong U.S. dollar. Since last October, when we first guided for fiscal year 2015, the strengthening of the dollar has cost us about $0.30 per diluted share not counting the competitive challenges that this has presented to our Imaging Components business. The good news is that we managed to largely offset this in our operations. 
We are now ready for your questions."

When you look at year-to-date, year-to-date gross orders are up kind of in constant currency 1% in EMEA. And that feels okay. we obviously like to do better than that. We've been surprised by the strength in Western Europe. We've been weak in Eastern Europe, Russia, we had a weak Q2 in India and in Africa. So Africa tends to be -- Africa tend to be lumpy. I think the Russia, Eastern Europe impact is a political one. But I think we'll see India and Africa come back. And then we did have a tough comp for our EMEA organization where last year we had a very large Algeria quarter. In Asia, you heard the story a little bit. Year-to-date gross orders are up 5% in constant currency in Asia. In China, we were up 9. So we still feel very good about where we are in China. The Japan market year-over-year, we think is down pretty substantially. There are some retrenchment going on in Japan. Market feels like it's down 30-ish-percent. Good news is, as I mentioned, we have a very strong performance in market share in Japan and it's nice to see that coming around and then of course, the other impact we have in Japan is the yen is off pretty substantially and hitting us there as well in Japan. So that kind of a go around goal. And Elisha, would you add anything there?"

It's got a dose rate that's optimized radiation therapy at 1,400 monitor units. TrueBeam is still optimized for SRT -- for SRS and SBRT. And so TrueBeam still has all the motion management, the 6 degree of freedom couch, the high-definition collimator flattening filter free and all of our triggered imaging capabilities. The difference between VitalBeam and UNIQUE, UNIQUE is built on our C-Series platform. It's a single energy system and it's really the entry-level products. So I don't think these -- we see this as really kind of between UNIQUE and TrueBeam and fulfilling a space where we can be more competitive. I think it kind of give us better price support of TrueBeam and it's not going to compete with the UNIQUE at all. And we still have the rest of the product line, the X and the Trilogy to kind of fit in there as well. So we feel very good about the way this product lines up. And I guess, just kind of reiterate the point, I don't think there was -- I would like to say there were some impact from people waiting in these markets for VitalBeam. But I don't think so in this last quarter."

We've talked about it a lot in the context of quality in terms of letting everybody in the world do the absolute best care. But I think the other thing that people are getting really excited about is the efficiency aspect of the product. And we had the paper presented at ESTRO last week where 1 institution were seeing 90 minute reduction in planning times. So that's per plan, that's huge. And all of a sudden, you start to get the same productivity and dose symmetry that we have. When we launched RapidPlan -- when we launch RapidArc, RapidArc was about productivity in the delivery room. Now we're talking about patient productivity and planning, 90 minutes, where do you get that kind of productivity? It's huge. And by the way, this is Varian-only thing. Research can't do this, and Elekta can do this, Pinnacle can't do this. So we are really first to market with a terrific product, great quality and great efficiency."

I would say in Q4, in the year-ago period, if you remember, we had strong orders in North America. So Q4 will be again more North American focused. And so it's just the way it breaks down. I wouldn't read too much into quarter-to-quarter. But really just kind of looking at the year. And interestingly on the year, if you exclude all of the Ventyx and patent litigation from last year and you exclude the restructuring from this year, we're actually going up about 10 basis points in margin.

For the second quarter of fiscal 2015 we generated good earnings that were achieved in the face of significant currency headwinds. In summary, we are reporting net earnings of $1.05 per diluted share, revenues of $759 million, down 2% in dollars but up 2% in constant currency, excellent cost control efforts that helped our gross and operating margins, double-digit Oncology orders growth in the Americas that largely offset declines in EMEA and APAC, challenges in our Imaging Components business with declines in orders in revenues and 2 big wins in our Proton business. 
Let's talk about each of the businesses in more detail starting with Oncology. Second quarter gross orders for Oncology Systems rose by 15% in North America and by nearly 10% in China, partially offsetting currency-related weakness across the bulk of the international market. Oncology gross orders totaled $581 million for the quarter, down 5% versus the year-ago quarter but equal to the year-ago quarter on a constant-currency basis. 
Looking at Oncology's 3 geographies. Gross orders in the Americas rose 12% in dollars and constant currency. Gross orders in EMEA declined 24% in dollars and 13% in constant currency principally due to weakness in Africa and India, where we had strong orders in the year-ago quarter and business tends to be lumpy. In APAC, gross orders fell by 15% in dollars and 8% in constant currency principally due to weakness in Japan. 
For the first half, Oncology gross orders growth rates were as follows: Worldwide, even in dollars and up 4% in constant currency; Americas, up 5% in both dollars and constant currency; EMEA, down 8% in dollars and up 1% in constant currency; and APAC, down 1% in dollars and up 5% in constant currency. 
Our strong order growth in North America during the quarter was highlighted by several large long-term deals. The largest of which was a project with HCA to equip its Sarah Cannon Cancer Center in Tennessee with 7 linear accelerators including 6 TrueBeam systems. This installation will also have our new RapidPlan and inside of analytics software using data analytics tools for treatment planning and information management. The HCA order is an example of the move toward consolidated networks making purchasing decisions aimed at standardizing clinical operations. The need for integrated clinical solutions drove many customer decisions during the quarter to replace competitive hardware and software products for multiple vendors in favor of a single Varian system. 
Clinical integration of treatment planning and delivery as well as information management for safe, efficient and effective workflow is a key Varian advantage. In Latin America, currency headwinds led to some purchasing delays that resulted in modest decline in orders. In EMEA, we had sizable wins in Germany, Bulgaria, Finland and in the U.K. Aspire Healthcare, one of the U.K.'s biggest private hospital chains, ordered 2 TrueBeams together with our full software suite for our plants in new radiotherapy and radiosurgery facility in Chelmsford, Essex. In APAC, weakness in Japan and Australia overshadowed our growth in China. In Japan, orders were flat in constant currency and down in dollars. The market remained sluggish. However, we gained share there during the quarter. Currency was also a culprit in Australia where a stronger dollar caused some customers to hold back on purchasing decisions. In China, we booked an $18 million order following a public tender by the People's Liberation Army. During the quarter, we also successfully launched the EDGE Radiosurgery System in front of more than 250 customers at the Annual China Med Exhibition in Beijing. China remains a healthy market for us. 
Order activity during the quarter was slow in other emerging markets including Brazil, India, Africa and Russia. Russia in particular remains very quiet. 
The long-term need for cancer treatment products remains high in developing markets where the number of diagnosed cases is rising and where radiation therapy is among the most cost-effective treatments. In past calls, we have talked about expanding our product portfolio to offer more to customers in global markets. 
Over the weekend, at the ESTRO show in Barcelona, Varian announced VitalBeam, a significant addition to our line of linear accelerators. VitalBeam leverages Varian's basic TrueBeam technology to provide clinics with new cost competitive options for delivering image-guided radiotherapy. It can be equipped with accessories including RapidArc, respiratory gating, onboard imaging and 80- or 120-leaf collimators. VitalBeam is a scalable and upgradable system that affordably meets the clinical needs of hospitals today and as they grow in the future. It's optimized for advanced radiotherapy. VitalBeam is targeted at the core radiotherapy market where it can serve as a workhorse in busy clinics. 
Customer interest at ESTRO was very high and we plan to make it available to customers in Europe first, while seeking clearances around the Rest of the World. CE Mark, FDA 510(k) and other international regulatory approvals have not yet been obtained. VitalBeam is currently not available for sale in any market. We will continue to invest in R&D to bring more products like VitalBeam to market. 
In March, we held our Annual Research Partners Symposium, a 2.5-day scientific meeting in Atlanta on the future of cancer care. It attracted 150 leading clinicians and research partners from 71 institutions in 15 countries. They shared ideas and presentations on their work with knowledge-based planning, data analytics, stereotactic radiosurgery and advanced imaging technology. It was an exciting meeting and we can see a clear path for the development of significant new treatment capabilities that would dramatically improve the speed and precision of radiotherapy and radiosurgery. The next steps will be every bit as exciting as IMRT, IGRT, SBRT, RapidArc, RapidPlan and TrueBeam. 
Let me turn now to our Imaging Components business. Gross orders for our Imaging Components fell by 24% to $156 million for the quarter and revenues fell by 8% to $155 million. Imaging Components had a tough comparison with very high panel orders in the year-ago quarter as a result of orders that slipped from the first to the second quarter last year. Additionally, orders in sales for tubes and panels were impacted by pricing pressures related to devaluations in the yen and the euro. 
Very strong dollar is causing some customers to reduce inventories in source or look elsewhere for lower-cost alternatives to our components. Orders in sales of our Security and Inspection Products also fell sharply in the quarter. Interest for these products have been delayed. And it appears that customers have already ordered most of what they need for the next few quarters as they work through the backlog. 
For the first half, orders for tubes and panels were up 6% and sales were flat. However, orders in sales for our Security products were down significantly. While we remain optimistic about the long-term growth prospects, we believe that this business will continue to face challenging conditions in the near term. 
The company's Other category, comprised of the Varian Particle Therapy business and the Ginzton Technology Center, recorded gross orders of $44 million and generated $14 million in revenue. It was a big quarter for our Proton business, we won a public tender and booked an order for a ProBeam installation at Aarhus in Denmark. In addition, Varian was announced as the preferred bidder for 2 Proton Therapy Centers that will be constructed in the United Kingdom over the next 2 years. The contracts for these projects are due to be signed during the summer and we expect to book the equipment portion of these orders at that time. With a strong backlog in the sales pipeline, we're starting to see some real momentum in our Particle Therapy business. 
Now I'll turn it over to Elisha."

Before I walk you through the P&L, let me touch on backlog. The company ended the quarter with a $3.1 billion backlog. Backlog adjustments during the quarter totaled $53 million, bringing net orders for the company to $729 million. The adjustment includes $12 million related to currency exchange rates. 
Second quarter revenues for the total company decreased 2% in dollars and increased 2% in constant currency. Total company revenues in the Americas were up 11% in dollars and up 12% in constant currency. EMEA revenues were down 1% in dollars but up 10% in constant currency. APAC revenues were down 25% in dollars and down 21% in constant currency. For the first half, total company revenues were flat in dollars and up 4% in constant currency. 
Oncology Systems posted a 2% decline in revenues during the quarter, bringing the revenue growth for the first half to 1%. Imaging Components posted a second quarter revenue decline of 8%, with small declines in our tubes and flat panel products and a 45% decline in our Security and Inspection Products. For the first half, Imaging Components revenues were down 3% from the year-ago period with gains in flat panels more than offset by declines in tubes as well as significant declines in Security and Inspection Products. Revenues for the Other category increased significantly from the year-ago quarter as we continued production and installation of several proton projects that are in our backlog. 
Total company gross margin for the quarter rose 30 basis points to 42.5% with increases in all of our businesses. Oncology Systems gross margin increased 18 basis points from the year-ago quarter to 43% as favorable product and geographic mix more than offset the negative currency impact on revenue. 
For the first half, Oncology's gross margin increased nearly 0.5% to 44.3%. The Imaging Components gross margin for the quarter increased by 216 basis points to 43.7% due largely to a higher mix of panel products, product cost reductions and improved quality cost. For the first half, Imaging Components gross margin increased nearly 1.5% to 42.9%. 
Second quarter SG&A expenses were $117 million or 15% of revenues, an improvement of 250 basis points as a percent of revenues from the year-ago quarter when we had a large patent litigation settlement. SG&A includes a $3 million charge during the quarter to complete the restructuring that was largely implemented last quarter. I think it's worth mentioning that SG&A expenses were down significantly from last quarter as the cost savings from the restructuring have started to flow through the P&L. 
Second quarter R&D expenses were $59 million or 8% of revenues even as a percentage of revenue with the year-ago quarter. And for the first half, R&D expenses were about even as a percentage of revenue at 8%. 
Moving down the income statement. Second quarter operating earnings totaled $146 million or 19% of revenues. Depreciation and amortization totaled $16 million for the quarter and $33 million for the first half. The effective tax rate at 28% was up 35 basis points from the year-ago period when we benefited from a patent litigation settlement. We now believe the tax rate for the full fiscal year will be 27% to 29%. 
Fully diluted shares outstanding decreased from the year-ago quarter to 101 million shares due largely to our ongoing repurchase program. Diluted earnings per share was $1.05 for the second quarter including the $0.02 restructuring charge. 
Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $862 million, debt of $513 million and stockholders' equity of $1.67 billion. DSO at 88 was improved 7 days from the year-ago quarter. 
Second quarter cash flow from operations was $53 million, less than net income, primarily due to working capital increases in inventory and accounts receivable. For the first half, cash flow from operations was $132 million. 
Primary uses of cash were $76 million toward the repurchase of about 825,000 shares of stock. At the end of the quarter, we had 3.9 million shares remaining under the existing repurchase authorization that extends through calendar year 2015. 
Now I'll turn it back to Dow for the outlook."

We believe that for fiscal year 2015, total company earnings will be in the range of $4.02 to $4.14 per diluted share and net revenues will increase by about 1% to 2% in dollars and by about 5% in constant currency. We now expect that challenges in our Imaging Components business and currency headwinds will more than offset the earnings momentum of the first half. We estimate that Imaging Components could negatively impact earnings by about $0.08 to $0.12 per diluted share. Additionally, since our guidance last quarter the strength of the dollar has diminished our earnings expectations by another $0.06 to $0.10 per diluted share. 
For the third quarter of fiscal 2015, we believe total company revenues should be about equal to the prior-year period in dollars and up about 4% in constant currency. Net earnings per diluted share for the third quarter could be in the range of $0.90 to $0.94 per diluted share. The outlook for the third quarter and full fiscal year 2015 excludes any impact of proton orders not yet booked into the backlog. 
Let me finish with a comment on the significant impact of the strong U.S. dollar. Since last October, when we first guided for fiscal year 2015, the strengthening of the dollar has cost us about $0.30 per diluted share not counting the competitive challenges that this has presented to our Imaging Components business. The good news is that we've managed to largely offset this in our operations. 
We are now ready for your questions."

Just as a reminder, the Americas was great, so gross orders were up 12% in the Americas. North America was up 14%, so that was terrific. EMEA, as I said, was down. When you look at year-to-date, year-to-date gross orders are up, constant currency 1% in EMEA. And the -- that feels okay. We'd obviously like to do better than that. We've been surprised by the strength in Western Europe. We've been weak in Eastern Europe, Russia. We had a weak Q2 in India and in Africa. So Africa tends to be -- Africa and India tend to be lumpy. I think the Russia, Eastern Europe impact is a political one. But I think we'll see India and Africa come back. And then we did have a tough comp for our EMEA organization where last year we had a very large Algeria order. In Asia, I mean, you heard the story a little bit. Year-to-date gross orders are up 5% in constant currency in Asia. In China, we were up 9%. So we still feel very good about where we are in China. The Japan market year-over-year, we think is down pretty substantially. There are some retrenchment going on in Japan. Market feels like it's down 30-ish-percent. Good news is, as I mentioned, we used to have a very strong performance in market share in Japan and it's nice to see that coming around. And then, of course, the other impact we have in Japan is the yen's off pretty substantially and hitting us there as well in Japan. So that's kind of a go around the globe. Elisha, would you add anything there?"

As I said, the really great thing about VitalBeam is it's built on the TrueBeam platform. So it gives our customers a ton of upgradability, they can scale up IMRT, IGRT, RapidArc, they can put a megavoltage imager on it or megavoltage and kilovoltage imager, they can go down market with an 80 multi leaf collimator, we haven't done that before. It's got a dose rate that's optimized radiation therapy at 1,400 monitor units. TrueBeam is still optimized from -- for SRT -- for SRS and SBRT. And so TrueBeam still has all the motion management, the 6 degree of freedom couch, the high-definition collimator flattening filter free and all of our triggered imaging capabilities. The difference between VitalBeam and UNIQUE, UNIQUE is built on our C-Series platform. It's a single energy system and it's really the entry-level product. So I don't think these -- we see this as really kind of between UNIQUE and TrueBeam and fulfilling a space where we can be more competitive. I think it kind of give us better price support of TrueBeam and it's not going to compete with the UNIQUE at all. And we still have the rest of the product line, the iX and the Trilogy to kind of fit in there as well. So we feel very good about the way this product lines up. And I guess, just kind of reiterate the point, I don't think there was -- I would like to say there were some impact from people waiting in these markets for VitalBeam. But I don't think so in this last quarter."

But I think the other thing that people are getting really excited about is the efficiency aspect of the product. And we had a paper presented at ESTRO last week where 1 institution was seeing 90 minute reduction in planning times. So that's per plan, that's huge. And all of a sudden, you start to get the same productivity and dose symmetry that we had. When we launched RapidPlan -- when we launch RapidArc, RapidArc was about productivity in the delivery room. Now we're talking about patient productivity and planning, 90 minutes, where do you get that kind of productivity? It's huge. And by the way, this is Varian-only thing. Research can't do this, and Elekta can't do this, Pinnacle can't do this. So we are really first to market with a terrific product, great quality and great efficiency."

But if I look at operating margin progression that's sort of implied by the guidance for the rest of the year, it does look like you're contemplating a very significant falloff in profitability in the third quarter and a big bounce back in 4Q.

And really, it's just when we look at the shippable backlog and what we expect to deliver in Q3, it is very significantly shifting to international and to emerging markets. So it's really reflected in the gross margin based on geography. We had the opposite effect in Q2 where we had a significant increase in North America deliveries. It's just the way the machines land. I would say in Q4, in the year-ago period, if you remember, we had strong orders in North America. So Q4 will be again more North American-focused. And so it's just the way it breaks down. I wouldn't read too much into quarter-to-quarter. But really just kind of looking at the year. And interestingly on the year, if you exclude all of Augmenix and the patent litigation from last year and you exclude the restructuring from this year, we're actually going up about 10 basis points in margin. So I look at that and say, apples-to-apples, we're doing a really good job on controlling costs and that the restructuring is starting to pay off.

I know that's a little complicated answer. But -- so there is an FX impact of $12 million in the quarter as well as we had a $10 million, $11 million outright cancellation of a tender for our Security and Inspection Products business.

For the second quarter of fiscal 2015 we generated good earnings that were achieved in the face of significant currency headwinds. In summary, we are reporting net earnings of $1.05 per diluted share, revenues of $759 million, down 2% in dollars but up 2% in constant currency, excellent cost control efforts that helped our gross and operating margins, double-digit Oncology orders growth in the Americas that largely offset declines in EMEA and APAC, challenges in our Imaging Components business with declines in orders in revenues and 2 big wins in our Proton business. 
Let's talk about each of the businesses in more detail starting with Oncology. Second quarter gross orders for Oncology Systems rose by 15% in North America and by nearly 10% in China, partially offsetting currency-related weakness across the bulk of the international market. Oncology gross orders totaled $581 million for the quarter, down 5% versus the year-ago quarter but equal to the year-ago quarter on a constant-currency basis. 
Looking at Oncology's 3 geographies. Gross orders in the Americas rose 12% in dollars and constant currency. Gross orders in EMEA declined 24% in dollars and 13% in constant currency principally due to weakness in Africa and India, where we had strong orders in the year-ago quarter and business tends to be lumpy. In APAC, gross orders fell by 15% in dollars and 8% in constant currency principally due to weakness in Japan. 
For the first half, Oncology gross orders growth rates were as follows: Worldwide, even in dollars and up 4% in constant currency; Americas, up 5% in both dollars and constant currency; EMEA, down 8% in dollars and up 1% in constant currency; and APAC, down 1% in dollars and up 5% in constant currency. 
Our strong order growth in North America during the quarter was highlighted by several large long-term deals. The largest of which was a project with HCA to equip its Sarah Cannon Cancer Center in Tennessee with 7 linear accelerators including 6 TrueBeam systems. This installation will also have our new RapidPlan and InSightive Analytics software using data analytics tools for treatment planning and information management. The HCA order is an example of the move toward consolidated networks making purchasing decisions aimed at standardizing clinical operations. The need for integrated clinical solutions drove many customer decisions during the quarter to replace competitive hardware and software products from multiple vendors in favor of a single Varian system. 
Clinical integration of treatment planning and delivery as well as information management for safe, efficient and effective workflow is a key Varian advantage. In Latin America, currency headwinds led to some purchasing delays that resulted in modest decline in orders. In EMEA, we had sizable wins in Germany, Bulgaria, Finland and in the U.K. Aspire Healthcare, one of the U.K.'s biggest private hospital chains, ordered 2 TrueBeams together with our full software suite for a planned new radiotherapy and radiosurgery facility in Chelmsford, Essex. In APAC, weakness in Japan and Australia overshadowed our growth in China. In Japan, orders were flat in constant currency and down in dollars. The market remained sluggish. However, we gained share there during the quarter. Currency was also a culprit in Australia where a stronger dollar caused some customers to hold back on purchasing decisions. In China, we booked an $18 million order following a public tender by the People's Liberation Army. During the quarter, we also successfully launched the EDGE Radiosurgery System in front of more than 250 customers at the Annual China Med Exhibition in Beijing. China remains a healthy market for us. 
Order activity during the quarter was slow in other emerging markets including Brazil, India, Africa and Russia. Russia in particular remains very quiet. 
The long-term need for cancer treatment products remains high in developing markets where the number of diagnosed cases is rising and where radiation therapy is among the most cost-effective treatments. In past calls, we have talked about expanding our product portfolio to offer more to customers in global markets. 
Over the weekend, at the ESTRO show in Barcelona, Varian announced VitalBeam, a significant addition to our line of linear accelerators. VitalBeam leverages Varian's basic TrueBeam technology to provide clinics with new cost competitive options for delivering image-guided radiotherapy. It can be equipped with accessories including RapidArc, respiratory gating, onboard imaging and 80- or 120-leaf collimators. VitalBeam is a scalable and upgradable system that affordably meets the clinical needs of hospitals today and as they grow in the future. It's optimized for advanced radiotherapy. VitalBeam is targeted at the core radiotherapy market where it can serve as a workhorse in busy clinics. 
Customer interest at ESTRO was very high and we plan to make it available to customers in Europe first, while seeking clearances around the Rest of the World. CE Mark, FDA 510(k) and other international regulatory approvals have not yet been obtained. VitalBeam is currently not available for sale in any market. We will continue to invest in R&D to bring more products like VitalBeam to market. 
In March, we held our Annual Research Partners Symposium, a 2.5-day scientific meeting in Atlanta on the future of cancer care. It attracted 150 leading clinicians and research partners from 71 institutions in 15 countries. They shared ideas and presentations on their work with knowledge-based planning, data analytics, stereotactic radiosurgery and advanced imaging technology. It was an exciting meeting and we can see a clear path for the development of significant new treatment capabilities that would dramatically improve the speed and precision of radiotherapy and radiosurgery. The next steps will be every bit as exciting as IMRT, IGRT, SBRT, RapidArc, RapidPlan and TrueBeam. 
Let me turn now to our Imaging Components business. Gross orders for our Imaging Components fell by 24% to $156 million for the quarter and revenues fell by 8% to $155 million. Imaging Components had a tough comparison with very high panel orders in the year-ago quarter as a result of orders that slipped from the first to the second quarter last year. Additionally, orders and sales for tubes and panels were impacted by pricing pressures related to devaluations in the yen and the euro. 
Very strong dollar is causing some customers to reduce inventories in source or look elsewhere for lower-cost alternatives to our components. 
Orders and sales of our Security and Inspection Products also fell sharply in the quarter. Tenders for these products have been delayed. And it appears that customers have already ordered most of what they need for the next few quarters as they work through the backlog. 
For the first half, orders for tubes and panels were up 6% and sales were flat. However, orders in sales for our Security products were down significantly. While we remain optimistic about the long-term growth prospects, we believe that this business will continue to face challenging conditions in the near term. 
The company's Other category, comprised of the Varian Particle Therapy business and the Ginzton Technology Center, recorded gross orders of $44 million and generated $14 million in revenue. It was a big quarter for our Proton business, we won a public tender and booked an order for a ProBeam installation at Aarhus in Denmark. In addition, Varian was announced as the preferred bidder for 2 Proton Therapy Centers that will be constructed in the United Kingdom over the next 2 years. The contracts for these projects are due to be signed during the summer and we expect to book the equipment portion of these orders at that time. With a strong backlog in the sales pipeline, we're starting to see some real momentum in our Particle Therapy business. 
Now I'll turn it over to Elisha."

Before I walk you through the P&L, let me touch on backlog. The company ended the quarter with a $3.1 billion backlog. Backlog adjustments during the quarter totaled $53 million, bringing net orders for the company to $729 million. The adjustment includes $12 million related to currency exchange rates. 
Second quarter revenues for the total company decreased 2% in dollars and increased 2% in constant currency. Total company revenues in the Americas were up 11% in dollars and up 12% in constant currency. EMEA revenues were down 1% in dollars but up 10% in constant currency. APAC revenues were down 25% in dollars and down 21% in constant currency. For the first half, total company revenues were flat in dollars and up 4% in constant currency. 
Oncology Systems posted a 2% decline in revenues during the quarter, bringing the revenue growth for the first half to 1%. Imaging Components posted a second quarter revenue decline of 8%, with small declines in our tubes and flat panel products and a 45% decline in our Security and Inspection Products. For the first half, Imaging Components revenues were down 3% from the year-ago period with gains in flat panels more than offset by declines in tubes as well as significant declines in Security and Inspection Products. Revenues for the Other category increased significantly from the year-ago quarter as we continued production and installation of several proton projects that are in our backlog. 
Total company gross margin for the quarter rose 30 basis points to 42.5% with increases in all of our businesses. Oncology Systems gross margin increased 18 basis points from the year-ago quarter to 43% as favorable product and geographic mix more than offset the negative currency impact on revenue. 
For the first half, Oncology's gross margin increased nearly 0.5% to 44.3%. The Imaging Components gross margin for the quarter increased by 216 basis points to 43.7% due largely to a higher mix of panel products, product cost reductions and improved quality cost. For the first half, Imaging Components gross margin increased nearly 1.5% to 42.9%. 
Second quarter SG&A expenses were $117 million or 15% of revenues, an improvement of 250 basis points as a percent of revenues from the year-ago quarter when we had a large patent litigation settlement. SG&A includes a $3 million charge during the quarter to complete the restructuring that was largely implemented last quarter. I think it's worth mentioning that SG&A expenses were down significantly from last quarter as the cost savings from the restructuring have started to flow through the P&L. 
Second quarter R&D expenses were $59 million or 8% of revenues even as a percentage of revenue with the year-ago quarter. And for the first half, R&D expenses were about even as a percentage of revenue at 8%. 
Moving down the income statement. Second quarter operating earnings totaled $146 million or 19% of revenues. Depreciation and amortization totaled $16 million for the quarter and $33 million for the first half. The effective tax rate at 28% was up 35 basis points from the year-ago period when we benefited from a patent litigation settlement. We now believe the tax rate for the full fiscal year will be 27% to 29%. 
Fully diluted shares outstanding decreased from the year-ago quarter to 101 million shares due largely to our ongoing repurchase program. Diluted earnings per share was $1.05 for the second quarter including the $0.02 restructuring charge. 
Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $862 million, debt of $513 million and stockholders' equity of $1.67 billion. DSO at 88 was improved 7 days from the year-ago quarter. 
Second quarter cash flow from operations was $53 million, less than net income, primarily due to working capital increases in inventory and accounts receivable. For the first half, cash flow from operations was $132 million. 
Primary uses of cash were $76 million toward the repurchase of about 825,000 shares of stock. At the end of the quarter, we had 3.9 million shares remaining under the existing repurchase authorization that extends through calendar year 2015. 
Now I'll turn it back to Dow for the outlook."

We believe that for fiscal year 2015, total company earnings will be in the range of $4.02 to $4.14 per diluted share and net revenues will increase by about 1% to 2% in dollars and by about 5% in constant currency. We now expect that challenges in our Imaging Components business and currency headwinds will more than offset the earnings momentum of the first half. We estimate that Imaging Components could negatively impact earnings by about $0.08 to $0.12 per diluted share. Additionally, since our guidance last quarter the strength of the dollar has diminished our earnings expectations by another $0.06 to $0.10 per diluted share. 
For the third quarter of fiscal 2015, we believe total company revenues should be about equal to the prior-year period in dollars and up about 4% in constant currency. Net earnings per diluted share for the third quarter could be in the range of $0.90 to $0.94 per diluted share. The outlook for the third quarter and full fiscal year 2015 excludes any impact of proton orders not yet booked into the backlog. 
Let me finish with a comment on the significant impact of the strong U.S. dollar. Since last October, when we first guided for fiscal year 2015, the strengthening of the dollar has cost us about $0.30 per diluted share not counting the competitive challenges that this has presented to our Imaging Components business. The good news is that we've managed to largely offset this in our operations. 
We are now ready for your questions."

Just as a reminder, the Americas was great, so gross orders were up 12% in the Americas. North America was up 14%, so that was terrific. EMEA, as I said, was down. When you look at year-to-date, year-to-date gross orders are up, constant currency 1% in EMEA. And the -- that feels okay. We'd obviously like to do better than that. We've been surprised by the strength in Western Europe. We've been weak in Eastern Europe, Russia. We had a weak Q2 in India and in Africa. So Africa tends to be -- Africa and India tend to be lumpy. I think the Russia, Eastern Europe impact is a political one. But I think we'll see India and Africa come back. And then we did have a tough comp for our EMEA organization where last year we had a very large Algeria order. In Asia, I mean, you heard the story a little bit. Year-to-date gross orders are up 5% in constant currency in Asia. In China, we were up 9%. So we still feel very good about where we are in China. The Japan market year-over-year, we think is down pretty substantially. There are some retrenchment going on in Japan. Market feels like it's down 30-ish-percent. Good news is, as I mentioned, we just had a very strong performance in market share in Japan and it's nice to see that coming around. And then, of course, the other impact we have in Japan is the yen's off pretty substantially and hitting us there as well in Japan. So that's kind of a go around the globe. Elisha, would you add anything there?"

As I said, the really great thing about VitalBeam is it's built on the TrueBeam platform. So it gives our customers a ton of upgradability, they can scale up IMRT, IGRT, RapidArc, they can put a megavoltage imager on it or megavoltage and kilovoltage imager, they can go down market with an 80 multi leaf collimator, we haven't done that before. It's got a dose rate that's optimized radiation therapy at 1,400 monitor units. TrueBeam is still optimized from -- for SRT -- for SRS and SBRT. And so TrueBeam still has all the motion management, the 6 degree of freedom couch, the high-definition collimator flattening filter free and all of our triggered imaging capabilities. The difference between VitalBeam and UNIQUE, UNIQUE is built on our C-Series platform. It's a single energy system and it's really the entry-level product. So I don't think these -- we see this as really kind of between UNIQUE and TrueBeam and fulfilling a space where we can be more competitive. I think it kind of give us better price support of TrueBeam and it's not going to compete with the UNIQUE at all. And we still have the rest of the product line, the iX and the Trilogy to kind of fit in there as well. So we feel very good about the way this product lines up. And I guess, just to kind of reiterate the point, I don't think there was -- I would like to say there were some impact from people waiting in these markets for VitalBeam. But I don't think so in this last quarter."

But I think the other thing that people are getting really excited about is the efficiency aspect of the product. And we had a paper presented at ESTRO last week where 1 institution was seeing 90 minute reduction in planning times. So that's per plan, that's huge. And all of a sudden, you start to get the same productivity and dosimetry that we had. When we launched RapidPlan -- when we launched RapidArc, RapidArc was about productivity in the delivery room. Now we're talking about patient productivity and planning, 90 minutes, where do you get that kind of productivity? It's huge. And by the way, this is Varian-only thing. RaySearch can't do this, and Elekta can't do this, Pinnacle can't do this. So we are really first to market with a terrific product, great quality and great efficiency."

But if I look at operating margin progression that's sort of implied by the guidance for the rest of the year, it does look like you're contemplating a very significant falloff in profitability in the third quarter and a big bounce back in 4Q.

And really, it's just when we look at the shippable backlog and what we expect to deliver in Q3, it is very significantly shifting to international and to emerging markets. So it's really reflected in the gross margin based on geography. We had the opposite effect in Q2 where we had a significant increase in North America deliveries. It's just the way the machines land. I would say in Q4, in the year-ago period, if you remember, we had strong orders in North America. So Q4 will be again more North American-focused. And so it's just the way it breaks down. I wouldn't read too much into quarter-to-quarter. But really just kind of looking at the year. And interestingly on the year, if you exclude all of Augmenix and the patent litigation from last year and you exclude the restructuring from this year, we're actually going up about 10 basis points in margin. So I look at that and say, apples-to-apples, we're doing a really good job on controlling costs and that the restructuring is starting to pay off.

I know that's a little complicated answer. But -- so there is an FX impact of $12 million in the quarter as well as we had a $10 million, $11 million outright cancellation of a tender for our Security and Inspection Products business.

For the second quarter of fiscal 2015 we generated good earnings that were achieved in the face of significant currency headwinds. In summary, we are reporting net earnings of $1.05 per diluted share, revenues of $759 million, down 2% in dollars but up 2% in constant currency, excellent cost control efforts that helped our gross and operating margins, double-digit Oncology orders growth in the Americas that largely offset declines in EMEA and APAC, challenges in our Imaging Components business with declines in orders in revenues and 2 big wins in our Proton business. 
Let's talk about each of the businesses in more detail starting with Oncology. Second quarter gross orders for Oncology Systems rose by 15% in North America and by nearly 10% in China, partially offsetting currency-related weakness across the bulk of the international market. Oncology gross orders totaled $581 million for the quarter, down 5% versus the year-ago quarter but equal to the year-ago quarter on a constant-currency basis. 
Looking at Oncology's 3 geographies. Gross orders in the Americas rose 12% in dollars and constant currency. Gross orders in EMEA declined 24% in dollars and 13% in constant currency principally due to weakness in Africa and India, where we had strong orders in the year-ago quarter and business tends to be lumpy. In APAC, gross orders fell by 15% in dollars and 8% in constant currency principally due to weakness in Japan. 
For the first half, Oncology gross orders growth rates were as follows: Worldwide, even in dollars and up 4% in constant currency; Americas, up 5% in both dollars and constant currency; EMEA, down 8% in dollars and up 1% in constant currency; and APAC, down 1% in dollars and up 5% in constant currency. 
Our strong order growth in North America during the quarter was highlighted by several large long-term deals. The largest of which was a project with HCA to equip its Sarah Cannon Cancer Center in Tennessee with 7 linear accelerators including 6 TrueBeam systems. This installation will also have our new RapidPlan and InSightive Analytics software using data analytics tools for treatment planning and information management. The HCA order is an example of the move toward consolidated networks making purchasing decisions aimed at standardizing clinical operations. The need for integrated clinical solutions drove many customer decisions during the quarter to replace competitive hardware and software products from multiple vendors in favor of a single Varian system. 
Clinical integration of treatment planning and delivery as well as information management for safe, efficient and effective workflow is a key Varian advantage. In Latin America, currency headwinds led to some purchasing delays that resulted in modest decline in orders. In EMEA, we had sizable wins in Germany, Bulgaria, Finland and in the U.K. Aspire Healthcare, one of the U.K.'s biggest private hospital chains, ordered 2 TrueBeams together with our full software suite for a planned new radiotherapy and radiosurgery facility in Chelmsford, Essex. In APAC, weakness in Japan and Australia overshadowed our growth in China. In Japan, orders were flat in constant currency and down in dollars. The market remained sluggish. However, we gained share there during the quarter. Currency was also a culprit in Australia where a stronger dollar caused some customers to hold back on purchasing decisions. In China, we booked an $18 million order following a public tender by the People's Liberation Army. During the quarter, we also successfully launched the EDGE Radiosurgery System in front of more than 250 customers at the Annual China Med Exhibition in Beijing. China remains a healthy market for us. 
Order activity during the quarter was slow in other emerging markets including Brazil, India, Africa and Russia. Russia in particular remains very quiet. 
The long-term need for cancer treatment products remains high in developing markets where the number of diagnosed cases is rising and where radiation therapy is among the most cost-effective treatments. In past calls, we have talked about expanding our product portfolio to offer more to customers in global markets. 
Over the weekend, at the ESTRO show in Barcelona, Varian announced VitalBeam, a significant addition to our line of linear accelerators. VitalBeam leverages Varian's basic TrueBeam technology to provide clinics with new cost competitive options for delivering image-guided radiotherapy. It can be equipped with accessories including RapidArc, respiratory gating, onboard imaging and 80- or 120-leaf collimators. VitalBeam is a scalable and upgradable system that affordably meets the clinical needs of hospitals today and as they grow in the future. It's optimized for advanced radiotherapy. VitalBeam is targeted at the core radiotherapy market where it can serve as a workhorse in busy clinics. 
Customer interest at ESTRO was very high and we plan to make it available to customers in Europe first, while seeking clearances around the Rest of the World. CE Mark, FDA 510(k) and other international regulatory approvals have not yet been obtained. VitalBeam is currently not available for sale in any market. We will continue to invest in R&D to bring more products like VitalBeam to market. 
In March, we held our Annual Research Partners Symposium, a 2.5-day scientific meeting in Atlanta on the future of cancer care. It attracted 150 leading clinicians and research partners from 71 institutions in 15 countries. They shared ideas and presentations on their work with knowledge-based planning, data analytics, stereotactic radiosurgery and advanced imaging technology. It was an exciting meeting and we can see a clear path for the development of significant new treatment capabilities that would dramatically improve the speed and precision of radiotherapy and radiosurgery. The next steps will be every bit as exciting as IMRT, IGRT, SBRT, RapidArc, RapidPlan and TrueBeam. 
Let me turn now to our Imaging Components business. Gross orders for our Imaging Components fell by 24% to $156 million for the quarter and revenues fell by 8% to $155 million. Imaging Components had a tough comparison with very high panel orders in the year-ago quarter as a result of orders that slipped from the first to the second quarter last year. Additionally, orders and sales for tubes and panels were impacted by pricing pressures related to devaluations in the yen and the euro. 
Very strong dollar is causing some customers to reduce inventories in source or look elsewhere for lower-cost alternatives to our components. 
Orders and sales of our Security and Inspection Products also fell sharply in the quarter. Tenders for these products have been delayed. And it appears that customers have already ordered most of what they need for the next few quarters as they work through the backlog. 
For the first half, orders for tubes and panels were up 6% and sales were flat. However, orders in sales for our Security products were down significantly. While we remain optimistic about the long-term growth prospects, we believe that this business will continue to face challenging conditions in the near term. 
The company's Other category, comprised of the Varian Particle Therapy business and the Ginzton Technology Center, recorded gross orders of $44 million and generated $14 million in revenue. It was a big quarter for our Proton business, we won a public tender and booked an order for a ProBeam installation at Aarhus in Denmark. In addition, Varian was announced as the preferred bidder for 2 Proton Therapy Centers that will be constructed in the United Kingdom over the next 2 years. The contracts for these projects are due to be signed during the summer and we expect to book the equipment portion of these orders at that time. With a strong backlog in the sales pipeline, we're starting to see some real momentum in our Particle Therapy business. 
Now I'll turn it over to Elisha."

Before I walk you through the P&L, let me touch on backlog. The company ended the quarter with a $3.1 billion backlog. Backlog adjustments during the quarter totaled $53 million, bringing net orders for the company to $729 million. The adjustment includes $12 million related to currency exchange rates. 
Second quarter revenues for the total company decreased 2% in dollars and increased 2% in constant currency. Total company revenues in the Americas were up 11% in dollars and up 12% in constant currency. EMEA revenues were down 1% in dollars but up 10% in constant currency. APAC revenues were down 25% in dollars and down 21% in constant currency. For the first half, total company revenues were flat in dollars and up 4% in constant currency. 
Oncology Systems posted a 2% decline in revenues during the quarter, bringing the revenue growth for the first half to 1%. Imaging Components posted a second quarter revenue decline of 8%, with small declines in our tubes and flat panel products and a 45% decline in our Security and Inspection Products. For the first half, Imaging Components revenues were down 3% from the year-ago period with gains in flat panels more than offset by declines in tubes as well as significant declines in Security and Inspection Products. Revenues for the Other category increased significantly from the year-ago quarter as we continued production and installation of several proton projects that are in our backlog. 
Total company gross margin for the quarter rose 30 basis points to 42.5% with increases in all of our businesses. Oncology Systems gross margin increased 18 basis points from the year-ago quarter to 43% as favorable product and geographic mix more than offset the negative currency impact on revenue. 
For the first half, Oncology's gross margin increased nearly 0.5% to 44.3%. The Imaging Components gross margin for the quarter increased by 216 basis points to 43.7% due largely to a higher mix of panel products, product cost reductions and improved quality cost. For the first half, Imaging Components gross margin increased nearly 1.5% to 42.9%. 
Second quarter SG&A expenses were $117 million or 15% of revenues, an improvement of 250 basis points as a percent of revenues from the year-ago quarter when we had a large patent litigation settlement. SG&A includes a $3 million charge during the quarter to complete the restructuring that was largely implemented last quarter. I think it's worth mentioning that SG&A expenses were down significantly from last quarter as the cost savings from the restructuring have started to flow through the P&L. 
Second quarter R&D expenses were $59 million or 8% of revenues even as a percentage of revenue with the year-ago quarter. And for the first half, R&D expenses were about even as a percentage of revenue at 8%. 
Moving down the income statement. Second quarter operating earnings totaled $146 million or 19% of revenues. Depreciation and amortization totaled $16 million for the quarter and $33 million for the first half. The effective tax rate at 28% was up 35 basis points from the year-ago period when we benefited from a patent litigation settlement. We now believe the tax rate for the full fiscal year will be 27% to 29%. 
Fully diluted shares outstanding decreased from the year-ago quarter to 101 million shares due largely to our ongoing repurchase program. Diluted earnings per share was $1.05 for the second quarter including the $0.02 restructuring charge. 
Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $862 million, debt of $513 million and stockholders' equity of $1.67 billion. DSO at 88 was improved 7 days from the year-ago quarter. 
Second quarter cash flow from operations was $53 million, less than net income, primarily due to working capital increases in inventory and accounts receivable. For the first half, cash flow from operations was $132 million. 
Primary uses of cash were $76 million toward the repurchase of about 825,000 shares of stock. At the end of the quarter, we had 3.9 million shares remaining under the existing repurchase authorization that extends through calendar year 2015. 
Now I'll turn it back to Dow for the outlook."

We believe that for fiscal year 2015, total company earnings will be in the range of $4.02 to $4.14 per diluted share and net revenues will increase by about 1% to 2% in dollars and by about 5% in constant currency. We now expect that challenges in our Imaging Components business and currency headwinds will more than offset the earnings momentum of the first half. We estimate that Imaging Components could negatively impact earnings by about $0.08 to $0.12 per diluted share. Additionally, since our guidance last quarter the strength of the dollar has diminished our earnings expectations by another $0.06 to $0.10 per diluted share. 
For the third quarter of fiscal 2015, we believe total company revenues should be about equal to the prior-year period in dollars and up about 4% in constant currency. Net earnings per diluted share for the third quarter could be in the range of $0.90 to $0.94 per diluted share. The outlook for the third quarter and full fiscal year 2015 excludes any impact of proton orders not yet booked into the backlog. 
Let me finish with a comment on the significant impact of the strong U.S. dollar. Since last October, when we first guided for fiscal year 2015, the strengthening of the dollar has cost us about $0.30 per diluted share not counting the competitive challenges that this has presented to our Imaging Components business. The good news is that we've managed to largely offset this in our operations. 
We are now ready for your questions."

Just as a reminder, the Americas was great, so gross orders were up 12% in the Americas. North America was up 14%, so that was terrific. EMEA, as I said, was down. When you look at year-to-date, year-to-date gross orders are up, constant currency 1% in EMEA. And the -- that feels okay. We'd obviously like to do better than that. We've been surprised by the strength in Western Europe. We've been weak in Eastern Europe, Russia. We had a weak Q2 in India and in Africa. So Africa tends to be -- Africa and India tend to be lumpy. I think the Russia, Eastern Europe impact is a political one. But I think we'll see India and Africa come back. And then we did have a tough comp for our EMEA organization where last year we had a very large Algeria order. In Asia, I mean, you heard the story a little bit. Year-to-date gross orders are up 5% in constant currency in Asia. In China, we were up 9%. So we still feel very good about where we are in China. The Japan market year-over-year, we think is down pretty substantially. There are some retrenchment going on in Japan. Market feels like it's down 30-ish-percent. Good news is, as I mentioned, we just had a very strong performance in market share in Japan and it's nice to see that coming around. And then, of course, the other impact we have in Japan is the yen's off pretty substantially and hitting us there as well in Japan. So that's kind of a go around the globe. Elisha, would you add anything there?"

As I said, the really great thing about VitalBeam is it's built on the TrueBeam platform. So it gives our customers a ton of upgradability, they can scale up IMRT, IGRT, RapidArc, they can put a megavoltage imager on it or megavoltage and kilovoltage imager, they can go down market with an 80 multi leaf collimator, we haven't done that before. It's got a dose rate that's optimized radiation therapy at 1,400 monitor units. TrueBeam is still optimized from -- for SRT -- for SRS and SBRT. And so TrueBeam still has all the motion management, the 6 degree of freedom couch, the high-definition collimator flattening filter free and all of our triggered imaging capabilities. The difference between VitalBeam and UNIQUE, UNIQUE is built on our C-Series platform. It's a single energy system and it's really the entry-level product. So I don't think these -- we see this as really kind of between UNIQUE and TrueBeam and fulfilling a space where we can be more competitive. I think it kind of give us better price support of TrueBeam and it's not going to compete with the UNIQUE at all. And we still have the rest of the product line, the iX and the Trilogy to kind of fit in there as well. So we feel very good about the way this product lines up. And I guess, just to kind of reiterate the point, I don't think there was -- I would like to say there were some impact from people waiting in these markets for VitalBeam. But I don't think so in this last quarter."

But I think the other thing that people are getting really excited about is the efficiency aspect of the product. And we had a paper presented at ESTRO last week where 1 institution was seeing 90 minute reduction in planning times. So that's per plan, that's huge. And all of a sudden, you start to get the same productivity and dosimetry that we had. When we launched RapidPlan -- when we launched RapidArc, RapidArc was about productivity in the delivery room. Now we're talking about patient productivity and planning, 90 minutes, where do you get that kind of productivity? It's huge. And by the way, this is Varian-only thing. RaySearch can't do this, and Elekta can't do this, Pinnacle can't do this. So we are really first to market with a terrific product, great quality and great efficiency."

But if I look at operating margin progression that's sort of implied by the guidance for the rest of the year, it does look like you're contemplating a very significant falloff in profitability in the third quarter and a big bounce back in 4Q. And while I understand revenue volumes have something to do with the overall profitability, you would still be down materially on operating margins year-over-year in the third quarter despite relatively flat revenue.

I would say in Q4, in the year-ago period, if you remember, we had strong orders in North America. So Q4 will be again more North American-focused. And so it's just the way it breaks down. I wouldn't read too much into quarter-to-quarter. But really just kind of looking at the year. And interestingly on the year, if you exclude all of Augmenix and the patent litigation from last year and you exclude the restructuring from this year, we're actually going up about 10 basis points in margin. So I look at that and say, apples-to-apples, we're doing a really good job on controlling costs and that the restructuring is starting to pay off.

I know that's a little complicated answer. But -- so there is an FX impact of $12 million in the quarter as well as we had a $10 million, $11 million outright cancellation of a tender for our Security and Inspection Products business.

The third quarter was mixed with strong constant currency growth in Oncology Systems gross orders, significant challenges in Imaging Components and a strong performance in Particle Therapy.
In summary, we are reporting net earnings of $1.13 per diluted share; revenues of $784 million, up 5% in dollars and 11% in constant currency; Oncology gross orders of $635 million, up 2% in dollars and 10% in constant currency; significant declines in orders and revenues for Imaging Components business; a big negative quarter-over-quarter impact from a strong U.S. dollar; and the booking 2 more multi-room proton orders, as well as significant revenue from the Maryland installation.
Turning to the operational highlights. Oncology gross orders totaled $635 million for the quarter, up 2% and 10% in constant currency. In the Americas, gross orders were up 4%, both in dollars and constant currency. In EMEA, gross orders were down 2%, but up 13% in constant currency. In APAC, orders rose 8% and were up 21% in constant currency.
We're really pleased with the constant currency growth in this business, let me give you some color on each of the geographies.
Latin America drove the orders growth in the Americas offsetting a 2% decline in North America. Year-to-date, our orders were up 3% in North America and we believe we've gained market share. In North America, we booked a $4 million of a $25 million long-term order from Innova Healthcare which is standardizing on their equipment, software and services across this network. We also achieved nearly $30 million of competitive takeouts in North America during the quarter, replacing the 7 Siemens machines, as well as 20 installations of software from competitors.
Clinics in North America and around the world are seeking to standardize on fully integrated cost-efficient treatment systems, this is a Varian strength.
Strong demand in Brazil, Argentina and Colombia drove an 82% order increase across Latin America. In EMEA, we booked our largest-ever order in Spain for $21 million to supply 10 linear accelerators, including 3 TrueBeam systems to 5 hospitals in Galatia. This order also includes Varian full suite of planning and oncology information management software.
Healthy demand in the U.K., Sweden and Italy, as well as in Germany where we are recapturing share added to the growth in EMEA.
We completed operational setup of a new strategic operating entity in Saudi Arabia to better support cancer patients and the medical community in the Middle East. Aramco in Saudi Arabia placed an $8 million during the quarter for advanced treatment systems.
India also made a strong contribution during the quarter, ordering 2 of our top line Edge radiosurgery systems. As you may have seen in an earlier press release, we showed a hospital in Hyderabad has just treated its 10,000th patient with RapidArc. This is quite an achievement and we're pleased to see our fast and efficient systems making cancer care more affordable and accessible patients around the world.
Our new VitalBeam product has now received FDA 510(k) and CE Mark approvals making it marketable in many territories. We received our first VitalBeam order in India, and we expect this affordable and upgradable linear accelerator for radiotherapy to be a winner, particularly in emerging markets. Overall, EMEA remained healthy market with year-to-date constant currency orders growth of 6%.
In APAC, China again led the way during the quarter, with healthy growth in orders, including for the first 2 EDGE radiosurgery systems. Stereotactic body radiotherapy was a big topic of discussion at our recent Users Meeting in Beijing, which attracted about 550 customers.
Australia also contributed to the growth in APAC when Radiation Oncology Queensland placed in order to install TrueBeam system and software at 5 sites.
In Japan, we saw some promising development of orders through 6 TrueBeam and service that led to strong constant currency growth. We also announced the software alliance of Flatiron Health to develop the next-generation of cloud-based informatics products, leveraging Varian's expertise in radiation oncology and Flatiron's expertise in medical oncology. The alliance will deliver software for fully integrated powerful cloud-based oncology information product suite.
Our Oncology service business grew orders by 8% during the quarter, and represented 42% of Oncology Systems orders for the period. We remain on track to the $1 billion service milestone this year, notwithstanding currency headwinds.
Subsequent to the close of the quarter, CMS published its proposals for 2016 Medicare reimbursement rates in the U.S. Under the proposal hospitals, which represent 90% of the U.S. market for equipment, would receive a nearly 2% increase in reimbursement overall for radiation oncology services. In freestanding clinics, CMS is proposing an overall reduction of 9% for technical fees and a 2% reduction for physician fees. The impact of these proposed cuts will vary depending upon the mix of patients and treatment protocols.
We're partnering with Radiation Oncology to express our concern about the impact of CMS proposals on our customers and patients access to cancer care.
Let me turn now to Imaging Components, which experienced another challenging quarter. Gross orders for Imaging Components fell by 25% to $122 million for the quarter, and revenue strength by 17% to $135 million. Security and Inspection Products revenues fell sharply during the quarter, as the market for border protection systems has slowed significantly. End customers, particularly in oil-based economies and war zones like Iraq, are not moving forward with system deployments or tenders. Additionally, customer had put significant pressure on pricing from their suppliers. We expect annual revenues for this business to be [indiscernible] as the previous year by about $35 million.
For Security and Inspection Products, the fourth quarter also be challenging because of a very tough orders comp with the prior year period.
Severe pricing pressure and a product mix shift caused a significant decline in panel orders during the quarter. Year-to-date orders for the Panel business were up 2% and revenues were down 6%. Competition in the radiographic portion of the panel market has intensified and put dollar-based products at a disadvantage. We are faced with a challenge of developing new products to meet tougher cost and performance expectations.
A bright spot for our Panel business is the recent House of Representatives passage of the 21st century cures legislation that contained a provision supported by Varian to incentivize the transition to digital radiography. This bill increases reimbursement for digital radiography while cutting rates for older, less efficient technologies. It is now moved to the Senate and we're hopeful that it sets the stage for more robust panel business in the future.
Revenues in our 2 business have been relatively flat as improvements in product quality and tube life have softened demand for replacement tubes. While currency does not have a direct impact on the performance of the Imaging Components business, it is having a dramatic effect on customer behavior in all product lines. Customers are actively looking for lower-cost alternatives to dollar based products. In the short-term, we are managing this business to maintain our market share. Over the long-term, we're stepping up our imaging investments, including R&D, to enhance our competitiveness.
Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we announced an agreement to acquire Claymount, a privately held Netherlands-based supplier of components and subsystems for X-ray imaging equipment manufacturers. Claymount is one of the world's leading suppliers of X-ray Imaging Components, including high-voltage connectors, generators and dose control mechanisms used in medical X-ray imaging. With annual revenues of about EUR 30 million, the company's a supplier to many global medical X-ray equipment manufacturers. This should give us good cross-selling opportunities and offer the added benefit of providing Varian's various other businesses and internal source of lower-cost components. Claymount's products complemented diversify our X-ray product offering, this will further expand Varian's portfolio components and subsystems that would enable X-ray OEMs to get their products to market faster and more efficiently.
The company's Other category comprised of Varian Particle Therapy business and the Ginzton Technology Center, recorded gross orders of $131 million and generated $91 million in revenue. This was an outstanding quarter for our Particle Therapy business with a significant level of activity.
We booked a Maryland deal, which resulted in a first profitable quarter ever for this business. We also booked an order for a forum system in the Netherlands.
Subsequent to the close of the quarter, we finalized $115 million in contracts to equip and service a 5-room center in Manhattan, a first proton facility in the New York State. Also we finalized the 2 previously announced contracts in the U.K.
With 3 centers treating patients using Varian equipment and 11 more projects in backlog, we're now seeing some real momentum in this business.
Now I'll turn it over to Elisha."

The company ended the quarter with a $3.1 billion backlog, up 9% from the year-ago quarter. Backlog adjustments during the quarter, totaled $60 million, bringing net orders for the company to $828 million. The backlog adjustment includes $17 million related to currency impacts and a $812 million from the cancellation of an oncology order in Ukraine.
Third quarter revenues for the total company increased 5% in dollars and 11% in constant currency. Total company revenues in the Americas were up 6% in both dollars and also currency. EMEA revenues were down 1% in dollar and up 12% in constant currency. APAC revenues were up 11% in dollars and up 20% in constant currency.
Year-to-date, total company revenues were up 2% in dollars and up 6% in constant currency.
Oncology Systems posted a 30% decline in revenues during the quarter, bringing the revenue decline year-to-date to 1% in dollars. The vast majority of the FX impact occurred in our Oncology business were constant currency revenues were up mid-single digits for the quarter and year-to-date.
Imaging Components posted a third quarter revenue decline of 17% with significant declines in our flat panel and Security and Inspection Products and a slight decline in our tubes products. Year-to-date, Imaging Components revenues were down 7% from the year-ago period, with slight declines in tubes, mid-single-digit declines in panels and a nearly 30% decline in Security and Inspection Products. As a reminder, Imaging Components sells primarily in U.S. dollars.
Revenues for the Other category increased significantly from the year-ago quarter as we recorded nearly $80 million related to the University of Maryland proton project.
Total company gross margin for the quarter fell by approximately 3 points to 40%. Let me walk you through this. Oncology Systems gross margin decreased by about 2 percentage points from the year-ago quarter to 41.9% due to an unfavorable and expected significant shift to lower margin geographies and negative currency impacts. Year-to-date, Oncology's gross margin decreased 41 basis points to 43.5% due largely to currency.
The Imaging Components gross margin for the quarter fell by more than 3 percentage points to 38.9% due to steep declines in revenues from our panel and Security and Inspection Products. Year-to-date, Imaging Components gross margin was equal to the year-ago period at 41.7% due to product cost reductions and improved quality cost, but offset pricing pressure.
The Other category, including our Proton business, which benefited from a weaker Euro, had a 31% gross margin in the quarter due largely to the Maryland Proton Treatment Center. While the margin performance was terrific for this business, the higher proportion of proton revenues was dilutive to the overall gross margin for the company.
Third quarter SG&A expenses were $111 million or 14% of revenue, an improvement at 2.5 percentage points from the year-ago quarter when we booked an $8 million charge for the impairment of a portion of the company's investment in Augmenix. On an apples-to-apples basis, excluding the impairment in the year-ago period, SG&A as a percentage of revenue improved 1.5 percentage points from the year-ago quarter.
Third quarter R&D expenses were $60 million or 8% of revenues, equal as a percentage of revenue with the year-ago quarter.
Moving down the income statement. Third quarter operating earnings totaled $144 million or 18.4% of revenues. Depreciation and amortization totaled $17[ph] million for the quarter and $50 million year-to-date.
The effective tax rate at 22.1% was down almost 3.5 points from the year-ago period due largely to the geographic mix of profits and the use of German tax loss carry-forward that were applied to the proton profits.
Given the ongoing geographic mix shift, the profits to outside North America and the German tax loss carry-forward, we now believe the tax rate for the full fiscal year will be about 27%.
Fully diluted shares outstanding decreased from the year-ago quarter to 100.5 million due largely to our ongoing share repurchase program. Diluted EPS was $1.13 for the third quarter.
Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $951 million, debt of $495 million and stockholder's equity of $1.7 billion. DSO is 83, improved by 5 days from the second quarter and by 12 days from the year-ago quarter with the help of strong collections and higher proton revenues.
Third quarter cash flow from operations was $184 million, significantly higher than net income due primarily to working capital improvement. Year-to-date, cash flow from operations was $316 million, slightly more than net earnings for the period.
Primary uses of cash were $92 million for the repurchase of 1 million shares of stock. At the end of the quarter, we had 2.9 million shares remaining under the existing repurchase authorization that extends through calendar year 2015.
Before turning it over to Dow for the guidance, I would like to detail to more items. First, you probably saw in recent press releases, in the third quarter, we extended $35 million in financing for the Maryland proton project. Subsequent to quarter end, we extended $91 million in financing for the know you're project. We will be able to fund of these loans using international cash at a weighted average interest rate of approximately 10%. You can find additional details in our public filings.
Second, given recent acquisitions, including Claymount, as well as historical onetime activities that make quarter-over-quarter comparison difficult, we will begin showing non-GAAP financials in the fourth quarter. We believe this will allow us to evaluate and measure the financial performance of acquisitions on a more appropriate operational basis, easily provide quarter-over-quarter comparisons, excluding unusual items, enable better comparability among our peer group and provide additional transparency to the financial community.
Now, I'll turn it back to Dow for the outlook."

We ended the second quarter with earnings guidance for fiscal 2015 in the range of $4.02 to $4.14 per diluted share. At the end of the third quarter, with approximately $0.22 per diluted share for the booking of the Maryland Proton Therapy System, partially offset by ongoing challenges in our Imaging Components business, we now believe that our earnings for fiscal 2015 could be in the range of $4.20 to $4.25 per diluted share.
The company will begin showing non-GAAP results starting in its fiscal fourth quarter. Non-GAAP earnings for fiscal year 2015 should be higher than the GAAP range by approximately $0.16 per diluted share, comprised of restructuring charges in the first half of the fiscal year 2015, acquisition-related costs and amortization of intangibles.

I know that hasn't been booked as order, so that won't flow through the P&L yet. But since it looks like equipment to started to be delivered, you've got a couple other projects here that are now started to deliver.

Obviously, we are very excited given all of the recent order activities in this business. We're not prepared at this point to give any kind of guidance into FY '16. I do think that from the top line perspective, we will be able to, at least, get to that number or exceed it by a little bit. Not so sure on the profitability only because Emory, we are not going to be including in any guidance that we give in to FY '16 until the point where their financing is secured. So that would change our numbers pretty significantly. But stay tuned, we will give guidance next quarter on booking into FY '16."

As Elisha as we said in the call, that business is down about $35 million year-over-year. it's a cyclical business. Oil prices are at a historic low, we just don't see the oil-based economy, which have been our largest customer, not 75% of that business is outside of the U.S. and a huge chunk of that is in the Middle East. And the security border protection side of that, we see kind of very cyclical. I think, that's going to remain soft for a while. We don't see that bouncing back right away. The flat panel business, we talked about in the script, some product mix issues as people are shifting to lower performance, lower cost products, and we're seeing price pressure in that business. But I think in part is related to the dollar-denominated business, so it's kind of one way we're seeing the FX in that business, we are seeing our customers there press very hard for cost reductions, for local suppliers and evaluating competitive alternatives. So I think we've got several quarters of kind of tough floating here in that business. Good news is, is that the 2 business seemed pretty stable, and we're pushing hard on the innovation front in this business. I think, as we looked to next year, it will be helped by the acquisitions. Clearly, we're announcing Claymount out today, and MeVis[ph] acquisition that we announced earlier this year, I'd say, 6 months in, it looks very good and we're very pleased with where the MeVis acquisition is going for Components business."

On Oncology, the good news there is here today, they are right at 43.5%, right smack in the middle of long-term range that we're trying to get to a 43% to 44%, and that is despite the significant FX impacts that we've had. Our revenues for FY '15 on a constant currency basis are down about $125 million for total company, just due to direct FX and most of that hits our Oncology business. So they've done a very good job at maintaining margins. In the quarter, we expected that they had just a huge shift to international deliveries, that was an 8-point swing quarter-over-quarter, and that was built into our guidance and when we talked about their margin last quarter, I believe, I mentioned that. I am quite pleased with our how oncology has been able to maintain margins at a really tough FX environment. ICB, this is our Imaging Components business, it's a volume business. And so when we have significant declines in volume, it just flows through the gross margin, which is exactly what you saw in the third quarter. Again, year-to-date, kudos to the team, they have maintained gross margin even with the year-ago period by going back to suppliers, by getting the cost reductions, by reducing costs everywhere they can and improving quality. I do think we're going to, obviously, have some pressures as going to the balance of the year on the gross margin for the Imaging business. But again, they've done a tremendous job so far this year on keeping it flat year-over-year. And then the total company was, obviously, impacted as well by proton. They had a terrific quarter, but as it's still lower than the overall company gross margin, so it was dilutive to the company's gross margin. But great performance by proton in the quarter."

There are some broader halo effect, I'd say, certainly it hasn't hurt us and it might help us a little bit. I would say that one of the things that we really like is the fact that from a customer point of view, it's 1 treatment planning system, it's 1 oncology information system, with your patients and you're getting brachytherapy, radiation therapy, Proton Therapy, we've got you. And that's 1 treatment plan that's integrated and that works really well. And then for our users, we've brought the user interface together.

Let me take that second part and go to kind of guidance walk for fiscal year '15. So as of the last time we guided, the midpoint was 4 0 8. You then add in the Maryland proton at $0.22, you get to 4 30. We have about a $10 million pretax Q4 issue in our Imaging Components business, largely in SIP, but in flat panels as well. So that's where you lose that $0.07, if you will, to get back to the 4 23. And then, of course, moving to non-GAAP, we can add about $0.16 to that dollar to get to the new midpoint of 4 39."

And because FX at least for the moment seemed to kind of settle down in that $1.09 to $1.10 range on the Euro. In terms of revenue, I should just say for total company, we spent a lot of time in the last quarter or 2 getting much more detail on our constant currency reporting. And for fiscal year '15, the year-over-year impact to revenue is about $125 million. So it was huge just given the 20% decline in the Euro and the yen. So yes, we did come off from early on, on the Oncology number. We've got Oncology in for the full year at about 1%. In dollars, that would clearly be mid-single digits if it were in constant currency. The bulk of where we're continuing to see some decline is in our Imaging Components business, and we did have to come off the revenue number a little bit in Q4 for that. And then you're right, the Proton business now will be closer to around $140 million, which gets you to total company about 2% in dollars."

I think, that's kind of how we see FX, it's one way of how we're seeing FX in that business. And we're seeing customers move their mix downmarket a little bit with the pricing environment that's out there and expecting lower capability, lower-priced product.

We've got a lot of installations planned for this next quarter. We're expanding the capabilities that the product has. I forgot to list it in the list of exciting software activities that we've got going on across the business. But it's probably the single biggest driver that we have in the business right now and that's really good. We do have a significant release coming out of engineering early in August. So we've got lots of customers lined up to take that release. And this a reminder for everybody on the call, the kind of efficiency and productivity we're seeing is 60 to 90 minutes per plan and that's huge for our customers. And we're not talking about the quality piece of that. So it's a minimum, 6 to 90 minutes faster and we really believe, as we've measured ids in some places in some institutions, but we want to measure it more broadly as we got a product out there. But we think that there will be a very significant quality improvement as well. And our vision behind this product is why can't every planner in the world be as good as our best planner. And that's kind of where we're going with the product. And anyway, I think, fourth quarter will be an exciting quarter for us with lots of installations coming, and with a little bit more of a clinical report for you next quarter. On EDGE, to the second part of your question, one of the things that we're seeing that we really like is we're having conversations -- the market is a replacement market, let's just start with that. And what we're seeing is more and more of those customers as they come to a source refresh or a replacement decision, they're having a Linac-based conversation with us. We know in stereotactic radiosurgery, the product is as good. And then on top of that, you got the capability for doing lung and liver. So it's the economics are wonderful and so we are having more and more action in that market. So we like the EDGE products position and I'd say the momentum is growing in one of the places we're seeing it grow is in this Gamma Knife takeout market."

The third quarter was mixed with strong constant currency growth in Oncology Systems gross orders, significant challenges in Imaging Components and a strong performance in Particle Therapy.
In summary, we are reporting net earnings of $1.13 per diluted share; revenues of $784 million, up 5% in dollars and 11% in constant currency; Oncology gross orders of $635 million, up 2% in dollars and 10% in constant currency; significant declines in orders and revenues for Imaging Components business; a big negative quarter-over-quarter impact from a strong U.S. dollar; and the booking of 2 more multi-room proton orders as well as significant revenue from the Maryland installation.
Turning to the operational highlights. Oncology gross orders totaled $635 million for the quarter, up 2% and 10% in constant currency. In the Americas, gross orders were up 4%, both in dollars and constant currency. In EMEA, gross orders were down 2%, but up 13% in constant currency. In APAC, orders rose 8% and were up 21% in constant currency.
We're really pleased with the constant currency growth in this business. Let me give you some color on each of the geographies.
Latin America drove the orders growth in the Americas offsetting a 2% decline in North America. Year-to-date, our orders were up 3% in North America, and we believe we've gained market share. 
In North America, we booked a $4 million of a $25 million long-term order from Innova [ph] Healthcare, which is standardizing on Varian equipment, software and services across its network. We also achieved nearly $30 million of competitive takeouts in North America during the quarter, replacing 7 Siemens machines as well as 20 installations of software from competitors.
Clinics in North America and around the world are seeking to standardize on fully integrated cost-efficient versatile treatment systems, this is a Varian strength.
Strong demand in Brazil, Argentina and Colombia drove an 82% order increase across Latin America. In EMEA, we booked our largest-ever order in Spain for $21 million to supply 10 linear accelerators, including 3 TrueBeam systems to 5 hospitals in Galicia. This order also includes Varian's full suite of treatment planning and oncology information management software.
Healthy demand in the U.K., Sweden and Italy as well as wins in Germany where we are recapturing share adding to the growth in EMEA.
We completed the operational setup of a new strategic operating entity in Saudi Arabia to better support cancer patients and the medical community in the Middle East. Aramco in Saudi Arabia placed an $8 million order in the quarter for advanced treatment systems.
India also made a strong contribution during the quarter, ordering 2 of our top of the line EDGE radiosurgery systems. As you may have seen in an earlier press release, we showed a hospital in Hyderabad has just treated its 10,000th patient with RapidArc. This is quite an achievement, and we're pleased to see our fast and efficient systems making cancer care more affordable and accessible patients around the world.
Our new VitalBeam product has now received FDA 510(k) and CE Mark approvals making it marketable in many territories. We received our first VitalBeam order in India, and we expect this affordable and upgradable linear accelerator for radiotherapy to be a winner, particularly in the emerging markets. Overall, EMEA remains a healthy market with year-to-date constant currency orders growth of 6%.
In APAC, China, again, led the way during the quarter with healthy growth in orders, including for the first 2 EDGE radiosurgery systems. Stereotactic body radiotherapy was a big topic of discussion at our recent Users Meeting in Beijing, which attracted about 550 customers.
Australia also contributed to the growth in APAC when Radiation Oncology Queensland placed an order to install TrueBeam systems and software at 5 sites.
In Japan, we saw some promising developments with orders for 6 TrueBeam systems and service that led to strong constant currency growth. We also announced the software alliance of Flatiron Health to develop the next-generation of cloud-based oncology informatics products, leveraging Varian's expertise in radiation oncology and Flatiron's expertise in medical oncology. The alliance will deliver software for a fully integrated, powerful cloud-based oncology information product suite.
Our Oncology service business grew orders by 8% during the quarter and represented 42% of Oncology Systems' orders for the period. We remain on track to hit the $1 billion service milestone this year, notwithstanding currency headwinds.
Subsequent to the close of the quarter, CMS published its proposals for 2016 Medicare reimbursement rates in the U.S. Under the proposal hospitals, which represent 90% of the U.S. market for equipment, would receive a nearly 2% increase in reimbursement overall for radiation oncology services. In freestanding clinics, CMS is proposing an overall reduction of 9% for technical fees and a 3% reduction for physician fees. The impact of these proposed cuts will vary depending upon the mix of patients and treatment protocols.
We're partnering with radiation oncology stakeholders to express our concern about the impact of the CMS proposals on our customers and on patients' access to cancer care.
Let me turn now to Imaging Components, which experienced another challenging quarter. Gross orders for Imaging Components fell by 25% to $122 million for the quarter and revenue strength by 17% to $135 million. Security and Inspection Products revenues fell sharply during the quarter, as the market for border protection systems has slowed significantly. End customers, particularly in oil-based economies and war zones like Iraq, are not moving forward with system deployments or tenders. Additionally, customers have put significant pressure on pricing from their suppliers. We expect annual revenues for this business to be half [ph] versus the previous year by about $35 million.
For Security and Inspection Products, the fourth quarter will also be challenging because of a very tough orders comp with the prior year period.
Severe pricing pressure and a product mix shift caused a significant decline in panel orders during the quarter. Year-to-date orders for the panel business were up 2% and revenues were down 6%. Competition in the radiographic portion of the panel market has intensified and put dollar-based products at a disadvantage. We are faced with a challenge of developing new products to meet tougher cost and performance expectations.
A bright spot for our panel business is the recent House of Representatives passage of the 21st Century Cures legislation that contained a provision supported by Varian to incentivize the transition to digital radiography. This bill increases reimbursement for digital radiography while cutting rates for older, less efficient technologies. It now moves to the Senate, and we're hopeful that it sets the stage for more robust panel business in the future.
Revenues in our tube business have been relatively flat as improvements in product quality and tube life have softened demand for replacement tubes. While currency does not have a direct impact on the performance of the Imaging Components business, it is having a dramatic effect on customer behavior in all product lines. Customers are actively looking for lower cost alternatives to dollar-based products. In the short-term, we are managing this business to maintain our market share. Over the long-term, we're stepping up our Imaging investments, including R&D, to enhance our competitiveness.
Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we announced an agreement to acquire Claymount, a privately held Netherlands-based supplier of components and subsystems for X-ray imaging equipment manufacturers. Claymount is one of the world's leading suppliers of X-ray imaging components, including high-voltage connectors, generators and dose control mechanisms used in medical X-ray imaging. With annual revenues of about EUR 30 million, the company is a supplier to many global medical X-ray equipment manufacturers. This should give us good cross-selling opportunities and offer the added benefit of providing Varian's other businesses and internal source of lower-cost components. Claymount's products complement and diversify our X-ray product offering. This will further expand Varian's portfolio of components and subsystems that will enable X-ray OEMs to get their products to market faster and more efficiently.
The company's Other category comprised of the Varian Particle Therapy business and the Ginzton Technology Center, recorded gross orders of $131 million and generated $91 million in revenue. This was an outstanding quarter for our Particle Therapy business with a significant level of activity.
We booked a Maryland deal, which resulted in a first profitable quarter ever for this business. We also booked an order for a 4-room system in the Netherlands.
Subsequent to the close of the quarter, we finalized $115 million in contracts to equip and service a 5-room center in Manhattan, the first proton facility in the New York State. Also we finalized the 2 previously announced contracts in the U.K.
With 3 centers treating patients using Varian equipment and 11 more projects in backlog, we're now seeing some real momentum in this business.
Now I'll turn it over to Elisha."

The company ended the quarter with a $3.1 billion backlog, up 9% from the year-ago quarter. Backlog adjustments during the quarter totaled $60 million bringing net orders for the company to $828 million. The backlog adjustment includes $17 million related to currency impacts and a $12 million from the cancellation of an oncology order in Ukraine.
Third quarter revenues for the total company increased 5% in dollars and 11% in constant currency. Total company revenues in the Americas were up 6% in both dollars constant currency. EMEA revenues were down 1% in dollars and up 12% in constant currency. APAC revenues were up 11% in dollars and up 20% in constant currency.
Year-to-date, total company revenues were up 2% in dollars and up 6% in constant currency.
Oncology Systems posted a 30% [ph] decline in revenues during the quarter, bringing the revenue decline year-to-date to 1% in dollars. The vast majority of the FX impact occurred in our Oncology business were constant currency revenues were up mid-single digits for the quarter and year-to-date.
Imaging Components posted a third quarter revenue decline of 17% with significant declines in our flat panel and Security and Inspection Products and a slight decline in our tube products. Year-to-date, Imaging Components revenues were down 7% from the year-ago period with slight declines in tubes, mid-single-digit declines in panels and a nearly 30% decline in Security and Inspection Products. As a reminder, Imaging Components sells primarily in U.S. dollars.
Revenues for the Other category increased significantly from the year-ago quarter as we recorded nearly $80 million related to the University of Maryland proton project.
Total company gross margin for the quarter fell by approximately 3 points to 40%. Let me walk you through this. Oncology Systems' gross margin decreased by about 2 percentage points from the year-ago quarter to 41.9% due to an unfavorable and expected significant shift to lower margin geographies and negative currency impacts. Year-to-date, Oncology's gross margin decreased 41 basis points to 43.5% due largely to currency.
The Imaging Components' gross margin for the quarter fell by more than 3 percentage points to 38.9% due to steep declines in revenues from our panel and Security and Inspection Products. Year-to-date, Imaging Components' gross margin was equal to the year-ago period at 41.7% due to product cost reductions and improved quality cost that offset pricing pressure.
The Other category, including our proton business, which benefited from a weaker Euro, had a 31% gross margin in the quarter, due largely to the Maryland proton project. While the margin performance was terrific for this business, the higher proportion of proton revenues was dilutive to the overall gross margin for the company.
Third quarter SG&A expenses were $111 million or 14% of revenue, an improvement at 2.5 percentage points from the year-ago quarter when we booked an $8 million charge for the impairment of a portion of the company's investment in Augmenix. On an apples-to-apples basis, excluding the impairment in the year-ago period, SG&A as a percentage of revenue, improved 1.5 percentage points from the year-ago quarter.
Third quarter R&D expenses were $60 million or 8% of revenues equal as a percentage of revenue with the year-ago quarter.
Moving down the income statement. Third quarter operating earnings totaled $144 million or 18.4% of revenues. Depreciation and amortization totaled $17 million for the quarter and $50 million year-to-date.
The effective tax rate at 22.1% was down almost 3.5 points from the year-ago period, due largely to the geographic mix of profits and the use of German tax loss carryforward that were applied to the proton profits.
Given the ongoing geographic mix shift, the profits to outside North America and the German tax loss carryforward, we now believe the tax rate for the full fiscal year will be about 27%.
Fully diluted shares outstanding decreased from the year-ago quarter to 100.5 million due largely to our ongoing share repurchase program. Diluted EPS was $1.13 for the third quarter.
Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $951 million, debt of $495 million and stockholders' equity of $1.7 billion. DSO is 83, improved by 5 days from the second quarter and by 12 days from the year-ago quarter with the help of strong collections and higher proton revenues.
Third quarter cash flow from operations was $184 million, significantly higher than net income, due primarily to working capital improvement. Year-to-date, cash flow from operations was $316 million, slightly more than net earnings for the period.
Primary uses of cash were $92 million for the repurchase of 1 million shares of stock. At the end of the quarter, we had 2.9 million shares remaining under the existing repurchase authorization that extends through calendar year 2015.
Before turning it over to Dow for the guidance, I would like to detail 2 more items. First, as you probably saw in recent press releases, in the third quarter, we extended $35 million in financing for the Maryland proton project. Subsequent to quarter end, we extended $91 million in financing for the New York project. We will be able to fund these loans using international cash at a weighted average interest rate of approximately 10%. You can find additional details in our public filings.
Second, given recent acquisitions, including Claymount as well as historical one-time activities that make quarter-over-quarter comparisons difficult, we will begin showing non-GAAP financials in the fourth quarter. We believe this will allow us to evaluate and measure the financial performance of acquisitions on a more appropriate operational basis, easily provide quarter-over-quarter comparisons, excluding unusual items, enable better comparability among our peer group and provide additional transparency to the financial community.
Now I'll turn it back to Dow for the outlook."

We ended the second quarter with earnings guidance for fiscal 2015 in the range of $4.02 to $4.14 per diluted share. At the end of the third quarter, with approximately $0.22 per diluted share for the booking of the Maryland Proton Therapy System, partially offset by ongoing challenges in our Imaging Components business, we now believe that our earnings for fiscal 2015 could be in the range of $4.20 to $4.25 per diluted share.
The company will begin showing non-GAAP results starting in its fiscal fourth quarter. Non-GAAP earnings for fiscal year 2015 should be higher than the GAAP range by approximately $0.16 per diluted share, comprised of restructuring charges in the first half of the fiscal year 2015, acquisition-related costs and amortization of intangibles.
We're now ready for your questions."

I think there's 2 pieces of it. First of all, the security piece is very tough to call. As Elisha -- as we said in the call, that business is down about $35 million year-over-year. it's a cyclical business. Oil prices are at a historic low, and we just don't see the oil-based economies, which have been our largest customers, about 75% of that business is outside of the U.S. and a huge chunk of that is in the Middle East. And the security border protection side of that, we see is kind of being a very cyclical. And I think, that's going to remain soft for a while. We don't see that bouncing back right away. The flat panel business, we talked about in the script, some product mix issues as people are shifting to lower performance, lower-cost products, and we're seeing price pressure in that business. But I think in part is related to -- it's a dollar-denominated business. So it's kind of that's one way of seeing the FX in that business, we are seeing our customers there press very hard for cost reductions, for local suppliers and evaluating competitive alternatives. So I think we've got several quarters of kind of tough sledding here in that business. Good news is that the 2 businesses seems pretty stable, and we are -- we're pushing hard on the innovation front in this business. And I think, as we look to next year, it will be helped by the acquisitions. Clearly, we're announcing Claymount today and the MeVis acquisition that we announced earlier this year, I'd say, whatever 6 months in, it looks very good and we're very pleased with where the MeVis acquisition is going for our Components business."

I mean, Oncology, the good news there is here to date, they are right at 43.5%, right smack in the middle of the long-term range that we're trying to get to a 43% to 44%, and that is despite the significant FX impacts that we've had. Our revenues for FY '15 on a constant currency basis are down about $125 million for total company, just due to direct FX and most of that hits our Oncology business. So they've done a very good job at maintaining margins. In the quarter, we expected that they had just a huge shift to international deliveries, that was an 8-point swing quarter-over-quarter, and that was built into our guidance and when we talked about their margin last quarter, I believe, we mentioned that. So I am quite pleased with how Oncology has been able to maintain margins in a really tough FX environment. ICB, this is our Imaging Components business, it's a volume business. And so when we have significant declines in volume, it just flows through the gross margin, which is exactly what you saw in this third quarter. Again, year-to-date, kudos to the team, they have maintained gross margin even with the year-ago period by going back to suppliers, by getting cost reductions, by reducing costs everywhere they can improving quality. I do think we're going to, obviously, have some pressures as going into the balance of the year on the gross margin for the Imaging business. But again, they've done a tremendous job so far this year on keeping it flat year-over-year. And then the total company was, obviously, impacted as well by Proton. They had a terrific quarter, but as it's still lower than the overall company gross margin, so it was dilutive to the company's gross margin. But great performance by Proton in the quarter."

Radiation therapy is still one of the highest value-adding modalities for treating cancer and one of the lowest cost. So we've got to make sure that we're in there with the fight. Some of our customers have taken a look at this. Those that have a little bit higher prostate mix are going to be impacted higher. And those that aren't, we have one of our very large customers think that the impact will be pretty balanced for them.

And for fiscal year '15, the year-over-year impact to revenue is about $125 million. So it was huge, just given the 20% decline in the euro and the yen. So yes, we did come off from early on, on the Oncology number. We've got Oncology in for the full year at about 1%. In dollars, that would clearly be mid-single digits if it were in constant currency. The bulk of where we're continuing to see some declines is in our Imaging Components business, and we did have to come off the revenue number a little bit in Q4 for that.

So we've got lots of customers lined up to take that release. And kind of just as reminder for everybody on the call, the kind of efficiency and productivity we're seeing is 60 to 90 minutes per plan and that's huge for our customers. And we're not talking about the quality piece of that.

And anyway, I think, fourth quarter will be an exciting quarter for us with lots of installations coming, and with a little bit more of a clinical report for you next quarter. On EDGE, to the second part of your question, one of the things that we're seeing that we really like is we're having conversations -- the Gamma Knife market is the replacement market, so let's just start with that. And what we're seeing is more and more of those customers as they come to a source refresh or a replacement decision, they're having a Linac-based conversation with us. We know in stereotactic radiosurgery, the product is as good. And then on top of that, you get the capability for doing lung and liver. So it's -- the economics are wonderful, and so we are having more and more action in that market. So we like the EDGE products position a lot.

311907,304879965,842187,"Varian Medical Systems, Inc., Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 29, 2015",2015-07-29,"Earnings Calls","Varian Medical Systems, Inc.","Executives","Good afternoon, and welcome. The third quarter was mixed, with strong constant currency growth in Oncology Systems gross orders, significant challenges in Imaging Components and a strong performance in Particle Therapy.In summary, we are reporting: Net",1470,"Good afternoon, and welcome. The third quarter was mixed, with strong constant currency growth in Oncology Systems gross orders, significant challenges in Imaging Components and a strong performance in Particle Therapy.
In summary, we are reporting: Net earnings of $1.13 per diluted share; revenues of $784 million, up 5% in dollars and 11% in constant currency; Oncology gross orders of $635 million, up 2% in dollars and 10% in constant currency; significant declines in orders and revenues for our Imaging Components business; a big negative quarter-over-quarter impact from a strong U.S. dollar; and the booking of 2 more multi-room proton orders, as well as significant revenue from the Maryland installation.
Turning to the operational highlights. Oncology gross orders totaled $635 million for the quarter, up 2% and 10% in constant currency. In the Americas, gross orders were up 4%, both in dollars and constant currency. In EMEA, gross orders were down 2%, but up 13% in constant currency. In APAC, orders rose 8% and were up 21% in constant currency.
We're really pleased with the constant currency growth in this business. Let me give you some color on each of the geographies.
Latin America drove the orders growth in the Americas, offsetting a 2% decline in North America. Year-to-date, our orders are up 3% in North America, and we believe we've gained market share. 
In North America, we booked $4 million of a $25 million long-term order from Inova Healthcare, which is standardizing on Varian equipment, software and services across its network. We also achieved nearly $30 million of competitive takeouts in North America during the quarter, replacing 7 Siemens machines, as well as 20 installations of software from competitors.
Clinics in North America and around the world are seeking to standardize on fully integrated cost-efficient versatile treatment systems, this is a Varian strength.
Strong demand in Brazil, Argentina and Colombia drove an 82% order increase across Latin America. In EMEA, we booked our largest-ever order in Spain for $21 million to supply 10 linear accelerators, including 3 TrueBeam systems, to 5 hospitals in Galicia. This order also includes Varian's full suite of treatment planning and oncology information management software.
Healthy demand in the U.K., Sweden and Italy, as well as wins in Germany, where we are recapturing share, adding to the growth in EMEA.
We completed the operational setup of a new strategic operating entity in Saudi Arabia to better support cancer patients and the medical community in the Middle East. Aramco in Saudi Arabia placed an $8 million order in the quarter for advanced treatment systems.
India also made a strong contribution during the quarter, ordering 2 of our top of the line EDGE radiosurgery systems. As you may have seen in an earlier press release, Yashoda Hospital in Hyderabad has just treated its 10,000th patient with RapidArc. This is quite an achievement, and we're pleased to see our fast and efficient systems making cancer care more affordable and accessible to patients around the world.
Our new VitalBeam product has now received FDA 510(k) and CE Mark approvals, making it marketable in many territories. We received our first VitalBeam order in India, and we expect this affordable and upgradable linear accelerator for radiotherapy to be a winner, particularly in emerging markets. Overall, EMEA remains a healthy market, with year-to-date constant currency orders growth of 6%.
In APAC, China again led the way during the quarter, with healthy growth in orders, including for the first 2 EDGE radiosurgery systems. Stereotactic body radiotherapy was a big topic of discussion at our recent Users Meeting in Beijing, which attracted about 550 customers.
Australia also contributed to the growth in APAC, when Radiation Oncology Queensland placed an order to install TrueBeam systems and software at 5 sites.
In Japan, we saw some promising developments with orders for 6 TrueBeam systems and service that led to strong constant currency growth. We also announced a software alliance with Flatiron Health to develop the next-generation of cloud-based oncology informatics products, leveraging Varian's expertise in radiation oncology and Flatiron's expertise in medical oncology. The alliance will deliver software for a fully integrated, powerful cloud-based oncology information product suite.
Our Oncology service business grew orders by 8% during the quarter and represented 42% of Oncology Systems orders for the period. We remain on track to hit the $1 billion service milestone this year, notwithstanding currency headwinds.
Subsequent to the close of the quarter, CMS published its proposals for 2016 Medicare reimbursement rates in the U.S. Under the proposal, hospitals, which represent 90% of the U.S. market for equipment, would receive a nearly 2% increase in reimbursement overall for radiation oncology services. In freestanding clinics, CMS is proposing an overall reduction of 9% for technical fees and a 3% reduction for physician fees. The impact of these proposed cuts will vary depending upon the mix of patients and treatment protocols.
We're partnering with radiation oncology stakeholders to express our concern about the impact of the CMS proposals on our customers and on patients' access to cancer care.
Let me turn now to Imaging Components, which experienced another challenging quarter. Gross orders for Imaging Components fell by 25% to $122 million for the quarter and revenue shrank by 17% to $135 million. Security and Inspection Products revenues fell sharply during the quarter, as the market for border protection systems has slowed significantly. End customers, particularly in oil-based economies and war zones like Iraq, are not moving forward with system deployments or tenders. Additionally, customers have put significant pressure on pricing from their suppliers. We expect annual revenues for this business to be off versus the previous year by about $35 million.
For Security and Inspection Products, the fourth quarter will also be challenging because of a very tough orders comp with the prior year period.
Severe pricing pressure and a product mix shift caused a significant decline in panel orders during the quarter. Year-to-date orders for the panel business were up 2% and revenues were down 6%. Competition in the radiographic portion of the panel market has intensified and put dollar-based products at a disadvantage. We are faced with a challenge of developing new products to meet tougher cost and performance expectations.
A bright spot for our panel business is the recent House of Representatives passage of the 21st Century Cures legislation that contained a provision supported by Varian to incentivize the transition to digital radiography. This bill increases reimbursement for digital radiography while cutting rates for older, less efficient technologies. It now moves to the Senate, and we're hopeful that it sets the stage for a more robust panel business in the future.
Revenues in our tube business have been relatively flat, as improvements in product quality and tube life have softened demand for replacement tubes. While currency does not have a direct impact on the performance of the Imaging Components business, it is having a dramatic effect on customer behavior in all product lines. Customers are actively looking for lower-cost alternatives to dollar-based products. In the short term, we are managing this business to maintain our market share. Over the long term, we're stepping up our imaging investments, including R&D, to enhance our competitiveness.
Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we announced an agreement to acquire Claymount, a privately held Netherlands-based supplier of components and subsystems for X-ray imaging equipment manufacturers. Claymount is one of the world's leading suppliers of X-ray imaging components, including high-voltage connectors, generators and dose control mechanisms used in medical X-ray imaging. With annual revenues of about EUR 30 million, the company is a supplier to many global medical X-ray equipment manufacturers. This should give us good cross-selling opportunities and offer the added benefit of providing Varian's other businesses an internal source of lower-cost components. Claymount's products complement and diversify our X-ray product offering. This will further expand Varian's portfolio of components and subsystems that will enable X-ray OEMs to get their products to market faster and more efficiently.
The company's Other category, comprised of the Varian Particle Therapy business and the Ginzton Technology Center, recorded gross orders of $131 million and generated $91 million in revenue. This was an outstanding quarter for our Particle Therapy business, with a significant level of activity.
We booked the Maryland deal, which resulted in a first profitable quarter ever for this business. We also booked an order for a 4-room system in the Netherlands.
Subsequent to the close of the quarter, we finalized $115 million in contracts to equip and service a 5-room center in Manhattan, the first proton facility in New York State. Also, we finalized the 2 previously announced contracts in the U.K.
With 3 centers treating patients using Varian equipment and 11 more projects in backlog, we're now seeing some real momentum in this business.
Now I'll turn it over to Elisha."

The company ended the quarter with a $3.1 billion backlog, up 9% from the year-ago quarter. Backlog adjustments during the quarter totaled $60 million, bringing net orders for the company to $828 million. The backlog adjustment includes $17 million related to currency impacts and a $12 million from the cancellation of an oncology order in Ukraine.
Third quarter revenues for the total company increased 5% in dollars and 11% in constant currency. Total company revenues in the Americas were up 6% in both dollars and constant currency. EMEA revenues were down 1% in dollars and up 12% in constant currency. APAC revenues were up 11% in dollars and up 20% in constant currency.
Year-to-date, total company revenues were up 2% in dollars and up 6% in constant currency.
Oncology Systems posted a 3% decline in revenues during the quarter, bringing the revenue decline year-to-date to 1% in dollars. The vast majority of the FX impact occurred in our Oncology business, where constant currency revenues were up mid-single digits for the quarter and year-to-date.
Imaging Components posted a third quarter revenue decline of 17%, with significant declines in our flat panel and Security and Inspection Products and a slight decline in our tube products. Year-to-date, Imaging Components revenues were down 7% from the year-ago period, with slight declines in tubes, mid-single-digit declines in panels and a nearly 30% decline in Security and Inspection Products. As a reminder, Imaging Components sells primarily in U.S. dollars.
Revenues for the Other category increased significantly from the year-ago quarter, as we recorded nearly $80 million related to the University of Maryland proton project.
Total company gross margin for the quarter fell by approximately 3 points to 40%. Let me walk you through this. Oncology Systems' gross margin decreased by about 2 percentage points from the year-ago quarter to 41.9%, due to an unfavorable and expected significant shift to lower-margin geographies and negative currency impacts. Year-to-date, Oncology's gross margin decreased 41 basis points to 43.5%, due largely to currency.
The Imaging Components' gross margin for the quarter fell by more than 3 percentage points to 38.9%, due to steep declines in revenues from our panel and Security and Inspection Products. Year-to-date, Imaging Components' gross margin was equal to the year-ago period at 41.7%, due to product cost reductions and improved quality costs that offset pricing pressure.
The Other category, including our proton business, which benefited from a weaker Euro, had a 31% gross margin in the quarter, due largely to the Maryland proton project. While the margin performance was terrific for this business, the higher proportion of proton revenues was dilutive to the overall gross margin for the company.
Third quarter SG&A expenses were $111 million or 14% of revenue, an improvement at 2.5 percentage points from the year-ago quarter, when we booked an $8 million charge for the impairment of a portion of the company's investment in Augmenix. On an apples-to-apples basis, excluding the impairment in the year-ago period, SG&A as a percentage of revenue, improved 1.5 percentage points from the year-ago quarter.
Third quarter R&D expenses were $60 million or 8% of revenues, equal as a percentage of revenue with the year-ago quarter.
Moving down the income statement. Third quarter operating earnings totaled $144 million or 18.4% of revenues. Depreciation and amortization totaled $17 million for the quarter and $50 million year-to-date.
The effective tax rate at 22.1% was down almost 3.5 points from the year-ago period, due largely to the geographic mix of profits and the use of German tax loss carryforwards that were applied to the proton profits.
Given the ongoing geographic mix shift of profits outside North America and the German tax loss carryforward, we now believe the tax rate for the full fiscal year will be about 27%.
Fully diluted shares outstanding decreased from the year-ago quarter to 100.5 million, due largely to our ongoing share repurchase program. Diluted EPS was $1.13 for the third quarter.
Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $951 million, debt of $495 million and stockholders' equity of $1.7 billion. DSO at 83 improved by 5 days from the second quarter and by 12 days from the year-ago quarter, with the help of strong collections and higher proton revenues.
Third quarter cash flow from operations was $184 million, significantly higher than net income, due primarily to working capital improvement. Year-to-date, cash flow from operations was $316 million, slightly more than net earnings for the period.
Primary uses of cash were $92 million toward the repurchase of 1 million shares of stock. At the end of the quarter, we had 2.9 million shares remaining under the existing repurchase authorization that extends through calendar year 2015.
Before turning it over to Dow for the guidance, I would like to detail 2 more items. First, as you probably saw in recent press releases, in the third quarter, we extended $35 million in financing for the Maryland proton project. Subsequent to quarter end, we extended $91 million in financing for the New York project. We will be able to fund these loans using international cash at a weighted average interest rate of approximately 10%. You can find additional details in our public filings.
Second, given recent acquisitions, including Claymount, as well as historical, one-time activities that make quarter-over-quarter comparisons difficult, we will begin showing non-GAAP financials in the fourth quarter. We believe this will allow us to evaluate and measure the financial performance of acquisitions on a more appropriate operational basis, easily provide quarter-over-quarter comparisons excluding unusual items, enable better comparability among our peer group and provide additional transparency to the financial community.
Now I'll turn it back to Dow for the outlook."

We ended the second quarter with earnings guidance for fiscal 2015 in the range of $4.02 to $4.14 per diluted share. At the end of the third quarter, with the approximately $0.22 per diluted share for the booking of the Maryland Proton Therapy system, partially offset by ongoing challenges in our Imaging Components business, we now believe that our earnings for fiscal 2015 could be in the range of $4.20 to $4.25 per diluted share.
The company will begin showing non-GAAP results starting in its fiscal fourth quarter. Non-GAAP earnings for fiscal year 2015 should be higher than the GAAP range by approximately $0.16 per diluted share, comprised of restructuring charges in the first half of the fiscal year 2015, acquisition-related costs and amortization of intangibles.

But since it looks like equipment is starting to be delivered, you've got a couple other projects here that are now starting to deliver.

Obviously, we are very excited, given all of the recent order activities in this business. We're not prepared at this point to give any kind of guidance into FY '16. I do think that from the top line perspective, we will be able to, at least get to that number or exceed it by a little bit. Not so sure on the profitability, only because Emory, we are not going to be including in any guidance that we give into FY '16 until the point where their financing is secured.

So it's kind of that's one way of seeing the FX in that business. We are seeing our customers there press very hard for cost reductions, for local suppliers and evaluating competitive alternatives. So I think we've got several quarters of kind of tough sledding here in that business. The good news is that the tube business seems pretty stable, and we are -- we're pushing hard on the innovation front in this business. And I think, as we look to next year, it will be helped by the acquisitions. Clearly, we're announcing Claymount today and the MeVis acquisition that we announced earlier this year, I'd say, what are we, 6 months in, it looks very good and we're very pleased with where the MeVis acquisition is going for our Components business."

So let me just kind of walk you through, Vijay, by business. I mean, Oncology, the good news there is year-to-date, they are right at 43.5%, right smack in the middle of the long-term range that we're trying to get to, a 43% to 44%, and that is despite the significant FX impacts that we've had. Our revenues for FY '15 on a constant currency basis are down about $125 million for total company, just due to direct FX and most of that hits our Oncology business. So they've done a very good job at maintaining margins. In the quarter, we expected that they had just a huge shift to international deliveries, it was an 8-point swing quarter-over-quarter, and that was built into our guidance. And when we talked about their margin last quarter, I believe we mentioned that. So I am quite pleased with how Oncology has been able to maintain margins in a really tough FX environment. ICB, this is a, our Imaging Components business, it's a volume business. And so when we have significant declines in volume, it just flows through the gross margin, which is exactly what you saw in this third quarter. Again, year-to-date, kudos to the team, they have maintained gross margin, even with the year-ago period, by going back to suppliers, by getting cost reductions, by reducing costs everywhere they can, improving quality. I do think we're going to, obviously, have some pressures as we go into the balance of the year on the gross margin for the Imaging business. But again, they've done a tremendous job so far this year on keeping it flat year-over-year. And then the total company was, obviously, impacted as well by proton. They had a terrific quarter, but as it's still lower than the overall company gross margin, so it was dilutive to the company's gross margin. But great performance by proton in the quarter."

I'd say, it certainly hasn't hurt us, and it might help us a little bit. I would say that one of the things that we really like is the fact that from a customer point of view, it's one treatment planning system, it's one oncology information system. If you're a patient and you're getting brachytherapy, radiation therapy, Proton Therapy, we've got you. And that's one treatment plan that's integrated and that works really well.

And in addition, assuming you get $0.22 plus from the Maryland facility, it looks like we lose about a $0.10 net-net if we look at the bottom line guidance. So again, is that all Imaging?

And for fiscal year '15, the year-over-year impact to revenue is about $125 million. So it was huge, just given the 20% decline in the euro and the yen. So yes, we did come off from early on, on the Oncology number. We've got Oncology in for the full year at about 1%, in dollars. That would clearly be mid-single digits if it were in constant currency. The bulk of where we're continuing to see some declines is in our Imaging Components business, and we did have to come off the revenue number a little bit in Q4 for that.

We've got a lot of installations planned for this next quarter. We're expanding the capabilities that the product has. I forgot to list it in the list of exciting software activities that we've got going on across the business. But it's probably the single biggest driver that we have in the business right now, and that's really good. We do have a significant release coming out of engineering early in August. So we've got lots of customers lined up to take that release. And kind of just as a reminder for everybody on the call, the kind of efficiency and productivity we're seeing is 60 to 90 minutes per plan and that's huge for our customers. And we're not talking about the quality piece of that. So it's at a minimum, 6 to 90 minutes faster and we really believe, as we've measured this in some places and some institutions, but we want to measure it more broadly as we get the product out there. But we think that there will be a very significant quality improvement as well. And our vision behind this product is why can't every planner in the world be as good as our best planner. And that's kind of where we're going with the product. And anyway, I think fourth quarter will be an exciting quarter for us, with lots of installations coming, and with a little bit more of a clinical report for you next quarter. On EDGE, to the second part of your question, one of the things that we're seeing that we really like is we're having conversations -- the Gamma Knife market is the replacement market, let's just start with that. And what we're seeing is more and more of those customers, as they come to a source refresh or a replacement decision, they're having a Linac-based conversation with us. We know in stereotactic radiosurgery, the product is as good. And then on top of that, you get the capability for doing lung and liver. So it's -- the economics are wonderful, and so we are having more and more action in that market. So we like the EDGE product's position a lot. I'd say the momentum is growing, and one of the places we're seeing it grow is in this Gamma Knife takeout market."

As you will have seen from the prerelease that we issued ahead of our Investor Meeting at ASTRO last week, the fourth quarter was marked by some earnings challenges as well as some orders excesses in 2 of our 3 businesses.
In summary, we are reporting non-GAAP net earnings of $1.04 per diluted share, up from $1.03 in the year-ago quarter. Revenues of $818 million, up 1% in dollars and 6% in constant currency. Oncology gross order growth of 5% in constant currency. Orders totaling more than $135 million for 3 Proton Therapy Systems and significant declines in orders and revenues for our Imaging Components business.
Focusing on operational highlights on our Oncology business, gross orders totaled $919 million for the quarter, equal in dollars and up 5% in constant currency versus the strong year-ago quarter. Orders for the fiscal year totaled $2.7 billion, equal with the prior year but up 6% in constant currency in line with our long-term mid-single-digit growth expectations for this business.
Orders in the Americas for the quarter declined by 5% in dollars in constant currency versus the year-ago period when we booked a large part of the Brazil tender. For the year, orders in the Americas were up 1% in dollars in constant currency, and North America orders grew by 4% in the quarter and 3% for the year.
In EMEA, orders grew 13% in dollars and a robust 25% in constant currency during the quarter. For the year, orders in EMEA were even with the year-ago period in dollars and up 12% in constant currency.
Gross orders in APAC were down by 3% in dollars but up 6% in constant currency for the quarter. Annual APAC orders were even with the prior year in dollars and up 9% in constant currency.
We gained share against the competition on all 3 regions of the world for the year. Our team in EMEA set a record by booking orders for over 100 accelerators with strength across the region. In the U.K., the National Health Service selected Varian to supply up to 20 TrueBeam systems. In Poland, we booked orders to supply in 11 public radiotherapy centers with TrueBeam Systems and software replacing older Siemens systems. In India, we booked the first tranche of a 5-year 18 accelerator order, including an EDGE radio surgery system. We have booked the remaining tranches when delivery dates come within our 2-year booking window.
In APAC, a customer in Japan placed an order for 3 TrueBeam systems together with our new RapidPlan and incitive analytics software products. In North America, our oncology team have several nice wins from customers including Memorials [indiscernible], Alliance Oncology and Cleveland clinic. Competitive takeouts added to our orders for the quarter and for the year.
In North America alone, we estimate that we generated over $150 million in orders during the year to replace hardware and software products from our competitors. Over 40 sites switched from other suppliers to our Eclipse Treatment Planning software during the year.
As you know, we have just returned from ASTRO in San Antonio, it's a great show for us with terrific customer response to our exhibit. Our booth was the busiest at the show and we have over 800 attendees at our users meeting. During the show, we provided a glimpse of the next big breakthrough, high-definition radiotherapy and radio surgery. This is a new 4-pie technique that will compress more of dose into the tumor while protecting much more of the surrounding healthy tissue. Clinicians working with TrueBeam's UNIQUE developer mode are using simultaneous motions for the treatment gallantry and patient couch to get a huge increase in the number of beam angles available for targeting the tumor.
High-definition radiotherapy is under trial at UCLA and is not yet ready for broad commercialization. We expect that high-definition treatments, coupled with our multimodality imaging capabilities at the treatment console, will make a much bigger gain in the fight against cancer than is possible with an expensive hybrid device, combining MR imaging and limited treatment delivery.
On the imaging front, we also exhibited iterative cone beam CT technology, which is showing great promise to improve the quality of imaging for planning and guiding treatments. This capability also generated a lot of excitement in our booth at ASTRO.
Varian's industry-leading RapidPlan software, which has already been ordered at over 300 sites, was the hit of the show. As we pointed out in our Investor Meeting there, numerous independent clinical studies show impressive time savings and quality that is equal to or better than plans generated manually.
At University of Michigan, RapidPlan has enabled complex spine SBRT plans to be generated in 15 to 20 minutes instead of the usual 60 to 90 minutes.
At the Royal Surrey Hospital in the U.K., the use of RapidPlan reduced treatment planning time by a factor of 5 and resulted in plans that were deemed equivalent or better 90% of the time. With RapidPlan, the symmetrist can help 5x as many patients as could be done with conventional planning products. This is a product that could help new centers in emerging markets get up to speed with high quality planning very quickly.
There are nearly 4,000 cancer centers worldwide using our Eclipse Treatment Planning software and each of these is a potential candidate for RapidPlan. So we expect it to help drive significant growth in software sales. We developed RapidPlan disease site models for a number of cancers including prostate, head and neck and lung and there are more to come.
The strength in our treatment planning offerings we acquire hyperdrive software technology during the quarter to improve the quality of prescriptions and accelerate the planning process. Our new VitalBeam product received FDA 510(k) and CE Mark approvals during the quarter. We received several VitalBeam orders and early signs are that this affordable extension of the TrueBeam platform will be a winner, particularly in the emerging markets. TrueBeam now comprises more than 70% of our global accelerator orders and 90% of our accelerator orders in the U.S.
Before I leave Oncology Systems, I want to draw your attention to a groundbreaking study issued by the Lancet Oncology Commission, highlighting the global need for more radiotherapy equipment. According to this report, by 2035, there will be 25 million new cases of cancer diagnosed annually and we will need to supply the world with more than 20,000 new machines to equip new centers, as well as replace aging infrastructure. The need is greatest in low and middle-income countries. The report is recommending that by 2020, 80% of these countries should establish national cancer plans and make radiotherapy part of their universal health coverage. Over the next 10 years, the Commission recommends investing $46 billion in these countries to expand radiotherapy capacity. This will require education and training in thousands of doctors, physicists and therapists. Varian has established a market development team that is partnering with governments, financiers, clinicians and patient advocacy groups to support this effort.
Let me now turn to Proton Therapy, which drew a lot of customer attention at ASTRO. We have the momentum in this business. In the fourth quarter, we booked more than $135 million in orders for 3 multi-room systems, including 2 in the U.K. and 1 in New York. This brought the number of proton orders booked in the year to 6 stems, totaling more than $300 million. At this point, we have 11 projects in backlog and we are currently working on more than 6 installations. Treatments are expected to commence at the University of Maryland early next year, which will bring the total number of centers treating patients with ovarian proton technology to 4.
The key to making the Proton Therapy business profitable are continued success in the market, reducing product costs and scaling up the service business. We feel like we have momentum in these areas.
Let me now turn to Imaging Components, where orders shrank by 30% to $165 million for the quarter, resulting in a full year orders decline of 16% for this business. This was another challenging quarter in an exceedingly tough year, particularly in our Security and Inspection business. Orders for panels were down for the quarter and for the year, driven primarily by price. Unit volumes for these products were up slightly from the prior year.
Our Imaging Components competitors are largely European and Japanese. They got about 20% reduction in their cost structure due to foreign exchange movement. They're using this to grab market share. Customers are looking for a lower price alternatives, including in sourcing. In fact, 1 customer has elected to in-source and the impact of this loss in fiscal year 2016 will be about $50 million of revenue.
The Security and Inspection Products business was also down sharply with annual orders off versus the previous year by about $60 million, representing a decline of more than 55%. The Security business remains profitable and we're looking at a lot of options for getting the business back on track.
To address the ongoing challenges for the overall business, we have initiated numerous corrective actions to make our product lines and operations more cost competitive. This include a restructuring to right size the business, accelerating product development, including a new low-cost flat panel and stepping up marketing efforts, particularly in Asia. We are opening a facility near Shanghai to support a rapidly expanding X-ray equipment manufacturing industry in China.
On a positive note, we feel very good about 2 new acquisitions we have made to complement our Imaging Components business, Mavis and Claymount. In fiscal year 2016, we're looking for about $50 million of revenues from these products and they are both off to a good start.
Now I'll turn it over to Elisha."

Backlog adjustments during the year totaled $215 million[ph] w",942,"Thanks, Dow and hello, everyone. Before I walk us through the P&L, let me touch on the backlog.
The company ended the fiscal year with a $3.5 billion backlog, up 10% from the year ago period. Backlog adjustments during the year totaled $215 million[ph] with approximately $50 million of that related to currency exchange rates.
Just to clarify, my P&L walk is on a non-GAAP basis. The GAAP versus non-non-GAAP reconciliation can be found in our press release.
In summary, fiscal year GAAP operating earnings were approximately $27 million lower than the non-GAAP earnings due to restructuring, amortization of intangible assets, acquisition-related cost and certain litigation costs.
Also for comparison purposes, we have provided in the press release a GAAP versus non-GAAP reconciliation for 2014 and 2015 by quarter.
Before I walk you through the numbers, let me just say that exchange rates wreaked havoc on our 2015 results. We estimate that on a constant currency basis, our reported results would have improved as follows: Orders would have been up by about $175 million; revenues would have been up by about $140 million; and on the earnings front, our operating margin would have been about 1 point higher.
Let me point out that this FX impact was felt primarily in Oncology Systems. On top of this, as Dow explained, currency driven price erosion had a huge impact on our Imaging Components business and that effect is incremental to the numbers that I just give you.
Now turning to the P&L. Fourth quarter revenues for the total company increased 1% in dollars and increased 6% in constant currency. Total company revenues in the Americas were down 1% in dollars and flat in constant currency. EMEA revenues were up 5% in dollars but up 18% in constant currency. And APAC revenues were down 2% in dollars and up 5% in constant currency.
For the year, total company revenues were up 2% in dollars and up 6% in constant currency.
Oncology Systems posted a 2% increase in revenues during the quarter, up 9% in constant currency. And for the year, oncology revenues were flat with the year-ago period in dollars and up 6% in constant currency.
Imaging Components posted a fourth quarter revenue decline of 8% with a 5% increase in X-ray tubes, flat revenues in panel products and a 57% decline in our Security and Inspection Products. For the year, Imaging Components revenues were down 7% from the year-ago period with tubes down 1%; flat panels, down 4%; and security products, down 37%. Revenues for the other category increased from the year-ago quarter as we continued production and installation of several proton projects that are in our backlog.
Total company gross margin sales by nearly 3 points to 38.9% for the quarter and by more than 1 point to 41.4% for the year. Currency exchange rates, price erosion in Imaging Components add a higher mix of lower margin proton revenue led to these declines. Oncology Systems gross margin decreased more than 2 points in the quarter and nearly 1 point for the year due almost entirely to current exchange rates.
Given the ongoing strength of the dollar, we believe Oncology's gross margin will remain at about 43% for 2016.
The Imaging Components gross margin for the quarter fell by nearly 5 percentage points to 38.9% due largely to pricing and mix. For the year, Imaging Components gross margin decreased by more than a point to 41% also due to pricing and mix. Given the pricing pressures we are experiencing, the 2016 gross margin for this business is likely to remain in the high 30s.
Fourth quarter SG&A expenses were about 15% of revenues, down almost a point as a percent of revenues from a year-ago quarter. For the year, SG&A expenses were about even with the year-ago period at 15% of revenue.
Fourth quarter R&D expenses were $69 million or 8% of revenues, up about 1 point as a percentage of revenue with the year-ago quarter. And for the year, R&D expenses were about even as a percentage of revenue at 8%.
Moving down the income statement. Fourth quarter operating earnings totaled $135 million or 17% of revenues. For the year, operating earnings totaled $576 million or 18.6% of revenues. On a constant currency basis, the operating margin was approximately 1 point higher.
Depreciation and amortization totaled $90 million[ph] for the quarter and $69 million for the year. The effective tax rate was 25% for the quarter and 26% for the year, both down significantly from the prior year periods due to geographic mix of products, the use of German tax loss carry-forwards and the unusually high 2014 rate.
Fully diluted shares outstanding decreased from the year-ago quarter to 99 million shares due largely to our ongoing share repurchase program. Diluted non-GAAP EPS was $1.04[ph] for the fourth quarter and $4.29 for the fiscal year. The strong U.S. dollar negatively impacted our non-GAAP EPS by approximately $0.15 in the fourth quarter and approximately $0.40 for the fiscal year.
Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $845 million, debt of $496 million and stockholders' equity of $1.7 billion.
DSO at 90 was up 5 days from the year-ago quarter. Cash flow from operations was $153 million for the quarter and $470 million for the fiscal year. Primary uses of cash during the quarter, were $128 million for the repurchase 1.5 million shares of stock. At the end of the quarter, we had 1.4 million shares remaining under the existing repurchase authorization that extends through calendar year 2015.
Now I'll turn it back to Dow for the outlook."

For the first quarter of fiscal 2016, we expect revenues to be roughly even with the year-ago quarter in dollars. With ongoing challenges experienced by Imaging Components in the second half of fiscal year 2015, as well as the effect of year-over-year changes in currency exchange rates, we expect non-GAAP earnings for the first quarter of fiscal year 2016 to be in the range of $0.88 to $0.92 per diluted share.
In summary, we believe that Oncology Systems is on the right track for continued steady profitable growth and that we have real momentum in our Particle Therapy business. We're focusing now on getting Imaging Components back on track.

The other impact in the guidance this year versus last year is also we're continuing to have some FX impact in our first half, and that's really concentrated in Q1 because the FX rates really didn't change that much until we got into our second quarter last year. So we are facing a Q1 headwind on FX, that should start to stabilize as we get further into the fiscal year and we anticipate about $0.15 on the full fiscal year '16."

So those were about split roughly even. So that alone would add $0.25 to the number due to ICD and FX. You're correct that we did have that $0.10 push out of Q4. And when you add to that back, you'll see we're kind of that mid-single digits if you were to do all of that math, mid-single-digit EPS growth on an apples-to-apples basis. And I would look back and look historically, Q1 has always been right around 20% to 22% of our total year, that's exactly what this Q1 is. I think last year was a bit of an anomaly, where our Q1 given an unrealistic gross margin we had in Oncology, it was a good thing that quarter, but it ended up being closer to 25% of our total fiscal year. So it gives me confidence that we're kind of in that historical range of about 20% of our year."

Historically, it's been a terrific business for us with very good growth and company-wide best operating profit. And cash generation's also been very good. So we still love the flat panel and the tube part of the business. The security part of the business is very profitable. The profitability of that business hasn't changed, but it's very cyclical and we get some big turns there. We like the fact that we're the leader in digital imaging technology. And so we've got both a strong product portfolio, as well as scale in the business. And there are synergies with our Oncology business. The Oncology is the second largest customer of that business, about 10%, 12% of the product cost of our Oncology business comes from our Components business, over 1,500 tubes and panels a year. So there are some vertical integration that we look at. I think what's happened is this business experienced the FX change in a different way than the rest of the world is experiencing it. Since more than 75% of the business is outside of the U.S. and largely Japan and Europe, and since it's almost entirely denominated in dollars, there was no FX constant currency adjustment to make in to the business. And so the way that was felt was in pricing as I said in the script. So clearly, that's what we're going to be watching where this business goes. We have 1 customer in source, as I said on the call. We've been through the rest of our pipeline, we've got contracts with everybody else. We feel like the rest of the business is secure. We're working very hard on some of the new product costs, some new products that will drive some feature and benefits, give us a little chance to hit the price as well as give us some cost reduction. And you've seen some acquisitions from us in this space this year. Those acquisitions are enhancing the portfolio and given us some scale and they're executing ahead of our internal plans by a little bit. They're $50 million[ph] together Claymount and Mavis, so it's not huge, but we like what they're doing for us. I think the key for us to watch here in 2016 is where do this price go. It's pretty stable in the dynamic sections of the market, in the radiographic piece of the market. It -- there's a lot of competitors, there is a need for some consolidation in this market and we're going to be watching that over 2016."

But to see these papers that I mentioned in the script come out, documenting both the efficiency improvement as well as the quality improvement have been dynamite. And that's a big deal. Second, as we go into our environment that's uncertain from a reimbursement point of view, total cost to ownership is everything. And the Varian advantage there is there's nobody close to us with that. There will be some niche products out there that probably get some play in some segments, but I think people are still going to be looking at value for money and how to stretch their capital dollars. I think the strength of our product line from top to bottom on the hardware side is very good.

Quarterly comparisons are for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 versus the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014. References to financial results for orders are to gross orders, unless otherwise indicated.
Beginning this quarter, the company is reporting non-GAAP results in order to provide quarter-over-quarter comparisons of operational performance, excluding unusual items. A reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP measure is included in our earnings release, which can be accessed on our website. Please be advised that this presentation and discussion contains forward-looking statements. Our use of words and phrases such as outlook, believe, expect, anticipate, could, should, will, promising and similar expressions are intended to identify those statements which represent our current judgment on future performance or other future matters. While we believe them to be reasonable based on information currently available to us, these statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially.
Some of the important risks relating to our business are described in our fourth quarter earnings release and in our filings with the SEC. We assume no obligation to update or revise the forward-looking statements in this presentation and discussion because of new information, future events or otherwise.

As you will have seen from the prerelease that we issued ahead of our Investor Meeting at ASTRO last week, the fourth quarter was marked by some earnings challenges as well as order successes in 2 of our 3 businesses.
In summary, we are reporting non-GAAP net earnings of $1.04 per diluted share, up from $1.03 in the year-ago quarter. Revenues of $818 million, up 1% in dollars and 6% in constant currency. Oncology gross order growth of 5% in constant currency. Orders totaling more than $135 million for 3 proton therapy systems and significant declines in orders and revenues for our Imaging Components business.
Focusing on operational highlights in our Oncology business, gross orders totaled $919 million for the quarter, equal in dollars and up 5% in constant currency versus the strong year-ago quarter. Orders for the fiscal year totaled $2.7 billion, equal with the prior year, but up 6% in constant currency, in line with our long-term mid-single-digit growth expectations for this business.
Orders in the Americas for the quarter declined by 5% in dollars in constant currency versus the year-ago period when we booked a large part of the Brazil tender. For the year, orders in the Americas were up 1% in dollars in constant currency, and North America orders grew by 4% in the quarter and 3% for the year.
In EMEA, orders grew 13% in dollars and a robust 25% in constant currency during the quarter. For the year, orders in EMEA were even with the year-ago period in dollars and up 12% in constant currency.
Gross orders in APAC were down by 3% in dollars, but up 6% in constant currency for the quarter. Annual APAC orders were even with the prior year in dollars and up 9% in constant currency.
We gained share against the competition in all 3 regions of the world for the year. Our team in EMEA set a record by booking orders for over a 100 accelerators with strength across the region. In the U.K., the National Health Service selected Varian to supply up to 20 TrueBeam systems. In Poland, we booked orders to supply 11 public radiotherapy centers with TrueBeam systems and software replacing older Siemens systems. In India, we booked the first tranche of a 5-year 18 accelerator order, including an EDGE radiosurgery system. We will book the remaining tranches when our delivery dates come within our 2-year booking window.
In APAC, a customer in Japan placed an order for 3 TrueBeam systems together with our new RapidPlan and InSightive Analytics software products. In North America, our oncology team had several nice wins from customers, including Memorial Sloan Kettering, Alliance Oncology and Cleveland Clinic. Competitive takeouts added to our orders for the quarter and for the year.
In North America alone, we estimate that we generated over $150 million in orders during the year to replace hardware and software products from our competitors. Over 40 sites switched from other suppliers to our Eclipse Treatment Planning software during the year.
As you know, we have just returned from ASTRO in San Antonio. It was a great show for us with terrific customer response to our exhibit. Our booth was the busiest at the show and we had over 800 attendees at our users meeting. During the show, we provided a glimpse of the next big breakthrough, high-definition radiotherapy and radiosurgery. This is a new 4Pi technique that will compress more dose into the tumor while protecting much more of the surrounding healthy tissue. Clinicians working with TrueBeam's UNIQUE developer mode are using simultaneous motions of the treatment gantry and patient couch to get a huge increase in the number of beam angles available for targeting the tumor.
High-definition radiotherapy is under trial at UCLA and is not yet ready for broad commercialization. We expect that high-definition treatments, coupled with our multimodality imaging capabilities at the treatment console, will make a much bigger gain in the fight against cancer than is possible with an expensive hybrid device, combining MR imaging and limited treatment delivery.
On the imaging front, we also exhibited iterative cone-beam CT technology, which is showing great promise to improve the quality of imaging for planning and guiding treatments. This capability also generated a lot of excitement in our booth at ASTRO.
Varian's industry-leading RapidPlan software, which has already been ordered at over 300 sites, was the hit at the show. As we pointed out at our investor meeting there, numerous independent clinical studies show impressive time savings and quality that is equal to or better than plans generated manually.
At University of Michigan, RapidPlan has enabled complex spine SBRT plans to be generated in 15 to 20 minutes instead of the usual 60 to 90 minutes.
At the Royal Surrey Hospital in the U.K., the use of RapidPlan reduced treatment planning time by a factor of 5 and resulted in plans that were deemed equivalent or better 90% of the time. With RapidPlan, a dosimetrist can help 5x as many patients as could be done with conventional planning products. This is a product that could help new centers in emerging markets get up to speed with high quality planning very quickly.
There are nearly 4,000 cancer centers worldwide using our Eclipse Treatment Planning software and each of these is a potential candidate for RapidPlan. So we expect it to help drive significant growth in software sales. We have developed RapidPlan disease site models for a number of cancers, including prostate, head and neck and lung and there are more to come.
To strengthen our treatment planning offerings, we acquired HyperDrive software technology during the quarter to improve the quality of prescriptions and accelerate the planning process. Our new VitalBeam product received FDA 510(k) and CE Mark approvals during the quarter. We received several VitalBeam orders and early signs are that this affordable extension of the TrueBeam platform will be a winner, particularly in the emerging markets. TrueBeam now comprises more than 70% of our global accelerator orders and 90% of our accelerator orders in the U.S.
Before I leave Oncology Systems, I want to draw your attention to a groundbreaking study issued by the Lancet Oncology Commission, highlighting the global need for more radiotherapy equipment. According to this report, by 2035, there will be 25 million new cases of cancer diagnosed annually and we will need to supply the world with more than 20,000 new machines to equip new centers as well as replace aging infrastructure. The need is greatest in low- and middle-income countries. The report is recommending that by 2020, 80% of these countries should establish national cancer plans and make radiotherapy part of their universal health coverage. Over the next 10 years, the commission recommends investing $46 billion in these countries to expand radiotherapy capacity. This will require education and training of thousands of doctors, physicists and therapists. Varian has established a market development team that is partnering with governments, financiers, clinicians and patient advocacy groups to support this effort.
Let me now turn to proton therapy, which drew a lot of customer attention at ASTRO. We have real momentum in this business. In the fourth quarter, we booked more than $135 million in orders for 3 multi-room systems, including 2 in the U.K. and 1 in New York. This brought the number of proton orders booked in the year to 6 systems, totaling more than $300 million. At this point, we have 11 projects in backlog and we are currently working on more than 6 installations. Treatments are expected to commence at the University of Maryland early next year, which will bring the total number of centers treating patients with Varian proton technology to 4.
The key to making the proton therapy business profitable are continued success in the market, reducing product costs and scaling up the service business. We feel like we have momentum in these areas.
Let me now turn to Imaging Components, where orders shrank by 30% to $165 million for the quarter, resulting in a full year orders decline of 16% for this business. This was another challenging quarter in an exceedingly tough year, particularly in our Security and Inspection business. Orders for panels were down for the quarter and for the year, driven primarily by price. Unit volumes for these products were up slightly from the prior year.
Our Imaging Components competitors are largely European and Japanese. They got about a 20% reduction in their cost structure due to foreign exchange movement. They're using this to grab market share. Customers are looking for lower price alternatives, including in-sourcing. In fact, one customer has elected to in-source and the impact of this loss in fiscal year 2016 will be about $50 million of revenue.
The Security and Inspection Products business was also down sharply with annual orders off versus the previous year by about $60 million, representing a decline of more than 55%. The Security business remains profitable and we're looking at a lot of options for getting the business back on track.
To address the ongoing challenges for the overall business, we have initiated numerous corrective actions to make our product lines and operations more cost competitive. These include restructuring to rightsize the business, accelerating product development, including a new low-cost flat panel and stepping up marketing efforts, particularly in Asia. We are opening a facility near Shanghai to support a rapidly expanding X-ray equipment manufacturing industry in China.
On a positive note, we feel very good about 2 new acquisitions we have made to complement our Imaging Components business, MeVis and Claymount. In fiscal year 2016, we're looking for about $50 million of revenues from these products and they are both off to a good start.
Now I'll turn it over to Elisha."

Before I walk you through the P&L, let me touch on the backlog.The company ended the fiscal year with a $3.5 billion backlog, up 10% from the year-ago period. Backlog adjustments during the year totaled $215 million, wi",939,"Thanks, Dow, and hello, everyone. Before I walk you through the P&L, let me touch on the backlog.
The company ended the fiscal year with a $3.5 billion backlog, up 10% from the year-ago period. Backlog adjustments during the year totaled $215 million, with approximately $50 million of that related to currency exchange rates.
Just to clarify, my P&L walk is on a non-GAAP basis. The GAAP versus non-GAAP reconciliation can be found in our press release.
In summary, fiscal year GAAP operating earnings were approximately $27 million lower than non-GAAP earnings due to restructuring, amortization of intangible assets, acquisition-related cost and certain litigation costs.
Also for comparison purposes, we have provided in the press release a GAAP versus non-GAAP reconciliation for 2014 and 2015 by quarter.
Before I walk you through the numbers, let me just say that exchange rates wreaked havoc on our 2015 results. We estimate that on a constant currency basis, our reported results would have improved as follows: orders would have been up by about $175 million; revenues would have been up by about $140 million; and on the earnings front, our operating margin would have been about 1 point higher.
Let me point out that this FX impact was felt primarily in Oncology Systems. On top of this, as Dow explained, currency-driven price erosion had a huge impact on our Imaging Components business and that effect is incremental to the numbers that I just give you.
Now turning to the P&L. Fourth quarter revenues for the total company increased 1% in dollars and increased 6% in constant currency. Total company revenues in the Americas were down 1% in dollars and flat in constant currency. EMEA revenues were up 5% in dollars, but up 18% in constant currency. And APAC revenues were down 2% in dollars and up 5% in constant currency. For the year, total company revenues were up 2% in dollars and up 6% in constant currency.
Oncology Systems posted a 2% increase in revenues during the quarter, up 9% in constant currency. And for the year, Oncology revenues were flat with the year-ago period in dollars and up 6% in constant currency.
Imaging Components posted a fourth quarter revenue decline of 8% with a 5% increase in X-ray tubes, flat revenues in panel products and a 57% decline in our Security and Inspection Products. For the year, Imaging Components revenues were down 7% from the year-ago period with tubes down 1%, flat panels down 4%, and security products down 37%. Revenues for the other category increased from the year-ago quarter, as we continued production and installation of several proton projects that are in our backlog.
Total company gross margin fell by nearly 3 points to 38.9% for the quarter and by more than 1 point to 41.4% for the year. Currency exchange rates, price erosion in Imaging Components and a higher mix of lower margin proton revenue led to these declines. Oncology Systems gross margin decreased more than 2 points in the quarter and nearly 1 point for the year, due almost entirely to currency exchange rates.
Given the ongoing strength of the dollar, we believe Oncology's gross margin will remain at about 43% for 2016.
The Imaging Components gross margin for the quarter fell by nearly 5 percentage points to 38.9% due largely to pricing and mix. For the year, Imaging Components gross margin decreased by more than a point to 41%, also due to pricing and mix. Given the pricing pressures we are experiencing, the 2016 gross margin for this business is likely to remain in the high 30s.
Fourth quarter SG&A expenses were about 15% of revenues, down almost a point as a percentage of revenues from the year-ago quarter. For the year, SG&A expenses were about even with the year-ago period at 15% of revenue.
Fourth quarter R&D expenses were $69 million or 8% of revenues, up about 1 point as a percentage of revenue with the year-ago quarter. And for the year, R&D expenses were about even as a percentage of revenue at 8%.
Moving down the income statement. Fourth quarter operating earnings totaled $135 million or 17% of revenues. For the year, operating earnings totaled $576 million or 18.6% of revenues. On a constant currency basis, the operating margin was approximately 1 point higher.
Depreciation and amortization totaled $19 million for the quarter and $69 million for the year. The effective tax rate was 25% for the quarter and 26% for the year, both down significantly from the prior periods due to geographic mix of products, the use of German tax loss carryforwards and the unusually high 2014 rate.
Fully diluted shares outstanding decreased from the year-ago quarter to 99 million shares, due largely to our ongoing share repurchase program. Diluted non-GAAP EPS was $1.04 for the fourth quarter and $4.29 for the fiscal year. The strong U.S. dollar negatively impacted our non-GAAP EPS by approximately $0.15 in the fourth quarter and approximately $0.40 for the fiscal year.
Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $845 million, debt of $496 million and stockholders' equity of $1.7 billion.
DSO at 90 was up 5 days from the year-ago quarter. Cash flow from operations was $153 million for the quarter and $470 million for the fiscal year. Primary uses of cash during the quarter were $128 million for the repurchase of 1.5 million shares of stock. At the end of the quarter, we had 1.4 million shares remaining under the existing repurchase authorization that extends through calendar year 2015.
Now I'll turn it back to Dow for the outlook."

For the first quarter of fiscal 2016, we expect revenues to be roughly even with the year-ago quarter in dollars. With ongoing challenges experienced by Imaging Components in the second half of fiscal year 2015 as well as the effect of year-over-year changes in currency exchange rates, we expect non-GAAP earnings for the first quarter of fiscal year 2016 to be in the range of $0.88 to $0.92 per diluted share.
In summary, we believe that Oncology Systems is on the right track for continued steady profitable growth and that we have real momentum in our Particle Therapy business. We're focusing now on getting Imaging Components back on track.

So the market is probably in the 3%-ish range and you were coming in the 5% to 6% constant currency adjusted range. I think, as you saw at ASTRO, we are very comfortable with our product portfolio and the position we have across the product line. I think it's as strong as our product line has ever been, and very encouraged by the reception we had at ASTRO.

So the full year is -- it remains as we talked about last week at the $4.45 to $4.55.

So the full year is -- it remains as we talked about last week at the $4.45 to $4.55. For Q1, if I take that $0.90 at the midpoint, we estimate there is about a 25% impact just because if we look at the quarter-over-quarter comparisons from last year, ICD had not suffered the pricing declines in Q1 and the dollar-euro rate were significantly different. So those were about split roughly even. So that alone would add $0.25 to the number due to ICD and FX. You're correct that we did have that $0.10 push out of Q4. And when you add that back, you'll see we're kind of that mid-single-digit if you were to do all of that math, mid-single-digit EPS growth on an apples-to-apples basis. And I went back and looked historically, Q1 has always been right around 20% to 22% of our total year, that's exactly what this Q1 is. I think last year was a bit of an anomaly, where our Q1, given an unrealistic gross margin we had in Oncology. It was a good thing that quarter, but it ended up being closer to 25% of our total fiscal year. So it gives me confidence that we're kind of in that historical range at about 20% of our year."

Historically, it's been a terrific business for us with very good growth and company-wide best operating profit. And cash generation has also been very good. So we still love the flat panel and tube part of the business. The security part of the business is very profitable. The profitability of that business hasn't changed, but it's very cyclical and we get some big turns there. We like the fact that we're the leader in digital imaging technology, and so we've got both a strong product portfolio as well as scale in the business. And there are synergies with our Oncology business. The -- Oncology is the second largest customer of that business. About 10 -- 12% of the product cost of our Oncology business comes from our Components business, over 1,500 tubes and panels a year. So there's some vertical integration that we look at. I think what's happened is this business experienced the FX change in a different way than the rest of the world is experiencing it. Since it -- since more than 75% of the business is outside of the U.S. and largely Japan and Europe, and since it's almost entirely denominated in dollars, there was no FX constant currency adjustment to make into the business. And so the way that was felt was, was in pricing, as I said in the script. So clearly, that's what we're going to be watching where this business goes. We have had one customer in-source, as I said on the call. We've been through the rest of our pipeline. We've got contracts with everybody else. We feel like the rest of the business is secure. We're working very hard on some new product costs -- some new products that will drive some feature and benefit, give us little chance to hit the price as well as give us some cost reduction. And you've seen some acquisitions from us in this space this year. Those acquisitions are enhancing the portfolio giving us some scale and they're executing ahead of our internal plans by a little bit. They're almost $50 million together, Claymount and MeVis, so it's not huge. But we like what they're doing for us. I think the key for us to watch here in 2016 is where does this price go. It's pretty stable in the dynamic sections of the market, in the radiographic piece of the market. It's -- there's a lot of competitors. There is a need for some consolidation in this market and it's -- we're going to be watching that over 2016."

So that's encouraging. Claymount is a little more hardware. It's largely a cable and connector business. It's very synergistic with our tube business, has the same customer list that we have and again, an opportunity there to kind of take that product line globally with our distribution and drive some growth. Also very good teams. The MeVis teams have very, very good software development team in Germany. The Claymount team, very low manufacturing cost in the Philippines.

But on the software side, the informatics side, maybe there are some things. And then we're going to continue to hunt as well the component space. We think scale matters there as the industry consolidates. It's been a rough year, but we've had terrific growth in this business. We've now -- we believe that we're the largest manufacturer in the world of tubes and panels even given some of the insourcing that the big radiology companies do.

I know you're going through the reorganized ICB. But are there still opportunities to push manufacturing cost down on the Oncology side, number one? And number two, Kolleen kind of alluded last week to some of those Brazil orders starting to come out into the P&L, or maybe it was Elisha, sorry, last week, those Brazilian orders starting to come out into the P&L in '16.

I'd say the vast majority of it's done here in Palo Alto. We have some capability in China, and we're building some capability in Brazil. So the -- China and Brazil will bring the cost per unit of that down, but we're still very significant here in Palo Alto. But the real cost opportunity's on the supply chain side. We made very good progress on that in 2015, and that continues to be a focus area for us. I'm pretty pleased with the variable cost productivity we're getting in Oncology.

As you will have seen from the prerelease that we issued ahead of our Investor Meeting at ASTRO last week, the fourth quarter was marked by some earnings challenges as well as order successes in 2 of our 3 businesses.
In summary, we are reporting non-GAAP net earnings of $1.04 per diluted share, up from $1.03 in the year-ago quarter. Revenues of $818 million, up 1% in dollars and 6% in constant currency. Oncology gross order growth of 5% in constant currency. Orders totaling more than $135 million for 3 proton therapy systems and significant declines in orders and revenues for our Imaging Components business.
Focusing on operational highlights in our Oncology business, gross orders totaled $919 million for the quarter, equal in dollars and up 5% in constant currency versus the strong year-ago quarter. Orders for the fiscal year totaled $2.7 billion, equal with the prior year, but up 6% in constant currency, in line with our long-term mid-single-digit growth expectations for this business.
Orders in the Americas for the quarter declined by 5% in dollars and constant currency versus the year-ago period when we booked a large part of the Brazil tender. For the year, orders in the Americas were up 1% in dollars and constant currency. In North America, orders grew by 4% in the quarter and 3% for the year.
In EMEA, orders grew 13% in dollars and a robust 25% in constant currency during the quarter. For the year, orders in EMEA were even with the year-ago period in dollars and up 12% in constant currency.
Gross orders in APAC were down by 3% in dollars, but up 6% in constant currency for the quarter. Annual APAC orders were even with the prior year in dollars and up 9% in constant currency.
We gained share against the competition in all 3 regions of the world for the year. Our team in EMEA set a record by booking orders for over 100 accelerators with strength across the region. In the U.K., the National Health Service selected Varian to supply up to 20 TrueBeam systems. In Poland, we booked orders to supply 11 public radiotherapy centers with TrueBeam systems and software replacing older Siemens systems. In India, we booked the first tranche of a 5-year 18 accelerator order, including an EDGE radiosurgery system. We will book the remaining tranches when their delivery dates come within our 2-year booking window.
In APAC, a customer in Japan placed an order for 3 TrueBeam systems together with our new RapidPlan and InSightive Analytics software products. In North America, our oncology team had several nice wins from customers, including Memorial Sloan Kettering, Alliance Oncology and Cleveland Clinic. Competitive takeouts added to our orders for the quarter and for the year.
In North America alone, we estimate that we generated over $150 million in orders during the year to replace hardware and software products from our competitors. Over 40 sites switched from other suppliers to our Eclipse Treatment Planning software during the year.
As you know, we have just returned from ASTRO in San Antonio. It was a great show for us with terrific customer response to our exhibit. Our booth was the busiest at the show and we had over 800 attendees at our users meeting. During the show, we provided a glimpse of the next big breakthrough, high-definition radiotherapy and radiosurgery. This is a new 4Pi technique that will compress more dose into the tumor while protecting much more of the surrounding healthy tissue. Clinicians working with TrueBeam's UNIQUE developer mode are using simultaneous motions at the treatment gantry and patient couch to get a huge increase in the number of beam angles available for targeting the tumor.
High-definition radiotherapy is under trial at UCLA and is not yet ready for broad commercialization. We expect that high-definition treatments, coupled with our multimodality imaging capabilities at the treatment console, will make a much bigger gain in the fight against cancer than is possible with an expensive hybrid device combining MR imaging and limited treatment delivery.
On the imaging front, we also exhibited iterative cone-beam CT technology, which is showing great promise to improve the quality of imaging for planning and guiding treatments. This capability also generated a lot of excitement in our booth at ASTRO.
Varian's industry-leading RapidPlan software, which has already been ordered at over 300 sites, was the hit of the show. As we pointed out at our Investor Meeting there, numerous independent clinical studies show impressive time savings and quality that is equal to or better than plans generated manually.
At University of Michigan, RapidPlan has enabled complex spine SBRT plans to be generated in 15 to 20 minutes instead of the usual 60 to 90 minutes.
At the Royal Surrey Hospital in the U.K., the use of RapidPlan reduced treatment planning time by a factor of 5 and resulted in plans that were deemed equivalent or better 90% of the time. With RapidPlan, a dosimetrist can help 5x as many patients as could be done with conventional planning products. This is a product that could help new centers in emerging markets get up to speed with high-quality planning very quickly.
There are nearly 4,000 cancer centers worldwide using our Eclipse Treatment Planning software and each of these is a potential candidate for RapidPlan, so we expect it to help drive significant growth in software sales. We have developed RapidPlan disease site models for a number of cancers, including prostate, head and neck and lung and there are more to come.
To strengthen our treatment planning offerings, we acquired HyperDrive software technology during the quarter to improve the quality of prescriptions and accelerate the planning process. Our new VitalBeam product received FDA 510(k) and CE Mark approvals during the quarter. We have received several VitalBeam orders and early signs are that this affordable extension of the TrueBeam platform will be a winner, particularly in the emerging markets. TrueBeam now comprises more than 70% of our global accelerator orders and 90% of our accelerator orders in the U.S.
Before I leave Oncology Systems, I want to draw your attention to a groundbreaking study issued by the Lancet Oncology Commission highlighting the global need for more radiotherapy equipment. According to this report, by 2035, there will be 25 million new cases of cancer diagnosed annually and we will need to supply the world with more than 20,000 new machines to equip new centers as well as replace aging infrastructure. The need is greatest in low- and middle-income countries. The report is recommending that by 2020, 80% of these countries should establish national cancer plans and make radiotherapy part of their universal health coverage. Over the next 10 years, the commission recommends investing $46 billion in these countries to expand radiotherapy capacity. This will require education and training of thousands of doctors, physicists and therapists. Varian has established a market development team that is partnering with governments, financiers, clinicians and patient advocacy groups to support this effort.
Let me now turn to proton therapy, which drew a lot of customer attention at ASTRO. We have real momentum in this business. In the fourth quarter, we booked more than $135 million in orders for 3 multi-room systems, including 2 in the U.K. and 1 in New York. This brought the number of proton orders booked in the year to 6 systems, totaling more than $300 million. At this point, we have 11 projects in backlog and we are currently working on more than 6 installations. Treatments are expected to commence at the University of Maryland early next year, which will bring the total number of centers treating patients with Varian proton technology to 4.
The key to making the proton therapy business profitable are continued success in the market, reducing product costs and scaling up the service business. We feel like we have momentum in these areas.
Let me now turn to Imaging Components, where orders shrank by 30% to $165 million for the quarter, resulting in a full year orders decline of 16% for this business. This was another challenging quarter in an exceedingly tough year, particularly in our Security and Inspection business. Orders for panels were down for the quarter and for the year, driven primarily by price. Unit volumes for these products were up slightly from the prior year.
Our Imaging Components competitors are largely European and Japanese. They got about a 20% reduction in their cost structure due to foreign exchange movement. They're using this to grab market share. Customers are looking for lower price alternatives, including in-sourcing. In fact, one customer has elected to in-source and the impact of this loss in fiscal year 2016 will be about $50 million of revenue.
The Security and Inspection Products business was also down sharply with annual orders off versus the previous year by about $60 million, representing a decline of more than 55%. The Security business remains profitable and we're looking at a lot of options for getting the business back on track.
To address the ongoing challenges for the overall business, we have initiated numerous corrective actions to make our product lines and operations more cost competitive. These include restructuring to rightsize the business, accelerating product development, including a new low-cost flat panel and stepping up marketing efforts, particularly in Asia. We are opening a facility near Shanghai to support a rapidly expanding X-ray equipment manufacturing industry in China.
On a positive note, we feel very good about 2 new acquisitions we have made to complement our Imaging Components business, MeVis and Claymount. In fiscal year 2016, we're looking for about $50 million of revenues from these products and they are both off to a good start.
Now I'll turn it over to Elisha."

Backlog adjustments during the year totaled $215 million, wi",939,"Thanks, Dow, and hello, everyone. Before I walk you through the P&L, let me touch on the backlog.
The company ended the fiscal year with a $3.5 billion backlog, up 10% from the year-ago period. Backlog adjustments during the year totaled $215 million, with approximately $50 million of that related to currency exchange rates.
Just to clarify, my P&L walk is on a non-GAAP basis. The GAAP versus non-GAAP reconciliation can be found in our press release.
In summary, fiscal year GAAP operating earnings were approximately $27 million lower than non-GAAP earnings due to restructuring, amortization of intangible assets, acquisition-related cost and certain litigation costs.
Also for comparison purposes, we have provided in the press release a GAAP versus non-GAAP reconciliation for 2014 and 2015 by quarter.
Before I walk you through the numbers, let me just say that exchange rates wreaked havoc on our 2015 results. We estimate that on a constant currency basis, our reported results would have improved as follows: orders would have been up by about $175 million; revenues would have been up by about $140 million; and on the earnings front, our operating margin would have been about 1 point higher.
Let me point out that this FX impact was felt primarily in Oncology Systems. On top of this, as Dow explained, currency-driven price erosion had a huge impact on our Imaging Components business and that effect is incremental to the numbers that I just gave you.
Now turning to the P&L. Fourth quarter revenues for the total company increased 1% in dollars and increased 6% in constant currency. Total company revenues in the Americas were down 1% in dollars and flat in constant currency. EMEA revenues were up 5% in dollars, but up 18% in constant currency. And APAC revenues were down 2% in dollars and up 5% in constant currency. For the year, total company revenues were up 2% in dollars and up 6% in constant currency.
Oncology Systems posted a 2% increase in revenues during the quarter, up 9% in constant currency. And for the year, Oncology revenues were flat with the year-ago period in dollars and up 6% in constant currency.
Imaging Components posted a fourth quarter revenue decline of 8% with a 5% increase in X-ray tubes, flat revenues in panel products and a 57% decline in our Security and Inspection Products. For the year, Imaging Components revenues were down 7% from the year-ago period with tubes down 1%, flat panels down 4% and Security Products down 37%. Revenues for the other category increased from the year-ago quarter, as we continued production and installation of several proton projects that are in our backlog.
Total company gross margin fell by nearly 3 points to 38.9% for the quarter and by more than 1 point to 41.4% for the year. Currency exchange rates, price erosion in Imaging Components and a higher mix of lower margin proton revenue led to these declines. Oncology Systems gross margin decreased more than 2 points in the quarter and nearly 1 point for the year, due almost entirely to currency exchange rates.
Given the ongoing strength of the dollar, we believe Oncology's gross margin will remain at about 43% for 2016.
The Imaging Components gross margin for the quarter fell by nearly 5 percentage points to 38.9% due largely to pricing and mix. For the year, Imaging Components gross margin decreased by more than a point to 41%, also due to pricing and mix. Given the pricing pressures we are experiencing, the 2016 gross margin for this business is likely to remain in the high 30s.
Fourth quarter SG&A expenses were about 15% of revenues, down almost a point as a percentage of revenues from the year-ago quarter. For the year, SG&A expenses were about even with the year-ago period at 15% of revenue.
Fourth quarter R&D expenses were $69 million or 8% of revenues, up about 1 point as a percentage of revenue with the year-ago quarter. And for the year, R&D expenses were about even as a percentage of revenue at 8%.
Moving down the income statement. Fourth quarter operating earnings totaled $135 million or 17% of revenues. For the year, operating earnings totaled $576 million or 18.6% of revenues. On a constant currency basis, the operating margin was approximately 1 point higher.
Depreciation and amortization totaled $19 million for the quarter and $69 million for the year. The effective tax rate was 25% for the quarter and 26% for the year, both down significantly from the prior periods due to geographic mix of products, the use of German tax loss carryforwards and the unusually high 2014 rate.
Fully diluted shares outstanding decreased from the year-ago quarter to 99 million shares, due largely to our ongoing share repurchase program. Diluted non-GAAP EPS was $1.04 for the fourth quarter and $4.29 for the fiscal year. The strong U.S. dollar negatively impacted our non-GAAP EPS by approximately $0.15 in the fourth quarter and approximately $0.40 for the fiscal year.
Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $845 million, debt of $496 million and stockholders' equity of $1.7 billion.
DSO at 90 was up 5 days from the year-ago quarter. Cash flow from operations was $153 million for the quarter and $470 million for the fiscal year. Primary uses of cash during the quarter were $128 million for the repurchase of 1.5 million shares of stock. At the end of the quarter, we had 1.4 million shares remaining under the existing repurchase authorization that extends through calendar year 2015.
Now I'll turn it back to Dow for the outlook."

For the first quarter of fiscal 2016, we expect revenues to be roughly even with the year-ago quarter in dollars. With ongoing challenges experienced by Imaging Components in the second half of fiscal year 2015 as well as the effect of year-over-year changes in currency exchange rates, we expect non-GAAP earnings for the first quarter of fiscal year 2016 to be in the range of $0.88 to $0.92 per diluted share.
In summary, we believe that Oncology Systems is on the right track for continued steady profitable growth and that we have real momentum in our Particle Therapy business. We're focusing now on getting Imaging Components back on track.

So when you kind of peel the onion on it, we were very comfortable with where we saw the U.S. market at in the fourth quarter. And all year, it was kind of -- we did gain some shares, so maybe half of the increment is share gain and half is market growth. So the market is probably in the 3%-ish range and we're coming in the 5%, 6% constant currency adjusted range. I think as you saw at ASTRO, we are very comfortable with our product portfolio and the position we have across the product line. I think it's as strong as our product line has ever been, and we're very encouraged by the reception we had at ASTRO. So going into ASTRO, I would have said maybe we can maintain share after a pretty big share gain. But coming out of ASTRO, we are more bullish than ever.

The other impact in the guidance this year versus last year is also we are continuing to have some FX impact in our first half, and that's really concentrated in Q1 because the FX rates really didn't change that much until we got into our second quarter last year. So we are facing a Q1 headwind on FX, that should start to stabilize as we get further into the fiscal year and we anticipate about $0.15 on the full fiscal year '16."

So those were about split roughly even. So that alone would add $0.25 to the number due to ICB and FX. You're correct that we did have that $0.10 push out of Q4. And when you add that back, you'll see we're kind of at mid-single-digit, if you were to do all of that math, mid-single-digit EPS growth on an apples-to-apples basis. And I went back and looked historically, Q1 has always been right around 20% to 22% of our total year, that's exactly what this Q1 is. I think last year was a bit of an anomaly, where our Q1, given an unrealistic gross margin we had in Oncology. It was a good thing that quarter, but it ended up being closer to 25% of our total fiscal year. So it gives me confidence that we're kind of in that historical range at about 20% of our year."

Historically, it's been a terrific business for us with very good growth and company-wide best operating profit. And cash generation has also been very good. So we still love the flat panel and tube part of the business. The security part of the business is very profitable. The profitability of that business hasn't changed, but it's very cyclical and we get some big turns there. We like the fact that we're the leader in digital imaging technology, and so we've got both a strong product portfolio as well as scale in the business. And there are synergies with our Oncology business. The -- Oncology is the second largest customer of that business. About 10 -- 12% of the product cost of our Oncology business comes from our Components business, over 1,500 tubes and panels a year. So there's some vertical integration that we look at. I think what's happened is this business experienced the FX change in a different way than the rest of the world is experiencing it. Since it -- since more than 75% of the business is outside of the U.S. and largely Japan and Europe, and since it's almost entirely denominated in dollars, there was no FX constant currency adjustment to make into the business. And so the way that was felt was, was in pricing, as I said in the script. So clearly, that's what we're going to be watching where this business goes. We have had one customer in-source, as I said on the call. We've been through the rest of our pipeline. We've got contracts with everybody else. We feel like the rest of the business is secure. We're working very hard on some new product costs -- some new products that will drive some feature and benefit, give us a little chance to hit the price as well as give us some cost reduction. And you've seen some acquisitions from us in this space this year. Those acquisitions are enhancing the portfolio, giving us some scale and they're executing ahead of our internal plans by a little bit. They're almost $50 million together, Claymount and MeVis, so it's not huge. But we like what they're doing for us. I think the key for us to watch here in 2016 is where does this price go. It's pretty stable in the dynamic sections of the market, in the radiographic piece of the market. It's -- there's a lot of competitors. There is a need for some consolidation in this market and it's -- we're going to be watching that over 2016."

You have to be able to plan the treatment, and there's nobody that does that better than we do. The efficiency -- I think for me, the most exciting part about ASTRO was to see these papers coming out, documenting what we marketed the year before. So we launched this last year. We felt very good about it. But to see these papers that I mentioned in the script come out documenting both the efficiency improvement as well as the quality improvement have been dynamite, and that's a big deal. Second, as we go into an environment that's uncertain from a reimbursement point of view, total cost to ownership is everything. And the Varian advantage there is there's nobody close to us with that. There'll be some niche products out there that probably get some play in some segments, but I think people are still going to be looking at value for money and how to stretch their capital dollars. I think the strength of our product line from top to bottom on the hardware side is very good. And then our software products are as good as ever. People really responded well to the InSightive Analytics and some of the kind of population and informatics -- population health and informatics tools that we have. And then kind of coming back to where I started. I think our treatment planning product is dynamite. That's how the treatment planning process starts. And given the advantages we have on the hardware side, to be able to take advantage of it, you have to have a great treatment planning product, and that's what we do that nobody else is even close to."

So part of the vision, we think, will get some uptake right away with our Velocity product. We've seen very good reception to that product since we acquired it 18 months ago or so, and it's made a nice role for itself in the product portfolio and in the family.
