In 2014, we made progress as we adapted to the changing marketplace and build additional capabilities to drive profitable, long-term growth. While we are disappointed by weaker-than-expected earnings in the fourth quarter, we are taking decisive actions to improve profitability. We see great opportunities ahead as we pursue our aspiration of sustained out performance, for our customers, employees and shareholders.
In 2014, we generated strong free cash flow. In support of our strategy to grow and produce attractive shareholder returns, we invested $162 million to complete 4 acquisitions. We returned $296 million to shareholders through buybacks and dividends. And we ended the year with $560 million of holding company capital. 
For the year, we delivered 9.7% operating ROE excluding AOCI below our target, due largely to an operating loss at health. Book value, excluding AOCI, grew by 9% compared to year end 2013. 
We are pleased with our top line results. Revenues increased 16% to $9.7 billion, through a combination of organic growth and acquisitions. The key drivers of this performance were our targeted growth offerings, which now account for a quarter of total revenue. More importantly, earnings from these product lines tripled year-over-year. We will continue to shift resources toward these targeted areas as we believe they will drive growth in earnings and cash flow longer-term. Our recent divestiture of American Reliable Insurance Company is another example of our actions to realign capital to support our long-term profitability objectives. I want to thank the American Reliable employees for their service and the seamless transition to Global Indemnity. 
During 2014, we also broadened our specialty insurance products with additional, adjacent fee-based services related to a variety of risk events. Across Assurant, we generated more than $1 billion of fee income for new and existing offerings, an increase of 76% from 2013. These results demonstrate our progress in building a stronger Assurant for the future. 
As we adapt to market changes, we must accelerate our efforts in 2015 to achieve profitable long-term growth. As an enterprise, we will focus on 3 strategic priorities.: First, we will innovate faster around the end consumer to generate organic growth; second, we will continue to drive operational excellence to become more efficient, while delivering outstanding customer experiences; and third, we will maintain our commitment to disciplined capital management. We view our stock as attractively priced and we'll balance investing in our businesses with returning capital to shareholders. We are working hard to achieve these strategic priorities. 
Let me now share updates on each segment. Assurant Solutions delivered exceptional results in 2014 by offering innovative programs across the mobile value chain in the U.S. and a number of international markets. As we look ahead, mobile remains the largest growth opportunity for solutions. Our acquisitions of Lifestyle Services Group in 2013 and CWI group last October enabled us to expand our global footprint in distribution. We will continue to consider select investments to enhance our competitive position. 
As smartphones, appliances and other consumer electronics intersect, solutions is focused on providing comprehensive protection through our connected living platform. Our expertise in the warranty and mobile business, coupled with our broad distribution, uniquely position us to deliver integrated solutions to our clients. For example, we recently partnered with [indiscernible] Brazil, one of the largest mobile operators in Latin America, to introduce a smartphone upgrade plan that includes device protection. This program enables consumers who otherwise could not have purchased those devices to join the connected world. 
As competition intensifies across the industry, there will be additional opportunities to expand our market share. But occasionally, we will lose business. Recently a client notified us of its decision to transfer their tablet protection program to an affiliated company, starting in the second quarter of this year. While we are disappointed to lose this business, we believe our tailored solutions in the mobile value chain and superior customer service will continue to be key differentiators in the industry. 
Pre-need is another important business for solutions and remains a solid performer. While widespread flu this season could increase mortality, we expect pre-need to grow, as we benefit from SCI's expanding share of the U.S. funeral market. These opportunities at solutions, along with our disciplined investments, will help us build on last year's success.
Let's now look at Assurant Specialty Property. The segment benefited from another year without significant hurricane activity. Property took many steps last year to drive operational excellence while moving resources toward our targeted growth areas. Our alignment with leading mortgage servicers remains a key differentiator and competitive strength for Property. As expected, the normalization of lender-placed insurance will pressure results near term. 
In 2014, we started to invest in initiatives to standardize our lender-placed platform to increase efficiency. We expect these investments and ongoing actions to generate net savings later this year and beyond to help maintain specialty returns. 
Our strong capital position allows us to invest in targeted areas to drive profitable growth and diversify our business model. We are pleased with our progress thus far. Our acquisitions of Field Asset Services, StreetLinks and eMortgage Logic, which now comprise our mortgage solutions business, are performing ahead of our revenue expectations. We're capturing market share and now expect to generate $300 million of fee income from these acquired businesses in 2015. 
At Assurant Health, 2014 marked the year of substantial change with the introduction of guaranteed issue and the public exchanges under the Affordable Care Act. For the first time during an open enrollment period, we participated on exchanges in 16 states. Individual major medical plans sold both on or off peak exchanges drove significant sales increases in the fourth quarter. While we are encouraged to see our products resonate with consumers, our focus must remain on driving profitability and achieving specialty returns. The loss for the year was disappointing, and reflected persistently high ACA claims experience. As we have noted, mandated coverage extensions introduced after the industry onset 2014 pricing, drove higher overall market morbidity and significantly affected results.
In response, we've taken action. Effective January 1 we implemented plan design changes and increased premium rates substantially for all 2015 ACA policies. We also lowered commission levels in certain distribution channels across several states to further manage risk. We believe the actions we are taking, along with ongoing expense discipline, should improve results in 2015.
Assurant Employee Benefits results were driven by overall favorable experience and growth in voluntary products. Revenue from this targeted area increased by 12%, well in excess of the market. We believe voluntary will remain the growth engine of benefits, as employers shift more the selection process and benefits costs to their employees. 
As the market continues to evolve, employee benefits will partner even more closely with health in a number of areas. For example, the segments we're looking at opportunities to leverage their broad distribution networks and sales programs. They are also evaluating operating efficiencies to improve the customer experience and strengthen returns.
As I move into the role of CEO, I'm energized by our employees as we strive to make Assurant stronger for the future. Across the organization, we are accelerating our actions on multiple fronts to enhance efficiency, to invest for long-term profitable growth and to prudently manage capital for the benefit of shareholders. 
Now Chris will review results in the quarter and our outlook for 2015 in more detail. Chris?"

I'll start with Solutions, which delivered another strong quarter. Net operating income was $58 million, $36 million higher than the prior year.

Net operating income was $58 million, $36 million higher than the prior year. Continued growth in covered mobile devices and favorable domestic loss experience drove results. We also recognized $5 million of income from client-marketing programs, a decrease from prior years.
Results also benefited from operational efficiencies due to the restructuring efforts that we began in 2013. Net earned premiums and fees were nearly $1 billion, as we delivered more integrated services in mobile, an area that we have targeted for growth. 
In our core business, higher revenue from vehicle service contracts and production at a domestic service client also contributed to the strong quarter. Declines in nongrowth areas, such as domestic credit tempered growth, and overall solutions revenue was partially offset by foreign exchange pressures out in Canada and Latin America. For the full year, Solutions delivered record top line and earnings, far exceeding our expectations. In 2015, we expect revenue and earnings to remain level with the prior year. 
Growth in our mobile and vehicle service contract businesses will offset the loss of a tablet program which accounts for roughly $100 million of annualized premiums and fees. In addition, there is potential for a decline in client marketing income. As we continue to expand our business globally, we also anticipate near-term foreign exchange headwinds. We will continue to invest in mobile and other core products to enhance our competitive position as nongrowth areas contract.
Now let's look at Specialty Property. In the quarter, net operating income was $71 million. This compares to $108 million in 2013, which was a near record quarter due to higher than average renewals and new lender placed portfolios. 
There were several factors contributing to the year-over-year earnings decline, including lower placement and premium rates, margin compression from the previously disclosed loss of business and higher noncatastrophe losses, including claims from hail storms early in the quarter.
Net earned premiums were $595 million, down 9% from 2013. The market and client factors mentioned earlier, along with uneven timing of loan additions and renewals, drove the decline. 
While overall revenue at property was down, targeted growth areas contributed approximately $140 million in the quarter. Premiums from multifamily housing grew 20% year-over-year as we expanded our distribution. Fee income rose 80%, primarily from acquisitions and market share gains in mortgage solutions.
For the quarter, Specialty Property's expense ratio increased 530 basis points, of which nearly 400 basis points was due to our shift toward fee-based products and services. The remaining 130 basis points relates to lower lender-placed premiums.
In 2015, we expect further declines in revenue and earnings at property due to the normalization of lender-placed insurance and the sale of American Reliable. The potential for increased catastrophe activity could also affect results. The initiatives underway to lower expenses in the lender placed area and expand margins for mortgage solutions will help mitigate some of the declines, with net savings expected in the latter part of this year. Importantly, these actions will help us maintain attractive returns long-term.
Turning to Health. The net operating loss of $37 million was driven by higher-than-expected loss experience on ACA policies, which was only partially offset by risk mitigation programs. During the quarter, Health adjusted it's accruals under these programs to reflect higher claims and increasing market morbidity. As a reminder, risk adjustment recoverables are based upon each carriers risk relative to the market. In the fourth quarter, we accrued $9 million under this program, a lower amount compared to the third quarter 2014, reflecting higher overall market risk. Recoverables under the reinsurance program totaled $133 million for the period. For the full year, our total estimated recoveries from the risk mitigation programs were approximately $400 million. The expense ratio at Health declined 370 basis points year-over-year, as we benefited from greater scale and continued operational discipline. As a reminder, results for the quarter included $5 million for the ACA annual insurer fee. This required annual expense will increase from $20 million to $28 million in 2015, and is nontax deductible. 
During the past several months we've taken aggressive steps to drive toward our long-term profitability goals. While the market will continue to evolve, we expect results to improve this year.
At employee benefits, fourth quarter earnings declined to $7 million, primarily due to lower disability recoveries compared to 2013. Given the low interest rate environment, we reduced our discount rate 25 basis points for new long-term disability claims beginning October 1. We will continue to monitor interest rates and take additional actions as needed. 
Benefits expense ratio decreased 60 basis points reflecting premium growth. As with health, expenses include the health insurer fee. In 2015, employee benefits share will increase by $2 million to $8 million for the full year. Overall, we expect voluntary to grow in excess of the market once again in 2015.
At the same time, we will take further actions to lower our general expense ratio toward our long-term target of 23%.
Moving to Corporate, we ended December with $310 million in deployable capital. During the quarter, we paid $71 million for the CWI Group, we returned $20 million to shareholders in the form of dividends, and we repurchased $102 million worth of stock. Overall, for the full year 2014, the company repurchased 3.3 million shares, or nearly 5% of our common stock outstanding. This year, through February 6, we repurchased an additional 529,000 shares for $35 million. 
Total segment dividends in 2014, net of infusions, were $450 million, below earnings as we funded growth in health. We expect 2015 segment dividends to approximate segment operating earnings. As always, this is subject to rating agency requirements.
Capital releases from lender-placed insurance will help fund organic growth in other product areas. The proceeds from the sale of American Reliable will provide additional flexibility to deploy capital. 
In 2014, the Corporate loss declined $15 million to $68 million, reflecting lower employee benefit and acquisition-related expenses compared to 2013. We expect additional reductions this year as we implement other expense initiatives.
Fourth quarter results also included an $8 billion reduction in the amortization of a deferred gain related to an annuity business we sold in 2001 through reinsurance. This had no impact on cash flows and does not change the total amount of amortization over the life of the contracts. 
While the investment portfolio continues to perform well and our low turnover strategy has helped us preserve book yield, a prolonged low interest rate environment will result in further declines in investment income. 
Before we open the line for questions, I want to mention an upcoming change to our financial reporting that we will implement in the first quarter. At the company's IPO, goodwill on our balance sheet was held at Corporate, as the majority of it is related to legacy transactions. Starting this year, the $840 million of goodwill at Corporate will now be included on segment balance sheets, $540 million at solutions and $300 million at Specialty Property. This will have no impact on Assurant's consolidated results.
In 2015, our focus remains on executing our strategic objectives as the markets evolve. We believe the actions underway across Assurant will help us deliver long-term profitable growth to our shareholders. 
And with that, operator, please open the call for questions."

In 2014, we made progress as we adapted to the changing marketplace and build additional capabilities to drive profitable, long-term growth. While we are disappointed by weaker-than-expected earnings in the fourth quarter, we are taking decisive actions to improve profitability. We see great opportunities ahead as we pursue our aspiration of sustained out-performance for our customers, employees and shareholders.
In 2014, we generated strong free cash flow. In support of our strategy to grow and produce attractive shareholder returns, we invested $162 million to complete 4 acquisitions. We returned $296 million to shareholders through buybacks and dividends. And we ended the year with $560 million of holding company capital. 
For the year, we delivered 9.7% operating ROE, excluding AOCI below our target, due largely to an operating loss at Health. Book value, excluding AOCI, grew by 9% compared to year end 2013. 
We are pleased with our top line results. Revenues increased 16% to $9.7 billion, through a combination of organic growth and acquisitions. The key drivers of this performance were our targeted growth offerings, which now account for a quarter of total revenue. More importantly, earnings from these product lines tripled year-over-year. We will continue to shift resources toward these targeted areas as we believe they will drive growth in earnings and cash flow longer-term. 
Our recent divestiture of American Reliable Insurance Company is another example of our actions to realign capital to support our long-term profitability objectives. I want to thank the American Reliable employees for their service and the seamless transition to Global Indemnity. 
During 2014, we also broadened our specialty insurance products with additional, adjacent fee-based services related to a variety of risk events. 
Across Assurant, we generated more than $1 billion of fee income for new and existing offerings, an increase of 76% from 2013. These results demonstrate our progress in building a stronger Assurant for the future. 
As we adapt to market changes, we must accelerate our efforts in 2015 to achieve profitable long-term growth. As an enterprise, we will focus on 3 strategic priorities: First, we will innovate faster around the end consumer to generate organic growth; second, we will continue to drive operational excellence to become more efficient, while delivering outstanding customer experiences; and third, we will maintain our commitment to disciplined capital management. 
We view our stock as attractively priced and we'll balance investing in our businesses with returning capital to shareholders. We are working hard to achieve these strategic priorities. 
Let me now share updates on each segment. Assurant Solutions delivered exceptional results in 2014 by offering innovative programs across the mobile value chain in the U.S. and a number of international markets. 
As we look ahead, mobile remains the largest growth opportunity for solutions. Our acquisitions of Lifestyle Services Group in 2013 and CWI Group, last October, enabled us to expand our global footprint in distribution. We will continue to consider select investments to enhance our competitive position. 
As smartphones, appliances and other consumer electronics intersect, Solutions is focused on providing comprehensive protection through our Connected Living platform. 
Our expertise in the warranty and mobile business, coupled with our broad distribution, uniquely position us to deliver integrated solutions to our clients. For example, we recently partnered with Claro, Brazil, one of the largest mobile operators in Latin America, to introduce a smartphone upgrade plan that includes device protection. This program enables consumers who otherwise could not have purchased those devices to join the connected world. 
As competition intensifies across the industry, there will be additional opportunities to expand our market share. But occasionally, we will lose business. Recently a client notified us of its decision to transfer their tablet protection program to an affiliated company, starting in the second quarter of this year. While we are disappointed to lose this business, we believe our tailored solutions in the mobile value chain and superior customer service will continue to be key differentiators in the industry. 
Preneed is another important business for Solutions and remains a solid performer. While widespread flu this season could increase mortality, we expect Preneed to grow, as we benefit from SCI's expanding share of the U.S. funeral market. These opportunities at Solutions, along with our disciplined investments, will help us build on last year's success.
Let's now look at Assurant Specialty Property. This segment benefited from another year without significant hurricane activity. Property took many steps last year to drive operational excellence while moving resources toward our targeted growth areas. Our alignment with leading mortgage servicers remains a key differentiator and competitive strength for Property. As expected, the normalization of lender-placed insurance will pressure results near term. 
In 2014, we started to invest in initiatives to standardize our lender-placed platform to increase efficiency. We expect these investments and ongoing actions to generate net savings later this year and beyond to help maintain specialty returns. 
Our strong capital position allows us to invest in targeted areas to drive profitable growth and diversify our business model. We are pleased with our progress thus far. Our acquisitions of Field Asset Services, StreetLinks and eMortgage Logic, which now comprise our mortgage solutions business, are performing ahead of our revenue expectations. We're capturing market share and now expect to generate $300 million of fee income from these acquired businesses in 2015. 
At Assurant Health, 2014 marked the year of substantial change with the introduction of guaranteed issue and the public exchanges under the Affordable Care Act. 
For the first time during an open enrollment period, we participated on exchanges in 16 states. Individual major medical plans sold both on or off peak exchanges drove significant sales increases in the fourth quarter. While we are encouraged to see our products resonate with consumers, our focus must remain on driving profitability and achieving specialty returns. 
The loss for the year was disappointing, and reflected persistently high ACA claims experience. 
As we have noted, mandated coverage extensions introduced after the industry upset 2014 pricing, drove higher overall market morbidity and significantly affected results.
In response, we've taken action. Effective January 1, we implemented plan design changes and increased premium rates substantially for all 2015 ACA policies. We also lowered commission levels in certain distribution channels across several states to further manage risk. We believe the actions we are taking, along with ongoing expense discipline, should improve results in 2015.
Assurant Employee Benefits results were driven by overall favorable experience and growth in voluntary products. Revenue from this targeted area increased by 12%, well in excess of the market. We believe voluntary will remain the growth engine in Benefits, as employers shift more of the selection process and benefits costs to their employees. 
As the market continues to evolve, Employee Benefits will partner even more closely with Health in a number of areas. For example, the segments we're looking at opportunities to leverage their broad distribution networks and sales programs. They are also evaluating operating efficiencies to improve the customer experience and strengthen returns.
As I moved into the role of CEO, I'm energized by our employees as we strive to make Assurant stronger for the future. Across the organization, we are accelerating our actions on multiple fronts to enhance efficiency, to invest for long-term profitable growth and to prudently manage capital for the benefit of shareholders. 
Now Chris will review results for the quarter and our outlook for 2015 in more detail. Chris?"
4026111,281157730,762713,"Assurant Inc., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 13, 2015",2015-02-13,"Earnings Calls","Assurant, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Alan. I'll start with Solutions, which delivered another strong quarter. Net operating income was $58 million, $36 million higher than the prior year. Continued growth in covered mobile devices and favorable domestic loss experience drove results.",1218,"Thanks, Alan. I'll start with Solutions, which delivered another strong quarter. Net operating income was $58 million, $36 million higher than the prior year. Continued growth in covered mobile devices and favorable domestic loss experience drove results. 
We also recognized $5 million of income from client marketing programs, a decrease from prior years.
Results also benefited from operational efficiencies due to the restructuring efforts that we began in 2013. 
Net earned premiums and fees were nearly $1 billion, as we delivered more integrated services in mobile, an area that we have targeted for growth. 
In our core business, higher revenue from vehicle service contracts and production at a domestic service client also contributed to the strong quarter. Declines in non-growth areas, such as domestic credit tempered growth, and overall solutions revenue was partially offset by foreign exchange pressures in Canada and Latin America. 
For the full year, Solutions delivered record top line and earnings, far exceeding our expectations. In 2015, we expect revenue and earnings to remain level with the prior year. 
Growth in our mobile and vehicle service contract businesses will offset the loss of a tablet program which accounts for roughly $100 million of annualized premiums and fees. 
In addition, there is potential for a decline in client marketing income. As we continue to expand our business globally, we also anticipate near-term foreign exchange headwinds. We will continue to invest in mobile and other core products to enhance our competitive position as non-growth areas contract.
Now let's look at Specialty Property. In the quarter, net operating income was $71 million. This compares to $108 million in 2013, which was a near record quarter due to higher-than-average renewals and new lender-placed portfolios. 
There were several factors contributing to the year-over-year earnings decline, including lower placement and premium rates, margin compression from the previously disclosed loss of business and higher non-catastrophe losses, including claims from hail storms early in the quarter.
Net earned premiums were $595 million, down 9% from 2013. The market and client factors mentioned earlier, along with uneven timing of loan additions and renewals, drove the decline. 
While overall revenue at Property was down. Targeted growth areas contributed approximately $140 million in the quarter. Premiums from multi-family housing grew 20% year-over-year as we expanded our distribution. Fee income rose 80%, primarily from acquisitions and market share gains in mortgage solutions.
For the quarter, Specialty Property's expense ratio increased 530 basis points, of which nearly 400 basis points was due to our shift toward fee-based products and services. The remaining 130 basis points relates to lower lender-placed premiums.
In 2015, we expect further declines in revenue and earnings at Property due to the normalization of lender-placed insurance and the sale of American Reliable. The potential for increased catastrophe activity could also affect results. The initiatives underway to lower expenses in the lender-placed area and expand margins for mortgage solutions will help mitigate some of the declines with net savings expected in the latter part of this year. Importantly, these actions will help us maintain attractive returns long-term.
Turning to Health. The net operating loss of $37 million was driven by higher-than-expected loss experience on ACA policies, which was only partially offset by risk mitigation programs. During the quarter, Health adjusted it's accruals under these programs to reflect higher claims and increasing market morbidity. 
As a reminder, risk adjustment recoverables are based upon each carriers risk relative to the market. 
In the fourth quarter, we accrued $9 million under this program, a lower amount compared to the third quarter 2014, reflecting higher overall market risk. Recoverables under the Reinsurance program totaled $133 million for the period. 
For the full year, our total estimated recoveries from the risk mitigation programs were approximately $400 million. The expense ratio at Health declined 370 basis points year-over-year, as we benefited from greater scale and continued operational discipline. As a reminder, results for the quarter included $5 million for the ACA annual insurer fee. This required annual expense will increase from $20 million to $28 million in 2015, and is non-tax deductible.
During the past several months, we've taken aggressive steps to drive toward our long-term profitability goals. While the market will continue to evolve, we expect results to improve this year.
At Employee Benefits, fourth quarter earnings declined to $7 million, primarily due to lower disability recoveries compared to 2013. Given the low interest rate environment, we reduced our discount rate 25 basis points for new long-term disability claims beginning October 1. We will continue to monitor interest rates and take additional actions as needed. 
Benefits expense ratio decreased 60 basis points reflecting premium growth. As with Health, expenses include the health insurer fee. In 2015, Employee Benefits share will increase by $2 million to $8 million for the full year. 
Overall, we expect voluntary to grow in excess of the market once again in 2015.
At the same time, we will take further actions to lower our general expense ratio toward our long-term target of 23%.
Moving to Corporate, we ended December with $310 million in deployable capital. During the quarter, we paid $71 million for the CWI Group, we returned $20 million to shareholders in the form of dividends, and we repurchased $102 million worth of stock. 
Overall, for the full year 2014, the company repurchased 3.3 million shares, or nearly 5% of our common stock outstanding. This year, through February 6, we repurchased an additional 529,000 shares for $35 million. 
Total segment dividends in 2014, net of infusions, were $450 million below earnings as we funded growth in Health. We expect 2015 segment dividends to approximate segment operating earnings. As always, this is subject to rating agency requirements.
Capital releases from lender-placed insurance will help fund organic growth in other product areas. The proceeds from the sale of American Reliable will provide additional flexibility to deploy capital. 
In 2014, the Corporate loss declined $15 million to $68 million, reflecting lower employee benefit and acquisition-related expenses compared to 2013. We expect additional reductions this year as we implement other expense initiatives.
Fourth quarter results also included an $8 billion reduction in the amortization of a deferred gain related to an annuity business we sold in 2001 through Reinsurance. This had no impact on cash flows and does not change the total amount of amortization over the life of the contracts. 
While the investment portfolio continues to perform well and our low turnover strategy has helped us preserve book yield, a prolonged low interest rate environment will result in further declines in investment income. 
Before we open the line for questions, I want to mention an upcoming change to our financial reporting that we will implement in the first quarter. At the company's IPO, goodwill on our balance sheet was held at Corporate, as the majority of it related to legacy transactions. 
Starting this year, the $840 million of goodwill at Corporate will now be included on segment balance sheets, $540 million at Solutions and $300 million at Specialty Property. This will have no impact on Assurant's consolidated results.
In 2015, our focus remains on executing our strategic objectives as the markets evolve. We believe the actions underway across Assurant will help us deliver long-term profitable growth to our shareholders. 
And with that, operator, please open the call for questions."

That is seemingly a very difficult thing to predict when you're trying to say predict the health of the broader risk pool. How critical is that adjuster accrual in your pricing and goals for 2015?"

In 2014, we made progress as we adapted to the changing marketplace and built additional capabilities to drive profitable, long-term growth. While we are disappointed by weaker-than-expected earnings in the fourth quarter, we are taking decisive actions to improve profitability. We see great opportunities ahead as we pursue our aspiration of sustained out-performance for our customers, employees and shareholders.
In 2014, we generated strong free cash flow. In support of our strategy to grow and produce attractive shareholder returns, we invested $162 million to complete 4 acquisitions. We returned $296 million to shareholders through buybacks and dividends. And we ended the year with $560 million of holding company capital. 
For the year, we delivered 9.7% operating ROE, excluding AOCI, below our target, due largely to an operating loss at Health. Book value, excluding AOCI, grew by 9% compared to year end 2013. 
We are pleased with our top line results. Revenues increased 16% to $9.7 billion, through a combination of organic growth and acquisitions. The key drivers of this performance were our targeted growth offerings, which now account for a quarter of total revenue. More importantly, earnings from these product lines tripled year-over-year. We will continue to shift resources toward these targeted areas as we believe they will drive growth in earnings and cash flow longer-term. 
Our recent divestiture of American Reliable Insurance Company is another example of our actions to realign capital to support our long-term profitability objectives. I want to thank the American Reliable employees for their service and the seamless transition to Global Indemnity. 
During 2014, we also broadened our specialty insurance products with additional, adjacent fee-based services related to a variety of risk events. 
Across Assurant, we generated more than $1 billion of fee income for new and existing offerings, an increase of 76% from 2013. These results demonstrate our progress in building a stronger Assurant for the future. 
As we adapt to market changes, we must accelerate our efforts in 2015 to achieve profitable long-term growth. As an enterprise, we will focus on 3 strategic priorities: First, we will innovate faster around the end consumer to generate organic growth; second, we will continue to drive operational excellence to become more efficient, while delivering outstanding customer experiences; and third, we will maintain our commitment to disciplined capital management. 
We view our stock as attractively priced and we'll balance investing in our businesses with returning capital to shareholders. We are working hard to achieve these strategic priorities. 
Let me now share updates on each segment. Assurant Solutions delivered exceptional results in 2014 by offering innovative programs across the mobile value chain in the U.S. and a number of international markets. 
As we look ahead, mobile remains the largest growth opportunity for Solutions. Our acquisitions of Lifestyle Services Group in 2013 and CWI Group last October enabled us to expand our global footprint in distribution. We will continue to consider select investments to enhance our competitive position. 
As smartphones, appliances and other consumer electronics intersect, Solutions is focused on providing comprehensive protection through our Connected Living platform. 
Our expertise in the warranty and mobile business, coupled with our broad distribution, uniquely position us to deliver integrated solutions to our clients. For example, we recently partnered with Claro, Brazil, one of the largest mobile operators in Latin America, to introduce a smartphone upgrade plan that includes device protection. This program enables consumers who otherwise could not have purchased those devices to join the connected world. 
As competition intensifies across the industry, there will be additional opportunities to expand our market share. But occasionally, we will lose business. Recently a client notified us of its decision to transfer their tablet protection program to an affiliated company, starting in the second quarter of this year. While we are disappointed to lose this business, we believe our tailored solutions in the mobile value chain and superior customer service will continue to be key differentiators in the industry. 
Preneed is another important business for Solutions and remains a solid performer. While widespread flu this season could increase mortality, we expect Preneed to grow, as we benefit from SCI's expanding share of the U.S. funeral market. These opportunities at Solutions, along with our disciplined investments, will help us build on last year's success.
Let's now look at Assurant Specialty Property. This segment benefited from another year without significant hurricane activity. Property took many steps last year to drive operational excellence while moving resources toward our targeted growth areas. Our alignment with leading mortgage servicers remains a key differentiator and competitive strength for Property. As expected, the normalization of lender-placed insurance will pressure results near-term. 
In 2014, we started to invest in initiatives to standardize our lender-placed platform to increase efficiency. We expect these investments and ongoing actions to generate net savings later this year and beyond to help maintain specialty returns. 
Our strong capital position allows us to invest in targeted areas to drive profitable growth and diversify our business model. We are pleased with our progress thus far. Our acquisitions of Field Asset Services, StreetLinks and eMortgage Logic, which now comprise our mortgage solutions business, are performing ahead of our revenue expectations. We're capturing market share and now expect to generate $300 million of fee income from these acquired businesses in 2015. 
At Assurant Health, 2014 marked a year of substantial change with the introduction of guaranteed issue and the public exchanges under the Affordable Care Act. 
For the first time during an open enrollment period, we participated on exchanges in 16 states. Individual major medical plans sold both on and off the exchanges drove significant sales increases in the fourth quarter. While we are encouraged to see our products resonate with consumers, our focus must remain on driving profitability and achieving specialty returns. 
The loss for the year was disappointing, and reflected persistently high ACA claims experience. 
As we have noted, mandated coverage extensions introduced after the industry had set 2014 pricing drove higher overall market morbidity and significantly affected results.
In response, we've taken action. Effective January 1, we implemented plan design changes and increased premium rates substantially for all 2015 ACA policies. We also lowered commission levels in certain distribution channels across several states to further manage risk. We believe the actions we are taking, along with ongoing expense discipline, should improve results in 2015.
Assurant Employee Benefits results were driven by overall favorable experience and growth in voluntary products. Revenue from this targeted area increased by 12%, well in excess of the market. We believe voluntary will remain the growth engine at Benefits, as employers shift more of the selection process and benefits costs to their employees. 
As the market continues to evolve, Employee Benefits will partner even more closely with Health in a number of areas. For example, the segments are looking at opportunities to leverage their broad distribution networks and sales programs. They are also evaluating operating efficiencies to improve the customer experience and strengthen returns.
As I've moved into the role of CEO, I'm energized by our employees as we strive to make Assurant stronger for the future. Across the organization, we are accelerating our actions on multiple fronts to enhance efficiency, to invest for long-term profitable growth and to prudently manage capital for the benefit of shareholders. 
Now Chris will review results for the quarter and our outlook for 2015 in more detail. Chris?"
4026111,281157730,762834,"Assurant Inc., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 13, 2015",2015-02-13,"Earnings Calls","Assurant, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Alan. I'll start with Solutions, which delivered another strong quarter. Net operating income was $58 million, $36 million higher than the prior year. Continued growth in covered mobile devices and favorable domestic loss experience drove results.",1218,"Thanks, Alan. I'll start with Solutions, which delivered another strong quarter. Net operating income was $58 million, $36 million higher than the prior year. Continued growth in covered mobile devices and favorable domestic loss experience drove results. 
We also recognized $5 million of income from client marketing programs, a decrease from prior years.
Results also benefited from operational efficiencies due to the restructuring efforts that we began in 2013. 
Net earned premiums and fees were nearly $1 billion, as we delivered more integrated services in mobile, an area that we have targeted for growth. 
In our core business, higher revenue from vehicle service contracts and production at a domestic service client also contributed to the strong quarter. Declines in non-growth areas, such as domestic credit, tempered growth, and overall Solutions revenue was partially offset by foreign exchange pressures in Canada and Latin America. 
For the full year, Solutions delivered record top line and earnings, far exceeding our expectations. In 2015, we expect revenue and earnings to remain level with the prior year. 
Growth in our mobile and vehicle service contract businesses will offset the loss of a tablet program, which accounts for roughly $100 million of annualized premiums and fees. 
In addition, there is potential for a decline in client marketing income. As we continue to expand our business globally, we also anticipate near-term foreign exchange headwinds. We will continue to invest in mobile and other core products to enhance our competitive position as non-growth areas contract.
Now let's look at Specialty Property. In the quarter, net operating income was $71 million. This compares to $108 million in 2013, which was a near-record quarter due to higher-than-average renewals and new lender-placed portfolios. 
There were several factors contributing to the year-over-year earnings decline, including lower placement and premium rates, margin compression from the previously disclosed loss of business and higher non-catastrophe losses, including claims from hail storms early in the quarter.
Net earned premiums were $595 million, down 9% from 2013. The market and client factors mentioned earlier, along with uneven timing of loan additions and renewals, drove the decline. 
While overall revenue at Property was down, targeted growth areas contributed approximately $140 million in the quarter. Premiums from multi-family housing grew 20% year-over-year as we expanded our distribution. Fee income rose 80%, primarily from acquisitions and market share gains in mortgage solutions.
For the quarter, Specialty Property's expense ratio increased 530 basis points, of which nearly 400 basis points was due to our shift toward fee-based products and services. The remaining 130 basis points relates to lower lender-placed premiums.
In 2015, we expect further declines in revenue and earnings at Property due to the normalization of lender-placed insurance and the sale of American Reliable. The potential for increased catastrophe activity could also affect results. The initiatives under way to lower expenses in the lender-placed area and expand margins for mortgage solutions will help mitigate some of the declines with net savings expected in the latter part of this year. Importantly, these actions will help us maintain attractive returns long-term.
Turning to Health. The net operating loss of $37 million was driven by higher-than-expected loss experience on ACA policies, which was only partially offset by risk-mitigation programs. During the quarter, Health adjusted its accruals under these programs to reflect higher claims and increasing market morbidity. 
As a reminder, risk adjustment recoverables are based upon each carrier's risk relative to the market. 
In the fourth quarter, we accrued $9 million under this program, a lower amount compared to the third quarter 2014, reflecting higher overall market risk. Recoverables under the reinsurance program totaled $133 million for the period. 
For the full year, our total estimated recoveries from the risk mitigation programs were approximately $400 million. The expense ratio at Health declined 370 basis points year-over-year, as we benefited from greater scale and continued operational discipline. As a reminder, results for the quarter included $5 million for the ACA annual insurer fee. This required annual expense will increase from $20 million to $28 million in 2015, and is non-tax deductible.
During the past several months, we've taken aggressive steps to drive toward our long-term profitability goals. While the market will continue to evolve, we expect results to improve this year.
At Employee Benefits, fourth quarter earnings declined to $7 million, primarily due to lower disability recoveries compared to 2013. Given the low interest rate environment, we reduced our discount rate 25 basis points for new long-term disability claims beginning October 1. We will continue to monitor interest rates and take additional actions as needed. 
Benefits expense ratio decreased 60 basis points reflecting premium growth. As with Health, expenses include the health insurer fee. In 2015, Employee Benefits share will increase by $2 million to $8 million for the full year. 
Overall, we expect voluntary to grow in excess of the market once again in 2015.
At the same time, we will take further actions to lower our general expense ratio toward our long-term target of 23%.
Moving to Corporate, we ended December with $310 million in deployable capital. During the quarter, we paid $71 million for the CWI Group, we returned $20 million to shareholders in the form of dividends, and we repurchased $102 million worth of stock. 
Overall, for the full year 2014, the company repurchased 3.3 million shares, or nearly 5% of our common stock outstanding. This year, through February 6, we've repurchased an additional 529,000 shares for $35 million. 
Total segment dividends in 2014, net of infusions, were $450 million below earnings as we funded growth in Health. We expect 2015 segment dividends to approximate segment operating earnings. As always, this is subject to rating agency requirements.
Capital releases from lender-placed insurance will help fund organic growth in other product areas. The proceeds from the sale of American Reliable will provide additional flexibility to deploy capital. 
In 2014, the Corporate loss declined $15 million to $68 million, reflecting lower employee benefit and acquisition-related expenses compared to 2013. We expect additional reductions this year as we implement other expense initiatives.
Fourth quarter results also included an $8 billion reduction in the amortization of a deferred gain related to an annuity business we sold in 2001 through reinsurance. This had no impact on cash flows and does not change the total amount of amortization over the life of the contracts. 
While the investment portfolio continues to perform well and our low turnover strategy has helped us preserve book yield, a prolonged low interest rate environment will result in further declines in investment income. 
Before we open the line for questions, I want to mention an upcoming change to our financial reporting that we will implement in the first quarter. At the company's IPO, goodwill on our balance sheet was held at Corporate, as the majority of it related to legacy transactions. 
Starting this year, the $840 million of goodwill at Corporate will now be included on segment balance sheets, $540 million at Solutions and $300 million at Specialty Property. This will have no impact on Assurant's consolidated results.
In 2015, our focus remains on executing our strategic objectives as the markets evolve. We believe the actions under way across Assurant will help us deliver long-term profitable growth to our shareholders. 
And with that, operator, please open the call for questions."

Now our ACA block is substantially bigger in 2015 as the market switches to the metallic plans. So the risk adjuster program remains very important to us as we go through the year."

While our first quarter results we are disappointing, we are encouraged by solid performance at our other businesses. The results also reinforced the importance of our strategic realignment going forward.
This morning, I want to highlight the opportunities ahead, and then we'll elaborate on the first quarter. Following a compressive review of our businesses, last week, we announced our decision to concentrate on specialty housing and lifestyle protection products and services, provided by our Solutions and Specialty Property segments. We believe this sharper focus will enable us to more consistently generate specialty returns long term. 
Accordingly, we are exploring strategic alternatives for health and employee benefits, including a sale of both businesses. Given their limited strategic fit in our portfolio, and the current market environment, we do not believe they can deliver the returns we require. During this process, we will continue to uphold our commitments to customers, policyholders and employees.
Our housing offerings, especially property, protect against risk where people live, through lender place and flood insurance, multifamily housing and mortgage solutions. Lifestyle offerings provided through solutions protect the people purchase and use every day, such as their mobile devices, cars, appliances, as well as their assets, which are safeguarded with pre-need funeral insurance. 
Specialty Property and Solutions have track records that sustained industry leadership positions and proven financial performance. Importantly, these businesses generally deliver specialty returns, generate significant free cash flow and have the highest profitable growth potential.
Looking ahead, we see a broad array of attractive opportunities and housing and lifestyle and plan plant to build upon our success in the U.S. and abroad. We will do this by further capitalizing on favorable market trends and identifying unmet consumer needs, where we can leverage our core capabilities, such as our advantage distribution networks and strong risk management.
Let me offer a few examples. Mobile continues to transform the consumer experience, and we believe there are many opportunities ahead for Assurant. Our Connected Living platform and solutions allows us to leverage our strengths to create new offerings as consumers are increasingly dependent on staying connected to each other, their devices and even their homes. With market-leading positions in housing, more well and extended service contracts, we are in a strong position to capitalizing on these trends and we are already seeing success.
Additionally, we continue to extend beyond insurance to offer other services related to various consumer risk events. Increasingly, we succeed in the market because of our ability to offer these integrated solutions. Our fee-based offerings now account for nearly 20% of solutions and properties total revenues, and we expect this percentage to grow over time.
Recently, we expanded our agreement with quarrel Brazil, 1 of the largest mobile operators in Latin America, by adding another smartphone manufacturer to the device upgrade program we introduced last quarter. While early, consumer response to this program has been promising, and demonstrates our ability to customize solutions for our partners and strengthening these relationships over time.
Our move into the mortgage solutions business is another example. We brought in our array of property preservation and valuation services through a series of acquisitions that are natural extensions of our collateral risk capabilities. Our strong processes, technology platforms and advantage spender networks, allow us to provide superior customer service for our clients.
Since establishing mortgage solutions, we've expanded market share with 9 clients that are among the leading mortgage servicers and originators. As a result, we expect the business, in total, will contribute more than $300 million of fee income this year.
These examples demonstrate the momentum we are gaining in areas targeted for growth. We believe a more tightly focused Assurant can enhance long-term shareholder value as we continue to execute on our strategy and align resources towards housing and lifestyle.
Now let me offer some highlights from our first quarter results. Overall, our portfolio of specialty businesses, most notably solutions and Specialty Property, continued to generate strong cash flow in the first quarter, which allowed us to return $100 million to shareholders through buybacks and dividends and end the quarter with $570 million of holding company capital.
Annualized operating ROE, excluding AOCI, decreased to 3.9%, driven by the loss at Health. Book value, excluding AOCI, was largely unchanged since year end. Net earned premiums and fees increased 8%. Our housing and lifestyle products accounted for the majority of our revenue and earnings during the first quarter. Fee income overall increased by 42%, primarily due to our expanded server offerings in mobile and mortgage solutions.
We're excited about the future. We believe our sharper focus will create additional opportunities for profitable growth and strengthen our ability to help people protect what matters most, while also allowing us to realize our aspiration of generating top quartile shareholder returns.
Now Chris will review results for the quarter and our outlook for 2015 in more detail. Chris?"

We now provide coverage on more than 28 million mobile devices, up nearly 20% year-over-year.In th",1137,"Thanks, Alan. I'll start with solutions. Segment earnings totaled $54 million, an increase of 10% from the prior year, as we expanded our mobile business. We now provide coverage on more than 28 million mobile devices, up nearly 20% year-over-year.
In the quarter, we also benefited from increased handset repair and logistics activity and favorable domestic loss experience. Results were partially offset by higher integration costs related to our acquisition of CWI Group in France, and higher loss experience on a mobile program in Latin America.
Total revenues increased 4%, driven by growth in mobile, our vehicle protection business and in a large domestic service contract client. This was partially offset by foreign exchange pressures and lower production volumes at brick-and-mortar retailers in North America, trends that we expect to persist for the rest of the year.
In addition, as we mentioned on our last call, we will discontinue a tablet program that represents around $100 million of annualized net earned premiums, when it transfers our clients in-house logistics provider. This will lower earnings beginning in the second quarter. Despite these headwinds, solutions overall revenue and earnings this year should remain level with last year.  Expansion of our integrated mobile offerings and vehicle service contracts will continue to drive 2015 performance.
Now let's look at Specialty Property. In the quarter, net operating income was $75 million, a decrease from the prior year, primarily driven by the ongoing normalization of lender placed. Despite cold winter weather, we incurred lower non-catastrophe losses, due to fewer weather and fire-related claims compared to the prior year.
Net earned premiums in the quarter declined by $95 million year-over-year, primarily reflecting the January sale of American Reliable, and lower lender placed premiums.
Placement rates in lender placed decreased 17 basis points from the first quarter of 2014, but remained flat from year end, driven by some small loan portfolio additions. Overall, we continue to expect our placement rates to gradually decline as the housing market improves.
Moving to properties targeted growth areas. We were pleased by the performance of our multifamily housing business, where revenue increased 18% year-over-year. Fee income more than doubled, driven by mortgage solutions, as we increase market share, by cross-selling our offerings and adding new clients.
For the quarter, Specialty Property's expense ratio increased by 910 basis points, of which nearly 1/2 was due to our shift towards fee-based products and services. Lower lender placed premiums also contributed to the increase.
During the quarter, we continued to implement our expense management initiatives. We incurred a modest severance charge related to staff reductions and made additional investments in our lender placed platform, to reduce our cost structure as the business normalizes. These actions are on track to generate net savings beginning in the second half of the year.
Turning to health. The net operating loss of $84 million was significantly worse than we anticipated. Approximately 1/2 was due to a reduction in our estimated recoveries under the ACA risk-mitigation programs for 2014 policies. We refined our accruals to take into account market data available since year end additional claims development. This change was reflected in our first quarter results.
The balance of the loss was driven by elevated claims on 2015 policies, which were only partially offset by risk mitigation programs.
For the first quarter, we accrued $64 million related to the risk adjustment program for 2015 policies. Recoverables under reinsurance totaled $56 million for the period, and we did not accrue any net recoverables for the risk quarters. While we are eligible to participate in this program, we believe this is a prudent measure, given that funding has not yet been authorized.
To further manage risk, we reduced commissions in January. As a result, individual sales dropped 15% from the prior year, despite significant market growth. Despite late actions taken, initial claims submissions on 2015 policies indicate that loss experience on our ACA enforced block will remain elevated throughout the year. ACA policies now account for 60% of health's premiums compared to 18% last year. Quarterly results will vary based on loss experience and the estimated recoveries for the risk mitigation programs. We expect insurance carriers will be notified by June 30 of final payment amounts related to the 2014 business, and any changes in current estimates will be recorded in our second quarter results.
The process to explore strategic options for Health is well underway. Absent of sale, we will begin the process to exit the market and will not participate in the 2016 ACA open enrollment. We will provide updates as we can. In the meantime, we remained focused on mitigating losses and prudently managing capital as we work through this process.
At employee benefits, first quarter earnings declined to $10 million, primarily due to lower real estate joint venture partnership investment income Disability results were less favorable, reflecting lower recoveries and the discount rate change implemented last quarter. Benefits expense ratio decreased 80 basis points due to premium growth and savings realized from previous expense actions. 
We view our enrollment capabilities and broad suite of voluntary products and services, including dental, to be unique in the market. As we explore strategic alternatives for the segment, we believe these will be viewed as valuable assets for any benefits focused organization.
Moving to Corporate. We ended March with $320 million of deployable capital. Total segment dividends in the first quarter, net of infusions, were $55 million. We continued to expect 2015 segment dividends to approximate segment operating earnings as capital releases from lender-placed insurance offset capital needs in other product areas. As always, this is subject to rating agency requirements.
During the first quarter, we returned $19 million to shareholders in the form of dividends, and we repurchased $82 million worth of stock. In April, we repurchased nearly 670,000 more shares for $41 million. Year-to-date, we retired 3% of total shares outstanding.
We continue to believe the stock is attractively priced. The proceeds from expected transactions will provide additional flexibility to deploy capital prudently through share buybacks, common stock dividends and investments in housing and lifestyle. 
The Corporate loss for the quarter declined to $4 million, due to a reduction in tax liabilities, which will reverse during the course of the year, and lower employee related benefits expenses. We still expect our full year 2015 Corporate loss to be in the range of $60 million to $65 million. We will assess other opportunities to accelerate expense management efforts as we realign the organization toward housing and lifestyle.
For the balance of the year, our focus remains on repositioning the company for profitable growth and successfully managing potential transactions for health and benefits. We believe the actions underway across Assurant will help build a stronger future for the company.
And with that, operator, please open the call for questions."

And I think you saw the first quarter is a good example of that. We ended the quarter with essentially the same amount of capital that we started. We have $320 million of deployable capital still on hand. We still expect segment dividends to approximate what we're going to earn in the segments. We returned capital.

I mean the intent of refocusing the company around housing and lifestyle is to create a more attractive company for our shareholders. That comes from a few different points. 1 is we have a proven track record in those areas of generating specialty returns long-term. Virtually every business that is part of the future of Assurant were a market leader. And that something we can build off of. Almost every 1 of those businesses, we're doing more than just insurance. We have integrated offerings risk event which allow us to have better duration with partners, there economics for us. In general, these are less capital intensive businesses. So what we are really focused on his free cash flow generation. That gives us the power to create value for our shareholders through the capital deployment. And as we look at across our portfolio, by far the highest profitable growth potential we have is in these areas of housing and lifestyle, really leveraging the consumer trends, the market trends, et cetera. And 1 of the things that we get into later this year, as we refocus on the future of Assurant, and we get the health and benefits transitions behind us, we will put out new metrics and new disclosures and we hold an Investor Day late this year to really help everyone understand how to think about Assurant going forward.

While our first quarter results at Health were disappointing, we are encouraged by solid performance at our other businesses. The results also reinforced the importance of our strategic realignment going forward.
This morning, I want to highlight the opportunities ahead, and then we'll elaborate on the first quarter. Following a comprehensive review of our businesses, last week, we announced our decision to concentrate on specialty housing and lifestyle protection products and services, provided by our Solutions and Specialty Property segments. We believe this sharper focus will enable us to more consistently generate specialty returns long-term. 
Accordingly, we are exploring strategic alternatives for Health and Employee Benefits, including a sale of both businesses. Given their limited strategic fit in our portfolio and the current market environment, we do not believe they can deliver the returns we require. During this process, we will continue to uphold our commitments to customers, policyholders and employees.
Our housing offerings, Specialty Property, protect against risk where people live through lender-placed and flood insurance, multi-family housing and mortgage solutions. 
Lifestyle offerings, provided through Solutions, protect what people purchase and use every day, such as their mobile devices, cars, appliances, as well as their assets, which are safeguarded with pre-need funeral insurance.
Specialty Property and Solutions have track records of sustained industry leadership positions and proven financial performance. Importantly, these businesses generally deliver specialty returns, generate significant free cash flow and have the highest profitable growth potential.
Looking ahead, we see a broad array of attractive opportunities in housing and lifestyle and plan to build upon our success in the U.S. and abroad. We will do this by further capitalizing on favorable market trends and identifying unmet consumer needs, where we can leverage our core capabilities such as our advantage distribution networks and strong risk management.
Let me offer a few examples. Mobile continues to transform the consumer experience, and we believe there are many opportunities ahead for Assurant. Our Connected Living platform at Solutions allows us to leverage our strengths to create new offerings, as consumers are increasingly dependent on staying connected to each other, their devices and even their homes. With market-leading positions in housing, mobile and extended service contracts, we are in a strong position to capitalizing on these trends and we are already seeing success.
Additionally, we continue to extend beyond insurance to offer other services related to various consumer risk events. Increasingly, we succeed in the market because of our ability to offer these integrated solutions. Our fee-based offerings now account for nearly 20% of Solutions' and Property's total revenues, and we expect this percentage to grow over time.
Recently, we expanded our agreement with Claro Brazil, one of the largest mobile operators in Latin America, by adding another smartphone manufacturer to the device upgrade program we introduced last quarter. While early, consumer response to this program has been promising and demonstrates our ability to customize solutions for our partners and strengthen these relationships over time.
Our move into the mortgage solutions business is another example. We broadened our array of property preservation and valuation services through a series of acquisitions that are natural extensions of our collateral risk capabilities. Our strong processes, technology platforms and advantage spender networks allow us to provide superior customer service for our clients.
Since establishing mortgage solutions, we've expanded market share with 9 clients that are among the leading mortgage servicers and originators. As a result, we expect the business in total will contribute more than $300 million of fee income this year.
These examples demonstrate the momentum we are gaining in areas targeted for growth. We believe a more tightly-focused Assurant can enhance long-term shareholder value as we continue to execute on our strategy and align resources toward housing and lifestyle.
Now let me offer some highlights from our first quarter results. Overall, our portfolio of specialty businesses, most notably Solutions and Specialty Property, continued to generate strong cash flow in the first quarter, which allowed us to return $100 million to shareholders through buybacks and dividends, and end the quarter with $570 million of holding company capital.
Annualized operating ROE, excluding AOCI, decreased to 3.9%, driven by the loss at Health. Book value, excluding AOCI, was largely unchanged since year-end. Net earned premiums and fees increased 8%. Our housing and lifestyle products accounted for the majority of our revenue and earnings during the first quarter. Fee income overall increased by 42%, primarily due to our expanded service offerings in mobile and mortgage solutions.
We're excited about the future. We believe our sharper focus will create additional opportunities for profitable growth and strengthen our ability to help people protect what matters most, while also allowing us to realize our aspirations of generating top quartile shareholder returns.
Now, Chris will review results for the quarter and our outlook for 2015 in more detail. Chris?"

Segment earnings totaled $54 million, an increase of 10% from the prior year, as we expanded our mobile business. We now provide coverage on more than 28 million mobile devices, up nearly 20% year-over-year.
In the quarter, we also benefited from increased handset repair and logistics activity and favorable domestic loss experience. Results were partially offset by higher integration costs related to our acquisition of CWI Group in France and higher loss experience on a mobile program in Latin America.
Total revenues increased 4%, driven by growth in mobile, our vehicle protection business and in a large domestic service contract client. This was partially offset by foreign exchange pressures and lower production volumes at brick-and-mortar retailers in North America, trends that we expect to persist for the rest of the year.
In addition, as we mentioned on our last call, we will discontinue a tablet program that represents around $100 million of annualized net earned premiums when it transfers to our client's in-house logistics provider. This will lower earnings beginning in the second quarter. 
Despite these headwinds, Solutions' overall revenue and earnings this year should remain level with last year. Expansion of our integrated mobile offerings and vehicle service contracts will continue to drive 2015 performance.
Now, let's look at Specialty Property. In the quarter, net operating income was $75 million, a decrease from the prior year, primarily driven by the ongoing normalization of lender-placed. Despite cold winter weather, we incurred lower non-catastrophe losses due to fewer weather and fire-related claims compared to the prior year.
Net earned premiums in the quarter declined by $95 million year-over-year, primarily reflecting the January sale of American Reliable and lower lender-placed premiums.
Placement rates in lender-placed decreased 17 basis points from the first quarter of 2014, but remained flat from year-end, driven by some small loan portfolio additions. Overall, we continue to expect our placement rates to gradually decline as the housing market improves.
Moving to Property's targeted growth areas. We were pleased by the performance of our multi-family housing business, where revenue increased 18% year-over-year. Fee income more than doubled, driven by mortgage solutions, as we increased market share by cross-selling our offerings and adding new clients.
For the quarter, Specialty Property's expense ratio increased by 910 basis points, of which nearly 1/2 was due to our shift toward fee-based products and services. Lower lender-placed premiums also contributed to the increase.
During the quarter, we continued to implement our expense management initiatives. We incurred a modest severance charge related to staff reductions and made additional investments in our lender-placed platform to reduce our cost structure as the business normalizes. These actions are on track to generate net savings beginning in the second half of the year.
Turning to Health. The net operating loss of $84 million was significantly worse than we anticipated. Approximately 1/2 was due to a reduction in our estimated recoveries under the ACA risk mitigation programs for 2014 policies. We refined our accruals to take into account market data available since year-end and additional claims development. This change was reflected in our first quarter results. The balance of the loss was driven by elevated claims on 2015 policies, which were only partially offset by risk mitigation programs.
For the first quarter, we accrued $64 million related to the risk adjustment program for 2015 policies. Recoverables under reinsurance totaled $56 million for the period, and we did not accrue any net recoverables for the risk quarters. While we are eligible to participate in this program, we believe this is a prudent measure, given that funding has not yet been authorized.
To further manage risk, we reduced commissions in January. As a result, individual sales dropped 15% from the prior year despite significant market growth. Despite rate actions taken, initial claims submissions on 2015 policies indicate that loss experience on our ACA in-force block will remain elevated throughout the year. ACA policies now account for 60% of Health's premiums compared to 18% last year. Quarterly results will vary based on loss experience and the estimated recoveries for the risk mitigation programs. We expect insurance carriers will be notified by June 30 of final payment amounts related to the 2014 business, and any changes in current estimates will be recorded in our second quarter results.
The process to explore strategic options for Health is well underway. Absent of sale, we will begin the process to exit the market and will not participate in the 2016 ACA Open Enrollment. We will provide updates as we can. In the meantime, we remain focused on mitigating losses and prudently managing capital as we work through this process.
At Employee Benefits, first quarter earnings declined to $10 million, primarily due to lower real estate joint venture partnership investment income. Disability results were less favorable reflecting lower recoveries and the discount rate change implemented last quarter. Benefits' expense ratio decreased 80 basis points due to premium growth and savings realized from previous expense actions.
We view our enrollment capabilities and broad suite of voluntary products and services, including Dental, to be unique in the market. As we explore strategic alternatives for the segment, we believe these will be viewed as valuable assets for any benefits-focused organization.
Moving to Corporate. We ended March with $320 million of deployable capital. Total segment dividends in the first quarter, net of infusions, were $55 million. We continue to expect 2015 segment dividends to approximate segment operating earnings as capital releases from lender-placed insurance offset capital needs in other product areas. As always, this is subject to rating agency requirements.
During the first quarter, we returned $19 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and we repurchased $82 million worth of stock. In April, we repurchased nearly 670,000 more shares for $41 million. Year-to-date, we retired 3% of total shares outstanding.
We continue to believe the stock is attractively priced. The proceeds from expected transactions will provide additional flexibility to deploy capital prudently through share buybacks, common stock dividends and investments in housing and lifestyle.
The Corporate loss for the quarter declined to $4 million due to a reduction in tax liabilities, which will reverse during the course of the year and lower employee-related benefits expenses. We still expect our full year 2015 Corporate loss to be in the range of $60 million to $65 million. We will assess other opportunities to accelerate expense management efforts as we realign the organization toward housing and lifestyle.
For the balance of the year, our focus remains on repositioning the company for profitable growth and successfully managing potential transactions for Health and Benefits. We believe the actions underway across Assurant will help build a stronger future for the company.
And with that, operator, please open the call for questions."

I think we're going to continue the same capital management approach that we've had, which is a disciplined and balanced deployment of capital between returning capital to shareholders and investing in the future of the company. And I think you saw the first quarter is a good example of that. We ended the quarter with essentially the same amount of capital that we started. We have $320 million of deployable capital still on hand. We still expect segment dividends to approximate what we're going to earn in the segments. We returned capital. We still think the stock is attractively priced. And so I think it's business as usual as we go through the next few quarters."

A lot of that is going to be dependent upon our ability to standardize and create greater efficiences around the lender-placed infrastructure, which we are -- now, net investors, the first half of the year, we expect to be net savers in the second half and in the out years.

I mean, the intent of refocusing the company around housing and lifestyle is to create a more attractive company for our shareholders. That comes from a few different points. One is we have a proven track record in those areas of generating specialty returns long-term. Virtually every business that is part of the future of Assurant were a market leader, and that's something we can build off of. Almost every one of those businesses, we're doing more than just insurance. We have integrated offerings around the risk event which allow us to have better duration with partners, better economics for us. 
In general, these are less capital-intensive businesses. And so what we are really are focused on is free cash flow generation. That gives us the power to create value for our shareholders through the capital deployment. And as we looked across our portfolio, by far the highest profitable growth potential we have is in these areas of housing and lifestyle, really leveraging the consumer trends, the market trends, et cetera. 
And one of the things that we're going to do later this year, as we refocus on the future of Assurant and we get the Health and Benefits transitions behind us, we will put out new metrics and new disclosures.

While our first quarter results at Health were disappointing, we are encouraged by solid performance at our other businesses.

While our first quarter results at Health were disappointing, we are encouraged by solid performance at our other businesses. The results also reinforced the importance of our strategic realignment going forward.
This morning, I want to highlight the opportunities ahead, and then we'll elaborate on the first quarter. Following a comprehensive review of our businesses, last week, we announced our decision to concentrate on specialty housing and lifestyle protection products and services, provided by our Solutions and Specialty Property segments. We believe this sharper focus will enable us to more consistently generate specialty returns long-term. 
Accordingly, we are exploring strategic alternatives for Health and Employee Benefits, including a sale of both businesses. Given their limited strategic fit in our portfolio and the current market environment, we do not believe they can deliver the returns we require. During this process, we will continue to uphold our commitments to customers, policyholders and employees.
Our housing offerings, Specialty Property, protect against risk where people live through lender-placed and flood insurance, multi-family housing and mortgage solutions. 
Lifestyle offerings, provided through Solutions, protect what people purchase and use every day, such as their mobile devices, cars, appliances, as well as their assets, which are safeguarded with pre-need funeral insurance.
Specialty Property and Solutions have track records of sustained industry leadership positions and proven financial performance. Importantly, these businesses generally deliver specialty returns, generate significant free cash flow and have the highest profitable growth potential.
Looking ahead, we see a broad array of attractive opportunities in housing and lifestyle and plan to build upon our success in the U.S. and abroad. We will do this by further capitalizing on favorable market trends and identifying unmet consumer needs, where we can leverage our core capabilities such as our advantage distribution networks and strong risk management.
Let me offer a few examples. Mobile continues to transform the consumer experience, and we believe there are many opportunities ahead for Assurant. Our Connected Living platform at Solutions allows us to leverage our strengths to create new offerings, as consumers are increasingly dependent on staying connected to each other, their devices and even their homes. With market-leading positions in housing, mobile and extended service contracts, we are in a strong position to capitalizing on these trends and we are already seeing success.
Additionally, we continue to extend beyond insurance to offer other services related to various consumer risk events. Increasingly, we succeed in the market because of our ability to offer these integrated solutions. Our fee-based offerings now account for nearly 20% of Solutions' and Property's total revenues, and we expect this percentage to grow over time.
Recently, we expanded our agreement with Claro Brazil, one of the largest mobile operators in Latin America, by adding another smartphone manufacturer to the device upgrade program we introduced last quarter. While early, consumer response to this program has been promising and demonstrates our ability to customize solutions for our partners and strengthen these relationships over time.
Our move into the mortgage solutions business is another example. We broadened our array of property preservation and valuation services through a series of acquisitions that are natural extensions of our collateral risk capabilities. Our strong processes, technology platforms and advantage spender networks allow us to provide superior customer service for our clients.
Since establishing mortgage solutions, we've expanded market share with 9 clients that are among the leading mortgage servicers and originators. As a result, we expect the business in total will contribute more than $300 million of fee income this year.
These examples demonstrate the momentum we are gaining in areas targeted for growth. We believe a more tightly-focused Assurant can enhance long-term shareholder value as we continue to execute on our strategy and align resources toward housing and lifestyle.
Now let me offer some highlights from our first quarter results. Overall, our portfolio of specialty businesses, most notably Solutions and Specialty Property, continued to generate strong cash flow in the first quarter, which allowed us to return $100 million to shareholders through buybacks and dividends, and end the quarter with $570 million of holding company capital.
Annualized operating ROE, excluding AOCI, decreased to 3.9%, driven by the loss at Health. Book value, excluding AOCI, was largely unchanged since year-end. Net earned premiums and fees increased 8%. Our housing and lifestyle products accounted for the majority of our revenue and earnings during the first quarter. Fee income overall increased by 42%, primarily due to our expanded service offerings in mobile and mortgage solutions.
We're excited about the future. We believe our sharper focus will create additional opportunities for profitable growth and strengthen our ability to help people protect what matters most, while also allowing us to realize our aspirations of generating top quartile shareholder returns.
Now, Chris will review results for the quarter and our outlook for 2015 in more detail. Chris?"

Segment earnings totaled $54 million, an increase of 10% from the prior year, as we expanded our mobile business. We now provide coverage on more than 28 million mobile devices, up nearly 20% year-over-year.In th",1131,"Thanks, Alan. I'll start with Solutions. Segment earnings totaled $54 million, an increase of 10% from the prior year, as we expanded our mobile business. We now provide coverage on more than 28 million mobile devices, up nearly 20% year-over-year.
In the quarter, we also benefited from increased handset repair and logistics activity and favorable domestic loss experience. Results were partially offset by higher integration costs related to our acquisition of CWI Group in France and higher loss experience on a mobile program in Latin America.
Total revenues increased 4%, driven by growth in mobile, our vehicle protection business and in a large domestic service contract client. This was partially offset by foreign exchange pressures and lower production volumes at brick-and-mortar retailers in North America, trends that we expect to persist for the rest of the year.
In addition, as we mentioned on our last call, we will discontinue a tablet program that represents around $100 million of annualized net earned premiums when it transfers to our client's in-house logistics provider. This will lower earnings beginning in the second quarter. 
Despite these headwinds, Solutions' overall revenue and earnings this year should remain level with last year. Expansion of our integrated mobile offerings and vehicle service contracts will continue to drive 2015 performance.
Now, let's look at Specialty Property. In the quarter, net operating income was $75 million, a decrease from the prior year, primarily driven by the ongoing normalization of lender-placed. Despite cold winter weather, we incurred lower non-catastrophe losses due to fewer weather and fire-related claims compared to the prior year.
Net earned premiums in the quarter declined by $95 million year-over-year, primarily reflecting the January sale of American Reliable and lower lender-placed premiums.
Placement rates in lender-placed decreased 17 basis points from the first quarter of 2014, but remained flat from year-end, driven by some small loan portfolio additions. Overall, we continue to expect our placement rates to gradually decline as the housing market improves.
Moving to Property's targeted growth areas. We were pleased by the performance of our multi-family housing business, where revenue increased 18% year-over-year. Fee income more than doubled, driven by mortgage solutions, as we increased market share by cross-selling our offerings and adding new clients.
For the quarter, Specialty Property's expense ratio increased by 910 basis points, of which nearly 1/2 was due to our shift toward fee-based products and services. Lower lender-placed premiums also contributed to the increase.
During the quarter, we continued to implement our expense management initiatives. We incurred a modest severance charge related to staff reductions and made additional investments in our lender-placed platform to reduce our cost structure as the business normalizes. These actions are on track to generate net savings beginning in the second half of the year.
Turning to Health. The net operating loss of $84 million was significantly worse than we anticipated. Approximately 1/2 was due to a reduction in our estimated recoveries under the ACA risk mitigation programs for 2014 policies. We refined our accruals to take into account market data available since year-end and additional claims development. This change was reflected in our first quarter results. The balance of the loss was driven by elevated claims on 2015 policies, which were only partially offset by risk mitigation programs.
For the first quarter, we accrued $64 million related to the risk adjustment program for 2015 policies. Recoverables under reinsurance totaled $56 million for the period, and we did not accrue any net recoverables for the risk quarters. While we are eligible to participate in this program, we believe this is a prudent measure, given that funding has not yet been authorized.
To further manage risk, we reduced commissions in January. As a result, individual sales dropped 15% from the prior year despite significant market growth. Despite rate actions taken, initial claims submissions on 2015 policies indicate that loss experience on our ACA in-force block will remain elevated throughout the year. ACA policies now account for 60% of Health's premiums compared to 18% last year. Quarterly results will vary based on loss experience and the estimated recoveries for the risk mitigation programs. We expect insurance carriers will be notified by June 30 of final payment amounts related to the 2014 business, and any changes in current estimates will be recorded in our second quarter results.
The process to explore strategic options for Health is well underway. Absent of sale, we will begin the process to exit the market and will not participate in the 2016 ACA Open Enrollment. We will provide updates as we can. In the meantime, we remain focused on mitigating losses and prudently managing capital as we work through this process.
At Employee Benefits, first quarter earnings declined to $10 million, primarily due to lower real estate joint venture partnership investment income. Disability results were less favorable reflecting lower recoveries and the discount rate change implemented last quarter. Benefits' expense ratio decreased 80 basis points due to premium growth and savings realized from previous expense actions.
We view our enrollment capabilities and broad suite of voluntary products and services, including Dental, to be unique in the market. As we explore strategic alternatives for the segment, we believe these will be viewed as valuable assets for any benefits-focused organization.
Moving to Corporate. We ended March with $320 million of deployable capital. Total segment dividends in the first quarter, net of infusions, were $55 million. We continue to expect 2015 segment dividends to approximate segment operating earnings as capital releases from lender-placed insurance offset capital needs in other product areas. As always, this is subject to rating agency requirements.
During the first quarter, we returned $19 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and we repurchased $82 million worth of stock. In April, we repurchased nearly 670,000 more shares for $41 million. Year-to-date, we retired 3% of total shares outstanding.
We continue to believe the stock is attractively priced. The proceeds from expected transactions will provide additional flexibility to deploy capital prudently through share buybacks, common stock dividends and investments in housing and lifestyle.
The Corporate loss for the quarter declined to $4 million due to a reduction in tax liabilities, which will reverse during the course of the year and lower employee-related benefits expenses. We still expect our full year 2015 Corporate loss to be in the range of $60 million to $65 million. We will assess other opportunities to accelerate expense management efforts as we realign the organization toward housing and lifestyle.
For the balance of the year, our focus remains on repositioning the company for profitable growth and successfully managing potential transactions for Health and Benefits. We believe the actions underway across Assurant will help build a stronger future for the company.
And with that, operator, please open the call for questions."

I think we're going to continue the same capital management approach that we've had, which is a disciplined and balanced deployment of capital between returning capital to shareholders and investing in the future of the company. And I think you saw the first quarter is a good example of that. We ended the quarter with essentially the same amount of capital that we started. We have $320 million of deployable capital still on hand. We still expect segment dividends to approximate what we're going to earn in the segments. We returned capital.

I mean, the intent of refocusing the company around housing and lifestyle is to create a more attractive company for our shareholders. That comes from a few different points. One is we have a proven track record in those areas of generating specialty returns long-term. Virtually every business that is part of the future of Assurant were a market leader, and that's something we can build off of. Almost every one of those businesses, we're doing more than just insurance. We have integrated offerings around the risk event which allow us to have better duration with partners, better economics for us. 
In general, these are less capital-intensive businesses. And so what we are really are focused on is free cash flow generation. That gives us the power to create value for our shareholders through the capital deployment. And as we looked across our portfolio, by far the highest profitable growth potential we have is in these areas of housing and lifestyle, really leveraging the consumer trends, the market trends, et cetera.

We look forward to discussing our second quarter 2015 results with you today. Joining me for Assurant's conference call are Alan Colberg, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Chris Pagano, our Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer.
Yesterday afternoon, we issued a news release announcing our second quarter 2015 results. The release and corresponding financial supplement are available at assurant.com.
As noted in our news release, beginning with the second quarter, Assurant is revising its presentation of results to reflect our focus on housing and lifestyle specialty protection products and services. As we wind down our major medical operations, results for Assurant Health are now included only net income and are no longer reflected in net operating income.
We will continue to report Assurant Employee Benefits under operating results as we pursue a sale of that business. 
Certain prior period results in the financial supplement and in the news release have been revised to conform to the new presentation. We believe these changes provide a more meaningful presentation of quarterly results and better reflect our strategic focus.
Today's call will contain other non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe are important in evaluating the company's performance. For more details on these measures, the comparable GAAP measures and a reconciliation of the two, please refer to the news release and financial supplement posted at assurant.com. 
We'll begin our call this morning with brief remarks from Alan and Chris before moving to Q&A. Some of the statements made today may be forward-looking and actual results may differ materially from those projected in these statements.
Additional information on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected can be found in yesterday's news release as well as in our SEC reports, including our 2014 Form 10-K, first quarter and upcoming second quarter Form 10-Q. Now, I'll turn the call over to Alan."

We are pleased with our overall performance in the second quarter. We're moving forward with our strategic realignment as we position Assurant for long-term profitable growth.
During the quarter, our momentum continued in housing and lifestyle. We grew market share, added client partnerships and expanded our products and services globally. At Assurant Solutions, we strengthened our lifestyle offerings in Connected Living, which includes service contracts in mobile. We extended our partnership with a leading U.S. mobile carrier to offer a buyer's remorse program. We will leverage our repair and logistics expertise to refurbish the unwanted devices and resell them through our global distribution channels, creating value for consumers, our clients and Assurant. Worldwide, mobile currently accounts for approximately 25% of Solutions revenue and more than a third of its profitability.
We've begun working with eBay to develop and launch an extended service contract program for new and used auto parts and accessories in the U.S. This new agreement builds on our long history in the auto warranty sector and leverages our expertise supporting online retailers. 
These partnerships reinforce our ability to offer solutions to customers across multiple distribution channels. This is another example of redeploying our capabilities into adjacent specialty areas where we can win.
At Assurant Specialty Property, we are transforming our lender-placed platform to increase efficiency while also maintaining exceptional client service. At the same time, our mortgage solutions business delivered strong organic growth as we integrate key functions across property preservation and appraisal management to provide additional value for our clients. We also broadened our multifamily housing capabilities through the acquisition of a receivables management company. 
During the quarter, we made progress with respect to the sale of Assurant Employee Benefits. Market interest continues to confirm our view that Employee Benefits is a valuable company. The process is moving ahead as planned and we expect to announce the sale by the end of the third quarter.
The wind down of Assurant Health continues and not on track with all modifications and actions so that we can substantially exit the market by the end of 2016. Following our announcement last month, we stopped issuing new major medical policies. We also reached an agreement in principle to sell our supplemental and self-funded product lines to National General.
Now let me offer some highlights from our second quarter results and then Chris will provide additional details. 
Annualized operating ROE, excluding AOCI, was 13.3% year-to-date. As noted, this excludes Health's results. Also, adjusting for the sale of American Reliable, Assurant's total revenue was roughly level with second quarter of 2014 as anticipated the clients in lender-placed were offset by increases in mobile and mortgage solutions fee income.
We are pleased that targeted growth areas in solutions and property are up 14% and now account for 26% of the revenue for these segments as well as a significant portion of profits. We'll continue to align resources toward our best opportunities and adjacent areas.
As we sharpened our strategic focus, Solutions and Specialty Property again generated strong cash flow in the second quarter. This allowed us to return a $124 million to shareholders through buybacks and dividends, invest in our specialty businesses and capitalize health to account for certain exit-related costs.
At the end of the quarter, we had $460 million of corporate capital at the holding company. We believe that capital released during the next 18 months from the Health wind down and the sale of Employee Benefits will provide us with significant flexibility. We will deploy this capital to build a stronger Assurant and create additional long-term value for shareholders.
Our second quarter results reinforced our strategic decision to build on our strengths in housing and lifestyle. Our sharper focus allows us to leverage our track record of sustained industry leadership to maximize opportunities for profitable global growth. We'll continue to extend beyond insurance to offer integrated services related to consumer risk events.  This includes growing our fee-based businesses that require less capital and generate more predictable earnings and cash flow over time.
As always, we're committed to disciplined capital deployment through investments in the business and return of capital to shareholders.
We believe these actions will allow us to realize our aspirations of generating top quartile shareholder returns. We're excited about the future and encouraged by our progress and momentum. 
And now I'll turn to Chris who will review results for the quarter and our outlook for 2015 in more detail. Chris?"

Excluding a net tax benefit, segment earnings totaled $52 million for the quarter. The $7 million year-over-year decline was primarily attributable to the previously disclosed loss of a tablet program in May and less income from mobile carrier marketing programs. 
International results were negatively affected by foreign exchange pressures and higher legal expenses related to a review of payment protection policies issued in the U.K. during 2003 and 2004. 
Turning to pre-need. The business benefited from lower mortality as well as continued growth from our partnership with SCI. Overall, revenue at Solutions was flat compared to second quarter of last year, consistent with our outlook for 2015.
The client loss noted earlier, foreign exchange volatility and expected declines at certain brick-and-mortar retailers offset growth in vehicle service contracts and other mobile programs. 
Looking ahead, we are encouraged by sales momentum in Connected Living, vehicle service contracts and pre-need, which we believe will generate profitable growth in future years. 
Now let's turn to Specialty Property, which had a very strong quarter exceeding our expectations.
Net operating income increased $19 million to $87 million driven by lower claims activity. The loss ratio improved 840 basis points year-over-year due to fewer reportable catastrophes and reduced frequency and severity of non-catastrophe claims.
As a reminder, the second quarter of 2014 included $22 million of adverse reserve development related to severe winter weather.
Adjusting for the sale of American Reliable, revenues decreased 2% as declines in lender-placed were nearly offset by strong growth in targeted areas. We continue to capture market share in mortgage solutions while expanding our savings capabilities in multi-family housing. We will continue to diversify into adjacent higher-margin fee-based businesses.
Moving to expenses. Our reported expense ratio increased 400 basis points year-over-year to approximately 50%. 2/3 of the increase was due to a greater proportion of fee-bases business. Excluding mortgage solutions, our insurance expense ratio increased by only 100 basis points to roughly 43%. This was driven mainly by lower insurance premiums. We've also made additional investments in our lender-placed platform to improve efficiencies long-term. We are on track to generate net savings in the second half of 2015 with more to come next year. These initiatives will help us maintain an insurance expense ratio in the mid 40s despite declining lender-placed revenue.
Earlier in the month, we finalized our 2015 Catastrophe Reinsurance Program, purchasing $1.3 billion of coverage. We were pleased to complete our program on attractive terms while also lowering our retention nearly 20% to $155 million. This comprehensive protection is an important part of our global risk management strategy.
For 2015, we expect properties revenue and earnings to decline due to the divestiture of American Reliable and the ongoing normalization lender-placed. As the inventory of seriously delinquent loans decreases, placement rates will continue to decline toward our forecasted range of 1.8% to 2.1% in the next few years.
Profitable growth within multi-family housing and mortgage solutions, along with international property expansion, will enable Specialty Property to maintain attractive returns long-term.
Turning to Employee Benefits, earnings in the quarter decreased by $3 million to $11 million due to less favorable life and disability results compared to second quarter 2014. While within the normal range of volatility, we saw a modest increase in disability incidence and an increase in life claims. Dental experience in the quarter remained favorable.
Net earned premiums and fee income increased 3%. Our strong voluntary platform, including dental, more than offset declines in employer-paid products. We were pleased that persistency and sales remain robust.
The Assurant Health run off operations reported a net loss of $124 million for the second quarter including $107 million of exit-related charges. These charges are mainly comprised of premium deficiency reserve, asset impairments and severance.
Premium deficiency reserves totaled $80 million after tax and reflect our view that future premiums and current claims reserves for major medical will be inadequate to cover future claims and direct expenses. The amount recorded in the quarter was slightly above our initial range to account for additional expenses through the wind down.
At the end of the second quarter, we received final notice from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, CMS, regarding risk mitigation payments for 2014 ACA policies. We were pleased that the final amounts for reinsurance and risk adjustment transfer were slightly better than March 31 estimates. This resulted in a net benefit of $9 million booked in the quarter. CMS confirmed that insurance carriers should receive payments during the third and fourth quarters. We will continue to monitor for any changes to that timetable.
We applied the lessons learned from 2014 and updated industry data to our 2015 estimation process. In the quarter, we accrued $117 million under the risk mitigation programs for 2015 effective policies. This included $68 million for Reinsurance and $49 million for the risk adjustment. As of June 30th, recoverables for 2015 policies under both programs totaled $237 million. Consistent with last quarter, we did not accrue any net recoverables for the risk quarters. Going forward, we expect to incur an additional $80 million to $95 million of exit costs primarily related to severance.
We will continue to refine our estimates for exit-related costs and the premium deficiency reserves based on actual loss experience, recoverables under the ACA risk mitigation programs and timing of expense reductions.
Results at Health will also reflect certain overhead expenses that cannot be included in the premium deficiency reserve calculation. 
Moving to Corporate, we ended June with $210 million of deployable capital. Total segment infusions in the second quarter, net of dividends, were $70 million as we funded capital needs at Health primarily from operating cash flow. We infused $215 million into Health to account for estimated total exit-related costs through the wind down period, which are recognized immediately under statutory accounting.
We believe that this will largely satisfy the capital needs during Health's run off subject to any significant changes in our assumptions for claims experience and exit-related expenses. We expect capital supporting Health will be returned to the holding company in the form of dividends in late 2016 subject to regulatory approval.
For full year 2015, we anticipate dividends from the operating segments, excluding Health, to exceed segment operating earnings, subject to growth and rating agency requirements. During the second quarter, we returned $22 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and we repurchased $102 million worth of stock. Through July 24th, we repurchased an additional 257,000 shares for $18 million. Year-to-date, this represents 5% of total shares outstanding. 
We continue to believe the stock is attractively priced. The proceeds from the sale of Employee Benefits and capital return from the Health wind down will provide additional flexibility to deploy capital prudently through a combination of share buybacks, common stock dividends and investments in housing and lifestyle.
The Corporate loss for the quarter declined to $9 million due to lower employee related benefit expenses and reduction in tax liabilities, which will reverse during the second half of the year.
The investment portfolio continues to perform well. Real estate joint venture partnerships generated $13 million of investment income in the quarter spread across the businesses.
Our focus for the remainder of 2015 is to position the company for profitable growth while successfully managing the exit of the health insurance market and the sale of Benefits. We believe all of the actions underway are critical to building a stronger company for the future. And with that, operator, please open the call for questions."

I mean, probably the way to think about Solutions is we are pursuing a strategy of creating client partnerships independent on most of the channel point. So we work with carriers. We work with OEMs. We work with retailers. Increasingly, we work with e-retailers. And what you see with the partnership that we announced with eBay, which we're still in the process of launching, so results will be later, is really that ability to work with large client partners across a variety of channels and that's really the hallmark of what Solutions does well, creating value for the consumer and for the client. The pipeline is robust for Solutions. The sales cycle is long, and we will continue to announce new partnerships as appropriate. But I think what you've seen in Solutions is we made a commitment to investors a couple of years ago that we expect over a period of time an average annual increase in NOI of 10%, obviously, with variability year-to-year. We still believe that's the right way to think about Solutions prospects going forward."

And on top of that, we've got capital being thrown off by the lender-placed business as it normalizes. So that is the -- that's what's driving our view of value and it will drive our repurchase decisions. But again, as Alan points out, again, it's a combination. We've got to invest in our business to maintain the leadership positions that we have."

We look forward to discussing our second quarter 2015 results with you today. Joining me for Assurant's conference call are Alan Colberg, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Chris Pagano, our Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer.
Yesterday afternoon, we issued a news release announcing our second quarter 2015 results. The release and corresponding financial supplement are available at assurant.com.
As noted in our news release, beginning with the second quarter, Assurant is revising its presentation of results to reflect our focus on housing and lifestyle, specialty protection products and services. As we wind down our major medical operations, results for Assurant Health are now included only net income and are no longer reflected in net operating income.
We will continue to report Assurant Employee Benefits under operating results as we pursue a sale of that business. 
Certain prior period results in the financial supplement and in the news release have been revised to conform to the new presentation. We believe these changes provide a more meaningful presentation of quarterly results and better reflect our strategic focus.
Today's call will contain other non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe are important in evaluating the company's performance. For more details on these measures, the comparable GAAP measures and a reconciliation of the 2, please refer to the news release and financial supplement posted at assurant.com. 
We'll begin our call this morning with brief remarks from Alan and Chris before moving to Q&A. Some of the statements made today may be forward-looking and actual results may differ materially from those projected in these statements.
Additional information on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected can be found in yesterday's news release as well as in our SEC reports, including our 2014 Form 10-K, first quarter and upcoming second quarter Form 10-Q. Now I'll turn the call over to Alan."

We are pleased with our overall performance in the second quarter. We're moving forward with our strategic realignment as we position Assurant for long-term profitable growth.
During the quarter, our momentum continued in housing and lifestyle. We grew market share, added client partnerships and expanded our products and services globally. At Assurant Solutions, we strengthened our lifestyle offerings in Connected Living, which includes service contracts in mobile. We extended our partnership with a leading U.S. mobile carrier to offer a buyer's remorse program. We will leverage our repair and logistics expertise to refurbish the unwanted devices and resell them through our global distribution channels, creating value for consumers, our clients and Assurant. Worldwide, mobile currently accounts for approximately 25% of Solutions revenue and more than 1/3 of its profitability.
We've begun working with eBay to develop and launch an extended service contract program for new and used auto parts and accessories in the U.S. This new agreement builds on our long history in the auto warranty sector and leverages our expertise supporting online retailers. 
These partnerships reinforce our ability to offer solutions to customers across multiple distribution channels. This is another example of redeploying our capabilities into adjacent specialty areas where we can win.
At Assurant Specialty Property, we are transforming our lender-placed platform to increase efficiency while also maintaining exceptional client service. At the same time, our mortgage solutions business delivered strong organic growth as we integrated key functions across property preservation and appraisal management to provide additional value for our clients. We also broadened our multifamily housing capabilities through the acquisition of a receivables management company. 
During the quarter, we made progress with respect to the sale of Assurant Employee Benefits. Market interest continues to confirm our view that Employee Benefits is a valuable company. The process is moving ahead as planned, and we expect to announce the sale by the end of the third quarter.
The wind down of Assurant Health continues and we're on track with all notification and actions so that we can substantially exit the market by the end of 2016. Following our announcement last month, we stopped issuing new major medical policies. We also reached an agreement in principle to sell our supplemental and self-funded product lines to National General.
Now let me offer some highlights from our second quarter results, and then Chris will provide additional details. 
Annualized operating ROE, excluding AOCI, was 13.3% year-to-date. As noted, this excludes Health's results. Also, adjusting for the sale of American Reliable, Assurant's total revenue was roughly level with second quarter of 2014. As anticipated, the clients in lender-placed were offset by increases in mobile and mortgage solutions fee income.
We are pleased that targeted growth areas in Solutions and Property are up 14% and now account for 26% of the revenue for these segments as well as a significant portion of profits. We'll continue to align resources toward our best opportunities and adjacent areas.
As we sharpened our strategic focus, Solutions and Specialty Property again generated strong cash flow in the second quarter. This allowed us to return a $124 million to shareholders through buybacks and dividends, invest in our specialty businesses and capitalize health to account for certain exit-related costs.
At the end of the quarter, we had $460 million of corporate capital at the holding company. We believe that capital released during the next 18 months from the Health wind-down and the sale of Employee Benefits will provide us with significant flexibility. We will deploy this capital to build a stronger Assurant and create additional long-term value for shareholders.
Our second quarter results reinforced our strategic decision to build on our strengths in housing and lifestyle. Our sharper focus allows us to leverage our track record of sustained industry leadership to maximize opportunities for profitable global growth. We'll continue to extend beyond insurance to offer integrated services related to consumer risk events. This includes growing our fee-based businesses that require less capital and generate more predictable earnings and cash flow over time. As always, we're committed to disciplined capital deployment through investments in the business and return of capital to shareholders.
We believe these actions will allow us to realize our aspirations of generating top quartile shareholder returns. We're excited about the future and encouraged by our progress and momentum. 
And now I'll turn to Chris who will review results for the quarter and our outlook for 2015 in more detail. Chris?"
4026111,306406537,841610,"Assurant Inc., Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 29, 2015",2015-07-29,"Earnings Calls","Assurant, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Alan. I'll start with Solutions where core results were in line with our expectations. Excluding a net tax benefit, segment earnings totaled $52 million for the quarter.

Excluding a net tax benefit, segment earnings totaled $52 million for the quarter. The $7 million year-over-year decline was primarily attributable to the previously disclosed loss of a tablet program in May and less income from mobile carrier marketing programs. 
International results were negatively affected by foreign exchange pressures and higher legal expenses related to a review of payment protection policies issued in the U.K. during 2003 and 2004. 
Turning to pre-need. The business benefited from lower mortality as well as continued growth from our partnership with SCI. Overall, revenue at Solutions was flat compared to second quarter of last year, consistent with our outlook for 2015.
The client loss noted earlier, foreign exchange volatility and expected declines at certain brick-and-mortar retailers offset growth in vehicle service contracts and other mobile programs. 
Looking ahead, we are encouraged by sales momentum in Connected Living, vehicle service contracts and pre-need, which we believe will generate profitable growth in future years. 
Now let's turn to Specialty Property, which had a very strong quarter exceeding our expectations. Net operating income increased $19 million to $87 million, driven by lower claims activity. The loss ratio improved 840 basis points year-over-year due to fewer reportable catastrophes and reduced frequency and severity of non-catastrophe claims. As a reminder, the second quarter of 2014 included $22 million of adverse reserve development related to severe winter weather.
Adjusting for the sale of American Reliable, revenues decreased 2% as declines in lender-placed were nearly offset by strong growth in targeted areas. We continue to capture market share in mortgage solutions while expanding our service capabilities in multi-family housing. We will continue to diversify into adjacent higher-margin fee-based businesses.
Moving to expenses. Our reported expense ratio increased 400 basis points year-over-year to approximately 50%. 2/3 of the increase was due to a greater proportion of fee-based business. Excluding mortgage solutions, our insurance expense ratio increased by only 100 basis points to roughly 43%. This was driven mainly by lower insurance premiums. We've also made additional investments in our lender-placed platform to improve efficiencies long term. We are on track to generate net savings in the second half of 2015 with more to come next year. These initiatives will help us maintain an insurance expense ratio in the mid-40s despite declining lender-placed revenue.
Earlier in the month, we finalized our 2015 Catastrophe Reinsurance Program, purchasing $1.3 billion of coverage. We were pleased to complete our program on attractive terms while also lowering our retention nearly 20% to $155 million. This comprehensive protection is an important part of our global risk management strategy.
For 2015, we expect properties revenue and earnings to decline due to the divestiture of American Reliable and the ongoing normalization of lender-placed. As the inventory of seriously delinquent loans decreases, placement rates will continue to decline toward our forecasted range of 1.8% to 2.1% in the next few years.
Profitable growth within multi-family housing and mortgage solutions, along with international property expansion, will enable Specialty Property to maintain attractive returns long term.
Turning to Employee Benefits, earnings in the quarter decreased by $3 million to $11 million due to less favorable life and disability results compared to second quarter 2014. While within the normal range of volatility, we saw a modest increase in disability incidents and an increase in life claims. Dental experience in the quarter remained favorable.
Net earned premiums and fee income increased 3%. Our strong voluntary platform, including dental, more than offset declines in employer-paid products. We were pleased that persistency and sales remained robust.
The Assurant Health runoff operations reported a net loss of $124 million for the second quarter, including $107 million of exit-related charges. These charges are mainly comprised of premium deficiency reserves, asset impairments and severance.
Premium deficiency reserves totaled $80 million after tax and reflect our view that future premiums and current claims reserves for major medical will be inadequate to cover future claims and direct expenses. The amount recorded in the quarter was slightly above our initial range to account for additional expenses through the wind-down.
At the end of the second quarter, we received final notice from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, CMS, regarding risk mitigation payments for 2014 ACA policies. We were pleased that the final amounts for reinsurance and the risk adjustment transfer were slightly better than March 31 estimates. This resulted in a net benefit of $9 million booked in the quarter. CMS confirmed that insurance carriers should receive payments during the third and fourth quarters. We will continue to monitor for any changes to that timetable.
We applied the lessons learned from 2014 and updated industry data to our 2015 estimation process. In the quarter, we accrued $117 million under the risk mitigation programs for 2015 effective policies. This included $68 million for reinsurance and $49 million for the risk adjustment. As of June 30, recoverables for 2015 policies under both programs totaled $237 million. Consistent with last quarter, we did not accrue any net recoverables for the risk corridors. Going forward, we expect to incur an additional $80 million to $95 million of exit costs primarily related to severance. We will continue to refine our estimates for exit-related costs and the premium deficiency reserves based on actual loss experience, recoverables under the ACA risk mitigation programs and timing of expense reductions. Results at Health will also reflect certain overhead expenses that cannot be included in the premium deficiency reserve calculation. 
Moving to Corporate, we ended June with $210 million of deployable capital. Total segment infusions in the second quarter, net of dividends, were $70 million as we funded capital needs at Health primarily from operating cash flow. We infused $215 million into Health to account for estimated total exit-related costs through the wind-down period, which are recognized immediately under statutory accounting. We believe that this will largely satisfy the capital needs during Health's runoff, subject to any significant changes in our assumptions for claims experience and exit-related expenses. We expect capital supporting Health will be returned to the holding company in the form of dividends in late 2016, subject to regulatory approval.
For full year 2015, we anticipate dividends from the operating segments, excluding Health, to exceed segment operating earnings, subject to growth and rating agency requirements. During the second quarter, we returned $22 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and we repurchased $102 million worth of stock. Through July 24, we repurchased an additional 257,000 shares for $18 million. Year-to-date, this represents 5% of total shares outstanding. 
We continue to believe the stock is attractively priced. The proceeds from the sale of Employee Benefits and capital return from the Health wind-down will provide additional flexibility to deploy capital prudently through a combination of share buybacks, common stock dividends and investments in housing and lifestyle.
The Corporate loss for the quarter declined to $9 million due to lower employee-related benefit expenses and reduction in tax liabilities, which will reverse during the second half of the year.
The investment portfolio continues to perform well. Real estate joint venture partnerships generated $13 million of investment income in the quarter spread across the businesses.
Our focus for the remainder of 2015 is to position the company for profitable growth while successfully managing the exit of the health insurance market and the sale of Benefits. We believe all of the actions underway are critical to building a stronger company for the future. 
And with that, operator, please open the call for questions."

I think you've seen a great track record over the last few years of buyback and including even this year with 5% of the stock buyback year-to-date. Any other consideration, things like a special dividend, that would be a board decision.

How should we think about sort of a ballpark of how much capital could be freed from the business once it runs off, I'm guessing, like, in 2016, but then the capital comes to the holdco in 2017?",149,"I had a couple of questions. First, on the Health business. How should we think about sort of a ballpark of how much capital could be freed from the business once it runs off, I'm guessing, like, in 2016, but then the capital comes to the holdco in 2017? So I think stat capital is about $340 million, but you've put in $215 million this quarter. Should we assume that whatever you're able to take out would be less than the $215 million because otherwise you would not have put the extra capital in? And then secondly, on the Employee Benefits business, how has your retention, your sales been affected by just the fact that the business is being up put up for bid?

We look forward to discussing our second quarter 2015 results with you today. Joining me for Assurant's conference call are Alan Colberg, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Chris Pagano, our Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer.
Yesterday afternoon, we issued a news release announcing our second quarter 2015 results. The release and corresponding financial supplement are available at assurant.com.
As noted in our news release, beginning with the second quarter, Assurant is revising its presentation of results to reflect our focus on housing and lifestyle, specialty protection products and services. As we wind down our major medical operations, results for Assurant Health are now included only net income and are no longer reflected in net operating income.
We will continue to report Assurant Employee Benefits under operating results as we pursue a sale of that business. 
Certain prior period results in the financial supplement and in the news release have been revised to conform to the new presentation. We believe these changes provide a more meaningful presentation of quarterly results and better reflect our strategic focus.
Today's call will contain other non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe are important in evaluating the company's performance. For more details on these measures, the comparable GAAP measures and a reconciliation of the 2, please refer to the news release and financial supplement posted at assurant.com. 
We'll begin our call this morning with brief remarks from Alan and Chris before moving to Q&A. Some of the statements made today may be forward-looking and actual results may differ materially from those projected in these statements.
Additional information on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected can be found in yesterday's news release as well as in our SEC reports, including our 2014 Form 10-K, first quarter and upcoming second quarter Form 10-Q. Now I'll turn the call over to Alan."

We are pleased with our overall performance in the second quarter. We're moving forward with our strategic realignment as we position Assurant for long-term profitable growth.
During the quarter, our momentum continued in housing and lifestyle. We grew market share, added client partnerships and expanded our products and services globally. At Assurant Solutions, we strengthened our lifestyle offerings in Connected Living, which includes service contracts in mobile. We extended our partnership with a leading U.S. mobile carrier to offer a buyer's remorse program. We will leverage our repair and logistics expertise to refurbish the unwanted devices and resell them through our global distribution channels, creating value for consumers, our clients and Assurant. Worldwide, mobile currently accounts for approximately 25% of Solutions revenue and more than 1/3 of its profitability.
We've begun working with eBay to develop and launch an extended service contract program for new and used auto parts and accessories in the U.S. This new agreement builds on our long history in the auto warranty sector and leverages our expertise supporting online retailers. 
These partnerships reinforce our ability to offer solutions to customers across multiple distribution channels. This is another example of redeploying our capabilities into adjacent specialty areas where we can win.
At Assurant Specialty Property, we are transforming our lender-placed platform to increase efficiency while also maintaining exceptional client service. At the same time, our mortgage solutions business delivered strong organic growth as we integrated key functions across property preservation and appraisal management to provide additional value for our clients. We also broadened our multifamily housing capabilities through the acquisition of a receivables management company. 
During the quarter, we made progress with respect to the sale of Assurant Employee Benefits. Market interest continues to confirm our view that Employee Benefits is a valuable company. The process is moving ahead as planned, and we expect to announce the sale by the end of the third quarter.
The wind down of Assurant Health continues and we're on track with all notification and actions so that we can substantially exit the health market by the end of 2016. Following our announcement last month, we stopped issuing new major medical policies. We also reached an agreement in principle to sell our supplemental and self-funded product lines to National General.
Now let me offer some highlights from our second quarter results, and then Chris will provide additional details. 
Annualized operating ROE, excluding AOCI, was 13.3% year-to-date. As noted, this excludes Health's results. Also, adjusting for the sale of American Reliable, Assurant's total revenue was roughly level with second quarter of 2014. As anticipated, the clients in lender-placed were offset by increases in mobile and mortgage solutions fee income.
We are pleased that targeted growth areas in Solutions and Property are up 14% and now account for 26% of the revenue for these segments as well as a significant portion of profits. We'll continue to align resources toward our best opportunities and adjacent areas.
As we sharpened our strategic focus, Solutions and Specialty Property again generated strong cash flow in the second quarter. This allowed us to return a $124 million to shareholders through buybacks and dividends, invest in our specialty businesses and capitalize health to account for certain exit-related costs.
At the end of the quarter, we had $460 million of corporate capital at the holding company. We believe that capital released during the next 18 months from the Health wind-down and the sale of Employee Benefits will provide us with significant flexibility. We will deploy this capital to build a stronger Assurant and create additional long-term value for shareholders.
Our second quarter results reinforced our strategic decision to build on our strengths in housing and lifestyle. Our sharper focus allows us to leverage our track record of sustained industry leadership to maximize opportunities for profitable global growth. We'll continue to extend beyond insurance to offer integrated services related to consumer risk events. This includes growing our fee-based businesses that require less capital and generate more predictable earnings and cash flow over time. As always, we're committed to disciplined capital deployment through investments in the business and return of capital to shareholders.
We believe these actions will allow us to realize our aspirations of generating top quartile shareholder returns. We're excited about the future and encouraged by our progress and momentum. 
And now I'll turn to Chris who will review results for the quarter and our outlook for 2015 in more detail. Chris?"
4026111,306406537,841867,"Assurant Inc., Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 29, 2015",2015-07-29,"Earnings Calls","Assurant, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Alan. I'll start with Solutions where core results were in line with our expectations. Excluding a net tax benefit, segment earnings totaled $52 million for the quarter.

Excluding a net tax benefit, segment earnings totaled $52 million for the quarter. The $7 million year-over-year decline was primarily attributable to the previously disclosed loss of a tablet program in May and less income from mobile carrier marketing programs. 
International results were negatively affected by foreign exchange pressures and higher legal expenses related to a review of payment protection policies issued in the U.K. during 2003 and 2004. 
Turning to pre-need. The business benefited from lower mortality as well as continued growth from our partnership with SCI. Overall, revenue at Solutions was flat compared to second quarter of last year, consistent with our outlook for 2015.
The client loss noted earlier, foreign exchange volatility and expected declines at certain brick-and-mortar retailers offset growth in vehicle service contracts and other mobile programs. 
Looking ahead, we are encouraged by sales momentum in Connected Living, vehicle service contracts and pre-need, which we believe will generate profitable growth in future years. 
Now let's turn to Specialty Property, which had a very strong quarter exceeding our expectations. Net operating income increased $19 million to $87 million, driven by lower claims activity. The loss ratio improved 840 basis points year-over-year due to fewer reportable catastrophes and reduced frequency and severity of non-catastrophe claims. As a reminder, the second quarter of 2014 included $22 million of adverse reserve development related to severe winter weather.
Adjusting for the sale of American Reliable, revenues decreased 2% as declines in lender-placed were nearly offset by strong growth in targeted areas. We continue to capture market share in mortgage solutions while expanding our service capabilities in multi-family housing. We will continue to diversify into adjacent higher-margin fee-based businesses.
Moving to expenses. Our reported expense ratio increased 400 basis points year-over-year to approximately 50%. 2/3 of the increase was due to a greater proportion of fee-based business. Excluding mortgage solutions, our insurance expense ratio increased by only 100 basis points to roughly 43%. This was driven mainly by lower insurance premiums. We've also made additional investments in our lender-placed platform to improve efficiencies long term. We are on track to generate net savings in the second half of 2015 with more to come next year. These initiatives will help us maintain an insurance expense ratio in the mid-40s despite declining lender-placed revenue.
Earlier in the month, we finalized our 2015 Catastrophe Reinsurance Program, purchasing $1.3 billion of coverage. We were pleased to complete our program on attractive terms while also lowering our retention nearly 20% to $155 million. This comprehensive protection is an important part of our global risk management strategy.
For 2015, we expect properties revenue and earnings to decline due to the divestiture of American Reliable and the ongoing normalization of lender-placed. As the inventory of seriously delinquent loans decreases, placement rates will continue to decline toward our forecasted range of 1.8% to 2.1% in the next few years.
Profitable growth within multi-family housing and mortgage solutions, along with international property expansion, will enable Specialty Property to maintain attractive returns long term.
Turning to Employee Benefits, earnings in the quarter decreased by $3 million to $11 million due to less favorable life and disability results compared to second quarter 2014. While within the normal range of volatility, we saw a modest increase in disability incidents and an increase in life claims. Dental experience in the quarter remained favorable.
Net earned premiums and fee income increased 3%. Our strong voluntary platform, including dental, more than offset declines in employer-paid products. We were pleased that persistency and sales remained robust.
The Assurant Health runoff operations reported a net loss of $124 million for the second quarter, including $107 million of exit-related charges. These charges are mainly comprised of premium deficiency reserves, asset impairments and severance.
Premium deficiency reserves totaled $80 million after tax and reflect our view that future premiums and current claims reserves for major medical will be inadequate to cover future claims and direct expenses. The amount recorded in the quarter was slightly above our initial range to account for additional expenses through the wind-down.
At the end of the second quarter, we received final notice from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, CMS, regarding risk mitigation payments for 2014 ACA policies. We were pleased that the final amounts for reinsurance and the risk adjustment transfer were slightly better than March 31 estimates. This resulted in a net benefit of $9 million booked in the quarter. CMS confirmed that insurance carriers should receive payments during the third and fourth quarters. We will continue to monitor for any changes to that timetable.
We applied the lessons learned from 2014 and updated industry data to our 2015 estimation process. In the quarter, we accrued $117 million under the risk mitigation programs for 2015 effective policies. This included $68 million for reinsurance and $49 million for the risk adjustment. As of June 30, recoverables for 2015 policies under both programs totaled $237 million. Consistent with last quarter, we did not accrue any net recoverables for the risk corridors. 
Going forward, we expect to incur an additional $80 million to $95 million of exit costs primarily related to severance. We will continue to refine our estimates for exit-related costs and the premium deficiency reserves based on actual loss experience, recoverables under the ACA risk mitigation programs and timing of expense reductions. Results at Health will also reflect certain overhead expenses that cannot be included in the premium deficiency reserve calculation. 
Moving to Corporate, we ended June with $210 million of deployable capital. Total segment infusions in the second quarter, net of dividends, were $70 million as we funded capital needs at Health primarily from operating cash flow. We infused $215 million into Health to account for estimated total exit-related costs through the wind-down period, which are recognized immediately under statutory accounting. We believe that this will largely satisfy the capital needs during Health's runoff, subject to any significant changes in our assumptions for claims experience and exit-related expenses. We expect capital supporting Health will be returned to the holding company in the form of dividends in late 2016, subject to regulatory approval.
For full year 2015, we anticipate dividends from the operating segments, excluding Health, to exceed segment operating earnings, subject to growth and rating agency requirements. During the second quarter, we returned $22 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and we repurchased $102 million worth of stock. Through July 24, we repurchased an additional 257,000 shares for $18 million. Year-to-date, this represents 5% of total shares outstanding. 
We continue to believe the stock is attractively priced. The proceeds from the sale of Employee Benefits and capital return from the Health wind-down will provide additional flexibility to deploy capital prudently through a combination of share buybacks, common stock dividends and investments in housing and lifestyle.
The Corporate loss for the quarter declined to $9 million due to lower employee-related benefit expenses and reduction in tax liabilities, which will reverse during the second half of the year.
The investment portfolio continues to perform well. Real estate joint venture partnerships generated $13 million of investment income in the quarter spread across the businesses.
Our focus for the remainder of 2015 is to position the company for profitable growth while successfully managing the exit of the health insurance market and the sale of Benefits. We believe all of the actions underway are critical to building a stronger company for the future. 
And with that, operator, please open the call for questions."

I think you've seen a great track record over the last few years of buyback and including even this year with 5% of the stock buyback year-to-date. Any other consideration, things like a special dividend, that would be a board decision.

In our lender-placed business though, we do feel we have the best business in the industry. We've been consistently gaining share in recent years. We've been reinvesting in that business to improve the capabilities. It's an extraordinarily valuable service and product for the mortgage industry. And we feel very good about that business as it normalizes, and we're confident it will remain a specialty business for us, as we talked about. More broadly, lots of activity going on in the market, we really can't comment on that. We're focused on repositioning Assurant around housing and lifestyle. That's a great franchise. It's an area where we've consistently generated specialty returns long term. It's an area where we hold leadership positions in most of the markets we now are playing in. We're continuing to expand our offerings to be more than just an insurance company with really integrated offerings to create value for the partners we work with. The businesses we're investing in are less capital-intensive on average, generating very strong free cash flow. We think all those actions are going to maximize the value of Assurant to our shareholders, and we feel good about the go-forward new Assurant."

We look forward to discussing our third quarter 2015 results with you today. 
Joining me for Assurant's conference call are Alan Colberg, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Chris Pagano, our Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. 
Yesterday afternoon, we issued a news release announcing our third quarter results. The release and corresponding financial supplement are available at assurant.com. 
Beginning last quarter, we revised the presentation of Assurant's results to reflect our focus on housing and lifestyle specialty offerings. As a reminder, results for Assurant Health runoff operations are included only net income and are no longer reflected in net operating income. We will continue to report Assurant Employee Benefits under operating results until the sale of that business is closed, which we expect to occur by the end of the first quarter 2016. 
Today's call will contain other non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe are important in evaluating the company's performance. For more details on those measures, the most comparable GAAP measures and a reconciliation of the two, please refer to the news release and financial supplement posted at assurant.com. 
We'll begin our call this morning with brief remarks from Alan and Chris before moving to Q&A. 
Some of the statements made today may be forward-looking and actual results may differ materially from those projected in these statements. Additional information on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected can be found in yesterday's news release, as well as in our SEC reports, including our 2014 Form 10-K, first and second quarter and upcoming third quarter Form 10-Q. 
Now, I'll turn the call over to Alan."

During the third quar",964,"Thanks, Francesca, and good morning, everyone. 
Our housing and lifestyle specialty protection businesses within solutions and specialty property delivered solid results, as we position the company for long-term profitable growth. 
During the third quarter, we took significant actions to support our strategic realignment and transformation of Assurant. We reached a definitive agreement with Sun Life Financial for the purchase of Assurant Employee Benefits. The transaction will provide Assurant with $1 billion of net proceeds, including capital releases, to support profitable growth long-term. Preparations for the divestiture and day 1 integration are progressing as planned. All required regulatory filings have been submitted and we hope to receive approval to close the transaction by the end of the first quarter 2016. 
At Assurant Health, we completed the sale of our supplemental and self-funded businesses, the National General, on October 1, for $14 million. The challenges that helped increase during the quarter, with higher than expected frequency and severity of claims, which will require capital infusions in the fourth quarter. While this development is disappointing, the wind down process is on track. We still expect to substantially exit the health insurance market next year and release the remaining capital supporting the business. The sale of benefits and wind down of our health operations support our strategic focus on specialty housing and lifestyle markets. We see many opportunities ahead to deliver attractive returns while providing Assurant with greater flexibility to redeploy capital for the benefit of shareholders. 
Our enhanced capital management plan announced in September reinforces our confidence in our ongoing businesses, as well as our commitment to disciplined deployment over the long-term. During the third quarter, we also established an organizational framework that will support our realignment and profitable growth. The leadership changes announced in September at senior level expertise to our management committee in 4 critical functions: enterprise risk management; technology; strategy and business development; and communication and marketing. These moves set the framework so that we can be more agile, operate more efficiently and accelerate the transformation of Assurant. 
I'm especially pleased that Chris will take on the Chief Risk Officer role once the CFO successor is named. Our core risk management capability, which Chris developed and championed, provides a great foundation from which we will be able to expand our global enterprise risk practices. Our external searches for Chris' successor as CFO and for our Chief Technology Officer are moving ahead. We believe our management committee will benefit from additional outside perspective, especially given how essential technology and digital transformation are to Assurant's long-term strategy and success in healthy and lifestyle. 
The promotions of Peter Walker and Francesca Luthi also reflect our deep bench of talent at Assurant and underscore the critical importance of strategy and communication and marketing to our ongoing success. These changes will allow our business lines to focus predominantly on critical client relationships, sales and exceptional customer service. 
Looking ahead, we remain optimistic about the opportunities at Assurant. During the third quarter, we continue to grow market share, add client partnerships and expand our suite of global offerings. 
At Assurant Solutions, we launched new mobile protection programs with Google and Samsung. While the programs will start small, these partnerships represent important steps in our global expansion of Connected Living. As a leading provider of vehicle protection services, we also see opportunities to further scale and strengthen our capabilities. To support our strategy, we acquired coast-to-coast an auto claims administrator, serving more than 1,000 clients across North America. We will leverage their robust administrative platform to extend our market share. 
At specialty property, we continue to transform our lender-placed platform, which is core to our housing offerings. We are starting to achieve savings that will accelerate and more than offset future investments. 
In October, we exited the vehicle title business, which was a nongrowth area for us. This business represented less than $10 million of annualized fee income and was sold for $19 million in cash proceeds. This is yet another example of our active and disciplined portfolio management. 
Momentum in properties target of growth areas continued in the third quarter. Multi-family housing, again, will deliver double-digit growth. We anticipate mortgage solutions will contribute close to $300 million in fee income this year. This represents more than 20% organic growth from 2014. We are pleased with our progress in these areas and believe we are well-positioned for the future. 
Now, I will offer some highlights results year-to-date and then Chris will provide additional details. Annualized operating ROE, excluding AOCI, was 12.5%. As a reminder, this excludes results from health's one-off operations. Assurant's net earned premiums and fees for the 9 months of 2015 decreased modestly after adjusting for health and the sale of American Reliable. This decline reflects the ongoing normalization of lender-placed. Fee income increased 27%, as we broadened our service offerings beyond traditional insurance. Cash flow remains strong, namely from specialty property and solutions, as we ended the quarter with $520 million of holding company capital. 
For the remainder of this year and into 2016, we will focus on executing our strategy to build a stronger Assurant for the future. Next year, absent significant hurricane activity, we believe we can sustain results in our ongoing businesses by expanding share in our targeted areas as we manage the normalization of lender-placed and other one-off operations. 
We will continue to work to eliminate the expense overhang from health and employee benefits. By establishing a more efficient organization model, we will maximize resources in 2016 and beyond. These actions will allow us to realize our aspirations of generating top quartile shareholder returns. We are optimistic about the future and encouraged by the pace of progress. 
And now, I'll turn to Chris who will review results for the quarter in more detail. Chris?"
4026111,312932186,883859,"Assurant Inc., Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2015",2015-10-28,"Earnings Calls","Assurant, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Alan. I'll start with solutions, where results were in line with our expectations. Excluding a $4.5 million net tax benefit from our international operations, segment earnings totaled $48 million for the quarter. This is compared to $55 million",1165,"Thanks, Alan. 
I'll start with solutions, where results were in line with our expectations. Excluding a $4.5 million net tax benefit from our international operations, segment earnings totaled $48 million for the quarter. This is compared to $55 million in the prior year period after adjusting for a $2.7 million asset impairment charge. The $7 million decline was driven by lower service contract volume at traditional retailers as consumers increasingly prefer e-commerce shopping. 
Earnings from mobile increased, despite the previously disclosed loss of a domestic tablet program. The improvement was driven by growth in covered devices and sustained client marketing activity. 
Revenues at solutions were down slightly compared to last year. This was due to the tablet program loss, foreign exchange volatility and declined at retailers. The decrease was partially offset by more than 20% growth in the vehicle service contract business from higher production at new and existing clients. 
Fee income also increased 21%, driven by mobile programs, where we continue to expand our repair and logistics offerings. 
Looking ahead to 2016, we remain focused on driving sustainable, profitable growth. We believe our integrated Connected Living offerings, along with improved international results and expense discipline, will be key drivers as we absorb larger declines from retail clients and the runoff of our domestic credit operations. 
Now, let's turn to Specialty Property, where results came in stronger than expected. Net operating income declined $17 million to $87 million. This was driven by ongoing lender-placed normalization and the client contract changes noted in previous quarters. Overall results, however, benefited from lower catastrophe reinsurance costs, no hurricane activity and lower non-catastrophe losses. Lower frequency and severity trends contributed to the improved loss experience. We are also encouraged by the increasing contributions from multi-family housing and mortgage solutions. Net earned premiums and fees decreased 12% after adjusting for the sale of American Reliable. This was due to declines in lender-placed, including the previously disclosed loss of client business. The impact was greater in the third quarter as the higher volume of policies for this client were renewed and transferred to the new carrier. We expect the transition of these policies to be largely complete by year-end. Specialty Property fee income increased 21% year-over-year. This was primarily due to growth in our property preservation offerings as we added new clients and leveraged cross-selling opportunities. 
Turning to expenses. Our reported expense ratio increased 520 basis points year-over-year to around 52%. 1/3 of the increase was due to a greater proportion of fee-based business, with the balance primarily caused by lower lender-placed premiums. Excluding mortgage solutions, our insurance expense ratio increased 300 basis points to roughly 45%. We've made additional investments in our lender-placed platform and we're able to generate net savings in the third quarter with more efficiency gains expected into 2016. These investments will help to keep our insurance expense ratio in the mid-40s longer-term as we modify the infrastructure to align with the lender-placed declines. We are pleased with Specialty Property's results thus far this year. In 2016, our focus will be to grow by adding new clients and increasing penetration in mortgage solutions and multi-family housing, while executing our lender-placed transformation. 
Results in employee benefits were in line with expectations. Earnings totaled $10 million for the quarter, a slight decline from third quarter 2014 due to less favorable Dental and disability results. Net earned premiums and fee income increased modestly as expected decline in employer-paid products were more than offset by strong voluntary growth. Expansion of voluntary continues to be driven by a diversed product offering and a robust benefits communication and administration platform, which we believe complement Sun Life's existing business. We are committed to ensuring a seamless transition for brokers, clients and employees as we prepare to close the sale by the end of the first quarter 2016. 
As we preannounced last week, Assurant Health one-off operations posted a net loss of $144 million for the third quarter. We experienced higher than expected frequency and severity of claims on 2015 ACA individual major medical policies. Third quarter results also included a strengthening of the premium deficiency reserves to account for higher estimated future losses and other direct expenses through 2017. We incurred $17 million after tax in severance and other exit related charges. In order to maintain adequate statutory surplus levels, we will infuse an estimated $200 million into health in the fourth quarter of this year. As of January 1, 2016, our block of ACA individual major medical policies will terminate. We expect most claims related to these policies to be paid by the end of the second quarter. In the months ahead, we will continue to refine our estimates for the premium deficiency reserves based on actual loss experience, recoverable's under the 2015 ACA risk mitigation programs and additional exit related charges. At the same time, we are evaluating alternative options to limit the length and expenses associated with the wind down period. As noted in the release, recoverable's for 2015 policies under reinsurance and risk-adjusted programs totaled $371 million as of September 30, 2015. Consistent with prior quarters, we did not accrue any net recoverable's for the risk orders. The majority of reimbursements for 2015 recoverable's are expected to be paid in the third quarter of 2016. We will continue to monitor for any updates to that timetable or changes in payment authorization. 
Moving to Corporate. We ended September with $270 million of deployable capital. During the third quarter, segment dividends totaled $188 million, reflecting solid profitability in our ongoing businesses and capital releases from lender-placed. We made additional investments in our vehicle service contract capabilities and returned $47 million to shareholders in the form of dividend and buybacks. Additionally, in the first 3 weeks of October, we bought $74 million worth of stock. Year-to-date, we've repurchased 4.2 million shares, representing 6% of total shares outstanding. We continue to view the stock as attractively priced. Over the course of next 18 months, we will deploy capital prudently through a combination of share buybacks, common stock dividends and investments in housing and lifestyle. As always, the timing and pace of our buyback programs take into account a variety of factors. We will continue to monitor claims development at health and as needed, factor that into our decision-making. The Corporate loss for the quarter increased to $27 million, primarily reflecting an expected reversal of tax benefits recorded in the first half of this year and $2.5 million of strategic repositioning costs. For the full year, the net operating loss for Corporate is expected to be around $65 million, excluding repositioning costs. 
Our focus for the remainder of 2015 is to position the company for profitable growth. We will do so while successfully managing the upcoming sale of employee benefits and continually exit of the health insurance market. We believe all of the actions underway are critical to building a stronger company for the future.

We are working hard to eliminate the overhang from Health and Employee Benefits. Some of the organizational changes that we announced last month and that allow us to really create a more agile, more efficient organization model.

Joining me for Assurant's conference call are Alan Colberg, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Chris Pagano, our Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. 
Yesterday afternoon, we issued a news release announcing our third quarter results. The release and corresponding financial supplement are available at assurant.com. 
Beginning last quarter, we revised the presentation of Assurant's results to reflect our focus on housing and lifestyle specialty offerings. As a reminder, results for Assurant Health runoff operations are included only in net income and are no longer reflected in net operating income. We will continue to report Assurant Employee Benefits under operating results until the sale of that business is closed, which we expect to occur by the end of the first quarter 2016. 
Today's call will contain other non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe are important in evaluating the company's performance. For more details on those measures, the most comparable GAAP measures and a reconciliation of the 2, please refer to the news release and financial supplement posted at assurant.com. 
We'll begin our call this morning with brief remarks from Alan and Chris before moving to Q&A. 
Some of the statements made today may be forward-looking and actual results may differ materially from those projected in these statements. Additional information on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected can be found in yesterday's news release as well as in our SEC reports including our 2014 Form 10-K, first and second quarter and upcoming third quarter Form 10-Q.

Our housing and lifestyle specialty protection businesses within Solutions and Specialty Property delivered solid results as we position the company for long-term profitable growth. 
During the third quarter, we took significant actions to support our strategic realignment and transformation of Assurant. We reached a definitive agreement with Sun Life Financial for the purchase of Assurant Employee Benefits. The transaction will provide Assurant with $1 billion of net proceeds, including capital releases, to support profitable growth long term. Preparations for the divestiture and day 1 integration are progressing as planned. All required regulatory filings have been submitted, and we hope to receive approval to close the transaction by the end of the first quarter 2016. 
At Assurant Health, we completed the sale of our supplemental and self-funded businesses, the National General, on October 1, for $14 million. The challenges had helped increase during the quarter with higher-than-expected frequency and severity of claims, which will require capital infusions in the fourth quarter. While this development is disappointing, the wind-down process is on track. We still expect to substantially exit the health insurance market next year and release the remaining capital supporting the business. The sale of benefits and wind down of our Health operations support our strategic focus on specialty housing and lifestyle markets. We see many opportunities ahead to deliver attractive returns while providing Assurant with greater flexibility to redeploy capital for the benefit of shareholders. 
Our enhanced capital management plan announced in September reinforces our confidence in our ongoing businesses as well as our commitment to disciplined deployment over the long term. During the third quarter, we also established an organizational framework that will support our realignment and profitable growth. The leadership changes announced in September at senior-level expertise to our management committee in 4 critical functions: enterprise risk management; technology; strategy and business development; and communication and marketing. These moves set the framework so that we can be more agile, operate more cost efficiently and accelerate the transformation of Assurant. 
I'm especially pleased that Chris will take on the Chief Risk Officer role once the CFO successor is named. Our core risk management capability, which Chris developed and championed, provides a great foundation from which we will be able to expand our global enterprise risk practices. Our external searches for Chris' successor as CFO and for our Chief Technology Officer are moving ahead. We believe our management committee will benefit from additional outside perspective, especially given how essential technology and digital transformation are to Assurant's long-term strategy and success in healthy and lifestyle. 
The promotions of Peter Walker and Francesca Luthi also reflect our deep bench of talent at Assurant and underscore the critical importance of strategy and communication and marketing to our ongoing success. These changes will allow our business lines to focus predominantly on critical client relationships, sales and exceptional customer service. 
Looking ahead, we remain optimistic about the opportunities at Assurant. During the third quarter, we continue to grow market share, add client partnerships and expand our suite of global offerings. 
At Assurant Solutions, we launched new mobile protection programs with Google and Samsung. While the programs will start small, these partnerships represent important steps in our global expansion of Connected Living. As a leading provider of vehicle protection services, we also see opportunities to further scale and strengthen our capabilities. To support our strategy, we acquired Coast To Coast, an auto claims administrator, serving more than 1,000 clients across North America. We will leverage their robust administrative platform to extend our market share. 
At Specialty Property, we continue to transform our lender-placed platform, which is core to our housing offerings. We are starting to achieve savings that will accelerate and more than offset future investments. 
In October, we exited the vehicle title business, which was a nongrowth area for us. This business represented less than $10 million of annualized fee income and was sold for $19 million in cash proceeds. This is yet another example of our active and disciplined portfolio management. 
Momentum in Property's targeted of growth areas continued in the third quarter. Multi-family housing, again, will deliver double-digit growth. We anticipate mortgage solutions will contribute close to $300 million in fee income this year. This represents more than 20% organic growth from 2014. We are pleased with our progress in these areas and believe we are well positioned for the future. 
Now I'll offer some highlights from results year-to-date and then Chris will provide additional details. Annualized operating ROE, excluding AOCI, was 12.5%. As a reminder, this excludes results from Health runoff operations. Assurant's net earned premiums and fees for the 9 months of 2015 decreased modestly after adjusting for Health and the sale of American Reliable. This decline reflects the ongoing normalization of lender placed. Fee income increased 27% as we broadened our service offerings beyond traditional insurance. Cash flow remained strong, namely from Specialty Property and Solutions, as we ended the quarter with $520 million of holding company capital. 
For the remainder of this year and into 2016, we will focus on executing our strategy to build a stronger Assurant for the future. Next year, absent significant hurricane activity, we believe we can sustain results in our ongoing businesses by expanding share in our targeted areas as we manage the normalization of lender-placed and other runoff operations. 
We will continue to work to eliminate the expense overhang from Health and Employee Benefits. By establishing a more efficient organization model, we will maximize resources in 2016 and beyond. These actions will allow us to realize our aspirations of generating top quartile shareholder returns. We're optimistic about the future and encouraged by the pace of progress. 
And now I'll turn to Chris, who will review results for the quarter in more detail. Chris?"
4026111,312932186,884201,"Assurant Inc., Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2015",2015-10-28,"Earnings Calls","Assurant, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Alan. I'll start with solutions, where results were in line with our expectations. Excluding a $4.5 million net tax benefit from our international operations, segment earnings totaled $48 million for the quarter. This is compared to $55 million",1165,"Thanks, Alan. 
I'll start with solutions, where results were in line with our expectations. Excluding a $4.5 million net tax benefit from our international operations, segment earnings totaled $48 million for the quarter. This is compared to $55 million in the prior year period after adjusting for a $2.7 million asset impairment charge. The $7 million decline was driven by lower service contract volume at traditional retailers as consumers increasingly prefer e-commerce shopping. 
Earnings from mobile increased, despite the previously disclosed loss of a domestic tablet program. The improvement was driven by growth in covered devices and sustained client marketing activity. 
Revenues at Solutions were down slightly compared to last year. This was due to the tablet program loss, foreign exchange volatility and declines at retailers. The decrease was partially offset by more than 20% growth in the vehicle service contract business from higher production at new and existing clients. 
Fee income also increased 21%, driven by mobile programs, where we continue to expand our repair and logistics offerings. 
Looking ahead to 2016, we remain focused on driving sustainable, profitable growth. We believe our integrated Connected Living offerings, along with improved international results and expense discipline, will be key drivers as we absorb larger declines from retail clients and the runoff of our domestic credit operations. 
Now let's turn to Specialty Property, where results came in stronger than expected. Net operating income declined $17 million to $87 million. This was driven by ongoing lender-placed normalization and client contract changes noted in previous quarters. Overall results, however, benefited from lower catastrophe reinsurance costs, no hurricane activity and lower non-catastrophe losses. Lower frequency and severity trends contributed to the improved loss experience. We were also encouraged by the increasing contributions from multi-family housing and mortgage solutions. Net earned premiums and fees decreased 12% after adjusting for the sale of American Reliable. This was due to declines in lender placed, including the previously disclosed loss of client business. The impact was greater in the third quarter as a higher volume of policies for this client were renewed and transferred to the new carrier. We expect the transition of these policies to be largely complete by year-end. Specialty Property fee income increased 21% year-over-year. This was primarily due to growth in our property preservation offerings as we added new clients and leveraged cross-selling opportunities. 
Turning to expenses. Our reported expense ratio increased 520 basis points year-over-year to around 52%. 1/3 of the increase was due to a greater proportion of fee-based business, with the balance primarily caused by lower lender-placed premiums. Excluding mortgage solutions, our insurance expense ratio increased 300 basis points to roughly 45%. We've made additional investments in our lender-placed platform and were able to generate net savings in the third quarter with more efficiency gains expected into 2016. These investments will help to keep our insurance expense ratio in the mid-40s longer term as we modify the infrastructure to align with the lender-placed declines. We are pleased with Specialty Property's results thus far this year. In 2016, our focus will be to grow by adding new clients and increasing penetration in mortgage solutions and multi-family housing, while executing our lender-placed transformation. 
Results in Employee Benefits were in line with expectations. Earnings totaled $10 million for the quarter, a slight decline from third quarter 2014 due, to less favorable Dental and disability results. Net earned premiums and fee income increased modestly as expected declines in employer-paid products were more than offset by strong voluntary growth. Expansion of voluntary continues to be driven by a diverse product offering and a robust benefits communication and administration platform, which we believe complements Sun Life's existing business. We are committed to ensuring a seamless transition for brokers, clients and employees as we prepare to close the sale by the end of the first quarter 2016. 
As we preannounced last week, Assurant Health runoff operations posted a net loss of $144 million for the third quarter. We experienced higher than expected frequency and severity of claims on 2015 ACA individual major medical policies. Third quarter results also included a strengthening of the premium deficiency reserves to account for higher estimated future losses and other direct expenses through 2017. We incurred $17 million after-tax in severance and other exit-related charges. In order to maintain adequate statutory surplus levels, we will infuse an estimated $200 million into health in the fourth quarter of this year. As of January 1, 2016, our block of ACA individual major medical policies will terminate. We expect most claims related to these policies to be paid by the end of the second quarter. In the months ahead, we will continue to refine our estimates for the premium deficiency reserves based on actual loss experience, recoverables under the 2015 ACA risk mitigation programs and additional exit-related charges. At the same time, we are evaluating alternative options to limit the length and expenses associated with the wind-down period. As noted in the release, recoverables for 2015 policies under reinsurance and risk-adjusted programs totaled $371 million as of September 30, 2015. Consistent with prior quarters, we did not accrue any net recoverables for the risk corridors. The majority of reimbursements for 2015 recoverables are expected to be paid in the third quarter of 2016. We will continue to monitor for any updates to that timetable or changes in payment authorization. 
Moving to Corporate. We ended September with $270 million of deployable capital. During the third quarter, segment dividends totaled $188 million, reflecting solid profitability in our ongoing businesses and capital releases from lender placed. We made additional investments in our vehicle service contract capabilities and returned $47 million to shareholders in the form of dividend and buybacks. Additionally, in the first 3 weeks of October, we bought $74 million worth of stock. Year-to-date, we've repurchased 4.2 million shares, representing 6% of total shares outstanding. We continue to view the stock as attractively priced. Over the course of the next 18 months, we will deploy capital prudently through a combination of share buybacks, common stock dividends and investments in housing and lifestyle. As always, the timing and pace of our buyback programs take into account a variety of factors. We will continue to monitor claims development at health and as needed, factor that into our decision-making. The Corporate loss for the quarter increased to $27 million, primarily reflecting an expected reversal of tax benefits recorded in the first half of this year and $2.5 million of strategic repositioning costs. For the full year, the net operating loss for Corporate is expected to be around $65 million, excluding repositioning costs. 
Our focus for the remainder of 2015 is to position the company for profitable growth. We will do so while successfully managing the upcoming sale of Employee Benefits and continuing the exit on the health insurance market. We believe all of the actions underway are critical to building a stronger company for the future.

Joining me for Assurant's conference call are Alan Colberg, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Chris Pagano, our Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. 
Yesterday afternoon, we issued a news release announcing our third quarter results. The release and corresponding financial supplement are available at assurant.com. 
Beginning last quarter, we revised the presentation of Assurant's results to reflect our focus on housing and lifestyle specialty offerings. As a reminder, results for Assurant Health runoff operations are included only in net income and are no longer reflected in net operating income. We will continue to report Assurant Employee Benefits under operating results until the sale of that business is closed, which we expect to occur by the end of the first quarter 2016. 
Today's call will contain other non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe are important in evaluating the company's performance. For more details on those measures, the most comparable GAAP measures and a reconciliation of the two, please refer to the news release and financial supplement posted at assurant.com. 
We'll begin our call this morning with brief remarks from Alan and Chris before moving to Q&A. 
Some of the statements made today may be forward-looking and actual results may differ materially from those projected in these statements. Additional information on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected can be found in yesterday's news release as well as in our SEC reports including our 2014 Form 10-K, first and second quarter and upcoming third quarter Form 10-Q. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Alan."

Our Housing and Lifestyle specialty protection businesses within Solutions and Specialty Property delivered solid results as we position the company for long-term profitable growth. During the third quart",963,"Thanks, Francesca, and good morning, everyone. 
Our Housing and Lifestyle specialty protection businesses within Solutions and Specialty Property delivered solid results as we position the company for long-term profitable growth. 
During the third quarter, we took significant actions to support our strategic realignment and transformation of Assurant. We reached a definitive agreement with Sun Life Financial for the purchase of Assurant Employee Benefits. The transaction will provide Assurant with $1 billion of net proceeds, including capital releases, to support profitable growth long term. Preparations for the divestiture and day one integration are progressing as planned. All required regulatory filings have been submitted, and we hope to receive approval to close the transaction by the end of the first quarter 2016. 
At Assurant Health, we completed the sale of our supplemental and self-funded businesses to National General on October 1 for $14 million. The challenges at Health increased during the quarter with higher-than-expected frequency and severity of claims, which will require capital infusions in the fourth quarter. While this development is disappointing, the wind-down process is on track. We still expect to substantially exit the health insurance market next year and release the remaining capital supporting the business. The sale of Benefits and wind-down of our Health operations support our strategic focus on specialty housing and lifestyle markets. We see many opportunities ahead to deliver attractive returns while providing Assurant with greater flexibility to redeploy capital for the benefit of shareholders. 
Our enhanced capital management plan announced in September reinforces our confidence in our ongoing businesses as well as our commitment to disciplined deployment over the long term. During the third quarter, we also established an organizational framework that will support our realignment and profitable growth. The leadership changes announced in September add senior-level expertise to our management committee in four critical functions: enterprise risk management; technology; strategy and business development; and communication and marketing. These moves set the framework so that we can be more agile, operate more cost efficiently and accelerate the transformation of Assurant. 
I'm especially pleased that Chris will take on the Chief Risk Officer role once the CFO successor is named. Our core risk management capability, which Chris developed and championed, provides a great foundation from which we will be able to expand our global enterprise risk practices. Our external searches for Chris' successor as CFO and for our Chief Technology Officer are moving ahead. We believe our management committee will benefit from additional outside perspective, especially given how essential technology and digital transformation are to Assurant's long-term strategy and success in Housing and Lifestyle. 
The promotions of Peter Walker and Francesca Luthi also reflect our deep bench of talent at Assurant and underscore the critical importance of strategy and communication and marketing to our ongoing success. These changes will allow our business lines to focus predominantly on critical client relationships, sales and exceptional customer service. 
Looking ahead, we remain optimistic about the opportunities at Assurant. During the third quarter, we continue to grow market share, add client partnerships and expand our suite of global offerings. 
At Assurant Solutions, we launched new mobile protection programs with Google and Samsung. While the programs will start small, these partnerships represent important steps in our global expansion of Connected Living. As a leading provider of vehicle protection services, we also see opportunities to further scale and strengthen our capabilities. To support our strategy, we acquired Coast To Coast, an auto claims administrator, serving more than 1,000 clients across North America. We will leverage their robust administrative platform to extend our market share. 
At Specialty Property, we continue to transform our lender-placed platform, which is core to our housing offerings. We are starting to achieve savings that will accelerate and more than offset future investments. 
In October, we exited the vehicle title business, which was a nongrowth area for us. This business represented less than $10 million of annualized fee income and was sold for $19 million in cash proceeds. This is yet another example of our active and disciplined portfolio management. 
Momentum in Property's targeted growth areas continued in the third quarter. Multi-family housing, again, will deliver double-digit growth. We anticipate mortgage solutions will contribute close to $300 million in fee income this year. This represents more than 20% organic growth from 2014. We are pleased with our progress in these areas and believe we are well positioned for the future. 
Now I'll offer some highlights from results year-to-date and then Chris will provide additional details. Annualized operating ROE, excluding AOCI, was 12.5%. As a reminder, this excludes results from Health runoff operations. Assurant's net earned premiums and fees for the 9 months of 2015 decreased modestly after adjusting for Health and the sale of American Reliable. This decline reflects the ongoing normalization of lender-placed. Fee income increased 27% as we broadened our service offerings beyond traditional insurance. Cash flow remained strong, namely from Specialty Property and Solutions, as we ended the quarter with $520 million of holding company capital. 
For the remainder of this year and into 2016, we will focus on executing our strategy to build a stronger Assurant for the future. Next year, absent significant hurricane activity, we believe we can sustain results in our ongoing businesses by expanding share in our targeted areas as we manage the normalization of lender-placed and other runoff operations. 
We will continue to work to eliminate the expense overhang from Health and Employee Benefits. By establishing a more efficient organization model, we will maximize resources in 2016 and beyond. These actions will allow us to realize our aspirations of generating top quartile shareholder returns. We're optimistic about the future and encouraged by the pace of progress. 
And now I'll turn to Chris, who will review results for the quarter in more detail. Chris?"
4026111,312932186,884422,"Assurant Inc., Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2015",2015-10-28,"Earnings Calls","Assurant, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Alan. I'll start with Solutions, where results were in line with our expectations. Excluding a $4.5 million net tax benefit from our international operations, segment earnings totaled $48 million for the quarter. This is compared to $55 million",1163,"Thanks, Alan. 
I'll start with Solutions, where results were in line with our expectations. Excluding a $4.5 million net tax benefit from our international operations, segment earnings totaled $48 million for the quarter. This is compared to $55 million in the prior year period after adjusting for a $2.7 million asset impairment charge. The $7 million decline was driven by lower service contract volume at traditional retailers as consumers increasingly prefer e-commerce shopping. 
Earnings from mobile increased, despite the previously disclosed loss of a domestic tablet program. The improvement was driven by growth in covered devices and sustained client marketing activity. 
Revenues at Solutions were down slightly compared to last year. This was due to the tablet program loss, foreign exchange volatility and declines at retailers. The decrease was partially offset by more than 20% growth in the vehicle service contract business from higher production at new and existing clients. 
Fee income also increased 21%, driven by mobile programs, where we continue to expand our repair and logistics offerings. 
Looking ahead to 2016, we remain focused on driving sustainable, profitable growth. We believe our integrated Connected Living offerings, along with improved international results and expense discipline, will be key drivers as we absorb larger declines from retail clients and the runoff of our domestic credit operations. 
Now let's turn to Specialty Property, where results came in stronger than expected. Net operating income declined $17 million to $87 million. This was driven by ongoing lender-placed normalization and client contract changes noted in previous quarters. Overall results, however, benefited from lower catastrophe reinsurance costs, no hurricane activity and lower non-catastrophe losses. Lower frequency and severity trends contributed to the improved loss experience. We were also encouraged by the increasing contributions from multi-family housing and mortgage solutions. Net earned premiums and fees decreased 12% after adjusting for the sale of American Reliable. This was due to declines in lender-placed, including the previously disclosed loss of client business. The impact was greater in the third quarter as a higher volume of policies for this client were renewed and transferred to the new carrier. We expect the transition of these policies to be largely complete by year-end. Specialty Property fee income increased 21% year-over-year. This was primarily due to growth in our property preservation offerings as we added new clients and leveraged cross-selling opportunities. 
Turning to expenses. Our reported expense ratio increased 520 basis points year-over-year to around 52%. 1/3 of the increase was due to a greater proportion of fee-based business, with the balance primarily caused by lower lender-placed premiums. Excluding mortgage solutions, our insurance expense ratio increased 300 basis points to roughly 45%. We've made additional investments in our lender-placed platform and were able to generate net savings in the third quarter with more efficiency gains expected into 2016. These investments will help to keep our insurance expense ratio in the mid-40s longer term as we modify the infrastructure to align with the lender-placed declines. We are pleased with Specialty Property's results thus far this year. In 2016, our focus will be to grow by adding new clients and increasing penetration in mortgage solutions and multi-family housing, while executing our lender-placed transformation. 
Results in Employee Benefits were in line with expectations. Earnings totaled $10 million for the quarter, a slight decline from third quarter 2014, due to less favorable Dental and Disability results. Net earned premiums and fee income increased modestly as expected declines in employer-paid products were more than offset by strong Voluntary growth. Expansion of Voluntary continues to be driven by a diverse product offering and a robust benefits communication and administration platform, which we believe complements Sun Life's existing business. We are committed to ensuring a seamless transition for brokers, clients and employees as we prepare to close the sale by the end of the first quarter 2016. 
As we preannounced last week, Assurant Health runoff operations posted a net loss of $144 million for the third quarter. We experienced higher-than-expected frequency and severity of claims on 2015 ACA individual major medical policies. Third quarter results also included a strengthening of the premium deficiency reserves to account for higher estimated future losses and other direct expenses through 2017. We incurred $17 million after-tax in severance and other exit-related charges. In order to maintain adequate statutory surplus levels, we will infuse an estimated $200 million into Health in the fourth quarter of this year. As of January 1, 2016, our block of ACA individual major medical policies will terminate. We expect most claims related to these policies to be paid by the end of the second quarter. In the months ahead, we will continue to refine our estimates for the premium deficiency reserves based on actual loss experience, recoverables under the 2015 ACA risk mitigation programs and additional exit-related charges. At the same time, we are evaluating alternative options to limit the length and expenses associated with the wind-down period. As noted in the release, recoverables for 2015 policies under reinsurance and risk-adjuster programs totaled $371 million as of September 30, 2015. Consistent with prior quarters, we did not accrue any net recoverables for the risk corridors. The majority of reimbursements for 2015 recoverables are expected to be paid in the third quarter of 2016. We will continue to monitor for any updates to that timetable or changes in payment authorization. 
Moving to Corporate. We ended September with $270 million of deployable capital. During the third quarter, segment dividends totaled $188 million, reflecting solid profitability in our ongoing businesses and capital releases from lender placed. We made additional investments in our vehicle service contract capabilities and returned $47 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks. Additionally, in the first three weeks of October, we bought $74 million worth of stock. Year-to-date, we've repurchased 4.2 million shares, representing 6% of total shares outstanding. We continue to view the stock as attractively priced. Over the course of the next 18 months, we will deploy capital prudently through a combination of share buybacks, common stock dividends and investments in Housing and Lifestyle. As always, the timing and pace of our buyback programs take into account a variety of factors. We will continue to monitor claims development at Health and as needed, factor that into our decision making. The Corporate loss for the quarter increased to $27 million, primarily reflecting an expected reversal of tax benefits recorded in the first half of this year and $2.5 million of strategic repositioning costs. For the full year, the net operating loss for Corporate is expected to be around $65 million, excluding repositioning costs. 
Our focus for the remainder of 2015 is to position the company for profitable growth. We will do so while successfully managing the upcoming sale of Employee Benefits and continuing the exit of the health insurance market. We believe all of the actions underway are critical to building a stronger company for the future. 
And with that, operator, please open the call for questions."

We look forward to discussing our third quarter 2015 results with you today. 
Joining me for Assurant's conference call are Alan Colberg, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Chris Pagano, our Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. 
Yesterday afternoon, we issued a news release announcing our third quarter results. The release and corresponding financial supplement are available at assurant.com. 
Beginning last quarter, we revised the presentation of Assurant's results to reflect our focus on housing and lifestyle specialty offerings. As a reminder, results for Assurant Health runoff operations are included only in net income and are no longer reflected in net operating income. We will continue to report Assurant Employee Benefits under operating results until the sale of that business is closed, which we expect to occur by the end of the first quarter 2016. 
Today's call will contain other non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe are important in evaluating the company's performance. For more details on those measures, the most comparable GAAP measures and a reconciliation of the two, please refer to the news release and financial supplement posted at assurant.com. 
We'll begin our call this morning with brief remarks from Alan and Chris before moving to Q&A. 
Some of the statements made today may be forward-looking and actual results may differ materially from those projected in these statements. Additional information on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected can be found in yesterday's news release as well as in our SEC reports including our 2014 Form 10-K, first and second quarter and upcoming third quarter Form 10-Q. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Alan."

Our Housing and Lifestyle specialty protection businesses within Solutions and Specialty Property delivered solid results as we position the company for long-term profitable growth. During the third quart",963,"Thanks, Francesca, and good morning, everyone. 
Our Housing and Lifestyle specialty protection businesses within Solutions and Specialty Property delivered solid results as we position the company for long-term profitable growth. 
During the third quarter, we took significant actions to support our strategic realignment and transformation of Assurant. We reached a definitive agreement with Sun Life Financial for the purchase of Assurant Employee Benefits. The transaction will provide Assurant with $1 billion of net proceeds, including capital releases, to support profitable growth long term. Preparations for the divestiture and day one integration are progressing as planned. All required regulatory filings have been submitted, and we hope to receive approval to close the transaction by the end of the first quarter 2016. 
At Assurant Health, we completed the sale of our supplemental and self-funded businesses to National General on October 1 for $14 million. The challenges at Health increased during the quarter with higher-than-expected frequency and severity of claims, which will require capital infusions in the fourth quarter. While this development is disappointing, the wind-down process is on track. We still expect to substantially exit the health insurance market next year and release the remaining capital supporting the business. The sale of Benefits and wind-down of our Health operations support our strategic focus on specialty housing and lifestyle markets. We see many opportunities ahead to deliver attractive returns while providing Assurant with greater flexibility to redeploy capital for the benefit of shareholders. 
Our enhanced capital management plan announced in September reinforces our confidence in our ongoing businesses as well as our commitment to disciplined deployment over the long term. During the third quarter, we also established an organizational framework that will support our realignment and profitable growth. The leadership changes announced in September add senior-level expertise to our management committee in 4 critical functions: enterprise risk management; technology; strategy and business development; and communication and marketing. These moves set the framework so that we can be more agile, operate more cost efficiently and accelerate the transformation of Assurant. 
I'm especially pleased that Chris will take on the Chief Risk Officer role once the CFO successor is named. Our core risk management capability, which Chris developed and championed, provides a great foundation from which we will be able to expand our global enterprise risk practices. Our external searches for Chris' successor as CFO and for our Chief Technology Officer are moving ahead. We believe our management committee will benefit from additional outside perspective, especially given how essential technology and digital transformation are to Assurant's long-term strategy and success in Housing and Lifestyle. 
The promotions of Peter Walker and Francesca Luthi also reflect our deep bench of talent at Assurant and underscore the critical importance of strategy and communication and marketing to our ongoing success. These changes will allow our business lines to focus predominantly on critical client relationships, sales and exceptional customer service. 
Looking ahead, we remain optimistic about the opportunities at Assurant. During the third quarter, we continue to grow market share, add client partnerships and expand our suite of global offerings. 
At Assurant Solutions, we launched new mobile protection programs with Google and Samsung. While the programs will start small, these partnerships represent important steps in our global expansion of Connected Living. As a leading provider of vehicle protection services, we also see opportunities to further scale and strengthen our capabilities. To support our strategy, we acquired Coast To Coast, an auto claims administrator, serving more than 1,000 clients across North America. We will leverage their robust administrative platform to extend our market share. 
At Specialty Property, we continue to transform our lender-placed platform, which is core to our housing offerings. We are starting to achieve savings that will accelerate and more than offset future investments. 
In October, we exited the vehicle title business, which was a nongrowth area for us. This business represented less than $10 million of annualized fee income and was sold for $19 million in cash proceeds. This is yet another example of our active and disciplined portfolio management. 
Momentum in Property's targeted growth areas continued in the third quarter. Multi-family housing, again, will deliver double-digit growth. We anticipate mortgage solutions will contribute close to $300 million in fee income this year. This represents more than 20% organic growth from 2014. We are pleased with our progress in these areas and believe we are well positioned for the future. 
Now I'll offer some highlights from results year-to-date and then Chris will provide additional details. Annualized operating ROE, excluding AOCI, was 12.5%. As a reminder, this excludes results from Health runoff operations. Assurant's net earned premiums and fees for the 9 months of 2015 decreased modestly after adjusting for Health and the sale of American Reliable. This decline reflects the ongoing normalization of lender-placed. Fee income increased 27% as we broadened our service offerings beyond traditional insurance. Cash flow remained strong, namely from Specialty Property and Solutions, as we ended the quarter with $520 million of holding company capital. 
For the remainder of this year and into 2016, we will focus on executing our strategy to build a stronger Assurant for the future. Next year, absent significant hurricane activity, we believe we can sustain results in our ongoing businesses by expanding share in our targeted areas as we manage the normalization of lender-placed and other runoff operations. 
We will continue to work to eliminate the expense overhang from Health and Employee Benefits. By establishing a more efficient organization model, we will maximize resources in 2016 and beyond. These actions will allow us to realize our aspirations of generating top quartile shareholder returns. We're optimistic about the future and encouraged by the pace of progress. 
And now I'll turn to Chris, who will review results for the quarter in more detail. Chris?"
4026111,312932186,884893,"Assurant Inc., Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2015",2015-10-28,"Earnings Calls","Assurant, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Alan. I'll start with Solutions, where results were in line with our expectations. Excluding a $4.5 million net tax benefit from our international operations, segment earnings totaled $48 million for the quarter. This is compared to $55 million",1163,"Thanks, Alan. 
I'll start with Solutions, where results were in line with our expectations. Excluding a $4.5 million net tax benefit from our international operations, segment earnings totaled $48 million for the quarter. This is compared to $55 million in the prior year period after adjusting for a $2.7 million asset impairment charge. The $7 million decline was driven by lower service contract volume at traditional retailers as consumers increasingly prefer e-commerce shopping. 
Earnings from mobile increased, despite the previously disclosed loss of a domestic tablet program. The improvement was driven by growth in covered devices and sustained client marketing activity. 
Revenues at Solutions were down slightly compared to last year. This was due to the tablet program loss, foreign exchange volatility and declines at retailers. The decrease was partially offset by more than 20% growth in the vehicle service contract business from higher production at new and existing clients. 
Fee income also increased 21%, driven by mobile programs, where we continue to expand our repair and logistics offerings. 
Looking ahead to 2016, we remain focused on driving sustainable, profitable growth. We believe our integrated Connected Living offerings, along with improved international results and expense discipline, will be key drivers as we absorb larger declines from retail clients and the runoff of our domestic credit operations. 
Now let's turn to Specialty Property, where results came in stronger than expected. Net operating income declined $17 million to $87 million. This was driven by ongoing lender-placed normalization and client contract changes noted in previous quarters. Overall results, however, benefited from lower catastrophe reinsurance costs, no hurricane activity and lower non-catastrophe losses. Lower frequency and severity trends contributed to the improved loss experience. We were also encouraged by the increasing contributions from multi-family housing and mortgage solutions. Net earned premiums and fees decreased 12% after adjusting for the sale of American Reliable. This was due to declines in lender-placed, including the previously disclosed loss of client business. The impact was greater in the third quarter as a higher volume of policies for this client were renewed and transferred to the new carrier. We expect the transition of these policies to be largely complete by year-end. Specialty Property fee income increased 21% year-over-year. This was primarily due to growth in our property preservation offerings as we added new clients and leveraged cross-selling opportunities. 
Turning to expenses. Our reported expense ratio increased 520 basis points year-over-year to around 52%. 1/3 of the increase was due to a greater proportion of fee-based business, with the balance primarily caused by lower lender-placed premiums. Excluding mortgage solutions, our insurance expense ratio increased 300 basis points to roughly 45%. We've made additional investments in our lender-placed platform and were able to generate net savings in the third quarter with more efficiency gains expected into 2016. These investments will help to keep our insurance expense ratio in the mid-40s longer term as we modify the infrastructure to align with the lender-placed declines. We are pleased with Specialty Property's results thus far this year. In 2016, our focus will be to grow by adding new clients and increasing penetration in mortgage solutions and multi-family housing, while executing our lender-placed transformation. 
Results in Employee Benefits were in line with expectations. Earnings totaled $10 million for the quarter, a slight decline from third quarter 2014, due to less favorable Dental and Disability results. Net earned premiums and fee income increased modestly as expected declines in employer-paid products were more than offset by strong Voluntary growth. Expansion of Voluntary continues to be driven by a diverse product offering and a robust benefits communication and administration platform, which we believe complements Sun Life's existing business. We are committed to ensuring a seamless transition for brokers, clients and employees as we prepare to close the sale by the end of the first quarter 2016. 
As we preannounced last week, Assurant Health runoff operations posted a net loss of $144 million for the third quarter. We experienced higher-than-expected frequency and severity of claims on 2015 ACA individual major medical policies. Third quarter results also included a strengthening of the premium deficiency reserves to account for higher estimated future losses and other direct expenses through 2017. We incurred $17 million after-tax in severance and other exit-related charges. In order to maintain adequate statutory surplus levels, we will infuse an estimated $200 million into Health in the fourth quarter of this year. As of January 1, 2016, our block of ACA individual major medical policies will terminate. We expect most claims related to these policies to be paid by the end of the second quarter. In the months ahead, we will continue to refine our estimates for the premium deficiency reserves based on actual loss experience, recoverables under the 2015 ACA risk mitigation programs and additional exit-related charges. At the same time, we are evaluating alternative options to limit the length and expenses associated with the wind-down period. As noted in the release, recoverables for 2015 policies under reinsurance and risk-adjuster programs totaled $371 million as of September 30, 2015. Consistent with prior quarters, we did not accrue any net recoverables for the risk corridors. The majority of reimbursements for 2015 recoverables are expected to be paid in the third quarter of 2016. We will continue to monitor for any updates to that timetable or changes in payment authorization. 
Moving to Corporate. We ended September with $270 million of deployable capital. During the third quarter, segment dividends totaled $188 million, reflecting solid profitability in our ongoing businesses and capital releases from lender placed. We made additional investments in our vehicle service contract capabilities and returned $47 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks. Additionally, in the first 3 weeks of October, we bought $74 million worth of stock. Year-to-date, we've repurchased 4.2 million shares, representing 6% of total shares outstanding. We continue to view the stock as attractively priced. Over the course of the next 18 months, we will deploy capital prudently through a combination of share buybacks, common stock dividends and investments in Housing and Lifestyle. As always, the timing and pace of our buyback programs take into account a variety of factors. We will continue to monitor claims development at Health and as needed, factor that into our decision making. The Corporate loss for the quarter increased to $27 million, primarily reflecting an expected reversal of tax benefits recorded in the first half of this year and $2.5 million of strategic repositioning costs. For the full year, the net operating loss for Corporate is expected to be around $65 million, excluding repositioning costs. 
Our focus for the remainder of 2015 is to position the company for profitable growth. We will do so while successfully managing the upcoming sale of Employee Benefits and continuing the exit of the health insurance market. We believe all of the actions underway are critical to building a stronger company for the future. 
And with that, operator, please open the call for questions."

But can you give us a sense, directionally at least, thinking about the Corporate operating loss of $65 million, give or take, for 2015, ex some of the sale-related costs, how should we think about that trending? Because I assume you'll have to absorb some overhead that was formerly allocated to the Benefits and the Health business. But I'd also, I guess, on the other side, assume that you'd be doing some cutting."

So maybe let me answer that by giving you a little bit of a sense of our broader 2016 priorities because we're very positive and bullish on how this company is evolving. First thing we're really focused on as we look to next year is completing the strategic repositioning. That's completing the sale of AEB, which we expect to happen in the first quarter, completing the substantial wind-down and exit of Health and really continuing to expand and grow our positions in Housing and Lifestyle where we're very well positioned for taking market share and growing with growing markets. We are working hard to eliminate the overhang from Health and Employee Benefits, some of the organizational changes that we announced last month and that allow us to really create a more agile, more efficient organization model. When you put all that together, that's how we're comfortable of saying we think we can sustain results absent a cat next year in our ongoing businesses, well absorbing the continuing normalization of lender-placed and some of the other runoffs in the retail business."

We've got better visibility around operating earnings and the availability of those earnings as segment dividends. We've got the issue with Health and the infusion that it's going to require. And then, again, we look out --  in the first quarter, there's going to be $1 billion of proceeds and release of capital from the sale of Benefits, future operating earnings and then the return of capital from Health as we run the business off in -- and exit by the end of 2016.
