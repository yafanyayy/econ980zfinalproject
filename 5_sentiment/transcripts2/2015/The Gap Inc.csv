Let me start with some highlights for the year then, I'll go through Q4 results before turning to the outlook for 2015. For the full year, EPS grew about 10%, excluding the estimated year-over-year impact fr",1379,"Thank you, Katrina. Good afternoon, everyone. Let me start with some highlights for the year then, I'll go through Q4 results before turning to the outlook for 2015. 
For the full year, EPS grew about 10%, excluding the estimated year-over-year impact from foreign exchange. On a reported basis, our earnings per share for the full year grew 5%. Our largest brand, Old Navy, delivered positive comps in each quarter and finished the year with a strong 11 comp in Q4.  We achieved our goal of leveraging expenses. At 25.6% of sales, our SG&A rate was the lowest since 2005.  We generated free cash flow of $1.4 billion and distributed about $1.6 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.
Moving to the fourth quarter and full year financial results. Regarding earnings, there's been quite a bit of focus on the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar and its impact to 2015 earnings, which I'll address, of course, in the outlook. But it's important to note that we've already absorbed a great deal of foreign exchange headwind in 2014. Full year net earnings were $1.26 billion, and earnings per share were $2.87. This includes about a $0.14 unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. The FX impact was most pronounced in the fourth quarter. Excluding the estimated year-over-year impact from foreign exchange, Q4 earnings per share grew about 20% versus last year.  On a reported basis, net income was $319 million, and earnings per share increased 10% to $0.75 per share.
Turning to sales. Sales for the fourth quarter were $4.7 billion and increased 5% on a constant currency basis. Comp sales were up 2%. For the full year, net sales were up 2% to $16.4 billion and up 3% on a constant currency basis, driven by Old Navy's strength. Comparable sales were flat for the year.
Moving to gross margin. Fourth quarter gross profit increased by $65 million to $1.7 billion and gross margin expanded by 40 basis points to 35.2%. Merchandise margins were up 60 basis points for the quarter, and rent and occupancy deleveraged 20 basis points. For the full year, gross profit was $6.3 billion, and gross margin was down 70 basis points to 38.3%.
At the beginning of 2014, we stated that foreign exchange would likely pressure our merchandise margins. For the year, merchandise margins were down 40 basis points, driven by this FX impact as well as disappointing performance for Gap brand. As anticipated, rent and occupancy FX deleveraged by 30 basis points.
Regarding SG&A. For the fourth quarter, total operating expenses were $1.1 billion, with marketing expenses at $178 million, slightly below last year. Total operating expenses for the year were $4.2 billion and leveraged 10 basis points despite moving $160 million of credit card income out of SG&A and into merchandise margin. Marketing expenses for the year were $639 million, about flat to last year.
Regarding stores and capital expenditures. We opened 116 new company-operated stores in 2014 net of closures. In line with our strategy, international store was focused primarily in Asia. In North America, store growth was focused on our outlet channel in Athleta. Not surprisingly, closures were focused on Gap specialty North America. Our square footage grew by 2.4%, in line with our guidance.  Store count and square footage by division are in our press release. 
Regarding balance sheet and cash flow. As we stated would be the case, we improved inventory levels throughout the year. Inventory dollars per store were down 5.5% at the end of the fourth quarter. This was better than our previous guidance, driven by foreign exchange favorability and stronger-than-expected sell-through at Old Navy.
We ended the year with about $1.5 billion in cash after having distributed about $1.6 billion to shareholders. Ending share count was 421 million shares.
And now I'd like to share our outlook for 2015. 
Regarding earnings per share. On a reported basis, we expect earnings per share to be the range of $2.75 to $2.80. Included in this guidance is an estimated unfavorable impact from foreign exchange at current spot rates of about $0.16, an unfavorable impact of about $0.13 due to the West Coast port situation, and an expectation for a slower turnaround at Gap brand. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, the port issues and last year's gain on sales, our underlying expected EPS growth rate for 2015 would be about 12 percentage points higher or about 9% EPS growth at its midpoint.
Now let me address the port issue. While we've been managing the slowdown at the ports for some time, it's the additional weekend closures in February and the resulting additional backlogs that are driving the expected negative impact to earnings. In simple terms, the first quarter is impacted by having fewer units available for sale. It's important to note that this is particularly impactful to Old Navy, given the importance of the Easter holiday to Old Navy's business. Additionally, the second quarter is impacted by late units arriving in Q2 and potentially being sold at lower margins, given that fall flows come in shortly thereafter.
Regarding our inventory guidance. Excluding the impact from the port situation, we would have expected inventory dollars per store to be slightly down at the end of the first quarter. Given the fluidity of the situation, we'll provide an update on inventory later in the quarter.
Moving on to the impact of foreign exchange to the year ahead. At current spot rates, we estimate that foreign exchange will negatively impact our reported EPS growth rate by about 6 percentage points. This equates to about $0.16 or over $100 million of pretax earnings. While comp is reported on a constant currency basis, the remainder of our reported performance is subject to currency fluctuations. As a reminder, our largest foreign subsidiaries are in Canada and Japan, with combined sales in these 2 countries of over $2 billion.  Both the Japanese yen and the Canadian dollar have depreciated by about 30% over the past 2 years. With continuing depreciation of these and other currencies against the dollar, our reported results have been and are expected to be negatively impacted.
There are 2 primary impact of foreign exchange: the first is translation, and the second impact is the economic impact to our merchandise margins. We hedge the majority of our inventory purchases for our foreign subsidiaries 12 to 18 months in advance. Effectively, this delays the impact of depreciating foreign currencies on most of our cost of goods. However, as the old hedge rates lap and new less favorable hedge rates come on, the cost of goods in local currencies will increase. In addition, unhedged inventory purchases will be subject to foreign exchange movements.
Moving to expenses and operating margins. We have a strong track record of managing expenses, and we intend to continue that. However, it's unlikely we will leverage expenses in 2015. As a reminder, we're lapping the $39 million gain on sale as well as absorbing the increase to our minimum hourly wage that we announced last year. Given the negative impact from foreign exchange, the port issues and last year's gain on sale, we expect operating margin to be down about 1 point to 2014 on a reported basis. However, excluding these 3 factors, we expect that operating margin on an underlying basis would modestly expand. 
Here are some other guidance metrics. We expect to add 115 net new stores, with our year-end store base in China growing to over 150 stores and Athleta store base growing to 120 total stores. Square footage is expected to increase about 2.5%. We expect capital expenditures to be about $800 million with the increased focus on omni-channel and supply chain capabilities. We expect depreciation and amortization to be about $525 million, and we expect our full year effective tax rate to be about 38%.
Finally, we remain very committed to our principle of returning excess cash to shareholders. Underscoring that commitment, we're pleased to have announced a new $1 billion share repurchase authorization and our intent to again increase the dividend to $0.92 per share.  As we enter 2015, we remain focused on using all of our levers to further drive value for our shareholders. Thank you, and now, I'll turn it over to Art."

It's really a pleasure to be here addressing all of you. before I go into anything concerning the business and looking forward, I would be remiss not to thank Glenn for everything that he has done for the company, his tireless effort over the last 8 years, what he brought the company in terms of vision, strategy, discipline and most importantly, results. And I have to thank him as well for everything he did as we worked shoulder to shoulder over the last few months during this transition time. We, as a team, feel that he was incredibly helpful to all of us in affecting a smooth transition and sharing his perspective on what we need to do going forward and then, allowing the team to get settled and to hit the ground running in 2015. So again, I need to thank him on behalf of myself and the team for everything that he has done.
So I'd been in the job now for officially about 3 weeks. I am very bullish on the future of this company. We have great brands with tremendous potential. I am extremely pleased with the team that is now in place and equally pleased with the consistent sense of urgency that every member of my team has in making the changes that we need to make to compete successfully and consistently. Product is critical for us. And consistent product season after season, appropriate to our brands, is a nonnegotiable. As I look forward, I first want to talk about where we are today.
Let me spend a moment and talk about the guidance that Sabrina gave to you. To be clear, I fully believe in the economic model that we have articulated and that we have been executing over the last several years. That said, there are 3 issues that are going to affect our performance in 2015:  the 2 are macro issues with foreign exchange and the port situation, and the third is the performance of Gap brand. 
I want to double click for a moment on Gap. None of us are satisfied with the performance that we're seeing at Gap. I made a made a very quick change the senior leadership there. I did this because we were not seeing the performance improvement in the business that we needed to see. And specifically, I was not seeing the women's product back on track the way it needed to be for the brand to perform to its potential. 
Jeff and I are together focused on what we need to do in order to get the brand back on track, and it starts with riding the women's business. There's an aesthetic issue, which we're working on today with urgency. We're pleased to see that the denim business seems to be showing signs of life. But Gap as a brand, is much more than denim, and we need to have the women's business hitting on all cylinders in order for the business to deliver the performance that we expect. 
2015 is largely really through fall right now. Jeff and the team are focused on making part of changes that they can make, but those would be modest and incremental until we late in the year. Holiday is under center significant scrutiny now. I have looked at it. Jeff has looked at it. The team is focused on it to make as much improvement as we can before we buy the product. 
Let me quickly refresh your memory.  In early 2011, I sat in the same seat that Jeff is sitting in right now at Gap brand. I know from experience, and I'm sharing this with Jeff, that we can get the brand back on track quickly with a relentless focus on product. When Jeff got into his role, he moved quickly to make some changes on his team. The obvious hole has been the leader of design. And I'm very pleased to announce today that Jeff has hired Wendy Goldman, who will be rejoining our company in a new role as head of design and product development for the brand. I gotten to know Wendy over the course of last few months, and I feel very confident that she will be a strong creative leader and a significant addition to the team. She knows our company from 8 years here early in her career. And more importantly, she brings her experience from a very successful 11-year run at Limited Brands.  Again, 2015 will be a year of hard work and getting the brand on track. But I'm very pleased that we have the team largely in place will be doing that work.
Now that said, I am bullish on where we are overall as a company. The consistency of performance that we've seen with Old Navy really premised on the back of the season after season good product that is on trend and on brand, gives me a great deal of confidence. And it's a product of work that Stefan and the team have done around how they think about trend, how they build the assortment and how they line up all elements of the business to express the brand consistently through marketing, product and in stores. 
I'm very happy with what I've seen the team at Banana Republic. has excellent taste. She understands the brand and she has been one of our most consistent operators into the company, having worked directly with me in a number of roles.  And I both expect more from the brand. 
April is Marissa's first product flow. We saw fall presented last week at Fashion Week to a very good perception and reaction. And so we are committed to continuing to move Banana forward. The proof is always in the product that we're putting in the stores, but we're excited about what we see and have high expectations.
Let me spend just a moment then on Athleta. We're excited about what we're seeing there. And we're excited about the continued growth, both in the active space and the the space where active meets her Ready to Wear wardrobe. You also have seen, given how excited we are, that we continue to push on fit inside of Gap and on the Active expression inside of Old Navy as well. And so this is a space that, not only through Athleta but as a company, we are very committed to. 
Over the course of 2014, we made significant progress in the omni-channel space, and we're very excited about the customer response there so far. And we're pushing forward to roll out all of the capabilities across our brands in North America as quickly as possible.
On top of omni-channel, I just want to spend a moment really more broadly on experience. And that you've been pulling some of the changes that we have made, you would have noted that we brought together the traditional marketing activities and our digital business inside both Gap and Banana Republic. Why am I excited about that? I'm excited about that because today, the digital expression of our brand is the primary way that our customers engage our brands. And if you look at our traffic, the bulk of our traffic is coming into our digital properties. And I'm convinced that going forward, we will win or lose at our digital line. Historically, our websites needed to be and have been tremendously effective and efficient channels that our customer bought through. We need to continue to be that going forward, but our digital expression of the brand needs to be more than that. It needs to be aspirational, holistic, emotional in a way that few people have expressed their brand digitally. And we are focused on doing that across all of our businesses.
I want to spend a minute on global growth. Glenn and I worked shoulder to shoulder to meet the strategy of growth, and we've have been put pursuing it consistently over the last several years. It's my intent to continue to pursue growth and obviously through all of our brands, and most importantly, through Old Navy's expansion into China and Japan. We continue to open stores in China with the plan for this year being about 40 stores, which is consistent with our store opening over the last year or so as well.
Let me close just by coming back a little bit to where I started. I am very excited to be sitting in this role. I am very optimistic about the prospects that this company has in front of it. I'm also very honest and objective and have a great deal of urgency about some of the work that we need to do to get parts of the business back on track. I can give you my strong assurance that I and my team are resolutely committed to doing what does what's necessary in order to make that happen as quickly as possible. Thank you. Katrina, I will pass it back to you."

And we'll talk more about those obviously the next several months. I would remind everybody that I think I'm on day 26 or something like that, so still bringing the team together. That all said, and I've said this before when we spoke a quarter ago, I don't want to communicate at all that there's going to be big shift in our priorities. Product is absolutely critical to us. And underneath product as a priority, our responsive supply chain capabilities, our seamless inventory capabilities, fabric platforming, obviously design and design talent all supercritical. And when I am talking products inside and outside the company, it's on brand, on trend product, but consistently. And that consistency issue is one of the things that I'm really focused on. And then, the second issue is really for me, it's experience. And under experience, it's the omni-channel, the physical and the digital experience and how all of that comes together. So it's really about, in my words, powering up our focus on those as much as anything rather than deviating from them. And that, of course, global growth which I referenced and I just want to come back to, which is we're committed to continuing build out our global structure and to the consistent product into -- appropriate to our brands and on trend season after season, not a lot of deviation on those priorities."

So Reserve in Store, shipping from store, Find in Store. And now we are testing mobile POS, which we talked about before. Knowing now how the customers are reacting to those, learning -- having learned a lot about how it comes together to form a customer value proposition and now starting to integrate them into a more holistic offer, that's really the focus, and it's going to be our focus over 2015. We're testing a mobile POS right now, which is really, as we've been talking about, as we push our POS to really a cloud-based POS, it brings all of our web services in. We've been testing that on a small device in stores. And both the sales associates and the customers have been reacting incredibly positively to that. And so it starts to open up a number of things for us, different ways of interacting with our customers, giving the sales associate those tools, different ways of engaging with those customers in the fitting room where we can actually get a transaction then. Of course, pivot back to what that mean to the real estate that we currently have committed, the church that we built for Easter Sunday, if you will, with all the registers in the front of the store. And can we start thinking about putting some of that real estate to more efficient use than underutilized registers for much of the year. so those are all things that we're absolutely focused on. It's well past proof of concept both in terms of technology as well as how customers engage. And you'll see us continue to push those out over the course of this year."

With regard to average unit cost, we talked about the fact that spring didn't really have a lot of change. Because when we reached spring, there wasn't a lot of difference in the cotton prices. We started to see some benefit in summer and certainly, in the back half. So that's all good news. Directionally though, when you do the math on what component cotton is to our total AUC, and I'll just do something high level and illustrate it for you. If you have a 20% improvement in cotton, it creates roughly about a 2% improvement in AUC. And that's before we make any mix decisions or any other changes to our assortment. So it's super helpful. It's a positive thing. But it's not an enormous lever even into the back half, again, but it's helpful. With regard to pricing, I would say given the promotional environment we've been living in, there's not really a great case, in my view, for changing pricing and giving back to the customer. Of course, what we'll be looking to do is trying to return to healthier margins in 2015. So that could be a lever, some of it offset by foreign exchange. But the cotton tailwind could be a lever, and then, we'll be managing our promotional cadence to try and support healthier margins in 2015."

So let me step back for a second and talk about that -- about the journey that, that Athleta is on. Obviously, it started as a catalog and then an online retailer. We only opened stores a few years ago. And as we've opened these stores, the #1 store in the market and then, the follow-on stores in that market, we're really learning a lot about kind of a building a retailer from digital world, if you will, into the physical world and how the 2 channels have interact with each other. What we've learned is very positive, which is that we can build stores and we can continue to get the growth out of the direct channel at the same time, which is obviously great growth, accretive growth and really attractive from that standpoint without having to put physical assets in the ground. And so I have no modification in my mind in any way, shape or form about the growth rate and the growth prospects of the business. Just as we're learning about how we get back between the 2 different channels, we're trying to be really responsible obviously and optimize the overall returns in the business by the differential growth rate of the 2 channels. So if you're or anyone is interpreting this as somehow, we're losing a little bit of our optimism for the business, that's absolutely the wrong interpretation."

And so even now with Jeff coming in, Kimberly, we've -- we're actually taking a pause and we will be shortening our part of calendar, number one, at Gap. And then, number two, pushing much more aggressively at some of those things that, in season or close to being in season, allow us to be very responsive like aggressive push on fabric platforming and those kinds of things. And so I have -- why I'm bullish on this, I see this working in our other businesses. I wish Gap has pushed farther forward because it would give us the ability to be a little bit more responsive right now. They're not as far as they will be very quickly. And then, the other issue is if you look at it, let's -- let's rewind from fall. Fall is sometime probably in early August. So it's actually not that far away right now if you consider the production cycle, notion time, et cetera, et cetera. so I don't think it's contradictory at all, and we're definitely pushing forward on this. I wish Gap was in a different place, but there is a laggard that is implementing this, and that's something we're correcting right now."

And the question was asked was very similar to that when I was in Jeff's seat. And as of February 2012 when we really had on brand and appropriate product that was really aligned with trend of the season, that was the Be Bright marketing campaign that we brought it to market with. And then, we saw very, very good numbers come out of the brand, almost instantaneously with getting the product back on track. And so I'll be honest with you right now, Susan. I'm really much more focused on reestablishing the direction of the women's business and getting product in our stores that reflects with our customers expect, which is product that is feminine, product that has an optimism associated with it, obviously, casual product with an American aesthetic. And I know there is upside associated with doing that. And then, we do that, and that gives us the time to then look at any other issues. I would also just refresh your memory that when I was sitting on that seat, we closed a couple of hundred stores and had made very good progress there from the standpoint of really rationalizing the fleet to be the kind of real estate that we felt a brand like Gap should be exposed in. And so right now, I want to stay focused with Jeff and the team that he's put together on getting the product aesthetic right. The other thing I'll say here again is that and as we talk about the product aesthetic, we have a very good men's business. The kids and baby business remains healthy for us, and the fit and Gap Body business is a good business also. And so for me, largely, this is women's business right now and it's what our focus is on."

Right now, as I mentioned, we're seeing a little bit of life in denim. And the revolution denim has gotten a pretty good reception from customers. They're really finding that they like the whole notion of it, the fit, the fabric,, et cetera. Obviously, denim has been -- I characterize it as customer has taken a bit of a pause in denim over the course of the last several quarters. And I would say as much in our business but also just been in New York doing Fashion Week and see what was being talked about, what was in the showrooms, what the news was in denim, I'm not going to call a turn in the denim business. But I'm feeling, for the most part, I'm feeling now differently than I felt for a while, which is that she's probably coming back to denim in a way that we haven't seen her to be for several quarters. So encouraged there, but it's early days. Tops is tough right now, and it's wovens and knits. It's a fit issue, it's a fit intent issue. It's aesthetic issue. And so we're very much focused on that and very much focused on fixing as quickly as possible. And so if I had to go to one category, I would definitely say it's in the tops business. And obviously both knits and woven for Gap brand are very material categories, and the product is just not -- she's just not responding to the product there right now at all. So let me just stop there. I mean, that's that we need to do. On the issue of retention of consistency and creativity, I actually think that's a false dichotomy, to tell you the truth. Now let me just give you an example. Fit, so fit in bottoms. Fit, for us, which is a huge issue with respect to a women's loyalty towards her pants. We should be the experts at that. We have been the experts at it. And shame on us when we lose consistency on fit because she then she can't count us. That also, as you might imagine, has an impact on the digital business. Because if she counts on the fit and fit has changed, then we obviously have an issue with returns right now. And so fit consistency is a science. It's a discipline. In no way does it impede what we need in terms of great creativity of our design teams. And so I guess I've looked at other creative businesses during my career. And I've always found that a lot of them being a trade-off between consistency and discipline and creativity on the other side. Consistency and discipline enables creativity. And frankly, it takes a lot of the work away from what the team -- has  to do at the end of the day. So I'm -- and this is really reacting from our design teams as well as they want to win and they want to have a foundation that they can build on every season."

And I would challenge you to find that we are consistently expressing casual American optimism to the product expression that we have in our stores. And so these are the words that we're using. And now what does that mean tangibly? So in summer, what you will see there is a more -- there was a very neutral summer that we had last year. You will see more color, brand-appropriate color coming back into the business by the time we get to summer. So the that change has been made. Print and pattern obviously as we get into late spring and summer, not so much in spring, you'll see a bit more of that when we get to summer as well. And then, as we move into fall, there a little bit more. of the work that's going on right now on holiday is holiday, for Gap, is really time for very optimistic expression of the brand. It's a time when a lot of the industry tends to go to a very dark and neutral place. We have done very good business over many years. It's a more optimistic expression of the brand during that time thing. It doesn't mean going nuts crazy , going nuts on or some of the other sort of cliché trends perhaps that you see during holiday. But we have an opportunity to express the brand in a very optimistic and colorful way there , but obviously in feminine way, which is the other piece that is from the women's business. and so I'm not going to call a turn on the business right now. I'm being very honest with you about the work that's going on and when you start to see some change. And I'm not promising anything later in the year.

I'd rather go to a slightly different place, which is to talk about this change that we've made in the structure of digital and marketing. And it's something that I did very intentionally. And I did it very intentionally in the 2 brands that we did it in under 2 leaders who I know very well, and I think a very very capable leaders. Now, you're going to know what does that mean at the end of the day. And one -- here, let me just give you a couple of things that probably continue to talk about. Our brands are being engaged digitally, much more so than through traditional marketing vehicles. And the good news about digital engagement is we have a have a much better line of sight to the return of our spend in digital engagement versus some of the traditional marketing vehicles like a billboard or a shelter or those kinds of things. so part of what I'm trying to do about bringing those 2 things together is really get our arms holistically around how the customer is engaging our brand and then, start managing that to the highest returns in our overall spend. And I'm not going to say that we're going to spend less on marketing. But I am, honestly, I'm pretty confident that we're going to be able to see a path towards evolving to higher returns on the marketing spend that we have. That we have across a number of different vehicles. The second thing, which I've highlighted but I want to highlight again, is that we have had the luxury of living with our digital expression of our brands, our website, as being very efficient transactional channels. Today to me, it becomes an end, which is those digital properties also have to carry the aspiration and emotion of the brand as well as being very efficient channels. And by bringing those 2 things together, we really now have leaders in an organization that's going to be thinking digitally first in everything they do. And it starts with very simple things, which is if you're shooting marketing assets for traditional marketing vehicles, oftentimes those assets don't manifest themselves in the best way possible for digital use. And we just need to be to a digital-first mindset. We'll get -- I do believe we'll get some efficiency out of doing that. I'm much more excited about the effectiveness of overall spend that we're going to see."

And that's what gets me probably more excited about anything about the fact that now that we've had a little bit of a run there with consistent product, which the customer has consistently responded to. I would also really point you to the expression of the brand in our marketing. I follow them -- probably the best place that I go to honestly to see it is on Instagram. I follow Old Navy and a number of our other brands as well as a number of other brands. And there are honestly times when I look at Old Navy's inventory on Instagram, and it's hard for me to distinguish between a premium or premium contemporary brand in terms of the aspiration of the fashion that we're presenting. And so Stefan uses the word aspirational. I think it's a great expression that you see. When you see those brands juxtaposed against each other and how Old Navy is really communicating the fact that it's got current trend that is right where she needs to be right now. And clearly, that's what she and overall family is responding to. Still bullish obviously for Old Navy, so that's in the domestic business. Given and consistency, there's a long runway in front of us there in terms of opportunity. Very bullish on the international business and expansion that we have in both Japan and in China. And then, the couple of places we're highlighting inside the assortment. I touched on the fact that Old Navy has a family-wide active expression. We've had tremendous customer reaction to that. She's really engaged. And she is engaged on behalf of the family, kids, the men's business and her business, the Active expression. And that's a place where -- if that's a trend, that's a trend that has a long runway in front of it. And so we're excited to be able to build up that business. And it's a business that is essentially purely incremental for us inside of Old Navy. There real estate to house the business without having to trade off other key categories. So it's a very nice incremental business. it allows us to build a business, productivity the real estate and give her another reason to go into the store."

And as a result, should -- as we're thinking about our 2015 model, I know you haven't given any specific guidance. As you're looking at out years, should we also be thinking about a currency headwind to factor in? And then, sort of as part of that question, I mean, this isn't your first moment dealing with currency. Do you guys have an approach, a plan of attack on how to defend margins, whether it's through pricing or cost savings? Have you considered, maybe in Europe, diversifying your sourcing capability to include some local manufacturing? Or any other initiatives you're thinking to protect margins from this?"

So they worsened again, but they didn't worsen to the degree that they did in -- coming out of 2013 to 2014. But that is all embedded. With regard to how we look at defending margin rate, I would say we look country by country certainly. We don't feel like in a lot of our countries, given the competitive landscape and the orientation toward value of the customer, that there is a lot of room to just full sale increase prices given the increase in AUC driven by the stronger dollar. What we look at more is how do we affect and address the issue through our promotional cadence through our sales and markdowns. That's what we've been trying to do overall for the last 1.5 years as we've been facing the pressure already. And we'll continue to look at sourcing mechanisms as well as we move forward since we'll probably be in a dollar-strong environment for a little while there."

And that is exactly what we saw back in 2012 and in 2013 when we have product, well priced for the brand that was on trend in our stores. And so I'm a little less inclined to embrace sort of the 2-dimensional cutout of the target customer rather than great product that's right for the brand. And for the aesthetics filters of the brand will power a good business. And so -- and then, as to the brands competing with each other, basic perspective on that is get the best product you can to your brand filters.

Let me start with some highlights for the year, and then I'll go through Q4 results before turning to the outlook for 2015. 
For the full year, EPS grew about 10%, excluding the estimated year-over-year impact from foreign exchange. On a reported basis, our earnings per share for the full year grew 5%. Our largest brand, Old Navy, delivered positive comps in each quarter and finished the year with a strong 11 comp in Q4. We achieved our goal of leveraging expenses. At 25.6% of sales, our SG&A rate was the lowest since 2005. We generated free cash flow of $1.4 billion and distributed about $1.6 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.
Moving to the fourth quarter and full year financial results. Regarding earnings, there's been quite a bit of focus on the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar and its impact to 2015 earnings, which I'll address, of course, in the outlook. But it's important to note that we've already absorbed a great deal of foreign exchange headwind in 2014. Full year net earnings were $1.26 billion, and earnings per share were $2.87. This includes about a $0.14 unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. The FX impact was most pronounced in the fourth quarter. Excluding the estimated year-over-year impact from foreign exchange, Q4 earnings per share grew about 20% versus last year. On a reported basis, net income was $319 million, and earnings per share increased 10% to $0.75 per share.
Turning to sales. Sales for the fourth quarter were $4.7 billion and increased 5% on a constant currency basis. Comp sales were up 2%. For the full year, net sales were up 2% to $16.4 billion and up 3% on a constant currency basis, driven by Old Navy's strength. Comparable sales were flat for the year.
Moving to gross margin. Fourth quarter gross profit increased by $65 million to $1.7 billion, and gross margin expanded by 40 basis points to 35.2%. Merchandise margins were up 60 basis points for the quarter, and rent and occupancy deleveraged 20 basis points. For the full year, gross profit was $6.3 billion, and gross margin was down 70 basis points to 38.3%.
At the beginning of 2014, we stated that foreign exchange would likely pressure our merchandise margins. For the year, merchandise margins were down 40 basis points, driven by this FX impact as well as disappointing performance at Gap brand. As anticipated, rent and occupancy deleveraged by 30 basis points.
Regarding SG&A. For the fourth quarter, total operating expenses were $1.1 billion, with marketing expenses at $178 million, slightly below last year. Total operating expenses for the year were $4.2 billion and leveraged 10 basis points despite moving $160 million of credit card income out of SG&A and into merchandise margin. Marketing expenses for the year were $639 million, about flat to last year.
Regarding stores and capital expenditures. We opened 116 new company-operated stores in 2014 net of closures. In line with our strategy, international store growth was focused primarily in Asia. In North America, store growth was focused on our outlet channel in Athleta. Not surprisingly, closures were focused on Gap specialty North America. Our square footage grew by 2.4%, in line with our guidance. Store count and square footage by division are in our press release. 
Regarding the balance sheet and cash flow. As we stated would be the case, we improved inventory levels throughout the year. Inventory dollars per store were down 5.5% at the end of the fourth quarter. This was better than our previous guidance, driven by foreign exchange favorability and stronger-than-expected sell-through at Old Navy. We ended the year with about $1.5 billion in cash after having distributed about $1.6 billion to shareholders. Ending share count was 421 million shares.
And now I'd like to share our outlook for 2015. Regarding earnings per share. On a reported basis, we expect earnings per share to be in the range of $2.75 to $2.80. Included in this guidance is an estimated unfavorable impact from foreign exchange at current spot rates of about $0.16, an unfavorable impact of about $0.13 due to the West Coast port situation and an expectation for a slower turnaround at Gap brand. Excluding the impacts of foreign exchange, the port issues and last year's gain on sale, our underlying expected EPS growth rate for 2015 would be about 12 percentage points higher or about 9% EPS growth at its midpoint.
Now let me address the port issue. While we've been managing the slowdown at the ports for some time, it's the additional weekend closures in February and the resulting additional backlogs that are driving the expected negative impact to earnings. In simple terms, the first quarter is impacted by having fewer units available for sale. It's important to note that this is particularly impactful to Old Navy, given the importance of the Easter holiday to Old Navy's business. Additionally, the second quarter is impacted by late units arriving in Q2 and potentially being sold at lower margins, given that fall flows come in shortly thereafter.
Regarding our inventory guidance. Excluding the impact from the port situation, we would have expected inventory dollars per store to be slightly down at the end of the first quarter. Given the fluidity of the situation, we'll provide an update on inventory later in the quarter.
Moving on to the impact of foreign exchange to the year ahead. At current spot rates, we estimate that foreign exchange will negatively impact our reported EPS growth rate by about 6 percentage points. This equates to about $0.16 or over $100 million of pretax earnings. While comp is reported on a constant currency basis, the remainder of our reported performance is subject to currency fluctuations. As a reminder, our largest foreign subsidiaries are in Canada and Japan, with combined sales in these 2 countries of over $2 billion. Both the Japanese yen and the Canadian dollar have depreciated by about 30% over the past 2 years. With the continuing depreciation of these and other currencies against the dollar, our reported results have been and are expected to be negatively impacted.
There are 2 primary impacts of foreign exchange: the first is translation and the second impact is the economic impact to our merchandise margins. We hedge the majority of our inventory purchases for our foreign subsidiaries 12 to 18 months in advance. Effectively, this delays the impact of depreciating foreign currencies on most of our cost of goods. However, as the old hedge rates lapse and new less favorable hedge rates come on, the cost of goods in local currencies will increase. In addition, unhedged inventory purchases will be subject to foreign exchange movements.
Moving to expenses and operating margins. We have a strong track record of managing expenses, and we intend to continue that. However, it's unlikely we'll leverage expenses in 2015. As a reminder, we're lapping the $39 million gain on sale as well as absorbing the increase to our minimum hourly wage that we announced last year. Given the negative impact from foreign exchange, the port issues and last year's gain on sale, we expect operating margin to be down about 1 point to 2014 on a reported basis. However, excluding these 3 factors, we expect that operating margin on an underlying basis would modestly expand. 
Here are some other guidance metrics. We expect to add 115 net new stores, with our year-end store base in China growing to over 150 stores and Athleta store base growing to 120 total stores. Square footage is expected to increase about 2.5%. We expect capital expenditures to be about $800 million, with the increased focus on omni-channel and supply chain capabilities. We expect depreciation and amortization to be about $525 million, and we expect our full year effective tax rate to be about 38%.
Finally, we remain very committed to our principle of returning excess cash to shareholders. Underscoring that commitment, we're pleased to have announced a new $1 billion share repurchase authorization and our intent to again increase the dividend to $0.92 per share. As we entered 2015, we remain focused on using all of our levers to further drive value for our shareholders. 
Thank you. And now I'll turn it over to Art."

It's really a pleasure to be here addressing all of you. And before I go into anything concerning the business and looking forward, I would be remiss not to thank Glenn for everything that he has done for the company, his tireless effort over the last 8 years, what he brought the company in terms of vision, strategy, discipline and, most importantly, results. And I have to thank him as well for everything he did as we worked shoulder to shoulder over the last few months during this transition time. We, as a team, feel that he was incredibly helpful to all of us in effecting a smooth transition, in sharing his perspective on what we need to do going forward and then allowing the team to get settled in to hit the ground running in 2015. So again, I need to thank him, on behalf of myself and the team, for everything that he has done.
So I'd been in the job now for officially about 3 weeks. I am very bullish on the future of this company. We have great brands with tremendous potential. I am extremely pleased with the team that is now in place and equally pleased with the consistent sense of urgency that every member of my team has in making the changes that we need to make to compete successfully and consistently. Product is critical for us. And consistent product, season after season, appropriate to our brands, is a nonnegotiable. As I look forward, I first want to talk about where we are today.
Let me spend a moment and talk about the guidance that Sabrina gave to you. To be clear, I fully believe in the economic model that we have articulated and that we have been executing over the last several years. That said, there are 3 issues that are going to affect our performance in 2015: the 2 are macro issues with foreign exchange and the port situation, and the third is the performance of Gap brand. 
I want to double click for a moment on Gap. None of us are satisfied with the performance that we're seeing at Gap. I made a very quick change with senior leadership there. I did this because we were not seeing the performance improvement in the business that we needed to see. And specifically, I was not seeing the women's product back on track the way it needed to be for the brand to perform to its potential. 
Jeff and I are together focused on what we need to do in order to get the brand back on track, and it starts with riding the women's business. There's an aesthetic issue, which we're working on today with urgency. We're pleased to see that the denim business seems to be showing signs of life, but Gap as a brand is much more than denim. And we need to have the women's business hitting on all cylinders in order for the business to deliver the performance that we expect. 
2015 is largely bought really through fall right now. Jeff and the team are focused on making product changes that they can make, but those will be modest and incremental until we get to late in the year. Holiday is under significant scrutiny now. I have looked at it. Jeff has looked at it. The team is focused on it to make as much improvement as we can before we buy the product. 
Let me quickly refresh your memory. In early 2011, I sat in the same seat that Jeff is sitting in right now at Gap brand. I know from my experience, and I'm sharing this with Jeff, that we can get the brand back on track quickly with a relentless focus on product. When Jeff got into his role, he moved quickly to make some changes on his team. The obvious hole has been the leader of design, and I'm very pleased to announce today that Jeff has hired Wendi Goldman, who will be rejoining our company, in a new role as head of design and product development for the brand. I've gotten to know Wendi over the course of the last few months, and I feel very confident that she will be a strong creative leader and a significant addition to the team. She knows our company from 8 years here early in her career, and more importantly, she brings her experience from a very successful 11-year run at Limited Brands. Again, 2015 is going to be a year of hard work and getting the brand back on track, but I'm very pleased that we have the team largely in place who will be doing that work.
Now, that said, I am bullish on where we are overall as a company. The consistency of performance that we've seen with Old Navy, really premised on the back of the season after season good product that is on trend and on brand, gives me a good deal of confidence. And it's the product of work that Stefan and the team have done around how they think about trend, how they build the assortment and how they line up all elements of the business to express the brand consistently through marketing, product and in stores. 
I'm very happy with what I've seen with the team at Banana Republic. Andi has excellent taste. She understands the brand, and she has been one of our most consistent operators inside the company, having worked directly with me in a number of roles.  Andi and I both expect more from the brand. 
April is Marissa's first product flow. We saw fall presented last week at fashion week to a very good reception and reaction. And so we are committed to continuing to move Banana forward. The proof is always in the product that we're putting in the stores, but we're excited about what we see and have high expectations.
Let me spend just a moment then on Athleta. We're excited about what we're seeing there, and we're excited about the continued growth, both in the active space and in the space where active meets her ready-to-wear wardrobe. You also have seen, given how excited we are, the fact that we continue to push on Fit inside of Gap and on the Active expression inside of Old Navy as well. And so this is a space that, not only through Athleta but as a company, we are very committed to. 
Over the course of 2014, we made significant progress in the omni-channel space, and we're very excited about the customer response there so far. And we're pushing forward to roll out all of the capabilities across our brands in North America as quickly as possible.
On top of omni-channel, I just want to spend a moment really more broadly on experience. And if you've been following some of the changes that we have made, you would have noted that we brought together the traditional marketing activities and our digital business inside both Gap and Banana Republic. Why am I excited about that? I'm excited about that because today, the digital expression of our brand is the primary way that our customers engage our brands. And if you look at our traffic, the bulk of our traffic is coming into our digital properties. And I'm convinced that going forward, we will win or lose at our digital leased line. Historically, our websites needed to be and have been tremendously effective and efficient channels that our customer bought through. We need to continue to be that going forward, but our digital expression of the brand needs to be more than that. It needs to be aspirational, holistic, emotional in a way that few people have expressed their brands digitally. And we are focused on doing that across all of our businesses.
I want to spend a minute on global growth. Glenn and I worked shoulder to shoulder to create the strategy and growth, and we've been pursuing it consistently over the last several years. It's my intent to continue to pursue growth and obviously through all of our brands and, most importantly, through Old Navy's expansion into China and Japan. We continue to open stores in China, with the plan for this year being about 40 stores, which is consistent with our store opening over the last year or so as well.
Let me close just by coming back a little bit to where I started. I am very excited to be sitting in this role. I am very optimistic about the prospects that this company has in front of it. I'm also very honest and objective and have a great deal of urgency about some of the work that we need to do to get parts of the business back on track. I can give you my strong assurance that I and my team are resolutely committed to doing what's necessary in order to make that happen as quickly as possible. Thank you. Katrina, I will pass it back to you."

It logically connects to the question, obviously, of the port situation. And so I'll address that proactively here, which is that with Gap, in particular, we are -- well, the port situation, for one thing, that is something that is very short term and really outside what we've built in terms of our responsive supply chain. We've reacted to that through logistics, and I'll let Sabrina talk more about that. I'm sure that will come up. With Gap and the aesthetic corrections that we need to do, what I'd like to be able to tell you is we can correct it with the responsive supply chain capabilities that we've built.

I would remind everybody that I think I'm day 26 or something like that, so still bringing the team together. That all said, and I said this before when we spoke a quarter ago, I don't want to communicate at all that there's going to be a big shift in our priorities. Product is absolutely critical to us. And underneath product as a priority, our responsive supply chain capabilities, our seamless inventory capabilities, fabric platforming, obviously, design and design talent, all supercritical. And when I am talking product inside and outside the company, it's on brand, on trend product, but consistently. And that consistency issue is one of the things that I'm really focused on. And then the second issue is really, for me, it's experience. And under experience, it's the omni-channel, the physical and the digital experience and how all of that comes together. So it's really about, in my words, powering up our focus on those as much as anything rather than deviating from them. And then, of course, global growth, which I referenced and I just want to come back to, which is we're committed to continuing to build out our global structure and to put consistent product into it, appropriate to our brands and on trend season after season, not a lot of deviation at all from those as our priorities."

That was a good one for me since I'm passionate about this as well as a number of other things. We're -- I think as we said, we're really continuing to push these omni-channel capabilities, which have been for us more what I would call spot capabilities, so Reserve in Store, Shipping from Store, Find in Store. And now we are testing mobile POS, which we've talked about before. Knowing now how the customer is reacting to those, learning -- having learned a lot about how it comes together to form a customer value proposition and now starting to integrate them into a more holistic offer, that's really the focus, and it's going to be the focus over 2015. We're testing a mobile POS right now, which is really, as we've been talking about, as we push our POS to really a cloud-based POS, it brings all of our web services in. We've been testing that on a small device in stores. And both the sales associates and the customers have been reacting incredibly positively to that. And so it starts to open up a number of things for us, different ways of interacting with our customers, giving the sales associate those tools, different ways of engaging with those customers in the fitting room where we can actually get a transaction done. Of course, you pivot back to what does that mean to the real estate that we currently have committed, the church that we've built for Easter Sunday, if you will, with all the registers in the front of the store, and can we start thinking about putting some of that real estate to more efficient use than underutilized registers for much of the year. And so those are all things that we're absolutely focused on. It's well past proof of concept both in terms of technology as well as how customers engage. And you'll see us continue to push those out over the course of this year."

With regard to average unit cost, we talked about the fact that spring didn't really have a lot of change. Because when we placed spring, there wasn't a lot of difference in the cotton prices. We start to see some benefit in summer and certainly in the back half. So that's all good news. Directionally though, when you do the math on what component cotton is to our total AUC, and I'll just do something high level and illustrative for you, if you have a 20% improvement in cotton, it equates to roughly about a 2% improvement in AUC. And that's before we make any mix decisions or any other changes to our assortment. So it's super helpful. It's a positive thing. But it's not an enormous lever even into the back half. Again, but it's helpful. With regard to pricing, I would say given the promotional environment we've been living in, there's not really a great case, in my view, for changing pricing and giving back to the customer. Of course, what we'll be looking to do is trying to return to healthier margins in 2015. So that could be a lever, some of it offset by foreign exchange. But the cotton tailwind could be a lever, and then we'll be managing our promotional cadence to try and also support healthier margins in 2015."

So let me just step back for a second and talk a little bit about that -- about the journey that Athleta is on. Obviously, started as a catalog and then an online retailer. We only opened stores a few years ago. And as we've opened these stores, the #1 store in the market and then the follow-on stores in that market, we're really learning a lot about kind of a -- building a retailer from the digital world, if you will, into the physical world and how the 2 channels interact with each other. And what we've learned is very positive, which is that we can build stores and we can continue to get the growth out of the direct channel at the same time, which is obviously great growth, accretive growth and really attractive from that standpoint without having to put physical assets in the ground. And so I have no modification in my mind in any way, shape or form about the growth rate and the growth prospects of the business. Just as we're learning about how we get that between the 2 different channels, we're trying to be really responsible obviously and optimize the overall returns of the business by the differential growth rate of the 2 channels. So if you're or anyone is interpreting this as somehow we're losing a little bit of our optimism for the business, that's absolutely the wrong interpretation."

And so even now with Jeff coming in, Kimberly, we've -- we're actually taking a pause and we will be shortening our product calendar, number one, at Gap; and then, number two, pushing much more aggressively on some of those things that, in season or close to being in season, allow us to be very responsive, like an aggressive push on fabric platforming and those kinds of things. And so I've -- why I'm bullish on this, I see this working in our other businesses. I wish Gap had pushed farther forward because it would give us the ability to be a little bit more responsive right now. They're not as far as they will be very quickly. And then the other issue is, is if you look at it, let's rewind from fall. Fall is sometime probably in early August. So it's actually not that far away right now if you consider the production cycle on ocean time, et cetera, et cetera. And so I don't think it's contradictory at all, and we're definitely pushing forward on this. I wish Gap was in a different place, but they are the laggard as it's come to implementing this, and that's something we're correcting right now."

And as of February of 2012, when we really had on brand and appropriate product that was really aligned with the trend of the season, that was the Be Bright marketing campaign that we brought it to market with, and then we saw very, very good numbers come out of the brand, almost instantaneously with getting the product back on track. And so I'll be honest with you right now, Susan. I'm really much more focused on reestablishing the aesthetic direction of the women's business and getting product in our stores that reflects with our customers expect, which is product that is feminine, product that has an optimism associated with it, obviously, casual product with an American aesthetic. And I know there is upside associated with doing that. And then we do that, and that gives us the time to then look at any other issues. I would also just refresh the memory that when I was sitting in that seat, we closed a couple of hundred stores and had made very good progress there from the standpoint of really rationalizing the fleet to be in the kind of real estate that we felt a brand like Gap should be exposed in. And so right now, I want to stay focused with Jeff and the team that he's pulled together on getting the product aesthetic right. The other thing I'll say here again is that -- and as we talk about the product aesthetic, we have a very good men's business. The kids and baby business remains healthy for us. And the Fit and GapBody business is a good business also. And so for me, largely, this is women's business right now, and it's what our focus is on."

Right now, as I mentioned, we're seeing a little bit of life in denim. And the revolution denim has gotten a pretty good reception from customers. They're really finding that they like the whole notion of it, the fit, the fabric, et cetera. Obviously, denim has been -- I characterize it as customer has taken a bit of a pause in denim over the course of the last several quarters. And I would say as much from our business but also having just been in New York doing fashion week and seeing what was being talked about, what was in the showrooms, what the news was in denim, I'm not going to call a turn in the denim business, but I'm feeling -- for the most part, I'm feeling now differently than I felt for a while, which is that she's probably coming back to denim in a way that we haven't seen her be for several quarters. So encouraged there but it's early days. Tops is tough right now, and it's wovens and knits. It's a fit issue. It's a fit intent issue. It's an aesthetic issue. And so we're very much focused on that and very much focused on fixing that as quickly as possible. And so if I had to go to one category, I would definitely say it's in the tops business. And obviously, both knits and wovens for Gap brand are very material categories, and the product is just not -- she's just not responding to the product there right now at all. So let me just stop there. I mean, that's work that we need to do. On the issue of the tension of consistency and creativity, I actually think that's a false dichotomy, to tell you the truth. And let me just give you an example. Fit, so fit in bottoms. Fit, for us, which is a huge issue with respect to a women's loyalty towards her pants, we should be the experts at fit. We have been the experts at fit. And shame on us when we lose consistency on fit because then she can't count on us. That also, as you might imagine, has an impact on the digital business. Because if she counts on the fit and the fit has changed, then we obviously have an issue with returns right now. And so fit consistency is a science. It's a discipline. In no way does it impede what we need in terms of the great creativity of our design teams. And so I guess I've looked in other creative businesses during my career. And I've always found that a lot of them being a trade-off between consistency and discipline and creativity on the other side. Consistency and discipline enables creativity. And frankly, it takes a lot of the work away from what the team has to done -- has to do at the end of the day. So I'm -- and this is really the reaction I see from our design teams as well as is they want to win and they want to have a foundation that they can build on every season."

And I would challenge you to find that we are consistently expressing casual American optimism to the product expression that we have in our stores. And so those are the words that we're using. And now what does that mean tangibly? So in summer, what you will see is there is some more -- it was a very neutral summer that we had last year. You will see more color, brand-appropriate color coming back into the business by the time we get to summer. So that's the change that has been made. Print and pattern obviously as we get into late spring and summer. Not so much in spring but you'll see a bit more of that when we get into summer as well. And then as we move into fall, there's a little bit more. And then the work that's going on right now on holiday is holiday for Gap is really a time for very optimistic expression of the brand. It's a time when a lot of the industry tends to go to a very dark and neutral place. We have done very good business over many years. It's a more optimistic expression of the brand during that time frame. It doesn't mean going nuts on crazy stripe again, going nuts on fair isle or some of the other sort of cliché trends perhaps that you see during holiday. But we have an opportunity to express the brand in a very optimistic and colorful way there but also, obviously, in a feminine way, which is the other piece that's missing from the women's business.

And I'm not promising anything until we get later in the year.

And it's something that I did",434,"Yes, I'll let Sabrina grab the specific number if she wants to talk about that. I'd rather go to a slightly different place, which is to really talk about this change that we've made in the structure of digital and marketing. And it's something that I did very intentionally. And I did it very intentionally in the 2 brands that we did it in, under 2 leaders who I know very well and I think are very enlightened and very capable leaders. Now, you're going to want to know what does that mean at the end of the day. And here, so let me just give you a couple of things that we'll probably continue to talk about. Our brands are being engaged digitally, much more so than through traditional marketing vehicles. And the good news about digital engagement is we have a much better line of sight to the return of our spend in digital engagement versus some of the traditional marketing vehicles, like a billboard or a transit shelter or those kinds of things. And so part of what I'm trying to do about bringing those 2 things together is to really get our arms holistically around how the customer is engaging our brand and then start managing that for the highest returns in our overall spend. And I'm not going to say that we're going to spend less marketing, but I am -- honestly, I'm pretty confident that we're going to be able to see a path towards evolving to higher returns on the marketing spend that we have across a number of different vehicles. The second thing, which I've highlighted but I want to highlight again, is that we have had the luxury of living with our digital expressions of our brands, our websites, as being very efficient transactional channels. Today, to me, it becomes an and, which is those digital properties also have to carry the aspiration and the emotion of the brand as well as being very efficient channels. And by bringing those 2 things together, we really now have leaders and an organization that's going to be thinking digitally first in everything they do. And it starts with very simple things, which is if you're shooting marketing assets for traditional marketing vehicles, oftentimes, those assets don't manifest themselves in the best way possible for digital use. And we just need to pivot to a digital-first mindset. And we'll get -- I do believe we'll get some efficiency out of doing that. I'm much more excited about the effectiveness of our overall spend that we're going to see."

In that we have brought the business different and the customer engages the business different, we've seen levels of strength in China, as an example, that have been better than what we've seen in other parts of the world.

So if I just step back and look at the opportunities for the brand, opportunity #1 is consistency season after season, and that's what gets me probably more excited than anything about the fact now that we've had a little bit of a run there with consistent product, which the customer has consistently responded to. I would also really point you to the expression of the brand in our marketing. I follow them -- probably the best place that I go to honestly to see it is on Instagram. I follow Old Navy and a number of our other brands as well as a number of other brands. And there are honestly times when I look at Old Navy's inventory on Instagram, and it's hard for me to distinguish between a premium or a premium contemporary brand in terms of the aspiration of the fashion that we're presenting. And so Stefan uses the word masspirational. I think it's a great expression that you see. When you see those brands juxtaposed against each other and how Old Navy is really communicating the fact that it's got current trend that is right where it needs to be right now, and clearly, that's what she and the overall family is responding to. Still bullish obviously for Old Navy. So that's in the domestic business. Given the -- given consistency, there's a long runway in front of us there in terms of opportunity. Very bullish on the international business and the expansion that we have in both Japan and in China. And then a couple of places we're highlighting inside the assortment. I touched on the fact that Old Navy has a family-wide Active expression. We've had tremendous customer reaction to that. She's really engaged. And she is engaged on behalf of the family, kids, the men's business and her business, the Active expression. And that's a place where that's -- if that's a trend, that's a trend that's got a long runway in front of it. And so we're excited about being able to build out that business. And it's a business that is essentially purely incremental for us inside of Old Navy. There is real estate to house the business without having to trade off other key categories. So it's a very nice incremental business for us. It allows us to build the business, build productivity in the real estate and give her another reason to come inside the store."

And we don't feel like in a lot of our countries, given the competitive landscape and the orientation toward value of the customer, that there is a lot of room to just full sale [ph] increase prices given the increase in AUC, driven by the stronger dollar. What we look at more is how do we affect and address the issue through our promotional cadence, through our sales and markdowns.

And that is exactly what we saw back in 2012 and in 2013 when we have product well priced, appropriate for the brand that was on trend in our stores.

Let me start with some highlights for the year, and then I'll go through Q4 results before turning to the outlook for 2015. 
For the full year, EPS grew about 10%, excluding the estimated year-over-year impact from foreign exchange. On a reported basis, our earnings per share for the full year grew 5%. Our largest brand, Old Navy, delivered positive comps in each quarter and finished the year with a strong 11 comp in Q4. We achieved our goal of leveraging expenses. At 25.6% of sales, our SG&A rate was the lowest since 2005. We generated free cash flow of $1.4 billion and distributed about $1.6 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.
Moving to the fourth quarter and full year financial results. Regarding earnings, there's been quite a bit of focus on the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar and its impact to 2015 earnings, which I'll address, of course, in the outlook. But it's important to note that we've already absorbed a great deal of foreign exchange headwind in 2014. Full year net earnings were $1.26 billion, and earnings per share were $2.87. This includes about a $0.14 unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. The FX impact was most pronounced in the fourth quarter. Excluding the estimated year-over-year impact from foreign exchange, Q4 earnings per share grew about 20% versus last year. On a reported basis, net income was $319 million, and earnings per share increased 10% to $0.75 per share.
Turning to sales. Sales for the fourth quarter were $4.7 billion and increased 5% on a constant currency basis. Comp sales were up 2%. For the full year, net sales were up 2% to $16.4 billion and up 3% on a constant currency basis, driven by Old Navy's strength. Comparable sales were flat for the year.
Moving to gross margin. Fourth quarter gross profit increased by $65 million to $1.7 billion, and gross margin expanded by 40 basis points to 35.2%. Merchandise margins were up 60 basis points for the quarter, and rent and occupancy deleveraged 20 basis points. For the full year, gross profit was $6.3 billion, and gross margin was down 70 basis points to 38.3%.
At the beginning of 2014, we stated that foreign exchange would likely pressure our merchandise margins. For the year, merchandise margins were down 40 basis points, driven by this FX impact as well as disappointing performance at Gap brand. As anticipated, rent and occupancy deleveraged by 30 basis points.
Regarding SG&A. For the fourth quarter, total operating expenses were $1.1 billion, with marketing expenses at $178 million, slightly below last year. Total operating expenses for the year were $4.2 billion and leveraged 10 basis points despite moving $160 million of credit card income out of SG&A and into merchandise margin. Marketing expenses for the year were $639 million, about flat to last year.
Regarding stores and capital expenditures. We opened 116 new company-operated stores in 2014 net of closures. In line with our strategy, international store growth was focused primarily in Asia. In North America, store growth was focused on our outlet channel in Athleta. Not surprisingly, closures were focused on Gap specialty North America. Our square footage grew by 2.4%, in line with our guidance. Store counts and square footage by division are in our press release. 
Regarding the balance sheet and cash flow. As we stated would be the case, we improved inventory levels throughout the year. Inventory dollars per store were down 5.5% at the end of the fourth quarter. This was better than our previous guidance, driven by foreign exchange favorability and stronger-than-expected sell-through at Old Navy. We ended the year with about $1.5 billion in cash after having distributed about $1.6 billion to shareholders. Ending share count was 421 million shares.
And now I'd like to share our outlook for 2015. Regarding earnings per share. On a reported basis, we expect earnings per share to be in the range of $2.75 to $2.80. Included in this guidance is an estimated unfavorable impact from foreign exchange at current spot rates of about $0.16, an unfavorable impact of about $0.13 due to the West Coast port situation and an expectation for a slower turnaround at Gap brand. Excluding the impacts of foreign exchange, the port issues and last year's gain on sale, our underlying expected EPS growth rate for 2015 would be about 12 percentage points higher or about 9% EPS growth at its midpoint.
Now let me address the port issue. While we've been managing the slowdown at the ports for some time, it's the additional weekend closures in February and the resulting additional backlog that are driving the expected negative impact to earnings. In simple terms, the first quarter is impacted by having fewer units available for sale. It's important to note that this is particularly impactful to Old Navy, given the importance of the Easter holiday to Old Navy's business. Additionally, the second quarter is impacted by late units arriving in Q2 and potentially being sold at lower margins, given that fall flows come in shortly thereafter.
Regarding our inventory guidance. Excluding the impact from the port situation, we would have expected inventory dollars per store to be slightly down at the end of the first quarter. Given the fluidity of the situation, we'll provide an update on inventory later in the quarter.
Moving on to the impact of foreign exchange to the year ahead. At current spot rates, we estimate that foreign exchange will negatively impact our reported EPS growth rate by about 6 percentage points. This equates to about $0.16 or over $100 million of pretax earnings. While comp is reported on a constant currency basis, the remainder of our reported performance is subject to currency fluctuations. As a reminder, our largest foreign subsidiaries are in Canada and Japan, with combined sales in these 2 countries of over $2 billion. Both the Japanese yen and the Canadian dollar have depreciated by about 30% over the past 2 years. With the continuing depreciation of these and other currencies against the dollar, our reported results have been and are expected to be negatively impacted.
There are 2 primary impacts of foreign exchange: the first is translation, and the second impact is the economic impact to our merchandise margins. We hedge the majority of our inventory purchases for our foreign subsidiaries 12 to 18 months in advance. Effectively, this delays the impact of depreciating foreign currencies on most of our cost of goods. However, as the old hedge rates lapse and new less favorable hedge rates come on, the cost of goods in local currencies will increase. In addition, unhedged inventory purchases will be subject to foreign exchange movements.
Moving to expenses and operating margins. We have a strong track record of managing expenses, and we intend to continue that. However, it's unlikely we'll leverage expenses in 2015. As a reminder, we're lapping the $39 million gain on sale as well as absorbing the increase to our minimum hourly wage that we announced last year. Given the negative impact from foreign exchange, the port issues and last year's gain on sale, we expect operating margins to be down about 1 point to 2014 on a reported basis. However, excluding these 3 factors, we expect that operating margin on an underlying basis would modestly expand. 
Here are some other guidance metrics. We expect to add 115 net new stores, with our year-end store base in China growing to over 150 stores and Athleta store base growing to 120 total stores. Square footage is expected to increase about 2.5%. We expect capital expenditures to be about $800 million, with the increased focus on omni-channel and supply chain capabilities. We expect depreciation and amortization to be about $525 million, and we expect our full year effective tax rate to be about 38%.
Finally, we remain very committed to our principle of returning excess cash to shareholders. Underscoring that commitment, we're pleased to have announced a new $1 billion share repurchase authorization and our intent to again increase the dividend to $0.92 per share. As we entered 2015, we remain focused on using all of our levers to further drive value for our shareholders. 
Thank you. And now I'll turn it over to Art."

That said, there are 3 issues that are going to affect our performance in 2015: the 2 are macro issues with foreign exchange and the port situation, and the third is the performance of Gap brand. 
I want to double click for a moment on Gap. None of us are satisfied with the performance that we're seeing at Gap. I made a very quick change with senior leadership there. I did this because we were not seeing the performance improvement in the business that we needed to see. And specifically, I was not seeing the women's product back on track the way it needed to be for the brand to perform to its potential. 
Jeff and I are together focused on what we need to do in order to get the brand back on track, and it starts with righting the women's business. There's an aesthetic issue, which we're working on today with urgency. We're pleased to see that the denim business seems to be showing signs of life, but Gap as a brand is much more than denim. And we need to have the women's business hitting on all cylinders in order for the business to deliver the performance that we expect. 
2015 is largely bought really through fall right now. Jeff and the team are focused on making product changes that they can make, but those will be modest and incremental until we get to late in the year. Holiday is under significant scrutiny now. I have looked at it. Jeff has looked at it. The team is focused on it to make as much improvement as we can before we buy the product. 
Let me quickly refresh your memory. In early 2011, I sat in the same seat that Jeff is sitting in right now at Gap brand. I know from my experience, and I'm sharing this with Jeff, that we can get the brand back on track quickly with a relentless focus on product. When Jeff got into his role, he moved quickly to make some changes on his team. The obvious hole has been the leader of design, and I'm very pleased to announce today that Jeff has hired Wendi Goldman, who will be rejoining our company, in a new role as head of design and product development for the brand. I've gotten to know Wendi over the course of the last few months, and I feel very confident that she will be a strong creative leader and a significant addition to the team. She knows our company from 8 years here early in her career, and more importantly, she brings her experience from a very successful 11-year run at Limited Brands. Again, 2015 is going to be a year of hard work and getting the brand back on track, but I'm very pleased that we have the team largely in place who will be doing that work.
Now, that said, I am bullish on where we are overall as a company. The consistency of performance that we've seen with Old Navy, really premised on the back of the season after season good product that is on trend and on brand, gives me a good deal of confidence. And it's the product of work that Stefan and the team have done around how they think about trend, how they build the assortment and how they line up all elements of the business to express the brand consistently through marketing, product and in stores. 
I'm very happy with what I've seen with the team at Banana Republic. Andi has excellent taste. She understands the brand, and she has been one of our most consistent operators inside the company, having worked directly with me in a number of roles.  Andi and I both expect more from the brand. 
April is Marissa's first product flow. We saw fall presented last week at fashion week to a very good reception and reaction. And so we are committed to continuing to move Banana forward. The proof is always in the product that we're putting in the stores, but we're excited about what we see and have high expectations.
Let me spend just a moment then on Athleta. We're excited about what we're seeing there, and we're excited about the continued growth, both in the active space and in the space where active meets her ready-to-wear wardrobe. You also have seen, given how excited we are, the fact that we continue to push on Fit inside of Gap and on the Active expression inside of Old Navy as well. And so this is a space that, not only through Athleta but as a company, we are very committed to. 
Over the course of 2014, we made significant progress in the omni-channel space, and we're very excited about the customer response there so far. And we're pushing forward to roll out all of the capabilities across our brands in North America as quickly as possible.
On top of omni-channel, I just want to spend a moment really more broadly on experience. And if you've been following some of the changes that we have made, you would have noted that we brought together the traditional marketing activities and our digital business inside both Gap and Banana Republic. Why am I excited about that? I'm excited about that because today, the digital expression of our brand is the primary way that our customers engage our brands. And if you look at our traffic, the bulk of our traffic is coming into our digital properties. And I'm convinced that going forward, we will win or lose at our digital leased line. Historically, our websites needed to be and have been tremendously effective and efficient channels that our customer bought through. We need to continue to be that going forward, but our digital expression of the brand needs to be more than that. It needs to be aspirational, holistic, emotional in a way that few people have expressed their brands digitally. And we are focused on doing that across all of our businesses.
I want to spend a minute on global growth. Glenn and I worked shoulder to shoulder to create the strategy and growth, and we've been pursuing it consistently over the last several years. It's my intent to continue to pursue growth and obviously through all of our brands and, most importantly, through Old Navy's expansion into China and Japan. We continue to open stores in China, with the plan for this year being about 40 stores, which is consistent with our store opening over the last year or so as well.
Let me close just by coming back a little bit to where I started. I am very excited to be sitting in this role. I am very optimistic about the prospects that this company has in front of it. I'm also very honest and objective and have a great deal of urgency about some of the work that we need to do to get parts of the business back on track. I can give you my strong assurance that I and my team are resolutely committed to doing what's necessary in order to make that happen as quickly as possible. Thank you. Katrina, I will pass it back to you."

So here's the reality is that we were actually set up to do that today, and we're continuing to grow that capability, not just in Gap and Old Navy but across all 3 of our big brands. It logically connects to the question, obviously, of the port situation. And so I'll address that proactively here, which is that with Gap, in particular, we are -- well, the port situation, for one thing, that is something that is very short term and really outside what we've built in terms of our responsive supply chain. We've reacted to that through logistics, and I'll let Sabrina talk more about that. I'm sure that will come up. With Gap and the aesthetic corrections that we need to do, what I'd like to be able to tell you is we can correct it with the responsive supply chain capabilities that we've built. The reality is, is that we're more rebooting some of the aesthetic elements of the brand. Those are capabilities that are set up to help us more in season with chase and open to buy and those types of things. And so it's really a little bit disconnected from the problem that we have in Gap right now. But I'm working very closely with Sonia Syngal, who is our head of supply chain and product operations, as well as the brand presidents. And these are capabilities that we've talked about before. We're continuing to build them, and we're very bullish about their ability to impact the business."

If I look back and step back from that a little bit, as Gap is doing that work to fix itself right now, there are the broader strategic priorities, and we'll talk more about those, obviously, over the course of the next several months. I would remind everybody that I think I'm day 26 or something like that, so still bringing the team together. That all said, and I said this before when we spoke a quarter ago, I don't want to communicate at all that there's going to be a big shift in our priorities. Product is absolutely critical to us. And underneath product as a priority, our responsive supply chain capabilities, our seamless inventory capabilities, fabric platforming, obviously, design and design talent, all supercritical. And when I am talking product inside and outside the company, it's on brand, on trend product, but consistently. And that consistency issue is one of the things that I'm really focused on. And then the second issue is really, for me, it's experience. And under experience, it's the omni-channel, the physical and the digital experience and how all of that comes together. So it's really about, in my words, powering up our focus on those as much as anything rather than deviating from them. And then, of course, global growth, which I referenced and I just want to come back to it, which is we're committed to continuing to build out our global structure and to put consistent product into it, appropriate to our brands and on trend season after season, not a lot of deviation at all from those as our priorities."

That was a good one for me since I'm passionate about this as well as a number of other things. We're -- I think as we've said, we're really continuing to push these omni-channel capabilities, which have been for us more what I would call spot capabilities, so Reserve in Store, Shipping from Store, Find in Store. And now we are testing mobile POS, which we've talked about before. Knowing now how the customer is reacting to those, learning -- having learned a lot about how it comes together to form a customer value proposition and now starting to integrate them into a more holistic offer, that's really the focus, and it's going to be the focus over 2015. We're testing a mobile POS right now, which is really, as we've been talking about, as we push our POS to really a cloud-based POS that brings all of our web services in. We've been testing that on a small device in stores. And both the sales associates and the customers have been reacting incredibly positively to that. And so it starts to open up a number of things for us, different ways of interacting with our customers, giving the sales associate those tools, different ways of engaging with those customers in the fitting room where we can actually get a transaction done. Of course, you pivot back to what does that mean to the real estate that we currently have committed, the church that we've built for Easter Sunday, if you will, with all the registers at the front of the store, and can we start thinking about putting some of that real estate to more efficient use than underutilized registers for much of the year. And so those are all things that we're absolutely focused on. It's well past proof of concept both in terms of technology as well as how customers engage. And you'll see us continue to push those out over the course of this year."

With regard to average unit cost, we talked about the fact that spring didn't really have a lot of change. Because when we placed spring, there wasn't a lot of difference in the cotton prices. We start to see some benefit in summer and certainly in the back half. So that's all good news. Directionally though, when you do the math on what component cotton is to our total AUC, and I'll just do something high level and illustrative for you, if you have a 20% improvement in cotton, it equates to roughly about a 2% improvement in AUC. And that's before we make any mix decisions or any other changes to our assortment. So it's super helpful. It's a positive thing. But it's not an enormous lever even into the back half, again, but it's helpful. With regard to pricing, I would say given the promotional environment we've been living in, there's not really a great case, in my view, for changing pricing and giving that to the customer. Of course, what we'll be looking to do is trying to return to healthier margins in 2015. So that could be a lever, some of it offset by foreign exchange. But the cotton tailwind could be a lever, and then we'll be managing our promotional cadence to try and also support healthier margins in 2015."

So let me just step back for a second and talk a little bit about that -- about the journey that Athleta is on. Obviously, started as a catalog and then an online retailer. We only opened stores a few years ago. And as we've opened these stores, the #1 store in the market and then the follow-on stores in that market, we're really learning a lot about kind of a -- building a retailer from the digital world, if you will, into the physical world and how the 2 channels interact with each other. And what we've learned is very positive, which is that we can build stores and we can continue to get the growth out of the direct channel at the same time, which is obviously great growth, accretive growth and really attractive from that standpoint without having to put physical assets in the ground. And so I have no modification in my mind in any way, shape or form about the growth rate and the growth prospects of the business. Just as we're learning about how we get that between the 2 different channels, we're trying to be really responsible obviously and optimize the overall returns of the business by the differential growth rate of the 2 channels. So if you're or anyone is interpreting this as somehow we're losing a little bit of our optimism for the business, that's absolutely the wrong interpretation."

And so I've -- why I'm bullish on this, I see this working in our other businesses. I wish Gap had pushed farther forward because it would give us the ability to be a little bit more responsive right now. They're not as far as they will be very quickly. And then the other issue is, is if you look at it, let's rewind from fall. Fall is sometime probably in early August. So it's actually not that far away right now if you consider the production cycle on ocean time, et cetera, et cetera. And so I don't think it's contradictory at all, and we're definitely pushing forward on this.

And so I'll be honest with you right now, Susan. I'm really much more focused on reestablishing the aesthetic direction of the women's business and getting product in our stores that reflects what our customers expect, which is product that is feminine, product that has an optimism associated with it, obviously, casual product with an American aesthetic. And I know there is upside associated with doing that. And then we do that, and that gives us the time to then look at any other issues. I would also just refresh the memory that when I was sitting in that seat, we closed a couple of hundred stores and had made very good progress there from the standpoint of really rationalizing the fleet to be in the kind of real estate that we felt a brand like Gap should be exposed in. And so right now, I want to stay focused with Jeff and the team that he's pulled together on getting the product aesthetic right. The other thing I'll say here again is that -- and as we talk about the product aesthetic, we have a very good men's business. The kids and baby business remains healthy for us. And the Fit and GapBody business is a good business also. And so for me, largely, this is women's business right now, and it's what our focus is on."

Right now, as I mentioned, we're seeing a little bit of life in denim. And the Resolution Denim has gotten a pretty good reception from customers. They're really finding that they like the whole notion of it, the fit, the fabric, et cetera. Obviously, denim has been -- I characterize it as the customer has taken a bit of a pause in denim over the course of the last several quarters. And I would say as much from our business, but also having just been in New York doing fashion week and seeing what was being talked about, what was in the showrooms, what the news was in denim, I'm not going to call a turn in the denim business, but I'm feeling -- for the most part, I'm feeling now differently than I felt for a while, which is that she's probably coming back to denim in a way that we haven't seen her be for several quarters. So encouraged there but it's early days. Tops is tough right now, and it's wovens and knits. It's a fit issue. It's a fit intent issue. It's an aesthetic issue. And so we're very much focused on that and very much focused on fixing that as quickly as possible. And so if I had to go to one category, I would definitely say it's in the tops business. And obviously, both knits and wovens for Gap brand are very material categories, and the product is just not -- she's just not responding to the product there right now at all. So let me just stop there. I mean, that's work that we need to do. On the issue of the tension of consistency and creativity, I actually think that's a false dichotomy, to tell you the truth. And let me just give you an example. Fit, so fit in bottoms. Fit, for us, which is a huge issue with respect to a women's loyalty towards her pants, we should be the experts at fit. We have been the experts at fit. And shame on us when we lose consistency on fit because then she can't count on us. That also, as you might imagine, has an impact on the digital business. Because if she counts on the fit and the fit has changed, then we obviously have an issue with returns right now. And so fit consistency is a science. It's a discipline. In no way does it impede what we need in terms of the great creativity of our design teams. And so I guess I've worked in other creative businesses during my career. And I've always found that rather than being a trade-off between consistency and discipline and creativity on the other side. Consistency and discipline enables creativity. And frankly, it takes a lot of the work away from what the team has to done -- has to do at the end of the day. So I'm -- and this is really the reaction I see from our design teams as well as is they want to win and they want to have a foundation that they can build on every season."

And if you haven't been in our stores and looked at the women's assortment, I would suggest that you do, but I suspect that you have. And I would challenge you to find that we are consistently expressing casual American optimism through the product expression that we have in our stores. And so those are the words that we're using. And now what does that mean tangibly? So in summer, what you will see is there is some more -- it was a very neutral summer that we had last year. You will see more color, brand-appropriate color coming back into the business by the time we get to summer. So that's a change that has been made. Print and pattern obviously as we get into late spring and summer. Not so much in spring but you'll see a bit more of that when we get into summer as well. And then as we move into fall, there's a little bit more. And then the work that's going on right now on holiday is holiday for Gap is really a time for very optimistic expression of the brand. It's a time when a lot of the industry tends to go to a very dark and neutral place. We have done very good business over many years with a more optimistic expression of the brand during that time frame. It doesn't mean going nuts on crazy stripe again, going nuts on fair isle or some of the other sort of cliché trends perhaps that you see during holiday. But we have an opportunity to express the brand in a very optimistic and colorful way there but also, obviously, in a feminine way, which is the other piece that's missing from the women's business. And so I'm not going to call a turn on the business right now. I'm being very honest with you about the work that's going on and when you will start to see some change. And I'm not promising anything until we get later in the year. But I think even as we get to the summer and the fall, you will start to see the brand shift a little bit more to be expressed through the appropriate filters of the brand."

I'd rather go to a slightly different place, which is to really talk about this change that we've made in the structure of digital and marketing. And it's something that I did very intentionally. And I did it very intentionally in the 2 brands that we did it in, under 2 leaders who I know very well and I think are very enlightened and very capable leaders. Now, you're going to want to know what does that mean at the end of the day. And here, so let me just give you a couple of things that we'll probably continue to talk about. Our brands are being engaged digitally, much more so than through traditional marketing vehicles. And the good news about digital engagement is we have a much better line of sight to the return of our spend in digital engagement versus some of the traditional marketing vehicles, like a billboard or a transit shelter or those kinds of things. And so part of what I'm trying to do by bringing those 2 things together is to really get our arms holistically around how the customer is engaging our brand and then start managing that for the highest returns in our overall spend. And I'm not going to say that we're going to spend less marketing, but I am -- honestly, I'm pretty confident that we're going to be able to see a path towards evolving to higher returns on the marketing spend that we have across a number of different vehicles. The second thing, which I've highlighted but I want to highlight again, is that we have had the luxury of living with our digital expressions of our brands, our websites, as being very efficient transactional channels. Today, to me, it becomes an and, which is those digital properties also have to carry the aspiration and the emotion of the brand as well as being very efficient channels. And by bringing those 2 things together, we really now have leaders and an organization that's going to be thinking digitally first in everything they do. And it starts with very simple things, which is if you're shooting marketing assets for traditional marketing vehicles, oftentimes, those assets don't manifest themselves in the best way possible for digital use. And we just need to pivot to a digital-first mindset. And we'll get -- I do believe we'll get some efficiency out of doing that. I'm much more excited about the effectiveness of our overall spend that we're going to see."

So if I just step back and look at the opportunities for the brand, opportunity #1 is consistency season after season, and that's what gets me probably more excited than anything about the fact now that we've had a little bit of a run there with consistent product, which the customer has consistently responded to. I would also really point you to the expression of the brand in our marketing. I follow them -- probably the best place that I go to honestly to see it is on Instagram. I follow Old Navy and a number of our other brands, as well as a number of other brands. And there are honestly times when I look at Old Navy's inventory on Instagram, and it's hard for me to distinguish between a premium or a premium contemporary brand in terms of the aspiration of the fashion that we're presenting. And so Stefan uses the word masspirational. I think it's a great expression that you see. When you see those brands juxtaposed against each other and how Old Navy is really communicating the fact that it's got current trend that is right where it needs to be right now, and clearly, that's what she and the overall family is responding to. Still bullish obviously for Old Navy. So that's in the domestic business. Given the -- given consistency, there's a long runway in front of us there in terms of opportunity. Very bullish on the international business and the expansion that we have in both Japan and in China. And then a couple of places we're highlighting inside the assortment. I touched on the fact that Old Navy has a family-wide Active expression. We've had tremendous customer reaction to that. She's really engaged. And she is engaged on behalf of the family, kids, the men's business and her business, the Active expression. And that's a place where that's -- if that's a trend, that's a trend that's got a long runway in front of it. And so we're excited about being able to build out that business. And it's a business that is essentially purely incremental for us inside of Old Navy. There is real estate to house the business. We're not having to trade off other key categories. So it's a very nice incremental business for us that allows us to build the business, build productivity in the real estate and give her another reason to come inside the store."

And we don't feel like in a lot of our countries, given the competitive landscape and the orientation toward value of the customer, that there is a lot of room to just, full sail, increase prices given the increase in AUC, driven by the stronger dollar. What we look at more is how do we affect and address the issue through our promotional cadence, through our sales and markdowns. So that's what we've been trying to do overall for the last 1.5 years as we've been facing the pressure already.

The most important thing I want to do today is reemphasize our earnings guidance for the year. You have, I'm sure, our press release in front of you, you have the details underneath that and after I am done, I'll hand it over to Sabrina Simmons, who will take you to the specific detail, and obviously we'll have Q&A at the end of this call.
We'll talk about our first quarter results and I'll go a little bit deeper into what's been going on over the last 3 months. There are 3 issues that really impacted the first quarter, 2 those are macro factors, which we've spoken to you about before in terms of foreign exchange and the West Coast port situation. Sabrina will spend a little bit more time on that. I really want to dive in on the underlying results of our 3 global brands, and specifically, the performance of our women's businesses. As we've said, and we continue to see, we've had an exceptionally well-performing women's business at Old Navy, which has driven great profitable growth. Product acceptance at Gap in the women's business has been tough and we're focused on making it happen. And at Banana Republic, it's a work in process and we have work to do there as well.
Let me start first by spending a few minutes on Old Navy. Obviously, it's a very good story, a story that we're very pleased with and a story that we have confidence and is going to continue to repeat itself on a going-forward basis. Three years of excellent performance and most importantly, underneath the covers, growth that is being driven in a very high-quality way with a very nice margin story underneath it. Q1 comp was a women's story, and I'm saying that in particular because as we have struggled with our Women's business in Gap as an example, Old Navy is an excellent example, where we continue to get women's right season after season, and we're very pleased with the performance that we're seeing with on-brand, on-trend product in our stores.
I need to point out that this is a combination of factors. It is clearly a team working well together, led by Stefan, that is delivering this performance, but it's also underlying process changes that we have made in a way that we're running the business and the way that we're bringing product to market that is delivering the consistency that we're seeing.
I've mentioned this before, but I need to mention it again, which is we are taking these changes. And in some cases, largely transplanting them into our other businesses in that they are proven inside of Old Navy and they have been delivering this kind of performance. Again, we have a strong women's business there, but it's been followed by a pretty strong business inside the rest of the box as well across men's, Kids and Baby. And it's a thing of beauty when Old Navy is firing at all cylinders, it has now for several seasons running.
On the flip side, I continue to be disappointed, but not surprised, by Gap's performance. We have had a women's business challenge now for several seasons running. I believe we have diagnosed it correctly, having to do with being off-brand, in some cases off-trend, and I can promise you that the team is all over it. In the last call that we had, I mentioned the hiring of Wendy Goldman. Wendy has hit the ground running. She is a highly collaborative, skilled leader working with the team, and I've been really pleased so far that results of the whole team is producing as they have focused on holiday and obviously on Spring. Jeffrey really has 3 priorities right now, and I want to underline and emphasize those to you. We are in-season every day, and we're managing the business as aggressively as we can to get every penny out of the business. In relative terms, Kids and Baby is performing better and men's is performing better. But to be clear, I am not happy, and Jeff is not happy, with the entire performance of the branded and we're committed to turning it around.
On top of managing in season, we're obviously working extremely hard to make every improvement that we can to the outlying seasons, including holiday and most importantly, Spring. On top of that, I said I was impatient, we are working very hard to change the product processes all of what we're doing in Old Navy in order to get Gap to a more consistent on-trend, on-brand footing. And I have to say much of the work that the team has done there is to realign the team on the aesthetic of the brand is very, very encouraging.
Banana Republic is a mixed bag. This was Marissa's first collection showing up late in the quarter. It's had a couple of very positive impacts in terms of reestablishing some fashion credibility for the brand and the relevance of the brand but we didn't get it 100% right and this is not to be excused but perhaps expected as you're bringing a new designer and a new leadership team together. The color palette was pretty stark between black and white, not enough color and print and pattern for this season that we're in, and we're still working to buy an assortment that is both commercial and fashion oriented. Relatively speaking, the men's business is stronger and it's not that the women's business is weak, but we have not hit the stride nor delivered the commercial results while at the same time we have established some fashion credibility, and that's our job and we're focused on making it happen.
In a moment, I'll turn it over to Sabrina. What I wanted to do was offer a few comments in advance about how Sabrina and I are working together and the commitment that we very much share together. Obviously, a big part of our story over the last several years has been the fact that we are committed to a responsible capital structure and as this company continues to generate a significant amount of cash, we are committed to distributing net excess cash to that of our shareholders. It's important for me to emphasize that Sabrina and I are highly aligned on continuing that going forward while at the same time responsibly reinvesting in the business.
Sabrina, let me pass it to you."

As anticipated, our first quarter results were impacted by foreign exchange headwind to delete receipts due to the West Coast port issue. Despite these dynamics, we're pleased that Old Navy delivered another strong quarter on top of 3 years growth. As Art mentioned, we're focused on taking the steps necessary to drive improvements and greater consistency in our other brands while continuing to make progress on our long-term objectives.
Operating income for the first quarter was $386 million versus $443 million last year. Net earnings were $239 million. On a reported basis, earnings per share were $0.56, down about 3% versus $0.58 last year. It's important to note that our reported earnings per share were negatively impacted by foreign exchange. We estimate that foreign exchange reduced our reported earnings per share growth rate by about 3 percentage points.
Sales for the first quarter were also impacted by foreign exchange and the port issues. As reported, first quarter sales were $3.7 billion, down 3% versus last year. The translation of foreign revenues into dollars negatively impacted our reported net sales by about $90 million in the first quarter. On a constant currency basis, net sales were down about 1%.
Regarding the port impact, there's no meaningful change to our first half estimate of $0.13. As a reminder, first quarter sales were impacted by having fewer units available for sale. We expect that second quarter will be impacted by late units that will likely be sold at lower margins. Total sales and comps by division are listed in our press release.
Moving to gross margin. First quarter gross margin was down 100 basis points to 37.8%. Merchandise margins were about flat, driven by strong performance at Old Navy, offset by the impact of foreign exchange as well as disappointing performance at Gap brand. Rent and occupancy de-leveraged 100 basis points.
In the face of challenging sales performance, we managed SG&A tightly. First quarter total operating expenses were $996 million, down $27 million from the prior year, driven by foreign exchange favorability. Marketing expenses were down about $7 million versus last year to $136 million. As a percent of sales, total operating expenses were 27.2% and de-leveraged about 10 basis points versus last year.
As a reminder, in Q2, we will lap last year's gain on sales of nearly $40 million. Therefore, we expect greater deleverage in Q2 versus Q1.
Regarding the balance sheet and cash flow. Inventory dollars per store were up about 4% at end of the first quarter. As anticipated, delayed receipts due to the West Coast port situation resulted in higher in-transit inventory levels at the end of the first quarter. We expect year-over-year inventory dollars per store at in the second quarter to be up slightly versus last year deal as we focus on selling through the late receipts while trying to maximize margin. As a reminder, last year's inventory per store up on the 2% in Q2 versus up 7% at the end of Q1.
For the quarter, free cash flow was an inflow of only $61 million. Underscoring our commitment to distribute excess cash to shareholders, we distributed more than 5x our free cash flow or $329 million this quarter. This includes $230 million to repurchase 5.6 million shares, resulting in a quarter end share count of 419 million.
Regarding capital expenditures and store count. First quarter capital expenditures were $150 million. We opened 29 company-operated stores on a net basis and ended the quarter with 3,309 stores. Store counts and square footage are listed in our press release.
And now I'd like to share our outlook for the rest of the year. Our first quarter performance was broadly in line with our expectation at the time we provided our full year guidance in February. Therefore, we are reaffirming our full year earnings per share guidance range of $2.75 to $2.80. For the full year, all other guidance metrics remain substantially unchanged.
In closing, as we enter the second quarter, we will be continue to focus on levers that we can control while we work to deliver compelling product assortments across all of our brands. 
Thank you, and now I'll turn it back over to Jack."

We've diagnosed it because we can go in there and look at it. I spent time in stores, I watched what customers buy, we look at our product acceptance and the issues are clear, and have been clear for several seasons. And so -- and it is a combination of all the above, which is we've got -- we are off-trend and in some cases, way off the brand. We have some quality and fit issues where we've made choices. And the issue is the women's business which is why I'm focused on the women's business, the women's business isn't working, it does in a brand like Gap, which is obviously dual gender and then whole family have a negative halo on the rest of the box. But we're actually getting very good customer feedback on our Kids and Baby business. The men's business continues to be relatively strong. And so it's why when I have been working with Jeff and the team, it's been prioritize the women's business because as it halos negatively when it's not working, it has the same halo effect positively when it is working. And I'm actually -- I'm pretty encouraged by what I see going forward. I can even look at the holiday assortment, which is largely landing -- now and some of the sort of obvious mistakes that we've made we have either gone from the while line, we've actually taken the step of canceling some styles that we have that we knew were just not salable, which is an appropriate thing to do as well and which we've been able to do. And so from that standpoint, again, same thing I said before. Team, heads down, looking on the women's assortment and getting it back on track as much as we can doing on the holiday, acknowledging it was must mostly bought and then spring being a no excuse moment."

The other side of that is I'm feeling like we're really getting our returns in the marketing spend that we have at Old Navy and what I can see the returns and it can help drive the business, I'm happy to put money in that into the business as well. So it's really about placing smart bets, not just sticking with the marketing plan or anything like that. So expect us to be us to be tight. And as product gets better, expect us to then start putting a little bit of pressure on the business. But you correctly have seen that we've pulled back in legal continue to do that until we feel like there is an opportunity to really tell the story. And then the second issue is -- and this is a topic broadly separate from the current performance of the business that both Sabrina and I are very focused on right now. We have, over a long period of time, generally spent more than many of the competitors out there in terms of marketing. And I think we should be getting more out of our marketing dollar than we are at the end of the day. Sabrina, do you want to add anything to that?"

Old Navy is farthest ahead in realizing this with the changes that have taken place, obviously, and the challenges of the business at Gap changes and addition, challenges in the business, those 2 businesses lagged. Banana's probably the middle and Gap is farthest behind. What I can say quite confidently is that as we have implemented it, it's very clear that it's having a positive impact and it's the right thing to do. And then the question really is scaling it and continuing to scale it as fast as we can. And so -- and we are using this in some cases to do exactly what we talked about with respect to a trend out there that we see or something like that. We'll put a set of silhouettes and in bottoms and we'll see which sells and allows us to go cut more aggressively and respond more quickly into the silhouettes that are selling right now. And then in denim as an example, there's a lot of variation out there in terms of rise, in terms of the leg silhouettes and the novelty and get more response there. And knits is an easy one where we've also used knit in particularly inside of Old Navy to be more responsive to where the knits business has really shown some real strength it put some volume behind it. So it's a clear capability. As I've said pretty publicly, we're in a business that we guess a lot and anything that we can do to minimize that guesses and guess better and inform it with data has a real positive impact on the business."

So that's one piece that will always be in the work. With regard to sort of how we deliver the expense savings this quarter to help you think about how we would do it in future quarters, a chunk of it came from foreign exchange, so we called that out. And so we benefited probably between the translation and balance sheet remeasurement, about $30 million of benefit. Even after that though, expenses were pretty close to last year, so very tight. And that comes primarily from this variable component I talked about, as well as we brought that marketing down a little bit by $7 million. And so we would continue to use those levers that are variable or discretionary, like marketing. Q2, I just want to call out again, is a very different dynamic because we leveraged last year in Q2 by 190 basis points. So just from a sheer uptick perspective, that includes the sale on gain of $40 million last year. So we're going to be lapping that. And then we layer on really kicking in in June the wage increase. So that the leverage we would expect to be higher in Q2 just because of what we're anniversary-ing such high leverage. But we will, behind the scenes, continue to continue to work although levers we have at our disposal to manage our expense is very tightly, especially if we're not realizing the sales we would expect."

Yes, I think, and I hope what you're seeing and what you're believing is that you put that much consistency in place 3 years, multiple quarters back-to-back and there's a reason behind that, and there was a reason behind that. And it is, it starts with obviously Stefan and his team, which is a really good team working well together. But the much more important thing behind the scenes is that team living inside of a very disciplined process and a set of process changes that is allowing for the consistency. Again, I say this often publicly that it's relatively easy to have a great quarter. What is superlatively hard in these industry is to put quarter-after-quarter together and then year-after-year. So we have a lot of confidence there in the processes and capabilities that we built. It starts with what we think is a really great process right at the beginning, which filters trend, really systematically across a wide variety of sources, filters trend down to the right ones that we feel are brand right and appropriately commercial for Old Navy. And it's allowed us to be in trends that are happening at the same time in the designer and the premium contemporary space. It's allowed us into those trends in Old Navy almost in a simultaneous way, which really is the way the world is working right now. So that ability to be right and to respond very quickly is powerful. And then if you just go down into the system, there's a really -- I think you really disciplined and structured management of the assortment that we're running us right now, which allows us to maintain the proper amount of newness in a portfolio, but also have a super solid set of style that are proven that we can invest in over several seasons to help us really drive the commercial plan of the business. Yes, I guess the way I'd think about it is that a healthy business is a business that's gaining market share. And Old Navy has now demonstrated its ability to hunt and win at market share a pretty consistently for a number of quarters running. So I won't say that this is going to be perfect every time because it's tough in this industry with fashion, but I do have a great deal of confidence in the system in process that we built there. And it's obviously we're working very aggressively with Jeff and his team and Andy and her team to almost do turnkey installation of some of these components into the other businesses as well. And we'll see the results there on a going-forward basis, but I've been really pleased with what we're seeing in Old Navy, and really confident what we're seeing going forward."

The second issue is fix as much of the product as we can that this in the pipeline and deliver spring. Spring women's product in a brand appropriate, trend appropriate way. And then the third is rebuilding the product processes. So there are a lot of plates spinning right now inside of Jeff's world, but he and I both feel very strongly that we can't wait, so we are working these things simultaneously. If you think about some of the key elements of the process, what is very simply the length of the pipeline at Old Navy has been running on a shorter pipeline for a while, and Gap is developing on that pipeline now as we speak. And then there is the trend process, the assortment architecture, the supply chain capabilities, a number of other things as well which we're layering in. Quite honestly, Jeff and I are sitting here and saying, how much can we pull through the organization and how fast as we push? But we are pretty pushing pretty hard and pretty fast. Spring will come to market with a shorter pipeline, but it's going to be a hybrid really of the way they've traditionally brought it to market and the new process that --. We'll get more and more up to speed on the platform as we go through the product development for 2016 in the outlying seasons. Yes, I can't tell you exactly when there's going to be a light's on moment of this revealing itself because it was in Old Navy and it is in both Banana and Gap -- progressively built.

I mean, one of the things that's really cool about what's going on in Old Navy is that they are able, in many cases, to achieve cost reductions that elevated sense of quality and a mix up all at the same time with some AUR. Now it's in selective categories. So this is one Sabrina and I are as absolutely in lockstep, which is to be -- to put AUR and look for AUR on the basis of mix and track record. Because it's provend to be way too elusive at times, not just for us but for other people in this industry. And then the other side of AUR, having nothing to do really with the make of the product, or AUC, is just getting off of the debt of the promotions that we've had in some parts of the company. And frankly, in my view, that's probably a much bigger AUR opportunity in the near to medium term than any fundamental changes in product mix or product make. We've been very heavily discounted, as you know, and in some cases, overbought in areas where the product is not registering, and that's a tough spot to be. So a second part of Gap is to really make sure that we are buying holiday and spring in exactly the right way. And again, I've said publicly that I have a pretty strong bias towards all this modestly underbuying a season and looking for upside in AUR versus trying to force a lot of units through the system."

And after I am done, I'll hand it over to Sabrina Simmons, who will take you through the specific detail. And obviously, we'll have Q&A at the end of this call.
We'll talk about our first quarter results, and I'll go a little bit deeper into what's been going on over the last 3 months. There are 3 issues that really impacted the first quarter, 2 those are macro factors, which we've spoken to you about before in terms of foreign exchange and the West Coast port situation. Sabrina will spend a little bit more time on that. I really want to dive in on the underlying results of our 3 global brands, and specifically, the performance of our women's businesses. As we've said, and we continue to see, we've had an exceptionally well-performing women's business at Old Navy, which has driven great profitable growth. Product acceptance at Gap in the women's business has been tough, and we're focused on making it happen. And at Banana Republic, it's a work in process, and we have work to do there as well.
Let me start first by spending a few minutes on Old Navy. Obviously, it's a very good story. A story that we're very pleased with and a story that we have confidence and is going to continue to repeat itself on a going-forward basis. Three years of excellent performance and most importantly, underneath the covers, growth that is being driven in a very high-quality way with a very nice margin story underneath it. Q1 comp was a women's story, and I'm saying that in particular because as we have struggled with our women's business in Gap as an example, Old Navy is an excellent example where we continue to get women's right season after season, and we're very pleased with the performance that we're seeing with on-brand, on-trend product in our stores.
I need to point out that this is a combination of factors. It is clearly a team working well together, led by Stefan, that is delivering this performance, but it's also underlying process changes that we have made in the way that we're running the business and the way that we're bringing product to market that is delivering the consistency that we're seeing.
I've mentioned this before, but I need to mention it again, which is, we are taking these changes. And in some cases, largely transplanting them into our other businesses in that they are proven inside of Old Navy and they have been delivering this kind of performance. Again, we have a strong women's business there, but it's been followed by a pretty strong business inside the rest of the box as well, across men's, kids and baby. And it's a thing of beauty when Old Navy is firing on all cylinders. It has now for several seasons running.
On the flip side, I continue to be disappointed, but not surprised, by Gap's performance. We have had a women's business challenge now for several seasons running. I believe we have diagnosed it correctly, having to do with being off-brand, in some cases off-trend, and I can promise you that the team is all over it. In the last call that we had, I mentioned the hiring of Wendi Goldman. Wendi has hit the ground running. She is a highly collaborative, skilled leader working with the team. And I've been really pleased so far of the results the whole team is producing as they have focused on holiday and obviously on spring.
Jeff really has 3 priorities right now, and I want to underline and emphasize those to you. We are in-season every day, and we're managing the business as aggressively as we can to get every penny out of the business. In relative terms, kids and baby is performing better and men's is performing better. But to be clear, I am not happy, and Jeff is not happy with the entire performance of the brand, and we're committed to turning it around.
On top of managing in season, we're obviously working extremely hard to make every improvement that we can to the outlying seasons, including holiday and most importantly, spring. On top of that, I said I was impatient, we are working very hard to change the product processes -- all of what we're doing in Old Navy -- in order to get Gap to a more consistent on-trend, on-brand footing. And I have to say, much of the work that the team has done there to realign the team on the aesthetic of the brand is very, very encouraging.
Banana Republic is a mixed bag. This was Marissa's first collection showing up later in the quarter. It's had a couple of very positive impacts in terms of reestablishing some fashion credibility for the brand and the relevance of the brand, but we didn't get it 100% right. And this is not to be excused, but perhaps expected as you're bringing a new designer and a new leadership team together. The color palette was pretty stark between black and white, not enough color and print and pattern for the season that we're in, and we're still working to buy an assortment that is both commercial and fashion-oriented. Relatively speaking, the men's business is stronger, and it's not that the women's business is weak, but we have not hit the stride nor delivered the commercial results while at the same time we have established some fashion credibility. And that's our job, and we're focused on making it happen.
In a moment, I'll turn it over to Sabrina. What I wanted to do was offer a few comments in advance about how Sabrina and I are working together and the commitment that we very much share together. Obviously, a big part of our story over the last several years has been the fact that we are committed to a responsible capital structure. And as this company continues to generate a significant amount of cash, we are committed to distributing that excess cash to the benefit of our shareholders. It's important for me to emphasize that Sabrina and I are highly aligned on continuing that going forward while at the same time responsibly reinvesting in the business.
Sabrina, let me pass it to you."

As anticipated, our first quarter results were impacted by foreign exchange headwinds and delayed receipts due to the West Coast port issues.

As anticipated, our first quarter results were impacted by foreign exchange headwinds and delayed receipts due to the West Coast port issues. Despite these dynamics, we're pleased that Old Navy delivered another strong quarter on top of 3 years of growth. As Art mentioned, we're focused on taking the steps necessary to drive improvements and greater consistency in our other brands while continuing to make progress on our long-term objectives.
Operating income for the first quarter was $386 million versus $443 million last year. Net earnings were $239 million. On a reported basis, earnings per share were $0.56, down about 3% versus $0.58 last year. It's important to note that our reported earnings per share were negatively impacted by foreign exchange. We estimate that foreign exchange reduced our reported earnings per share growth rate by about 3 percentage points.
Sales for the first quarter were also impacted by foreign exchange and the port issues. As reported, first quarter sales were $3.7 billion, down 3% versus last year. The translation of foreign revenues into dollars negatively impacted our reported net sales by about $90 million in the first quarter. On a constant currency basis, net sales were down about 1%.
Regarding the port impact, there's no meaningful change to our first half estimate of $0.13. As a reminder, first quarter sales were impacted by having fewer units available for sale. We expect that second quarter will be impacted by late units that will likely be sold at lower margins. Total sales and comps by division are listed in our press release.
Moving to gross margin. First quarter gross margin was down 100 basis points to 37.8%. Merchandise margins were about flat, driven by strong performance at Old Navy, offset by the impact of foreign exchange as well as disappointing performance at Gap brand. Rent and occupancy deleveraged 100 basis points.
In the face of challenging sales performance, we managed SG&A tightly. First quarter total operating expenses were $996 million, down $27 million from the prior year, driven by foreign exchange favorability. Marketing expenses were down about $7 million versus last year to $136 million. As a percent of sales, total operating expenses were 27.2% and deleveraged about 10 basis points versus last year. As a reminder, in Q2, we will lap last year's gain on sale of nearly $40 million. Therefore, we expect greater deleverage in Q2 versus Q1.
Regarding the balance sheet and cash flow. Inventory dollars per store were up about 4% at end of the first quarter. As anticipated, delayed receipts due to the West Coast port situation resulted in higher in-transit inventory levels at the end of the first quarter. We expect year-over-year inventory dollars per store at the end of the second quarter to be up slightly versus last year as we focus on selling through these late receipts while trying to maximize margin. As a reminder, last year's inventory per store was up only 2% in Q2 versus up 7% at the end of Q1.
For the quarter, free cash flow was an inflow of $61 million. Underscoring our commitment to distribute excess cash to shareholders, we distributed more than 5x our free cash flow or $329 million this quarter. This includes $230 million to repurchase 5.6 million shares, resulting in a quarter end share count of 419 million.
Regarding capital expenditures and store count. First quarter capital expenditures were $150 million. We opened 29 company-operated stores on a net basis and ended the quarter with 3,309 stores. Store count and square footage are listed in our press release.
And now I'd like to share our outlook for the rest of the year. Our first quarter performance was broadly in line with our expectations at the time we provided our full year guidance in February. Therefore, we are reaffirming our full year earnings per share guidance range of $2.75 to $2.80. For the full year, all other guidance metrics remain substantially unchanged.
In closing, as we enter the second quarter, we will continue to focus on levers that we can control while we work to deliver compelling product assortments across all of our brands.
Thank you. And now I'll turn it back over to Jack."

We've diagnosed it because you can go in there and look at it. I spend time in stores. I talk to customers. I watch what customers buy. We look at our product's acceptance. And the issues are clear and have been clear for several seasons. And so -- and it is a combination of all of the above, which is we've got -- we are off-trend and in some cases way off the brand. We have some quality and fit issues, where we've made some choices. And the issue is that when the women's business -- which is why I'm focused on the women's business. When the women's business isn't working, it does, in a brand like Gap -- which is obviously dual gender and then whole family -- have a negative halo on the rest of the box. But we're actually getting very good customer feedback on our kids and baby business. The men's business continues to be relatively strong. And so it's why when I have been working with Jeff and the team, it's been prioritize the women's business because as it halos negatively when it's not working, it has the same halo effect positively when it is working. And I'm actually -- I'm pretty encouraged by what I see going forward. I can even look at the holiday assortment, which has largely landed now. And some of the sort of obvious mistakes that we've made, we have -- they're gone from the line. We've actually taken the step of canceling some styles that we have and we knew were just not salable, which is an appropriate thing to do as well and which we've been able to do. So from that standpoint, again, same thing I'm said before. Team, heads down, working on the women's assortment and getting it back on track as much as we can do in a holiday, acknowledging it was mostly bought and then spring being a no excuses moment."

And it's exactly the strategy that I followed back in 2011 when we looked forward down the pipeline, didn't feel good about the product and consequently pulled back on a lot of the working media spend that we had in place. And we're doing some of that now as well. The other side of that is, I'm feeling like we're really getting our returns in the marketing spend that we have at Old Navy. And when I can see the returns and it can help drive the business, I'm happy to put money into the business as well. So it's really about placing smart bets, not just sticking with the marketing plan or anything like that. So expect us to be tight. And as the product gets better, expect us to then start putting a little bit of pressure on the business. But you correctly have seen that we've pulled back, and we'll continue to do that until we feel like there's an opportunity to really tell the story. And then the second issue with us is -- and this is a topic broadly separate from the current performance of the business that both Sabrina and I are very focused on right now. We have, over a long period of time, generally spent more than many of the competitors out there in terms of marketing, and I think we should be getting more out of our marketing dollar than we are at the end of the day. Sabrina, do you want to add anything to that?"

And it also includes, by the way, I should say, Piperlime because we closed that in the quarter. And so we're not marketing behind that. And then with regard to the second quarter, I would just say, there's not going to be any radical change because it's likely to follow the same pattern as Q1. So I would look at something sort of starting at -- last year is a good starting point to the second quarter."

Old Navy is farthest ahead in realizing this with the changes that have taken place, obviously, and the challenges in the business at Gap, changes in leadership, challenges in the business, those 2 businesses lagged. Banana's probably in the middle and Gap is farthest behind. What I can say quite confidently is that as we have implemented it, it's very clear that it's having a positive impact and it's the right thing to do. And then the question really is scaling it and continuing to scale it as fast as we can. And so -- and we are using this in some cases to do exactly what we talked about with respect to a trend out there that we see or something like that. We'll put a set of silhouettes in, in bottoms and we'll see which sells and allows us to go cut more aggressively and respond more quickly into the silhouettes that are selling right now. And obviously in denim as an example, there's a lot of variation out there in terms of rise, in terms of leg silhouette and the novelty and being more responsive there. Knits is an easy one where we've also used that and particularly inside of Old Navy to be more responsive to where the knits business has really shown some real strength and put some volume behind it. So it's a clear capability. As I've said pretty publicly, we're in a business that we guess a lot and anything that we can do to minimize that guesses and guess better and inform it with data has a real positive impact on the business."

So we do have the benefit that if sales do not -- are not realized to the extent we'd like them to be, we have a natural variable component that comes down. So that's one piece that will always be in the works. With regard to sort of how we deliver the expense savings this quarter to help you think about how we would do it in future quarters, a chunk of it came from foreign exchange. So we called that out. And so we benefited probably between the translation and balance sheet remeasurement about $30 million of benefit. Even after that though, expenses were pretty close to last year, so very tight. And that comes primarily from this variable component I talked about, as well as we brought that marketing down a little bit by $7 million. And so we would continue to use those levers that are variable or discretionary, like marketing. Q2, I just want to call out again, is a very different dynamic because we leveraged last year in Q2 by 190 basis points. So just from a sheer uptick perspective, that includes the gain on sale of $40 million last year. So we're going to be lapping that. And then we layer on really kicking in, in June the wage increase. So the deleverage we would expect to be higher in Q2 just because of what we're anniversary-ing such high leverage. But we will, behind the scenes, continue to work all the levers we have at our disposal to manage our expenses very tightly, especially if we're not realizing the sales we would expect."

I think and I hope what you're seeing and what you're believing is that you put that much consistency in place 3 years, multiple quarters back-to-back and there's a reason behind that. And there is a reason behind that. And it is, it starts with obviously Stefan and his team, which is a really good team working well together. But the much more important thing behind the scenes is that team living inside of a very disciplined process and a set of process changes that is allowing for the consistency. Again, I say this often publicly that it's relatively easy to have a great quarter. What is superlatively hard in this industry is to put quarter-after-quarter together and then year-after-year. And so we have a lot of confidence there in the processes and capabilities that we've built. It starts with what we think is a really great process right at the beginning, which filters trend, really systematically across a wide variety of sources, filters trend down to the right ones that we feel are brand right and appropriately commercial for Old Navy. And it's allowed us to be in trends that are happening at the same time in the designer and the premium contemporary space. It's allowed us to be into those trends in Old Navy almost in a simultaneous way, which really is the way the world is working right now. And so that ability to be right and to respond very quickly is powerful. And then if you just go down into the system, there's a really -- I think a really disciplined and structured management of the assortment that we're running as well right now, which allows us to maintain the proper amount of newness entering the portfolio, but also have a super solid set of styles that are proven, that we can invest in over several seasons to help us really drive the commercial plan of the business. Yes, I guess the way I'd think about it is that a healthy business is a business that's gaining market share. And Old Navy has now demonstrated its ability to hunt and win that market share pretty consistently for a number of quarters running. So I won't say that this is going to be perfect every time because it's tough in this industry with fashion, but I do have a great deal of confidence in the system and process that we've built there. And it's obviously why we are working very aggressively with Jeff and his team and Andi and her team to almost do turnkey installation of some of these components into the other businesses as well. And yes, we'll see the results there on a going-forward basis, but I've been really pleased with what we're seeing with Old Navy and really confident with what we see going forward."

As a reminder, we're also dealing with this year headwinds within the gross margin line due to foreign exchange. So that's just part of what we laid out at the early part of the year for everyone to understand because we have that very large Japan and Canada business. Then other than that, I will tell you, once we're past the first half port impact, of course, we'll be heads down on trying to deliver the healthiest margin we can. And we will ultimately continue to use all of our levers to try and put up the best value that we can every quarter. So we'll see how that works out."

The second issue is fix as much of the product as we can that is in the pipeline and deliver spring, spring women's product in a brand-appropriate, trend-appropriate way. And then the third is rebuilding the product processes. So there are a lot of plates spinning right now inside of Jeff's world, but he and I both feel very strongly that we can't wait. So we're working these things simultaneously. If you think about some of the key elements of the process, one is very simply the length of the pipeline. And Old Navy has been running on a shorter pipeline for a while. And Gap is developing on that pipeline now as we speak. And then there is the trend process, the assortment architecture, the supply chain capabilities, a number of other things as well which we're layering in. Quite honestly, Jeff and I are sitting here and saying, ""How much can we throw at the organization and how fast can we push?"" But we are pushing pretty hard and pretty fast. Spring will come to market with a shorter pipeline, but it's going to be a hybrid really of the way they've traditionally brought it to market and the new process that we've built. We'll then get more and more up to speed on the new platform as we go through product development for 2016 and the outlying seasons. Yes, I can't tell you exactly when there's going to be a light's on moment of this revealing itself because it was at Old Navy and it is in both Banana and Gap more of a progressive rebuild, but some the key elements are already in place right now."

And our issue with AUR as a company has been our inconsistency in our ability to achieve AUR. Again, inside of Stefan's business, there has been an opportunity that they've had, and they have demonstrated their ability to mostly out of mix, really not out of make at the end of the day. I mean, one of the things that's really cool about what's going on in Old Navy is that they are able, in many cases, to achieve cost reductions, an elevated sense of quality and a mix up all at the same time with some AUR. Now it's in selective categories. So this is one where Sabrina and I are absolutely in lockstep, which is to be -- to put AUR and look for AUR on the basis of mix and track record. Because it's proved to be way too elusive at times, not just for us, but for other people in this industry. And then the other side of AUR, having nothing to do really with the make of the product or AUC is just getting off of the depth of the promotions that we've had in some parts of the company. And frankly, in my view, that's probably a much bigger AUR opportunity in the near to medium term than any fundamental changes in product mix or product make. We've been very heavily discounted, as you know. And in some cases, overbought in areas where the product is not registering, and that's a tough spot to be. So a second part of Gap is to really make sure that we are buying holiday and spring in exactly the right way. And again, I've said publicly that I have a pretty strong bias towards always modestly underbuying a season and looking for upside in AUR versus trying to force a lot of units through the system."

And then you see that we try and get back with the guidance at Q2 of getting back to tighter inventories, slightly up. And the reason we're giving ourselves a little bit of wiggle room is with those late inventories coming in, we don't want to do anything unnatural if goods aren't really liable to just force the sell-through to get to an EOQ, but it's still fairly tight when you think about it to be slightly up when last year we're lapping only an up 2%.

And after I am done, I'll hand it over to Sabrina Simmons, who will take you through the specific detail. And obviously, we'll have Q&A at the end of this call.
We'll talk about our first quarter results, and I'll go a little bit deeper into what's been going on over the last 3 months. There are 3 issues that really impacted the first quarter, 2 of those are macro factors, which we've spoken to you about before in terms of foreign exchange and the West Coast port situation. Sabrina will spend a little bit more time on that. I really want to dive in on the underlying results of our 3 global brands, and specifically, the performance of our women's businesses. As we've said, and we continue to see, we've had an exceptionally well-performing women's business at Old Navy, which has driven great profitable growth. Product acceptance at Gap in the women's business has been tough, and we're focused on making it happen. And at Banana Republic, it's a work in process, and we have work to do there as well.
Let me start first by spending a few minutes on Old Navy. Obviously, it's a very good story. A story that we're very pleased with and a story that we have confidence in and is going to continue to repeat itself on a going-forward basis. Three years of excellent performance and most importantly, underneath the covers, growth that is being driven in a very high-quality way with a very nice margin story underneath it. Q1 comp was a women's story, and I'm saying that in particular because as we have struggled with our women's business in Gap as an example, Old Navy is an excellent example where we continue to get women's right, season after season, and we're very pleased with the performance that we're seeing with on-brand, on-trend product in our stores. 
I need to point out that this is a combination of factors. It is clearly a team working well together, led by Stefan, that is delivering this performance, but it's also underlying process changes that we have made in the way that we're running the business and the way that we're bringing product to market that is delivering the consistency that we're seeing.
I've mentioned this before, but I need to mention it again, which is, we are taking these changes. And in some cases, largely transplanting them into our other businesses in that they are proven inside of Old Navy and they have been delivering this kind of performance. Again, we have a strong women's business there, but it's been followed by a pretty strong business inside the rest of the box as well, across men's, kids and baby. And it's a thing of beauty when Old Navy is firing on all cylinders. It has now for several seasons running.
On the flip side, I continue to be disappointed, but not surprised, by Gap's performance. We have had a women's business challenge now for several seasons running. I believe we have diagnosed it correctly, having to do with being off-brand, in some cases off-trend, and I can promise you that the team is all over it. In the last call that we had, I mentioned the hiring of Wendi Goldman. Wendi has hit the ground running. She is a highly collaborative, skilled leader working with the team. And I've been really pleased so far of the results the whole team is producing as they have focused on holiday and obviously on spring.
Jeff really has 3 priorities right now, and I want to underline and emphasize those to you. We are in-season every day, and we're managing the business as aggressively as we can to get every penny out of the business. In relative terms, kids and baby is performing better and men's is performing better. But to be clear, I am not happy, and Jeff is not happy with the entire performance of the brand, and we're committed to turning it around.
On top of managing in season, we're obviously working extremely hard to make every improvement that we can to the outlying seasons, including holiday and most importantly, spring. On top of that, I said I was impatient, we are working very hard to change the product processes -- all of what we're doing in Old Navy -- in order to get Gap to a more consistent on-trend, on-brand footing. And I have to say, much of the work that the team has done there to realign the team on the aesthetic of the brand is very, very encouraging.
Banana Republic is a mixed bag. This was Marissa's first collection showing up later in the quarter. It's had a couple of very positive impacts in terms of reestablishing some fashion credibility for the brand and the relevance of the brand, but we didn't get it 100% right. And this is not to be excused, but perhaps expected as you're bringing a new designer and a new leadership team together. The color palette was pretty stark between black and white, not enough color and print and pattern for the season that we're in, and we're still working to buy an assortment that is both commercial and fashion-oriented. Relatively speaking, the men's business is stronger, and it's not that the women's business is weak, but we have not hit the stride nor delivered the commercial results while at the same time we have established some fashion credibility. And that's our job, and we're focused on making it happen.
In a moment, I'll turn it over to Sabrina. What I wanted to do was offer a few comments in advance about how Sabrina and I are working together and the commitment that we very much share together. Obviously, a big part of our story over the last several years has been the fact that we are committed to a responsible capital structure. And as this company continues to generate a significant amount of cash, we are committed to distributing that excess cash to the benefit of our shareholders. It's important for me to emphasize that Sabrina and I are highly aligned on continuing that going forward while at the same time responsibly reinvesting in the business.
Sabrina, let me pass it to you."

As anticipated, our first quarter results were impacted by foreign exchange headwinds and delayed receipts due to the West Coast port issues. Despite these dynamics, we're pleased that Old Navy delivered another strong quarter on top of 3 years of growth. As Art mentioned, we're focused on taking the steps necessary to drive improvements and greater consistency in our other brands while continuing to make progress on our long-term objectives.
Operating income for the first quarter was $386 million versus $443 million last year. Net earnings were $239 million. On a reported basis, earnings per share were $0.56, down about 3% versus $0.58 last year. It's important to note that our reported earnings per share were negatively impacted by foreign exchange. We estimate that foreign exchange reduced our reported earnings per share growth rate by about 3 percentage points.
Sales for the first quarter were also impacted by foreign exchange and the port issues. As reported, first quarter sales were $3.7 billion, down 3% versus last year. The translation of foreign revenues into dollars negatively impacted our reported net sales by about $90 million in the first quarter. On a constant currency basis, net sales were down about 1%.
Regarding the port impact, there's no meaningful change to our first half estimate of $0.13. As a reminder, first quarter sales were impacted by having fewer units available for sale. We expect that second quarter will be impacted by late units that will likely be sold at lower margins. Total sales and comps by division are listed in our press release.
Moving to gross margin. First quarter gross margin was down 100 basis points to 37.8%. Merchandise margins were about flat, driven by strong performance at Old Navy, offset by the impact of foreign exchange as well as disappointing performance at Gap brand. Rent and occupancy deleveraged 100 basis points.
In the face of challenging sales performance, we managed SG&A tightly. First quarter total operating expenses were $996 million, down $27 million from the prior year, driven by foreign exchange favorability. Marketing expenses were down about $7 million versus last year to $136 million. As a percent of sales, total operating expenses were 27.2% and deleveraged about 10 basis points versus last year. As a reminder, in Q2, we will lap last year's gain on sale of nearly $40 million. Therefore, we expect greater deleverage in Q2 versus Q1.
Regarding the balance sheet and cash flow. Inventory dollars per store were up about 4% at the end of the first quarter. As anticipated, delayed receipts due to the West Coast port situation resulted in higher in-transit inventory levels at the end of the first quarter. We expect year-over-year inventory dollars per store at the end of the second quarter to be up slightly versus last year as we focus on selling through these late receipts while trying to maximize margin. As a reminder, last year's inventory per store was up only 2% in Q2 versus up 7% at the end of Q1.
For the quarter, free cash flow was an inflow of $61 million. Underscoring our commitment to distribute excess cash to shareholders, we distributed more than 5x our free cash flow or $329 million this quarter. This includes $230 million to repurchase 5.6 million shares, resulting in a quarter end share count of 419 million.
Regarding capital expenditures and store count. First quarter capital expenditures were $150 million. We opened 29 company-operated stores on a net basis and ended the quarter with 3,309 stores. Store count and square footage are listed in our press release.
And now I'd like to share our outlook for the rest of the year. Our first quarter performance was broadly in line with our expectations at the time we provided our full year guidance in February. Therefore, we are reaffirming our full year earnings per share guidance range of $2.75 to $2.80. For the full year, all other guidance metrics remain substantially unchanged.
In closing, as we enter the second quarter, we will continue to focus on levers that we can control while we work to deliver compelling product assortments across all of our brands.

I think that we've been -- and I've been pretty consistent in talking about, which is, we know we have a problem in the women's business. We've diagnosed it. We've diagnosed it because you can go in there and look at it. I spend time in stores. I talk to customers. I watch what customers buy. We look at our product's acceptance. And the issues are clear and have been clear for several seasons. And so -- and it is a combination of all of the above, which is we've got -- we are off-trend and in some cases way off the brand. We have some quality and fit issues, where we've made some choices. And the issue is that when the women's business -- which is why I'm focused on the women's business. When the women's business isn't working, it does, in a brand like Gap -- which is obviously dual gender and then whole family -- have a negative halo on the rest of the box. But we're actually getting very good customer feedback on our kids and baby business. The men's business continues to be relatively strong. And so it's why when I have been working with Jeff and the team, it's been prioritize the women's business because as it halos negatively when it's not working, it has the same halo effect positively when it is working. And I'm actually -- I'm pretty encouraged by what I see going forward. I can even look at the holiday assortment, which has largely landed now. And some of the sort of obvious mistakes that we've made, we have -- they're gone from the line. We've actually taken the step of canceling some styles that we have and we knew were just not salable, which is an appropriate thing to do as well and which we've been able to do. So from that standpoint, again, same thing I'm saying before. Team, heads down, working on the women's assortment and getting it back on track as much as we can do in a holiday, acknowledging it was mostly bought and then spring being a no excuses moment."

And it's exactly the strategy that I followed back in 2011 when we looked forward down the pipeline, didn't feel good about the product and consequently pulled back on a lot of the working media spend that we had in place. And we're doing some of that now as well. The other side of that is, I'm feeling like we're really getting our returns in the marketing spend that we have at Old Navy. And when I can see the returns and it can help drive the business, I'm happy to put money into the business as well. So it's really about placing smart bets, not just sticking with the marketing plan or anything like that. So expect us to be tight. And as the product gets better, expect us to then start putting a little bit of pressure on the business. But you correctly have seen that we've pulled back, and we'll continue to do that until we feel like there's an opportunity to really tell the story. And then the second issue is, is -- and this is a topic broadly separate from the current performance of the business that both Sabrina and I are very focused on right now. We have, over a long period of time, generally spent more than many of the competitors out there in terms of marketing, and I think we should be getting more out of our marketing dollar than we are at the end of the day. Sabrina, do you want to add anything to that?"

Old Navy is farthest ahead in realizing this with the changes that have taken place, obviously, and the challenges in the business at Gap, changes in leadership, challenges in the business, those 2 businesses lagged. Banana's probably in the middle and Gap is farthest behind. What I can say quite confidently is that as we have implemented it, it's very clear that it's having a positive impact and it's the right thing to do. And then the question really is scaling it and continuing to scale it as fast as we can. And so -- and we are using this in some cases to do exactly what you talked about with respect to a trend out there that we see or something like that. We'll put a set of silhouettes in, in bottoms and we'll see which sells and allows us to go cut more aggressively and respond more quickly into the silhouettes that are selling right now. And obviously in denim as an example, there's a lot of variation out there in terms of rise, in terms of leg silhouette and the novelty and being more responsive there. Knits is an easy one where we've also used that and particularly inside of Old Navy to be more responsive to where the knits business has really shown some real strength and put some volume behind it. So it's a clear capability. As I've said pretty publicly, we're in a business that we guess a lot and anything that we can do to minimize that guesses and guess better and inform it with data has a real positive impact on the business."

So we do have the benefit that if sales do not -- are not realized to the extent we'd like them to be, we have a natural variable component that comes down. So that's one piece that will always be in the works. With regard to sort of how we deliver the expense savings this quarter to help you think about how we would do it in future quarters, a chunk of it came from foreign exchange. So we called that out. And so we benefited probably between the translation and balance sheet remeasurement about $30 million of benefit. Even after that though, expenses were pretty close to last year, so very tight. And that comes primarily from this variable component I talked about, as well as we brought that marketing down a little bit by $7 million. And so we would continue to use those levers that are variable or discretionary, like marketing. Q2, I just want to call out again, is a very different dynamic because we leveraged last year in Q2 by 190 basis points. So just from a sheer optic perspective, that includes the gain on sale of $40 million last year. So we're going to be lapping that. And then we layer on really kicking in, in June the wage increase. So the deleverage we would expect to be higher in Q2 just because of what we're anniversary-ing such high leverage. But we will, behind the scenes, continue to work all the levers we have at our disposal to manage our expenses very tightly, especially if we're not realizing the sales we would expect."

I think and I hope what you're seeing and what you're believing is that you put that much consistency in place 3 years, multiple quarters back-to-back and there's a reason behind that. And there is a reason behind that. And it is, it starts with obviously Stefan and his team, which is a really good team working well together. But the much more important thing behind the scenes is that team living inside of a very disciplined process and a set of process changes that is allowing for the consistency. Again, I say this often publicly that it's relatively easy to have a great quarter. What is superlatively hard in this industry is to put quarter-after-quarter together and then year-after-year. And so we have a lot of confidence there in the processes and capabilities that we've built. It starts with what we think is a really great process right at the beginning, which filters trend, really systematically across a wide variety of sources, filters trend down to the right ones that we feel are brand right and appropriately commercial for Old Navy. And it's allowed us to be in trends that are happening at the same time in the designer and the premium contemporary space. It's allowed us to be into those trends in Old Navy almost in a simultaneous way, which really is the way the world is working right now. And so that ability to be right and to respond very quickly is powerful. And then if you just go down into the system, there's a really -- I think a really disciplined and structured management of the assortment that we're running as well right now, which allows us to maintain the proper amount of newness entering the portfolio, but also have a super solid set of styles that are proven, that we can invest in over several seasons to help us really drive the commercial plan of the business. Yes, I guess the way I'd think about it is that a healthy business is a business that's gaining market share. And Old Navy has now demonstrated its ability to hunt and win that market share pretty consistently for a number of quarters running. So I won't say that this is going to be perfect every time because it's tough in this industry with fashion, but I do have a great deal of confidence in the system and process that we've built there. And it's obviously why we are working very aggressively with Jeff and his team and Andi and her team to almost do turnkey installation of some of these components into the other businesses as well. And yes, we'll see the results there on a going-forward basis, but I've been really pleased with what we're seeing with Old Navy and really confident with what we see going forward."

So we're working these things simultaneously. If you think about some of the key elements of the process, one is very simply the length of the pipeline. And Old Navy has been running on a shorter pipeline for a while. And Gap is developing on that pipeline now as we speak. And then there is the trend process, the assortment architecture, the supply chain capabilities, a number of other things as well which we're layering in. Quite honestly, Jeff and I are sitting here and saying, ""How much can we throw at the organization and how fast can we push?"" But we are pushing pretty hard and pretty fast. Spring will come to market with a shorter pipeline, but it's going to be a hybrid really of the way they've traditionally brought it to market and the new process that we've built. We'll then get more and more up to speed on the new platform as we go through product development for 2016 and the outlying seasons.

And our issue with AUR as a company has been our inconsistency in our ability to achieve AUR. Again, inside of Stefan's business, there has been an opportunity that they've had, and they have demonstrated their ability to mostly out of mix, really not out of make at the end of the day. I mean, one of the things that's really cool about what's going on in Old Navy is that they are able, in many cases, to achieve cost reductions, an elevated sense of quality and a mix up all at the same time with some AUR. Now it's in selective categories. So this is one where Sabrina and I are absolutely in lockstep, which is to be -- to put AUR and look for AUR on the basis of mix and track record. Because it's proved to be way too elusive at times, not just for us, but for other people in this industry. And then the other side of AUR, having nothing to do really with the make of the product or AUC is just getting off of the depth of the promotions that we've had in some parts of the company. And frankly, in my view, that's probably a much bigger AUR opportunity in the near to medium term than any fundamental changes in product mix or product make. We've been very heavily discounted, as you know. And in some cases, overbought in areas where the product is not registering, and that's a tough spot to be. So a second part of Gap is to really make sure that we are buying holiday and spring in exactly the right way. And again, I've said publicly that I have a pretty strong bias towards always modestly underbuying a season and looking for upside in AUR versus trying to force a lot of units through the system."

And I would say, we're pretty much there excluding this port issue that puts us up, up 4%. And then you see that we try and get back with the guidance at Q2 of getting back to tighter inventories, slightly up. And the reason we're giving ourselves a little bit of wiggle room is with those late inventories coming in, we don't want to do anything unnatural if goods aren't really liable to just force the sell-through to get to an EOQ, but it's still fairly tight when you think about it to be slightly up when last year we're lapping only an up 2%.

I'm really going to focus on the back half of the year and as we get into 2016. And we are making progress on the journey that I've articulated to you in the work that's going on at Gap and at Banana Republic. 
Let me start with Old Navy and then I'll talk a bit about the other brands as well. Pleased with Old Navy's performance. I see strength as I look into the back half. Obviously, we look at all the products as we go through the months and very pleased with where the women's business is, as well as the other businesses that surround women's at the end of the day. Active has been a strength that they continue to build. We now have an Active expression that sits across the entire family. As I look out into September and October, I think, the fall product for Old Navy is going to be right in the sweet spot of what's on-brand, on trend and a great value proposition. And I'm excited about that they can do for this company in the back half. 
Old Navy's consistency continues to be a thing of beauty. It sits on a platform of product process that they have built over the last couple of years and now are pretty relentlessly executing season after season. It's those same product processes that we are pretty far along now in installing in Gap and Banana Republic. And as I've said before, Old Navy remains our proof point for building product, executing trend, delivering on-brand, on quality, on-fit product consistently for the rest of the company. 
We see a very long run way of growth for Old Navy. They've gained roughly $1 billion of market share over the course of the last 3 years. They are continuing to build out their response on supply chain capabilities, platforming fabric, becoming faster and faster and responding to consumer needs and I'm very pleased with the progress that Stephan and the team have made and the outlook that we see for the back half and 2016. 
Let me then turn to Gap. The steps that I have laid out with Jeff, as we focus on getting the business back on track, first of all, obviously, started with recruiting the team around Jeff. And that is now largely done. Since I spoke to you last, Steven [indiscernible] has joined as Head of Global Merchandising. Stephen is a talent and we are very pleased to have him. That team has been focused obviously on spring of 2016 and I'm confident that they have been doing the right work to get the business back on track as we get into next year. 
2 [ph] weeks ago, I was in New York with the entire team. We did a full style level, on figure review of the adult assortments. I saw terrific progress in terms of re-centering on what the brand equities are. On fit, on quality, on femininity, on optimism, they are hallmarks of what Gap brand is all about. 
I'm not going to stand up at the plate and call which fans we're going to hit it over, that's not who I am. But I'm confident that Gap will make significant progress in spring and very pleased with what I've seen in the women's assortment and the turnaround in the women's assortment. 
While being focused on getting the spring women's assortment back on track, which the team has been spending most of their energy on and they've now obviously turned to summer, at the same time, they've been rebuilding the product processes inside the business and I've referred to this before using Old Navy as the template, built more responsive capabilities, platformed much of the fabric and I'm very encouraged by what these capabilities will be able to deliver for us as we go into 2016. For the first time, we will be going to in-season open in some of our key product programs and therefore, able to get back in after we read the business in season with significant quantities of units. This is obviously an important capability for us. We're building this across the entire company and it's great to see Jeff and the team make progress like this as quickly as they have. 
Let me, for a moment, just address the strategic actions that we announced we were going to be taking when we last spoke with you. 
I'm really pleased with the progress that Jeff and the team have made. We will have stores being closed over the course of this year. But the work on restructuring the business, on working with our landlords to make sure that this was an orderly process, has largely been done. And what that does is it gives the team the ability to really now focus on the business going forward. 
Let me turn for just a moment to Banana Republic. It's not a space where I spent a lot of time talking to you in our last couple of calls. So I want to spend a moment there and give you my perspective as to what we're looking at in the back half and as we get into 2016. 
I'm really confident with the design point of view that we have in the business. Actually, I like the team underneath Melissa. It's really centered on the aesthetic of the brand, really on the sweet spot of what Banana is and should be. And I'm confident that we have a significant opportunity as we get into the latter half of this year and next year to really drive the business through merchandising as well. I feel like we can support our big ideas and there are several of the pipeline. And buy the line in a way they can buy the business. And I'm really excited to see what this brand can do as we get into the end of the year and into 2016. 
Let me turn last to China. And obviously, over the last, even couple of weeks, there's been a lot of news coming out of China. And it's an important area of long-term growth for us. I was in China just a few weeks ago, spent a week with the team, in stores, in several cities. And quite simply, I and we are continuing to be very bullish on our opportunity in China. We'll process the currency devaluation, the team is working on that right now. I don't see that really giving us any significant headwinds as we think about the continued growth of the China business. We continue to look at a very robust store pipeline there as well. Our outlet business continues to grow in China. And so really, as far as I'm concerned, no change in strategy, no change in direction, no change in intensity, as we continue to look at China as a significant long-term growth opportunity for the company. 
So before I close, I would just like to address the fact that there's a lot of noise really out there right now around the apparel sector. And just so you know my perspective, I shuted out because from where I sit, across all of our businesses, our job is to deliver regardless of the noise that's out there today. And what I see is I see a consumer who has confidence. I see dollars being spent. And I see an opportunity for us to continue to get more than our fair share as I look forward. And I am very optimistic, even though the work that's going on inside of Gap and Banana and the continued consistency that I see at Old Navy, very optimistic about what I see in front of us. 
Now let me turn it over to Sabrina"
274265,309026595,861540,"The Gap, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 20, 2015",2015-08-20,"Earnings Calls","The Gap, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Art. Good afternoon everyone. As anticipated, our results were impacted by foreign exchange, West Coast port issues and our previously announced strategic actions primarily related to Gap brand. Given the number of unique factors impacting fina",775,"Thank you, Art. Good afternoon everyone. As anticipated, our results were impacted by foreign exchange, West Coast port issues and our previously announced strategic actions primarily related to Gap brand. Given the number of unique factors impacting financial results, I'm going to zoom out and quickly speak to a first half results on a normalized basis. 
Beginning with foreign exchange. In the first half, foreign exchange negatively impacted earnings per share by $0.06. With the accelerated weakening of the yen and Canadian dollar, the FX impact of $0.04 to Q2 was larger than Q1. 
With regard to the West Coast port situation. The first half impact of the port delays was about $0.13, in line with our original estimate but slightly weighted toward Q2. 
And finally, the charges associated with our strategic actions, which were publicly disclosed in mid-June, totaled about $95 million in the first half or about $0.14. As a reminder, these charges primarily include costs associated with lease buyouts, asset impairments and employee-related costs. Excluding these items, our underlying business delivered adjusted earnings per share growth of 12% over last year. We're pleased that despite our product challenges at Gap and Banana Republic, we were able to use all of our levers to achieve this respectable underlying earnings per share growth in the first half. 
Turning now to the second quarter performance. On a constant-currency basis, net sales were about flat. Foreign exchange negatively impacted our reported net sales by about $100 million in the second quarter. As reported, net sales were $3.9 billion, down 2% versus last year. Total sales in comps by division are in our press release. 
Moving to gross margin. Second quarter gross margin was down 200 basis points to 37.4%. Rent and occupancy deleveraged 40 basis points. Merchandise margin deleveraged 160 basis points and was negatively impacted by both the ports and foreign exchange. 
With regard to SG&A. We continue to manage expenses tightly. Second quarter total operating expenses were $1.1 billion, including about $70 million of charges associated with our strategic actions and about a $30 million benefit from foreign exchange. Excluding these items and last year's gain on sale, adjusted SG&A dollars were about flat year-over-year. Marketing expenses were down $11 million to $131 million. 
Turning to earnings. Excluding the negative impact from strategic actions, which was about $0.12, earnings per share were $0.64 or $0.52 on a reported basis. 
Regarding the balance sheet and cash flow. Inventory dollars per store were up 1% at the end of the second quarter, in line with our guidance. Year-to-date, free cash flow was an inflow of $341 million. Consistent with our opportunistic approach, we're pleased to have spent over $600 million on share repurchases year-to-date. In the second quarter alone, we spent over $375 million repurchasing 10 million shares. Including our dividend, year-to-date shareholder distributions totaled about $800 million. We ended the quarter with a share count of 410 million and a cash balance of $1 billion. 
Regarding capital expenditures and store count. Year-to-date, capital expenditures were about $300 million. On a net basis, we opened 29 company-operated stores year-to-date, including 40 Gap brand closures. We ended the quarter with 3,309 stores. 
And now I'd like to share our outlook for the rest of the year. Given that our first half performance was within the scenarios embedded in our initial full year outlook, we are reaffirming our full year earnings per share guidance range of $2.75 to $2.80. This range excludes the charges associated with our strategic actions. With regard to those actions, we now estimate the charges to be around $130 million to $140 million. Excluding the cost associated with our strategic actions, we continue to expect operating margins to be down about 1 point versus 2014, driven by the negative impact from foreign exchange, the first half port issues and last year's gain on sale. 
While we continue to pursue our growth initiatives in Asia and domestically with Athleta, given our Gap brand closures, we now anticipate store count and square footage to be about flat for the year. 
Regarding inventory, we expect third quarter inventory to be down slightly. For the full year, all of our guidance metrics remain substantially unchanged. 
In closing, while the business experienced challenges in the first half, we are pleased to have delivered underlying EPS growth of 12% and to have distributed about $800 million to shareholders, underscoring our commitment to returning excess cash. As we enter the third quarter, we'll continue to focus on levers that we can control and advance initiatives that will drive future improvements. Thank you and I will turn it back over to Jack."

There's always opportunities to work more productively and efficiently in the business. As a reminder, a large part of our expense base is variable to sales, whether it's per unit because of DC cost or whether it's related and variable to store cost, a large piece is variable. So of course, when sales are increasing, we would expect nominal dollars to increase. But if they're not increasing, then we do our very best since we've been demonstrating to be responsible and to hold all of our other discretionary and overhead items very tightly, combined with the natural benefit we get from the variable piece. So that's that piece. So with regard to the balance sheet, let me see if I can remember your questions. I know one was on cash. And so we still target roughly between $1 billion and $1.2 billion as our cash on balance sheet target. And we ended with $1 billion. So we're very comfortable with where we ended the quarter. And then with regard to our ratios. I would say broadly speaking, we like being an investment-grade credit, it gives us a lot of flexibility in our business and we have fought hard for those.

And so that's been a particular focus in side of Banana and a particular focus in side of Gap. And it doesn't always come for free. But it doesn't always come with a cost either. And so you can easily choose a yarn and a sweater that's actually more expensive because of the hand feel that it delivers but it's the yarn that's going to be our appealing standards and therefore for the customer, it's a lower quality experience. And so, this is something that's on my radar. I've it mentioned before. It's on the radar of the teams for both of those brands as well as Old Navy. The customer has a quality expectation that's an opportunity for us. And so you should expect to see some of that in the back half of the year.

So at a high level, as a reminder, for our legal entities that do business outside of the United States. And the biggest businesses I'll focus on again for us are Japan and Canada because those two together are really our biggest currency exposure because we have about $2 billion worth of sales between those two countries. The -- unfortunately, those currencies have continued to depreciate. So we hedge of course. They -- those operations are in local currency and they buy the vast majority of their cost of goods in U.S. dollars. So they're exposed to the depreciation of their currency. And we hedge for them 12 to 18 months forward to give: A, our merchants and our team certainty around what the cost of sales is; but also obviously, it eases the impact of the depreciation of the currencies. Now it doesn't prevent the depreciation of the currencies ultimately hitting us, it only delays it. So with the continuation of the depreciation of yen and the CAD in particular, we're probably going to expect continuing headwinds into '16. Now currencies are really volatile. We'll see when we get there and we'll talk more about that obviously in our Q4 call, when we finish doing most of our hedging and have our budgets done. But I would say, from where we sit today, given the way the currencies have moved, we're going to probably continue to feel headwinds maybe around the same magnitude, hopefully not, but maybe around the same magnitude as we have this year."

And you guys might remember, we had a fall campaign for Gap last year which were not anniversarying, so we're probably going to be down some because of that alone and also the absence of Piperlime, I mean, no other dramatic changes and we might even invest a little more in other brands like Old Navy.

Nonetheless, thing, one that I feel pretty strongly about just the best marketing is good product and if I look at Gap as an example, we drove a strong business back a couple of years ago, in the spring of 2012 with modest marketing but exceptional product. And so what I can say is that as we feel better about the product, that will help us think about the marketing that we're willing to put behind it. But I do believe that your marketing should lag good products and that a lot of what will drive the balance of the business is good products in the stores which then puts some marketing behind in maybe the next period. So we're managing it very carefully. And again, as Sabrina said, too soon to talk about what we're going to do in Q4, it's not really there yet."

With regard to the impact of the store closures on ROD, I would say it's not going to be that meaningful. And the reason is you recall that -- the stores we're closing, are mostly in the lower quality centers. And in those centers, we actually had pretty favorable rents. So when we take those out of the portfolio, it doesn't really help your ROD leverage much because as a percent to rent, that wasn't the issue with the stores. It was more brand positioning with those stores."

But if you look at Gap, where do I expect bounce as we're getting the aesthetic, on trend quality, et cetera, on track? You can just look at the public data and see where we've given up market share. Knits is a big category in women's where we gave up market share. It's a knit cycle right now. It is an opportunity for us to get our share and more than our fair share. Denim is coming back which is a place that powers the brand and I believe we have really good product development in the pipeline. And those are two big categories for the brand. Those will always be brand drivers for Gap. And so I'll just stop there at the moment. But that's -- the team has been focused across the entire assortment that to be able to ride the balance in denim and then reclaim and more so, our fair share in knits is a big opportunity for us."

I'm really going to focus on the back half of the year and as we get into 2016. We are making progress on the journey that I've articulated to you in the work that's going on at Gap and at Banana Republic.
Let me start with Old Navy and then I'll talk a bit about the other brands as well. Pleased with Old Navy's performance. I see strength as I look into the back half. Obviously, we look at all the products as we go through the months and very pleased with where the women's business is, as well as the other businesses that surround women's at the end of the day. Active has been a strength that they continue to build. We now have an Active expression that sits across the entire family. As I look out into September and October, I think the fall product for Old Navy is going to be right in the sweet spot of what's on-brand, on-trend and a great value proposition. And I'm excited about that they can do for this company in the back half.
Old Navy's consistency continues to be a thing of beauty. It sits on a platform of product process that they have built over the last couple of years and now are pretty relentlessly executing season after season. It's those same product processes that we are pretty far along now in installing in Gap and Banana Republic. And as I've said before, Old Navy remains our proof point for building product, executing trend, delivering on-brand, on-quality, on-fit product consistently for the rest of the company.
We see a very long run way of growth for Old Navy. They've gained roughly $1 billion of market share over the course of the last 3 years. They are continuing to build out their responsive supply chain capabilities, platforming fabric, becoming faster and faster in responding to consumer needs, and I'm very pleased with the progress that Stefan and the team have made and the outlook that we see for the back half and 2016.
Let me then turn to Gap. The steps that I have laid out with Jeff, as we focus on getting the business back on track, first of all, obviously, started with recruiting the team around Jeff. And that is now largely done. Since I spoke to you last, Steven Sare has joined as Head of Global Merchandising. Steven is a talent and we're very pleased to have him. That team has been focused obviously on spring of 2016, and I'm confident that they have been doing the right work to get the business back on track as we get into next year. 
3 weeks ago, I was in New York with the entire team. We did a full style level, on-figure review of the adult assortments. I saw terrific progress in terms of recentering on what the brand equities are. On fit, on quality, on femininity, on optimism, they are hallmarks of what Gap brand is all about.
I'm not going to stand up at the plate and call which fence we're going to hit it over, that's not who I am. But I'm confident that Gap will make significant progress in spring and very pleased with what I've seen in the women's assortment and the turnaround in the women's assortment.
While being focused on getting the spring women's assortment back on track, which the team has been spending most of their energy on and they've now obviously turned to summer, at the same time, they've been rebuilding the product processes inside the business. And I've referred to this before using Old Navy as the template, built more responsive capabilities, platformed much of the fabric, and I'm very encouraged by what these capabilities will be able to deliver for us as we get into 2016. For the first time, we will be going to in-season open in some of our key product programs and therefore, able to get back in after we read the business in season with significant quantities of units. This is obviously an important capability for us. We're building this across the entire company, and it's great to see Jeff and the team make progress like this as quickly as they have.
Let me, for a moment, just address the strategic actions that we announced we were going to be taking when we last spoke with you.
I'm really pleased with the progress that Jeff and the team have made. We will have stores being closed over the course of this year. But the work on restructuring the business, on working with our landlords to make sure that this was an orderly process, has largely been done. And what that does is it gives the team the ability to really now focus on the business going forward.
Let me turn for just a moment to Banana Republic. It's not a place where I spent a lot of time talking to you in our last couple of calls. So I want to spend a moment there and give you my perspective as to what we're looking at in the back half and as we get into 2016.
I'm really confident with the design point of view that we have in the business. I feel like the team underneath Marissa is really centered on the aesthetic of the brand, really in the sweet spot of what Banana is and should be. And I'm confident that we have a significant opportunity as we get into the latter half of this year and next year to really drive the business through merchandising as well. I feel like we can support our big ideas, and there are several in the pipeline, and buy the line in a way they can buy the business. I'm really excited to see what this brand can do as we get to the end of the year and into 2016.
Let me turn last to China. And obviously, over the last even couple of weeks, there's been a lot of news coming out of China. And it's an important area of long-term growth for us. I was in China just a few weeks ago, spent a week with the team, in stores, in several cities. And quite simply, I and we are continuing to be very bullish on our opportunity in China. We'll process the currency devaluation. The team is working on that right now. I don't see that really giving us any significant headwinds as we think about the continued growth of the China business. We continue to look at a very robust store pipeline there as well. Our outlet business continues to grow in China. And so really, as far as I'm concerned, no change in strategy, no change in direction, no change in intensity, as we continue to look at China as a significant long-term growth opportunity for the company.
So before I close, I would just like to address the fact that there's a lot of noise really out there right now around the apparel sector. And just so you know my perspective, I shuted out because from where I sit, across all of our businesses, our job is to deliver regardless of the noise that's out there today. And what I see is I see a consumer who has confidence. I see dollars being spent, and I see an opportunity for us to continue to get more than our fair share as I look forward. And I am very optimistic, given the work that's going on inside of Gap and Banana and the continued consistency that I see at Old Navy, very optimistic about what I see in front of us.
Now let me turn it over to Sabrina."
274265,309026595,861584,"The Gap, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 20, 2015",2015-08-20,"Earnings Calls","The Gap, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Art. Good afternoon, everyone. As anticipated, our results were impacted by foreign exchange, West Coast port issues and our previously announced strategic actions primarily related to Gap brand. Given the number of unique factors impacting fin",775,"Thank you, Art. Good afternoon, everyone. As anticipated, our results were impacted by foreign exchange, West Coast port issues and our previously announced strategic actions primarily related to Gap brand. Given the number of unique factors impacting financial results, I'm going to zoom out and quickly speak to our first half results on a normalized basis.
Beginning with foreign exchange. In the first half, foreign exchange negatively impacted earnings per share by $0.06. With the accelerated weakening of the yen and Canadian dollar, the FX impact of $0.04 to Q2 was larger than Q1.
With regard to the West Coast port situation. The first half impact of the port delays was about $0.13, in line with our original estimate but slightly weighted toward Q2.
And finally, the charges associated with our strategic actions, which were publicly disclosed in mid-June, totaled about $95 million in the first half or about $0.14. As a reminder, these charges primarily include costs associated with lease buyouts, asset impairments and employee-related costs. Excluding these items, our underlying business delivered adjusted earnings per share growth of 12% over last year. We're pleased that despite our product challenges at Gap and Banana Republic, we were able to use all of our levers to achieve this respectable underlying earnings per share growth in the first half.
Turning now to the second quarter performance. On a constant-currency basis, net sales were about flat. Foreign exchange negatively impacted our reported net sales by about $100 million in the second quarter. As reported, net sales were $3.9 billion, down 2% versus last year. Total sales in comps by division are in our press release.
Moving to gross margin. Second quarter gross margin was down 200 basis points to 37.4%. Rent and occupancy deleveraged 40 basis points. Merchandise margin deleveraged 160 basis points and was negatively impacted by both the ports and foreign exchange.
With regard to SG&A. We continue to manage expenses tightly. Second quarter total operating expenses were $1.1 billion, including about $70 million of charges associated with our strategic actions and about a $30 million benefit from foreign exchange. Excluding these items and last year's gain on sale, adjusted SG&A dollars were about flat year-over-year. Marketing expenses were down $11 million to $131 million.
Turning to earnings. Excluding the negative impact from strategic actions, which was about $0.12, earnings per share were $0.64 or $0.52 on a reported basis.
Regarding the balance sheet and cash flow. Inventory dollars per store were up 1% at the end of the second quarter, in line with our guidance. Year-to-date, free cash flow was an inflow of $341 million. Consistent with our opportunistic approach, we're pleased to have spent over $600 million on share repurchases year-to-date. In the second quarter alone, we spent over $375 million repurchasing 10 million shares. Including our dividend, year-to-date shareholder distributions totaled about $800 million. We ended the quarter with a share count of 410 million and a cash balance of $1 billion.
Regarding capital expenditures and store count. Year-to-date, capital expenditures were about $300 million. On a net basis, we opened 29 company-operated stores year-to-date, including 40 Gap brand closures. We ended the quarter with 3,309 stores.
And now I'd like to share our outlook for the rest of the year. Given that our first half performance was within the scenarios embedded in our initial full year outlook, we are reaffirming our full year earnings per share guidance range of $2.75 to $2.80. This range excludes the charges associated with our strategic actions. With regard to those actions, we now estimate the charges to be around $130 million to $140 million. Excluding the cost associated with our strategic actions, we continue to expect operating margins to be down about 1 point versus 2014, driven by the negative impact from foreign exchange, the first half port issues and last year's gain on sale.
While we continue to pursue our growth initiatives in Asia and domestically with Athleta, given our Gap brand closures, we now anticipate store count and square footage to be about flat for the year.
Regarding inventory, we expect third quarter inventory to be down slightly. For the full year, all other guidance metrics remain substantially unchanged.
In closing, while the business experienced challenges in the first half, we are pleased to have delivered underlying EPS growth of 12% and to have distributed about $800 million to shareholders, underscoring our commitment to returning excess cash. As we enter the third quarter, we'll continue to focus on levers that we can control and advance the initiatives that will drive future improvements. Thank you and I will turn it back over to Jack."

If I look across the business, the women's business is performing. I've now seen product looking out through the rest of the year, really excited about the -- where we are from a trend standpoint across a number of categories. And probably what's most important to me is that the strength of business is diversified, it's not singular. And then if you add on top of that some new categories that really have not been powering the business until we've built them out over the last couple of seasons, like Active, I feel really good about what Old Navy has as ammunition to deliver the back half."

There's always opportunities to work more productively and efficiently in the business. As a reminder, a large part of our expense base is variable to sales, whether it's per unit because of DC cost or whether it's related and variable to store cost, a large piece is variable. So of course, when sales are increasing, we would expect nominal dollars to increase. But if they're not increasing, then we do our very best since we've been demonstrating to be responsible and to hold all of our other discretionary and overhead items very tightly, combined with the natural benefit we get from the variable piece. So that's that piece. With regard to the balance sheet, let me see if I can remember your questions. I know one was on cash. And so we still target roughly between $1 billion and $1.2 billion as our cash on balance sheet target, and we ended with $1 billion so we're very comfortable with where we ended the quarter. And then with regard to our ratios. I would say, broadly speaking, we like being an investment-grade credit. It gives us a lot of flexibility in our business, and we have fought hard for those. So we try to remain consistent in our ratios with the agencies' guidelines on what constitutes investment grade."

And so that's been a particular focus inside of Banana and a particular focus inside of Gap. And it doesn't always come for free but it doesn't always come with a cost either. And so you can easily choose a yarn and a sweater that's actually more expensive because of the hand feel that it delivers but it's the yarn that's got to be in appealing standards and therefore, for the customer, it's a lower quality experience. And so this is something that's on my radar. I've mentioned it before. It's on the radar of the teams for both of those brands as well as Old Navy. The customer has a quality expectation that's an opportunity for us. And so you should expect to see some of that in the back half of the year. But it's been a very intentional focus on design, merchandising, production and sourcing as we get into the beginning of next year.

Now that said, we made a very large, concerted effort this time to really, really go after the customer with some e-mail pieces, direct mail pieces, signage in stores to try and recapture to the next closest Gap store as well as online.

So at a high level, as a reminder, for our legal entities that do business outside of the United States, and the biggest businesses I'll focus on again for us are Japan and Canada because those two together are really our biggest currency exposure because we have about $2 billion worth of sales between those two countries. The -- unfortunately, those currencies have continued to depreciate. So we hedge, of course. They -- those operations are in local currency, and they buy the vast majority of their cost of goods in U.S. dollars. So they're exposed to the depreciation of their currency. And we hedge for them 12 to 18 months forward to give: a, our merchants and our team certainty around what the cost of sales is; but also obviously, it eases the impact of the depreciation of the currencies. Now it doesn't prevent the depreciation of the currencies ultimately hitting us, it only delays it. So with the continuation of the depreciation of yen and CAD in particular, we're probably going to expect to see continuing headwinds into '16. Now currencies are really volatile. We'll see when we get there, and we'll talk more about that obviously in our Q4 call, when we finish doing most of our hedging and we have our budgets done. But I would say, from where we sit today, given the way the currencies moved, we're going to probably continue to feel headwinds maybe around the same magnitude, hopefully not, but maybe around the same magnitude as we have this year."

And if I look at Gap as an example, we drove a strong business back a couple of years ago, in the spring of 2012, with modest marketing but exceptional product. And so what I can say is that as we feel better about the product, that will help us think about the marketing that we're willing to put behind it. But I do believe that your marketing should lag good products and that a lot of what will drive the bounce in the business is good products in the stores, which then puts some marketing behind in maybe the next period. So we're managing it very carefully. And again, as Sabrina said, too soon to talk about what we're going to do in Q4, it's not really there yet."

With regard to the impact of the store closures on ROD, I would say it's not going to be that meaningful. And the reason is you'll recall that the stores we're closing are mostly in the lower quality centers. And in those centers, we actually had pretty favorable rents. So when we take those out of the portfolio, it doesn't really help your ROD leverage much because as a percent to rent, that wasn't the issue with those stores, it was more brand positioning with those stores."

But if you look at Gap, where do I expect bounce as we're getting the aesthetic, on trend quality, et cetera, on track? You can just look at the public data and see where we've given up market share. Knits is a big category in women's where we gave up market share. It is a knit cycle right now. It is an opportunity for us to get our share and more than our fair share. Denim is coming back, which is a place that powers the brand, and I believe we have really good product development in the pipeline. And those are two big categories for the brand, always big brand drivers for Gap. And so I'll just stop there at the moment. But that's -- the team has obviously been focused across the entire assortment that to be able to ride the bounce in denim and then reclaim and more so our fair share in knits is a big opportunity for us."

I'm really going to focus on the back half of the year and as we get into 2016. We are making progress on the journey that I've articulated to you in the work that's going on at Gap and at Banana Republic.
Let me start with Old Navy and then I'll talk a bit about the other brands as well. Pleased with Old Navy's performance. I see strength as I look into the back half. Obviously, we look at all the products as we go through the months and very pleased with where the women's business is, as well as the other businesses that surround women's at the end of the day. Active has been a strength that they continue to build. We now have an Active expression that sits across the entire family. As I look out into September and October, I think the fall product for Old Navy is going to be right in the sweet spot of what's on-brand, on-trend and a great value proposition. And I'm excited about that they can do for this company in the back half.
Old Navy's consistency continues to be a thing of beauty. It sits on a platform of product process that they have built over the last couple of years and now are pretty relentlessly executing season after season. It's those same product processes that we are pretty far along now in installing in Gap and Banana Republic. And as I've said before, Old Navy remains our proof point for building product, executing trend, delivering on-brand, on-quality, on-fit product consistently for the rest of the company.
We see a very long run way of growth for Old Navy. They've gained roughly $1 billion of market share over the course of the last 3 years. They are continuing to build out their responsive supply chain capabilities, platforming fabric, becoming faster and faster in responding to consumer needs, and I'm very pleased with the progress that Stefan and the team have made and the outlook that we see for the back half and 2016.
Let me then turn to Gap. The steps that I have laid out with Jeff, as we focus on getting the business back on track, first of all, obviously, started with recruiting the team around Jeff. And that is now largely done. Since I spoke to you last, Steven Sare has joined as Head of Global Merchandising. Steven is a talent and we're very pleased to have him. That team has been focused obviously on spring of 2016, and I'm confident that they have been doing the right work to get the business back on track as we get into next year. 
Three weeks ago, I was in New York with the entire team. We did a full style level, on-figure review of the adult assortments. I saw terrific progress in terms of recentering on what the brand equities are. On fit, on quality, on femininity, on optimism, they are hallmarks of what Gap brand is all about.
I'm not going to stand up at the plate and call which fence we're going to hit it over, that's not who I am. But I'm confident that Gap will make significant progress in spring and very pleased with what I've seen in the women's assortment and the turnaround in the women's assortment.
While being focused on getting the spring women's assortment back on track, which the team has been spending most of their energy on and they've now obviously turned to summer, at the same time, they've been rebuilding the product processes inside the business. And I've referred to this before using Old Navy as the template, built more responsive capabilities, platformed much of the fabric, and I'm very encouraged by what these capabilities will be able to deliver for us as we get into 2016. For the first time, we will be going to in-season open in some of our key product programs and therefore able to get back in after we read the business in season with significant quantities of units. This is obviously an important capability for us. We're building this across the entire company, and it's great to see Jeff and the team make progress like this as quickly as they have.
Let me, for a moment, just address the strategic actions that we announced we were going to be taking when we last spoke with you.
I'm really pleased with the progress that Jeff and the team have made. We will have stores being closed over the course of this year. But the work on restructuring the business, on working with our landlords to make sure that this was an orderly process, has largely been done. And what that does is it gives the team the ability to really now focus on the business going forward.
Let me turn for just a moment to Banana Republic. It's not a place where I spent a lot of time talking to you in our last couple of calls. So I want to spend a moment there and give you my perspective as to what we're looking at in the back half and as we get into 2016.
I'm really confident with the design point of view that we have in the business. I feel like the team underneath Marissa is really centered on the aesthetic of the brand, really in the sweet spot of what Banana is and should be. And I'm confident that we have a significant opportunity as we get into the latter half of this year and next year to really drive the business through merchandising as well. I feel like we can support our big ideas, and there are several in the pipeline, and buy the line in a way they can buy the business. I'm really excited to see what this brand can do as we get to the end of the year and into 2016.
Let me turn last to China. And obviously, over the last even couple of weeks, there's been a lot of news coming out of China. And it's an important area of long-term growth for us. I was in China just a few weeks ago, spent a week with the team, in stores, in several cities. And quite simply, I and we are continuing to be very bullish on our opportunity in China. We'll process the currency devaluation. The team is working on that right now. I don't see that really giving us any significant headwinds as we think about the continued growth of the China business. We continue to look at a very robust store pipeline there as well. Our outlet business continues to grow in China. And so really, as far as I'm concerned, no change in strategy, no change in direction, no change in intensity, as we continue to look at China as a significant long-term growth opportunity for the company.
So before I close, I would just like to address the fact that there's a lot of noise really out there right now around the apparel sector. And just so you know my perspective, I shut it out because from where I sit, across all of our businesses, our job is to deliver regardless of the noise that's out there today. And what I see is I see a consumer who has confidence. I see dollars being spent, and I see an opportunity for us to continue to get more than our fair share as I look forward. And I am very optimistic, given the work that's going on inside of Gap and Banana and the continued consistency that I see at Old Navy, very optimistic about what I see in front of us.
Now let me turn it over to Sabrina."
274265,309026595,861607,"The Gap, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 20, 2015",2015-08-20,"Earnings Calls","The Gap, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Art. Good afternoon, everyone. As anticipated, our results were impacted by foreign exchange, West Coast port issues and our previously announced strategic actions primarily related to Gap brand. Given the number of unique factors impacting fin",775,"Thank you, Art. Good afternoon, everyone. As anticipated, our results were impacted by foreign exchange, West Coast port issues and our previously announced strategic actions primarily related to Gap brand. Given the number of unique factors impacting financial results, I'm going to zoom out and quickly speak to our first half results on a normalized basis.
Beginning with foreign exchange. In the first half, foreign exchange negatively impacted earnings per share by $0.06. With the accelerated weakening of the yen and Canadian dollar, the FX impact of $0.04 to Q2 was larger than Q1.
With regard to the West Coast port situation. The first half impact of the port delays was about $0.13, in line with our original estimate but slightly weighted toward Q2.
And finally, the charges associated with our strategic actions, which were publicly disclosed in mid-June, totaled about $95 million in the first half or about $0.14. As a reminder, these charges primarily include costs associated with lease buyouts, asset impairments and employee-related costs. Excluding these items, our underlying business delivered adjusted earnings per share growth of 12% over last year. We're pleased that despite our product challenges at Gap and Banana Republic, we were able to use all of our levers to achieve this respectable underlying earnings per share growth in the first half.
Turning now to the second quarter performance. On a constant-currency basis, net sales were about flat. Foreign exchange negatively impacted our reported net sales by about $100 million in the second quarter. As reported, net sales were $3.9 billion, down 2% versus last year. Total sales in comps by division are in our press release.
Moving to gross margin. Second quarter gross margin was down 200 basis points to 37.4%. Rent and occupancy deleveraged 40 basis points. Merchandise margin deleveraged 160 basis points and was negatively impacted by both the ports and foreign exchange.
With regard to SG&A. We continue to manage expenses tightly. Second quarter total operating expenses were $1.1 billion, including about $70 million of charges associated with our strategic actions and about a $30 million benefit from foreign exchange. Excluding these items and last year's gain on sale, adjusted SG&A dollars were about flat year-over-year. Marketing expenses were down $11 million to $131 million.
Turning to earnings. Excluding the negative impact from strategic actions, which was about $0.12, earnings per share were $0.64 or $0.52 on a reported basis.
Regarding the balance sheet and cash flow. Inventory dollars per store were up 1% at the end of the second quarter, in line with our guidance. Year-to-date, free cash flow was an inflow of $341 million. Consistent with our opportunistic approach, we're pleased to have spent over $600 million on share repurchases year-to-date. In the second quarter alone, we spent over $375 million repurchasing 10 million shares. Including our dividend, year-to-date shareholder distributions totaled about $800 million. We ended the quarter with a share count of 410 million and a cash balance of $1 billion.
Regarding capital expenditures and store count. Year-to-date, capital expenditures were about $300 million. On a net basis, we opened 29 company-operated stores year-to-date, including 40 Gap brand closures. We ended the quarter with 3,309 stores.
And now I'd like to share our outlook for the rest of the year. Given that our first half performance was within the scenarios embedded in our initial full year outlook, we are reaffirming our full year earnings per share guidance range of $2.75 to $2.80. This range excludes the charges associated with our strategic actions. With regard to those actions, we now estimate the charges to be around $130 million to $140 million. Excluding the cost associated with our strategic actions, we continue to expect operating margins to be down about 1 point versus 2014, driven by the negative impact from foreign exchange, the first half port issues and last year's gain on sale.
While we continue to pursue our growth initiatives in Asia and domestically with Athleta, given our Gap brand closures, we now anticipate store count and square footage to be about flat for the year.
Regarding inventory, we expect third quarter inventory to be down slightly. For the full year, all other guidance metrics remain substantially unchanged.
In closing, while the business experienced challenges in the first half, we are pleased to have delivered underlying EPS growth of 12% and to have distributed about $800 million to shareholders, underscoring our commitment to returning excess cash. As we enter the third quarter, we'll continue to focus on levers that we can control and advance the initiatives that will drive future improvements. Thank you and I will turn it back over to Jack."

If I look across the business, the women's business is performing. I've now seen product looking out through the rest of the year, really excited about the -- where we are from a trend standpoint across a number of categories. And probably what's most important to me is that the strength of business is diversified, it's not singular.

There's always opportunities to work more productively and efficiently in the business. As a reminder, a large part of our expense base is variable to sales, whether it's per unit because of DC cost or whether it's related and variable to store cost, a large piece is variable. So of course, when sales are increasing, we would expect nominal dollars to increase. But if they're not increasing, then we do our very best since we've been demonstrating to be responsible and to hold all of our other discretionary and overhead items very tightly, combined with the natural benefit we get from the variable piece. So that's that piece. With regard to the balance sheet, let me see if I can remember your questions. I know one was on cash. And so we still target roughly between $1 billion and $1.2 billion as our cash on balance sheet target, and we ended with $1 billion so we're very comfortable with where we ended the quarter. And then with regard to our ratios. I would say, broadly speaking, we like being an investment-grade credit. It gives us a lot of flexibility in our business, and we have fought hard for those.

Fit should be an asset for this company, and we have had fit challenges and consistency challenges in bottoms in Gap. And it's something that the team has been very resolutely focused on.

And so that's been a particular focus inside of Banana and a particular focus inside of Gap. And it doesn't always come for free but it doesn't always come with a cost either. And so you can easily choose a yarn and a sweater that's actually more expensive because of the hand feel that it delivers but it's the yarn that's going to be in appealing standards and therefore, for the customer, it's a lower quality experience. And so this is something that's on my radar. I've mentioned it before. It's on the radar of the teams for both of those brands as well as Old Navy. The customer has a quality expectation that's an opportunity for us. And so you should expect to see some of that in the back half of the year. But it's been a very intentional focus on design, merchandising, production and sourcing as we get into the beginning of next year.

Now that said, we made a very large, concerted effort this time to really, really go after the customer with some e-mail pieces, direct mail pieces, signage in stores to try and recapture to the next closest Gap store as well as online.

So at a high level, as a reminder, for our legal entities that do business outside of the United States, and the biggest businesses I'll focus on again for us are Japan and Canada because those two together are really our biggest currency exposure because we have about $2 billion worth of sales between those two countries. The -- unfortunately, those currencies have continued to depreciate. So we hedge, of course. They -- those operations are in local currency, and they buy the vast majority of their cost of goods in U.S. dollars. So they're exposed to the depreciation of their currency. And we hedge for them 12 to 18 months forward to give: a, our merchants and our team certainty around what the cost of sales is; but also obviously, it eases the impact of the depreciation of the currencies. Now it doesn't prevent the depreciation of the currencies ultimately hitting us, it only delays it. So with the continuation of the depreciation of yen and CAD in particular, we're probably going to expect to see continuing headwinds into '16. Now currencies are really volatile. We'll see when we get there, and we'll talk more about that obviously in our Q4 call, when we finish doing most of our hedging and we have our budgets done. But I would say, from where we sit today, given the way the currencies have moved, we're going to probably continue to feel headwinds maybe around the same magnitude, hopefully not, but maybe around the same magnitude as we have this year."

If I look at the opportunity for Banana, positioned where it is, it's executing well. There's a very large opportunity for us there. And so I'm pretty excited about the growth there as we get the business back on track and especially as we're building the product platforms underneath Banana to be more responsive and more quick and more on trend. So it's a place where we don't probably talk about it as much as we do certainly with Gap and the situation there, and then obviously, with the strength of Old Navy, but to me, it is a quiet, powerful growth asset for this company."

With regard to the impact of the store closures on ROD, I would say it's not going to be that meaningful. And the reason is you'll recall that the stores we're closing are mostly in the lower quality centers. And in those centers, we actually had pretty favorable rents. So when we take those out of the portfolio, it doesn't really help your ROD leverage much because as a percent to rent, that wasn't the issue with those stores, it was more brand positioning with those stores."

Knits is a big category in women's where we gave up market share. It is a knit cycle right now. It is an opportunity for us to get our share and more than our fair share. Denim is coming back, which is a place that powers the brand, and I believe we have really good product development in the pipeline. And those are two big categories for the brand, should always big brand drivers for Gap. And so I'll just stop there at the moment.

So I'm going to be pretty short today and I just want to reiterate some of the key points as I look at Q3, Q4 and then springing beyond next year. 
Q3 was challenging for Gap and Banana. And again, largely due to the acceptance in women's product which is not what we wanted it to be. But let me make something very clear. We know what the issues are with our product. And we're addressing those pretty systematically. I spent a lot of time reading reviews of our product online and our customers are very clear in telling us what we're doing well and what we're not doing well. And I'm very confident having seen the product, having been with the teams that were addressing these issues. And that as we get into spring of next year, we're going to see a material improvement across both Banana and Gap in the product that we're putting in front of our customers. 
So I have confidence in the work that we're doing across the company and I've spoken to you about how we are essentially lifting processes and capabilities from Old Navy and installing them in Gap and Banana Republic. I've seen the product in spring now and in summer across all of the brands and I'm really excited about how we will be back on track in the spring and beyond next year. I'm also confident in the momentum of the business at Old Navy and I'm looking forward to the product that they're putting in at the beginning of next year as well. 
So let me focus on inventory for a moment. We spent a lot of time in Q3, focused on inventory and getting quaint. And I'm really pleased, and Sabrina will provide on detail on this, but we've come into Q4 with our inventories in very good shape. 
That said, we're in a competitive environment. And regardless, Q4 is always a very promotional quarter. And so we reflected the fact that our expectation is that it is going to be a very promotional environment in Q4 and we are prepared to play there. 
One of the things that we have done very well, and we've been very committed to, is expense control. We were prudent and delivered against this in Q3 and you have my commitment that we are going to continue to remain very disciplined as we go through Q4. 
I'll hand it off to Sabrina in a minute. But I want to say something about where my head is relative to looking forward at the prospects of this company. I'm very confident that we can win. And I'm confident that we can win, not on the basis of anything other than the work that the teams are doing to position all of our brands for better and more consistent performance as we get into 2016. 
And now I'll turn it over to Sabrina."

As usual, I will begin today by reviewing third quarter performance and then provide an update on our full-year guidance. I'd like to note that our third quarter reported results include about $13 million in cost related to our",775,"Good afternoon everyone. As usual, I will begin today by reviewing third quarter performance and then provide an update on our full-year guidance. 
I'd like to note that our third quarter reported results include about $13 million in cost related to our previously announced strategic actions. About $7 million of that total is in SG&A, with $6 million in gross margin. This brings our year-to-date cost related to our strategic actions to $107 million. 
So starting with sales for the third quarter. On a constant-currency basis, net sales were about flat. Foreign exchange negatively impacted our reported net sales by about $100 million in the third quarter. As reported, net sales were $3.9 billion, down 3% versus last year. Total sales and comps by division are in our press release. 
Moving to inventory and gross margin. As previously disclosed, elevated promotional activity pressured margins as we manage through units during the quarter. We did, however, exceed our goal on inventory and ended the third quarter with inventory per store down 4% year-over-year, beating our previous guidance. We expect fourth quarter ending inventory per store to be about flat on top of last year's decline of 6%. 
Third quarter gross margin was down 290 basis points to 37.3%, with about 60 basis points of the decline driven by foreign exchange. Merchandise margin deleveraged 240 basis points, with the greatest pressure at Banana Republic. Rent and occupancy deleveraged 50 basis points. 
Given the challenging business, we're pleased that our teams continued to manage expenses tightly during the quarter. Marketing expenses were down $34 million to $142 million due largely to lower spend at Gap brand. Third quarter total operating expenses were below last year at $1 billion, including about a $26 million benefit from foreign exchange. 
Turning to earnings. Excluding the negative impact from the strategic actions which was about $0.02, earnings per share were $0.63 or $0.61 on a reported basis. Foreign exchange had about a $0.05 negative impact on third quarter earnings per share or a 6 percentage point negative impact to EPS growth. Additionally, Q3 of 2014 benefited from a discrete tax item that resulted in a lower effective tax rate of 34.5% in the quarter compared with 37.4% this year. 
Regarding cash and distributions. During the quarter, we closed on a $400 million term loan. The new funds provide us with additional flexibility, including the opportunity to repurchase shares at what we consider an attractive valuation. 
Including the proceeds from the loan, we ended the quarter with over $1 billion in cash. Consistent with our commitment to return cash to shareholders, we spent $200 million repurchasing shares during the third quarter and over $800 million year-to-date. We ended the quarter with 404 million shares outstanding. Including our dividend, year-to-date shareholder distributions have totaled about $1.1 billion. 
Regarding capital expenditures and store count. Year-to-date capital expenditures were $505 million. And on a net basis, we opened 66 company-operated stores year-to-date and ended the quarter with 3,346 stores. Store count in square footage details are in our release. 
And now I'd like to share our outlook for the rest of the year. We are revising our full year earnings per share guidance to $2.38 to $2.42. And we now expect operating margin to be about 10.5%. Our guidance excludes the charges related to our strategic actions which we continued to estimate at around $130 million to $140 million. All other full year guidance metrics remain substantially unchanged. 
Now let me take a step back and briefly outline two major factors that have changed meaningfully since we set our initial guidance at the beginning of the year. 
First, Banana Republic significantly decelerated with fall product when we had expected some marginal improvement. Second, it appears to us that the consumer more broadly pulled back on apparel purchasing in Q3, especially outside of value, leaving the sector with inventories probably more elevated than desired entering Q4. 
While we've done the work to position ourselves for a successful holiday season entering with tight inventories, we feel our guidance reflects a prudent outlook given what will likely continue to be a highly promotional environment. 
As a reminder, 2015 has been negatively impacted by several other items. The two largest of which are foreign exchange and the first half port issues. Normalizing for these items, our guidance range implies an underlying EPS decline of about 5% to 6%. 
In closing, as we enter the fourth quarter, we'll continue to push forward the turnaround efforts at Gap and Banana and work to maintain the solid year-to-date performance at Old Navy. 
Thank you and now I'll turn it back over to Jack."

So you have your normal few styles that don't work. But overall, the product acceptance is very good, pretty systematically across the board. It's just -- it's -- as you know, as you noted upfront, it's a really tough macro environment right now from the standpoint of the customer. And secondly, compounded -- compounding that, not to make excuses, but statistic that October was the warmest October ever and you're still seeing the temperatures in the Northeast, et cetera, pretty warm, which obviously means people aren't necessary to buy into particularly sweaters and outerwear.

We have a very senior person now in a critical role in the company overseeing fit across the entire company and really getting fit consistency, particularly in our bottoms business where it's critical at the end of the day. And I mentioned on the call that I look at reviews. What I would say is this, which is, if you look at reviews, if you get into our stores and talk to our customers, we have a process called voice of the customer where we listen to feedback where specifically we do consumer insights. There's 100% consistency with what our customers want, what is not working for them across all of those touch points. And those are the team -- those are the things that the teams are acting on in both Gap and Banana to get the product back, centered to where it needs to be. So I don't want to get through right now, style by style or anything like that. But again, if I come back to Gap casual, optimistic American, we have re-centered the development very much around those filters with consistent fit, with femininity. And if I go to Banana, which is really updated classics with a twist, which is how we always talked about that business and quality fabrications, the product development has been very consistent with that as I look at spring and summer."

And so to me, you buy tight and you let some AUR come into the business. And then we do have some capability to feed units into the business if we're seeing styles in programs that are working. And I would rather go in tight with the ability to feed the business and come in heavy than regret it at the end of the day. So obviously, we're looking for comp. We're always looking for comp. But I'm not going to drive comp by just making a massive investment in units until we really have confidence about the product. And so again, buy tight, feed the business, that's the strategy that we'll take for both of those businesses over the course of the next couple of quarters next year."

And if you go back and look over my comments from earlier in the year, I was really hoping that we would get more traction with the new design direction. Obviously, we've made some changes in design and we did that pretty quickly. When we felt like where we weren't where we needed to be. I have confidence in the current team. I have confidence in the team owning spring and summer. So it's not going to delay what we expect to see as we get into the beginning of next year. But I was not expecting and I'm very disappointed by the deceleration that we've seen, particularly with Banana in the back half. I think I had a much better calibration as to where Gap was than what we're going to be working through, but less so with Banana. And that's been a real disappointment to me and a bit of a surprise. I would say competitive context, probably the biggest issue here is just, as we've gotten into Q4, I was surprised to see people carrying inventory and as heavy as they actually did. And as I said in my remarks, we'll play -- we are prepared to play in a very promotional environment. But I hope you would give us the benefit that we do really focus on managing inventory as pretty aggressively. And I think it's going to be a tough quarter and I think we've had signals. A tough quarter from the standpoint of the consumer promotional environment. And I think we've had signals for a while that the consumer was standing on the sidelines a little bit. And it was just a little bit of a disappointment that we may have some excess inventory and a really promotional environment as we go into Q4. But again, we're prepared to play. It's why we spent what we spent in terms of getting clean in Q3 because we did not want to carry that inventory into Q4."

But with it being as warm as it has, we're still waiting for demand to really pickup. Also pleased with the traction that Old Navy is getting in denim, particularly in fashion denim. They've been quite on-trend, especially with rise and silhouette. And we're seeing, again, good product development there that I believe will carry us forward in Q4 as well. And the last thing is that even in Q3, we saw a really encouraging consistency across all divisions in the business. There's always going to be a difference between men's and women's and kids and baby. But it's nice to see it when all the businesses are registering good product acceptance. And despite the fact that we are clearing through inventory, which puts some pressure on the business, I do believe we have very good consistent products acceptance across the whole box. And then last thing I will just call out, which we really expressed in the last few seasons, is the Full Family Active Expression, which is in a category where there is obviously higher than market growth. We have that now in the box, all the way down to baby in a full family, really put it in the stores about displacing any other programs. So it's about incremental productivity.

And I'm glad you raised the question because part of how we're thinking about spring in Gap as an example is where did we not get our fair share? And as a consequence, number 1, where we're developing it and then buying into it to support it. So Oliver knits is a great example, women's knits, we underdeveloped in 2015. We conceded a fair amount of market share in our women's knits business just because we didn't have the range of development. And as a consequence, as I've looked at spring and then summer, we had very intentional developments to reclaim and hopefully, more than reclaim our fair share of the knits business. And it's silhouette, it's fabrication and it's for multiple uses. And she comes to us, she comes to Gap brand. Knits is an important part of that spring and summer assortment, year round, but spring and summer in particular. And so that's part of how I look at it and say, how much risk do I find versus opportunity? And when I look at it and say, it's a fair share opportunity of getting our fair share in terms of what they end up buying. I'm pretty confident that there's some upside for us there. Dresses is another example where, especially from later spring and summer, there should be a terrific accessible dress business in Gap, shirt dresses and then a variety of knit dress publications in particular, short, medium and long maxi dresses. If you look at our LY assortment there, we are very underdeveloped with only a couple of silhouettes. And again, fair share, we left much money on the table because we really weren't playing with the range of development that we should've had. So both of those are good examples of where I feel like there's opportunity. I'll just go to a third, which is denim. And when I look at products, Oliver, we always take last year's category development and compare it against this year's category development. And so if I look at denim, what I saw last year was a lot of development that was relatively overlapping. So if you had washes, the washes were quite similar across the same silhouettes. When I look at our development this year, I see much more intentional development to create multiple reasons to buy rather than reasons to buy this or that. And so I feel good about the denim development and our opportunity there as well. Those are the approaches that we've taken to every category whether it's wovens, or knits or denim. But those are probably 3 standouts for me where I feel like there is a share opportunity. On the demographic piece. I've said this before and I'll say it again. I feel like Gap is a brand when it's at its best and I saw this in [indiscernible] in 2012 where we were on trend with products that our customers expected. We got a mom in there and a mom with her teenage or young 20s daughter in the store. And if you look at where we are, probably underpenetrated today, certainly in the millennial customer. The customers and older customer in Gap which we've talked about and that represents a shared opportunity for us across all our businesses for sure."

Just because of the volume and the capacity that, that gives us in the stores. And it's an easy shopping experience. But that's about tuning and tweaking for the season.

And so we are really aggressively focused on making sure that as our traffic pivots from a desktop or a laptop or even a tablet onto a mobile device, that we are able to monetize that traffic. And so it's about a number of things that we've talked about before that we continue to push aggressively on, starting with responsive design that delivers a great mobile experience, off of one website. But then making sure that the shopping experience is easy, greater use of inventory versus text, a great checkout experience, tap to apply promotion capabilities which we put in place. And so making sure that the experience is both emotional, immersive and aspirational on mobile device as a brand experience but also transactionally efficient as a customer buying on the mobile device. That's probably the biggest opportunity that we've got right now and we're very aggressively focused on it. It's moving very quickly. We're excited about it. Our traffic is growing.

I think I'm going to start by saying, broadly speaking, nothing has changed with regard to our view on our capital structure and our cash balances. So for sometime, Brian, you'll remember, it's important to us we target investment-grade ratios and we've targeted between $1 billion to $1.2 billion of balance sheet cash. We dipped a little bit below that at times. But that's broadly been our target and nothing has changed. Now Q3 always tends to be, like it is for many retailers, sort of, our lower point in cash flow because we're building inventories. And then of course, Q4 is a high cash inflow quarter for us. So we really took the opportunity to execute this term loan, just to give us a little bit of flexibility, timing wise, before all of these Q4 of cash flows came in so that we could continue with our philosophy of being opportunistic. And make some purchases on behalf of the shareholders, perhaps before all of that Q4 cash flow comes in. So again, broadly speaking, no major change in our philosophy at all."

And so a lot of the work we do on inventory is to make sure that the teams are grounded in current trends, current traffic trends, especially. What happened with Old Navy was really all about September's trends dropping off from what we had seen. So September again was that all-important 5-week month. And we never saw Labor Day come -- or I'm sorry, 5-week month. We never really saw Labor Day come. And in a high velocity business like Old Navy, where everyday of a holiday and certainly, every week is very meaningful, when you get backed up, it spells trouble for October. We fortunately, earlier in the year, made a decision across all of our brands, especially Banana and Gap, that we were going to go into the last quarter much tighter. So we have pulled back units across all of our brands and we feel comfortable that the combination of how we're entering with the much tighter receding that will go on in the fourth quarter, we're going to be tight. We're going to be in good shape in terms of inventory. We've guided to that about flat at the end of the fourth quarter but it's important to remember that that's the lapping a minus 6. A minus 6 on Q3 ending 2 year minus 6%. So we're feeling pretty good because we want to walk that line that we want to have enough inventory to give us the possibility of those positive comps. And yet, we want to be tight."

So I'm going to be pretty short today. And I just want to reiterate some of the key points as I look at Q3, Q4 and then springing beyond next year.
Q3 was challenging for Gap and Banana, and again, largely due to the acceptance in women's product which is not what we wanted it to be. Let me make something very clear. We know what the issues are with our product. And we're addressing those pretty systematically. I spent a lot of time reading reviews of our product online, and our customers are very clear in telling us what we're doing well and what we're not doing well. And I'm very confident having seen the product, having been with the teams that were addressing these issues and that as we get into spring of next year, we're going to see a material improvement across both Banana and Gap in the product that we're putting in front of our customers.
So I have confidence in the work that we're doing across the company, and I've spoken to you about how we are essentially lifting processes and capabilities from Old Navy and installing them in Gap and Banana Republic. I've seen the product in spring now and in summer across all of the brands, and I'm really excited about how we will be back on track in the spring and beyond next year. I'm also confident in the momentum of the business at Old Navy, and I'm looking forward to the product that they're putting in at the beginning of next year as well.
So let me focus on inventory for a moment. We spent a lot of time in Q3 focused on inventory and getting clean. And I'm really pleased, and Sabrina will provide detail on this, we've come into Q4 with our inventories in very good shape. 
That said, we're in a competitive environment. And regardless, Q4 is always a very promotional quarter. And so we reflected the fact that our expectation is that it is going to be a very promotional environment in Q4, and we are prepared to play there.
One of the things that we have done very well, and we've been very committed to, is expense control. We were prudent and delivered against this in Q3, and you have my commitment that we are going to continue to remain very disciplined as we go through Q4.
I'll hand it off to Sabrina in a minute. But I want to say something about where my head is relative to looking forward at the prospects of this company. I'm very confident that we can win. And I'm confident that we can win not on the basis of anything other than the work that the teams are doing to position all of our brands for better and more consistent performance as we get into 2016.
And now I'll turn it over to Sabrina."

As usual, I will begin today by reviewing third quarter performance and then provide an update on our full year guidance.I'd like to note that our third quarter reported results include about $13 million in cost related to our p",776,"Good afternoon everyone. As usual, I will begin today by reviewing third quarter performance and then provide an update on our full year guidance.
I'd like to note that our third quarter reported results include about $13 million in cost related to our previously announced strategic actions. About $7 million of that total is in SG&A, with $6 million in gross margin. This brings our year-to-date cost related to our strategic actions to $107 million.
So starting with sales for the third quarter. On a constant-currency basis, net sales were about flat. Foreign exchange negatively impacted our reported net sales by about $100 million in the third quarter. As reported, net sales were $3.9 billion, down 3% versus last year. Total sales and comps by division are in our press release.
Moving to inventory and gross margin. As previously disclosed, elevated promotional activity pressured margins as we manage through units during the quarter. We did, however, exceed our goal on inventory and ended the third quarter with inventory per store down 4% year-over-year, beating our previous guidance. We expect fourth quarter ending inventory per store to be about flat on top of last year's decline of 6%.
Third quarter gross margin was down 290 basis points to 37.3%, with about 60 basis points of the decline driven by foreign exchange. Merchandise margin deleveraged 240 basis points, with the greatest pressure at Banana Republic. Rent and occupancy deleveraged 50 basis points.
Given the challenging business, we're pleased that our teams continued to manage expenses tightly during the quarter. Marketing expenses were down $34 million to $142 million due largely to lower spend at Gap brand. Third quarter total operating expenses were below last year at $1 billion, including about a $26 million benefit from foreign exchange.
Turning to earnings. Excluding the negative impact from the strategic actions, which was about $0.02, earnings per share were $0.63 or $0.61 on a reported basis. Foreign exchange had about a $0.05 negative impact on third quarter earnings per share or a 6 percentage point negative impact to EPS growth. Additionally, Q3 of 2014 benefited from a discrete tax item that resulted in a lower effective tax rate of 34.5% in the quarter compared with 37.4% this year.
Regarding cash and distributions. During the quarter, we closed on a $400 million term loan. The new funds provide us with additional flexibility, including the opportunity to repurchase shares at what we consider an attractive valuation. Including the proceeds from the loan, we ended the quarter with over $1 billion in cash. Consistent with our commitment to return cash to shareholders, we spent $200 million repurchasing shares during the third quarter and over $800 million year-to-date. We ended the quarter with 404 million shares outstanding. Including our dividend, year-to-date shareholder distributions have totaled about $1.1 billion.
Regarding capital expenditures and store count. Year-to-date capital expenditures were $505 million. And on a net basis, we opened 66 company-operated stores year-to-date and ended the quarter with 3,346 stores. Store count in square footage details are in our release.
And now I'd like to share our outlook for the rest of the year. We are revising our full year earnings per share guidance to $2.38 to $2.42. And we now expect operating margin to be about 10.5%. Our guidance excludes the charges related to our strategic actions which we continued to estimate at around $130 million to $140 million. All other full year guidance metrics remain substantially unchanged.
Now let me take a step back and briefly outline 2 major factors that have changed meaningfully since we set our initial guidance at the beginning of the year. First, Banana Republic significantly decelerated with fall product when we had expected some marginal improvement. Second, it appears to us that the consumer more broadly pulled back on apparel purchasing in Q3, especially outside of value, leaving the sector with inventories probably more elevated than desired entering Q4.
While we've done the work to position ourselves for a successful holiday season entering with tight inventories, we feel our guidance reflects a prudent outlook given what will likely continue to be a highly promotional environment.
As a reminder, 2015 has been negatively impacted by several other items, the 2 largest of which are foreign exchange and the first half port issues. Normalizing for these items, our guidance range implies an underlying EPS decline of about 5% to 6%.
In closing, as we enter the fourth quarter, we'll continue to push forward the turnaround efforts at Gap and Banana and work to maintain the solid year-to-date performance at Old Navy.
Thank you, and now I'll turn it back over to Jack."

If you look at what's in the store right now, the good news is that while we had to work through some inventory in Q3, we are seeing excellent product acceptance right now. So you have your normal few styles that don't work. But overall, the product acceptance is very good, pretty systematically across the board. It's just -- it's -- as you know, as you noted upfront, it's a really tough macro environment right now from the standpoint of the customer. And secondly, compounded -- compounding that, not to make excuses, but statistic that October was the warmest October ever and we're still seeing the temperatures in the Northeast, et cetera, pretty warm, which obviously means people aren't necessarily to buy into particularly sweaters and outerwear. But product acceptance is good. In Gap -- in Gap, we are -- and that's really what we saw on October, obviously. We're waiting to see how Q4 kicks in, et cetera. As I mentioned in the call, I am very much deep in with the teams across all of our brands, Athleta included, and looking at product that is in development for next year. And we referenced this before. In Gap, we know we have issues around femininity, around the optimism of the color palette, around the silhouettes that we brought in as big key items. And we've specifically and intentionally corrected those. Fit inconsistency has been an issue, and I think I mentioned this before. We have a very senior person now in a critical role in the company overseeing fit across the entire company and really getting fit consistency, particularly in our bottoms business where it's critical at the end of the day. And I mentioned on the call that I look at reviews. What I would say is this, which is, if you look at reviews, if you get into our stores and talk to our customers, we have a process called Voice of the Customer where we listen to feedback very specifically. We do consumer insights. There's 100% consistency with what our customers want, what is not working for them across all of those touch points. And those are the team -- those are the things that the teams are acting on in both Gap and Banana to get the product back, centered to where it needs to be. So I don't want to get through right now style by style or anything like that. But again, if I come back to Gap casual, optimistic American, we have re-centered the development very much around those filters with consistent fit, with femininity. And if I go to Banana, which is really updated classics with a twist, which is how we've always talked about that business, and quality fabrications, the product development has been very consistent with that as I look at spring and summer."

We -- our issue is that we are not -- we don't have the pricing authority right now that we need to have even from where we were a few periods ago. And so to me, you buy tight and you let some AUR come into the business. And then we do have some capability to feed units into the business if we're seeing styles and programs that are working. And I would rather go in tight with the ability to feed the business than come in heavy and regret it at the end of the day. So obviously, we're looking for comp. We're always looking for comp. But I'm not going to drive comp by just making a massive investment in units until we really have confidence about the product. And so again, buy tight, feed the business, that's the strategy that we'll take for both of those businesses over the course of the next couple of quarters next year."

And if you go back and look over my comments from earlier in the year, I was really hoping that we would get more traction with the new design direction. Obviously, we've made some changes in design and we did that pretty quickly when we felt like we weren't where we needed to be. I have confidence in the current team. I have confidence in the team owning spring and summer. So it's not going to delay what we expect to see as we get into the beginning of next year. But I was not expecting and I'm very disappointed by the deceleration that we've seen, particularly with Banana in the back half. I think I had a much better calibration as to where Gap was and what we were going to be working through but less so with Banana. And that's been a real disappointment to me and a bit of a surprise. I would say competitive context, probably the biggest issue here is just as we've gotten into Q4, I was surprised to see people carrying inventory in as heavy as they actually did. And as I said in my remarks, we'll play -- we are prepared to play in a very promotional environment. But I hope you would give us the benefit that we do really focus on managing inventory as pretty aggressively. And I think it's going to be a tough quarter and I think we've had signals, a tough quarter from the standpoint of the consumer promotional environment. And I think we've had signals for a while that the consumer was standing on the sidelines a little bit. And it was just a little bit of a disappointment that we may have some excess inventory and a really promotional environment as we go into Q4. But again, we're prepared to play. It's why we spent what we spent in terms of getting clean in Q3 because we did not want to carry that inventory into Q4."

You start to see conversion move on the basis of the traffic that you have in the store, word of mouth these days is a super powerful form of marketing. If you just think about Instagram and Pinterest and other social media, that's a very powerful form of marketing. And that will start to bring traffic in.

It's an important outerwear business, an important sweaters business. As I mentioned, we haven't had that cold snap yet, really, across the country that starts to get those businesses going. But we've seen this before. And when you get the cold, she comes in and she shops. So I'm really confident about the product that we have in the stores. But with it being as warm as it has, we're still waiting for demand to really pick up. Also pleased with the traction that Old Navy is getting in denim, particularly in fashion denim. They've been quite on-trend, especially with rise and silhouette. And we're seeing, again, good product development there that I believe will carry us forward in Q4 as well. And then last thing is that even in Q3, we saw a really encouraging consistency across all divisions in the business. Now there's always going to be a difference between men's and women's and kids and baby. But it's nice to see it when all the businesses are registering good product acceptance. And despite the fact that we are clearing through inventory, which puts some pressure on the business, I do believe we have very good consistent products acceptance across the whole box. And then last thing I would just call out, which we really expressed in the last few seasons, is the full family Active expression, which is in a category where there is obviously higher-than-market growth. We have that now in the box all the way down to baby, full family, really put it in the stores without displacing any other programs. So it's about incremental productivity.

And I'm glad you raised the question because part of how we're thinking about spring in Gap as an example is where did we not get our fair share. And as a consequence, number one, where are we developing into it and then buying into it to support it. So Oliver, knits is a great example, women's knits. We underdeveloped in 2015. We conceded a fair amount of market share in our women's knits business just because we didn't have the range of development. And as a consequence, as I've looked at spring and then summer, we had very intentional developments to reclaim, and hopefully more than reclaim, our fair share of the knits business. And it's silhouette, it's fabrication and it's for multiple uses. And she comes to us, she comes to Gap brand. Knits is an important part of that spring and summer assortment, year round, but spring and summer in particular. And so it's part of how I look at it and say, how much risk do I find versus opportunity? And when I look and I say, it's a fair share opportunity of getting our fair share in terms of both development and buying. I'm pretty confident that there's some upside for us there. Dresses is another example where, especially from later spring and summer, there should be a terrific accessible dress business in Gap, shirt dresses and then a variety of knit dress fabrications in particular, short, medium and long maxi dresses. If you look at our LY [ph] assortment there, we were very underdeveloped with only a couple of silhouettes. And again, fair share, we left a bunch of money on the table because we really weren't playing with the range of development that we should have had. So both of those are good examples of where I feel like there's opportunity. I'll just go to a third, which is denim. And when I look at products, Oliver, we always take last year's category development and compare it against this year's category development. And so if I look at denim, what I saw last year was a lot of development that was relatively overlapping. So if you had washes, the washes were quite similar across the same silhouettes. When I look at our development this year, I see much more intentional development to create multiple reasons to buy rather than reasons to buy this or that. And so I feel good about the denim development and our opportunity there as well. Those are the approaches that we've taken to every category, whether it's wovens or knits or denim. But those are probably 3 standouts for me where I feel like there is a share opportunity. On the demographic piece, I've said this before and I'll say it again. I feel like Gap is a brand when it's at its best. And I saw this in Spades in 2012 where we were on trend with products that our customers expected. We got a mom in there and a mom with her teenage or young 20s daughter in the store. And if you look at where we are probably underpenetrated today, certainly in the millennial customer, the customers and older customer in Gap, which we've talked about. And that represents a share opportunity for us across all of our businesses, for sure."

That said, we will always tune and tweak and look for opportunity. And one of the things we always do, which hopefully you'll see when you go into our stores, is as we get into Q4, we tend to back away from more fashion visual merchandising in the stores towards a more key item presentation just because of the volume and the capacity that, that gives us in the stores. And it's an easy shopping experience. But that's about tuning and tweaking for the season, not about a reset as to where the brand is or a need to do anything or change anything fundamentally.

So to me, the big issue and the big opportunity, and it's both an issue and an opportunity, is the continued growth of mobile traffic. Anybody who is telling you the truth will tell you that it's become probably a majority of their traffic, growing very, very fast. And so we are really aggressively focused on making sure that as our traffic pivots from a desktop or a laptop or even a tablet onto a mobile device, that we are able to monetize that traffic. And so it's about a number of things that we've talked about before that we continue to push aggressively on, starting with responsive design that delivers a great mobile experience off of one website but then making sure that the shopping experience is easy, greater use of inventory versus text, a great checkout experience, tap to apply promotion capabilities, which we put in place, and so making sure that the experience is both emotional, immersive and aspirational on mobile device as a brand experience but also transactionally efficient as a customer buying on the mobile device. That's probably the biggest opportunity that we've got right now, and we're very aggressively focused on it. It's moving very quickly. We're excited about it. Our traffic is growing. But the mobile device experience is different than a desktop experience. And we need to make sure that we can make money there in the same way that we can make money on the other real estate.

We dipped a little bit below that at times. But that's broadly been our target and nothing has changed. Now Q3 always tends to be, like it is for many retailers, sort of our lower point in cash flow because we're building inventories. And then, of course, Q4 is a high cash inflow quarter for us. So we really took the opportunity to execute this term loan just to give us a little bit of flexibility, timing-wise, before all of these Q4 of cash flows came in so that we could continue with our philosophy of being opportunistic and make some purchases on behalf of the shareholders perhaps before all of that Q4 cash flow comes in. So again, broadly speaking, no major change in our philosophy at all."

And so a lot of the work we do on inventory is to make sure that the teams are grounded in current trends, current traffic trends, especially. What happened with Old Navy was really all about September's trends dropping off from what we had seen. So September again was that all-important 5-week month. And we never saw Labor Day come -- or I'm sorry, 5-week month. And we never really saw Labor Day come. And in a high-velocity business like Old Navy where every day of a holiday and certainly every week is very meaningful, when you get backed up, it spells trouble for October. We fortunately, earlier in the year, made a decision across all of our brands, especially Banana and Gap, that we were going to go into the last quarter much tighter. So we have pulled back units across all of our brands, and we feel comfortable that the combination of how we're entering with the much tighter receding that will go on in the fourth quarter, we're going to be tight. We're going to be in good shape in terms of inventory. We've guided to that about flat at the end of the fourth quarter, but it's important to remember that, that's lapping a minus 6. So we're going to -- a minus 6 on Q3 ending 2-year minus 6. So we're feeling pretty good because we want to walk that line that we want to have enough inventory to give us the possibility of those positive comps and yet we want to be tight."

So I'm going to be pretty short today. And I just want to reiterate some of the key points as I look at Q3 and Q4 and then springing beyond next year.
Q3 was challenging for Gap and Banana, and again, largely due to the acceptance in women's product which is not what we wanted it to be. Let me make something very clear. We know what the issues are with our products. And we're addressing those pretty systematically. I spend a lot of time reading reviews of our product online, and our customers are very clear in telling us what we're doing well and what we're not doing well. And I'm very confident having seen the product, having been with the teams, that we're addressing these issues and that as we get into spring of next year, we're going to see a material improvement across both Banana and Gap in the product that we're putting in front of our customers.
So I have confidence in the work that we're doing across the company, and I've spoken to you about how we are essentially lifting processes and capabilities from Old Navy and installing them in Gap and Banana Republic. I've seen the product in spring now and in summer across all of the brands, and I'm really excited about how we will be back on track in the spring and beyond next year. I'm also confident in the momentum of the business at Old Navy, and I'm looking forward to the product that they're putting in at the beginning of next year as well.
So let me focus on inventory for a moment. We spent a lot of time in Q3 focused on inventory and getting clean. And I'm really pleased, and Sabrina will provide detail on this, we come into Q4 with our inventories in very good shape. 
That said, we're in a competitive environment. And regardless, Q4 is always a very promotional quarter. And so we reflected the fact that our expectation is that it is going to be a very promotional environment in Q4, and we are prepared to play there.
One of the things that we have done very well, and we've been very committed to, is expense control. We were prudent and delivered against this in Q3, and you have my commitment that we are going to continue to remain very disciplined as we go through Q4.
I'll hand it off to Sabrina in a minute. But I want to say something about where my head is relative to looking forward at the prospects of this company. I'm very confident that we can win. And I'm confident that we can win not on the basis of anything other than the work that the teams are doing to position all of our brands for better and more consistent performance as we get into 2016.
And now I'll turn it over to Sabrina."

As usual, I will begin today by reviewing third quarter performance and then provide an update on our full year guidance.I'd like to note that our third quarter reported results include about $13 million in cost related to our p",776,"Good afternoon everyone. As usual, I will begin today by reviewing third quarter performance and then provide an update on our full year guidance.
I'd like to note that our third quarter reported results include about $13 million in cost related to our previously announced strategic actions. About $7 million of that total is in SG&A, with $6 million in gross margin. This brings our year-to-date cost related to our strategic actions to $107 million.
So starting with sales for the third quarter. On a constant-currency basis, net sales were about flat. Foreign exchange negatively impacted our reported net sales by about $100 million in the third quarter. As reported, net sales were $3.9 billion, down 3% versus last year. Total sales and comps by division are in our press release.
Moving to inventory and gross margin. As previously disclosed, elevated promotional activity pressured margins as we managed through units during the quarter. We did, however, exceed our goal on inventory and ended the third quarter with inventory per store down 4% year-over-year, beating our previous guidance. We expect fourth quarter ending inventory per store to be about flat on top of last year's decline of 6%.
Third quarter gross margin was down 290 basis points to 37.3%, with about 60 basis points of the decline driven by foreign exchange. Merchandise margin deleveraged 240 basis points, with the greatest pressure at Banana Republic. Rent and occupancy deleveraged 50 basis points.
Given the challenging business, we're pleased that our teams continued to manage expenses tightly during the quarter. Marketing expenses were down $34 million to $142 million due largely to lower spend at Gap brand. Third quarter total operating expenses were below last year at $1 billion, including about a $26 million benefit from foreign exchange.
Turning to earnings. Excluding the negative impact from the strategic actions, which was about $0.02, earnings per share were $0.63 or $0.61 on a reported basis. Foreign exchange had about a $0.05 negative impact on third quarter earnings per share or a 6 percentage point negative impact to EPS growth. Additionally, Q3 of 2014 benefited from a discrete tax item that resulted in a lower effective tax rate of 34.5% in the quarter compared with 37.4% this year.
Regarding cash and distributions. During the quarter, we closed on a $400 million term loan. The new funds provide us with additional flexibility, including the opportunity to repurchase shares at what we consider an attractive valuation. Including the proceeds from the loan, we ended the quarter with over $1 billion in cash. Consistent with our commitment to return cash to shareholders, we spent $200 million repurchasing shares during the third quarter and over $800 million year-to-date. We ended the quarter with 404 million shares outstanding. Including our dividend, year-to-date shareholder distributions have totaled about $1.1 billion.
Regarding capital expenditures and store count. Year-to-date capital expenditures were $505 million. And on a net basis, we opened 66 company-operated stores year-to-date and ended the quarter with 3,346 stores. Store count and square footage details are in our release.
And now I'd like to share our outlook for the rest of the year. We are revising our full year earnings per share guidance to $2.38 to $2.42. And we now expect operating margin to be about 10.5%. Our guidance excludes the charges related to our strategic actions which we continued to estimate at around $130 million to $140 million. All other full year guidance metrics remain substantially unchanged.
Now let me take a step back and briefly outline 2 major factors that have changed meaningfully since we set our initial guidance at the beginning of the year. First, Banana Republic significantly decelerated with fall product when we had expected some marginal improvement. Second, it appears to us that the consumer more broadly pulled back on apparel purchasing in Q3, especially outside of value, leaving the sector with inventories probably more elevated than desired entering Q4.
While we've done the work to position ourselves for a successful holiday season entering with tight inventories, we feel our guidance reflects a prudent outlook given what will likely continue to be a highly promotional environment.
As a reminder, 2015 has been negatively impacted by several other items, the 2 largest of which are foreign exchange and the first half port issues. Normalizing for these items, our guidance range implies an underlying EPS decline of about 5% to 6%.
In closing, as we enter the fourth quarter, we'll continue to push forward the turnaround efforts at Gap and Banana and work to maintain the solid year-to-date performance at Old Navy.
Thank you, and now I'll turn it back over to Jack."

If you look at what's in the store right now, the good news is that while we had to work through some inventory in Q3, we are seeing excellent product acceptance right now. So you have your normal -- a few styles that don't work. But overall, the product acceptance is very good, pretty systematically across the board. It's just -- it's -- as you know, as you noted upfront, it's a really tough macro environment right now from the standpoint of the customer. And secondly, compounded -- compounding that, not to make excuses, but a statistic that October was the warmest October ever and we're still seeing the temperatures in the Northeast, et cetera, pretty warm, which obviously means people aren't necessarily ready to buy into particularly sweaters and outerwear. But product acceptance is good. In Gap -- in Gap, we are -- and that's a little what we saw in October, obviously. We're waiting to see how Q4 kicks in, et cetera. As I mentioned in the call, I am very much deep in with the teams across all of our brands, Athleta included, and looking at product that is in development for next year. And we've referenced this before. In Gap, we know we have issues around femininity, around the optimism of the color palette, around the silhouettes that we brought in as big key items. And we've specifically and intentionally corrected those. Fit inconsistency has been an issue, and I think I mentioned this before. We have a very senior person now in a critical role in the company overseeing fit across the entire company and really getting fit consistency, particularly in our bottoms business where it's critical at the end of the day. And I mentioned on the call that I look at reviews. What I would say is this, which is, if you look at reviews, if you get into our stores and talk to our customers, we have a process called Voice of the Customer where we listen to feedback very specifically. We do consumer insights. There's 100% consistency with what our customers want, what is not working for them across all of those touch points. And those are the team -- those are the things that the teams are acting on in both Gap and Banana to get the product back, centered to where it needs to be. So I don't want to get through right now style by style or anything like that. But again, if I come back to Gap casual, optimistic American, we have re-centered the development very much around those filters with consistent fit, with femininity. And if I go to Banana, which is really updated classics with a twist, which is how we've always talked about that business, and quality fabrications, the product development has been very consistent with that as I look at spring and summer."

We -- our issue is that we are not -- we don't have the pricing authority right now that we need to have even from where we were a few periods ago. And so to me, you buy tight and you let some AUR come into the business. And then we do have some capability to feed units into the business if we're seeing styles and programs that are working. And I would rather go in tight with the ability to feed the business than come in heavy and regret it at the end of the day. So obviously, we're looking for comp. We're always looking for comp. But I'm not going to drive comp by just making a massive investment in units until we really have confidence about the product. And so again, buy tight, feed the business, that's the strategy that we'll take for both of those businesses over the course of the next couple of quarters next year."

And if you go back and look over my comments from earlier in the year, I was really hoping that we would get more traction with the new design direction. Obviously, we've made some changes in design and we did that pretty quickly when we felt like we weren't where we needed to be. I have confidence in the current team. I have confidence in the team owning spring and summer. So it's not going to delay what we expect to see as we get into the beginning of next year. But I was not expecting and I'm very disappointed by the deceleration that we've seen, particularly with Banana in the back half. I think I had a much better calibration as to where Gap was and what we were going to be working through but less so with Banana. And that's been a real disappointment to me and a bit of a surprise. I would say competitive context, probably the biggest issue here is just as we've gotten into Q4, I was surprised to see people carrying inventory in as heavy as they actually did. And as I said in my remarks, we'll play -- we are prepared to play in a very promotional environment. But I hope you would give us the benefit that we do really focus on managing inventories pretty aggressively. And I think it's going to be a tough quarter and I think we've had signals, a tough quarter from the standpoint of the consumer promotional environment. And I think we've had signals for a while that the consumer was standing on the sidelines a little bit. And it was just a little bit of a disappointment that we may have some excess inventory and a really promotional environment as we go into Q4. But again, we're prepared to play. It's why we spent what we spent in terms of getting clean in Q3 because we did not want to carry that inventory into Q4."

You start to see conversion move on the basis of the traffic that you have in the store. Word of mouth these days is a super powerful form of marketing. If you just think about Instagram and Pinterest and other social media, that's a very powerful form of marketing. And that will start to bring traffic in.

It's an important outerwear business, an important sweaters business. As I mentioned, we haven't had that cold snap yet, really, across the country that starts to get those businesses going. But we've seen this before. And when you get the cold, she comes in and she shops. So I'm really confident about the product that we have in the stores. But with it being as warm as it has, we're still waiting for demand to really pick up. Also pleased with the traction that Old Navy is getting in denim, and particularly in fashion denim. They've been quite on-trend, especially with rise and silhouette. And we're seeing, again, good product development there that I believe will carry us forward in Q4 as well. And then last thing is that even in Q3, we saw a really encouraging consistency across all divisions in the business. Now there's always going to be a difference between men's and women's and kids and baby. But it's nice to see it when all the businesses are registering good product acceptance. And despite the fact that we are clearing through inventory, which puts some pressure on the business, I do believe we have very good consistent products acceptance across the whole box. And then the last thing I would just call out, which we really expressed in the last few seasons, is the full family Active expression, which is in a category where there is obviously higher-than-market growth. We have that now in the box all the way down to baby, full family, really put it in the stores without displacing any other programs. So it's about incremental productivity.

And I'm glad you raised the question because part of how we're thinking about spring in Gap as an example is where did we not get our fair share. And as a consequence, number one, where are we developing into it and then buying into it to support it. So Oliver, knits is a great example, women's knits. We underdeveloped in 2015. We conceded a fair amount of market share in our women's knits business just because we didn't have the range of development. And as a consequence, as I've looked at spring and then summer, we had very intentional developments to reclaim, and hopefully more than reclaim, our fair share of the knits business. And it's silhouette, it's fabrication and it's for multiple uses. And she comes to us, she comes to Gap brand. Knits is an important part of that spring and summer assortment, year round, but spring and summer in particular. And so it's part of how I look at it and I say, how much risk do I find versus opportunity? And when I look and I say, it's a fair share opportunity of getting our fair share in terms of both development and buying. I'm pretty confident that there's some upside for us there. Dresses is another example where, especially from later spring and summer, there should be a terrific accessible dress business in Gap, shirt dresses and then a variety of knit dress fabrications in particular, short, medium and long maxi dresses. If you look at our LY assortment there, we were very underdeveloped with only a couple of silhouettes. And again, fair share, we left a bunch of money on the table because we really weren't playing with the range of development that we should have had. So both of those are good examples of where I feel like there's opportunity. I'll just go to a third, which is denim. And when I look at products, Oliver, we always take last year's category development and compare it against this year's category development. And so if I look at denim, what I saw last year was a lot of development that was relatively overlapping. So if you had washes, the washes were quite similar across the same silhouettes. When I look at our development this year, I see much more intentional development to create multiple reasons to buy rather than reasons to buy this or that. And so I feel good about the denim development and our opportunity there as well. Those are the approaches that we've taken to every category, whether it's wovens or knits or denim. But those are probably 3 standouts for me where I feel like there is a share opportunity. On the demographic piece, I've said this before and I'll say it again. I feel like Gap is a brand that is at its best. And I saw this in Spades in 2012, where we were on trend with products that our customers expected. We got a mom in there and a mom with her teenage or young 20s daughter in the store. And if you look at where we are probably underpenetrated today, certainly in the millennial customer -- the customer is an older customer in Gap, which we've talked about. And that represents a share opportunity for us across all of our businesses, for sure."

I hope that you would give us credit for building on strength. And whether it's Stefan in the building or not in the building or Jill now as interim leader, there is a team that has found their legs and is driving a great business. And so this is much more about building on strength and maintaining the momentum than any particular need to do a reset of the business at all. That said, we will always tune and tweak and look for opportunity. And one of the things we always do, which hopefully you'll see when you go into our stores, is as we get into Q4, we tend to back away from more fashion visual merchandising in the stores towards a more key item presentation just because of the volume and the capacity that, that gives us in the stores. And it's an easy shopping experience. But that's about tuning and tweaking for the season, not about a reset as to where the brand is or a need to do anything or change anything fundamentally. Sabrina, you want to take on the port?"

Do you feel like there's anything incremental you can do now on the e-comm side or omni-channel side to push on that button? Because clearly, mall traffic and store declines are likely to get worse from here. And then a second question, for Sabrina, on the line of credit and your appetite for buying the stock back here, is there a minimum cash balance or just kind of viewpoint as we look into next year, what your appetite could look like to be buying back stock at the pace you have the last couple of years?"

Let me just -- I'll talk quickly about the e-commerce piece, and then I'll hand it over to Sabrina on the other one. So to me, the big issue and the big opportunity, and it's both an issue and an opportunity, is the continued growth of mobile traffic. Anybody who is telling you the truth will tell you that it's become probably a majority of their traffic, growing very, very fast. And so we are really aggressively focused on making sure that as our traffic pivots from a desktop or a laptop or even a tablet onto a mobile device, that we are able to monetize that traffic. And so it's about a number of things that we've talked about before that we continue to push aggressively on, starting with responsive design that delivers a great mobile experience off of one website but then making sure that the shopping experience is easy, greater use of inventory versus text, a great checkout experience, tap to apply promotion capabilities, which we put in place, and so making sure that the experience is both emotional, immersive and aspirational on mobile device as a brand experience but also transactionally efficient as a customer buying on the mobile device. That's probably the biggest opportunity that we've got right now, and we're very aggressively focused on it. It's moving very quickly. We're excited about it. Our traffic is growing. But the mobile device experience is different than the desktop experience. And we need to make sure that we can make money there in the same way that we can make money on the other real estate.

I think I'm going to start by saying, broadly speaking, nothing has changed with regard to our view on our capital structure and our cash balances. So for some time, Brian, you'll remember, it's important to us we target investment-grade ratios and we've targeted between $1 billion to $1.2 billion of balance sheet cash. We dipped a little bit below that at times. But that's broadly been our target and nothing has changed. Now Q3 always tends to be, like it is for many retailers, sort of our lower point in cash flow because we're building inventories. And then, of course, Q4 is a high cash inflow quarter for us. So we really took the opportunity to execute this term loan just to give us a little bit of flexibility, timing-wise, before all of these Q4 of cash flows came in so that we could continue with our philosophy of being opportunistic and make some purchases on behalf of the shareholders perhaps before all of that Q4 cash flow comes in. So again, broadly speaking, no major change in our philosophy at all."

I guess the only thing that surprised us a bit during the quarter is that Old Navy ended up with a bit of an inventory overage and it looks like you effectively cleared through that product in October. But Old Navy had a really terrific 4% comp, I think, if I got the numbers right in the quarter. So I'm just wondering, does that suggest that the inventory bought for Old Navy was actually bought for an even higher comp?

So I'll back up a little bit, Kimberly, because we definitely try and buy to current demand. We never buy on hope. And so a lot of the work we do on inventory is to make sure that the teams are grounded in current trends, current traffic trends, especially. What happened with Old Navy was really all about September's trends dropping off from what we had seen. So September again was that all-important 5-week month. And we never saw Labor Day come -- or I'm sorry, 5-week month. And we never really saw Labor Day come. And in a high-velocity business like Old Navy where every day of a holiday and certainly every week is very meaningful, when you get backed up, it spells trouble for October. We fortunately, earlier in the year, made a decision across all of our brands, especially Banana and Gap, that we were going to go into the last quarter much tighter. So we have pulled back units across all of our brands, and we feel comfortable that the combination of how we're entering, with the much tighter re-seeding that will go on in the fourth quarter, we're going to be tight. We're going to be in good shape in terms of inventory. We've guided to that about flat at the end of the fourth quarter, but it's important to remember that, that's lapping a minus 6. So we're going to -- a minus 6 on Q3 ending 2-year minus 6. So we're feeling pretty good because we want to walk that line that we want to have enough inventory to give us the possibility of those positive comps and yet we want to be tight."
