Reynolds American reported another great quarter overall in what can only be characterized as a fantastic year.

Reynolds American reported another great quarter overall in what can only be characterized as a fantastic year. With our continued earnings growth momentum and excellent returns to our shareholders in 2014, I'm hopeful that our investors are as pleased as we are with the year's results. Our companies made substantial progress in many areas, but I'd like to call out a few of our key achievements over the past year. 
Our companies strengthened the profitability of their core cigarette and moist-snuff operations through smart business strategies and execution, and the tight focus on efficiency and productivity. And they also continue to invest in the equity of their powerful key brands, growing market share and profitability. 
The marketplace is quite competitive, so that kind of brand performance is a tribute to the company's engaged and expert consumer and trade marketing team. And in keeping with our commitment well investors, our  companies outstanding performance yielded excellent value for shareholders. Total shareholder return, which included a dividend increase of more than 6% was just under 35% for the year, again, significantly outpacing the S&P 500. 
Before I get into more details on the quarter, I want to give you a quick update on our proposed acquisition of Lorillard and the divestiture of certain assets to Imperial. 
As you know, the shareholders of RAI, Lorillard and Imperial Tobacco approved the transaction last month, which was an important milestone. And RAI has substantially complied with the second request for information from the Federal Trade Commission. We do not know the exact timing of an FTC decision, and I can only reiterate that the process continues to proceed as expected, and I remain confident that the deal will close in the first half of this year. 
Before I turn to our review of our company's performance, let me reemphasize the important role that innovation plays as a driving force in our strategy to transform the tobacco industry. Our companies are committed to providing superior products to meet emerging consumer preferences. In 2014, VUSE digital vapor products were rolled out across the country after a highly successful performance in Colorado and Utah. VUSE is now available in about 100,000 outlets, primarily in convenience gas and VUSE is already the top-selling e-cigarette in that channel overall. 
VUSE is truly satisfying. It's simple and it's convenient to use. And importantly, VUSE is earning the trust and credibility of skeptical vapor users because of its proprietary digital vapor technology and its American assembly. These are meaningful points of difference for other consumers and providing them with distinctive products like VUSE is key to gaining a competitive advantage. 
To build on the brand's market-leading position and growth momentum, VUSE added 4 more styles to the Colorado and Utah markets in the December. Rich mint, crema, and mint. Adult smokers and vapor users have shown a high degree of interest in these styles. And although it's still early days, we expect these styles with brother and VUSE appeal to adult smokers and vapors. Another innovation case in point is Niconovum Zonnic NRT gum, which began its national expansion late in the third quarter, following a positive reception from retailers and consumers in Iowa. 
Zonnic also added fruit and cinnamon flavors to its portfolio last year. This roll out is going very well, and the brand is now in about 18,000 outlets, primarily convenience gas and as well as some drug and grocery chains. 
Finally on the subject of innovative products. In the fourth quarter, we announced expansion plans for Revo, which uses proprietary heat not burn technology developed by R.J. Reynolds. R.J. Reynolds expansion of Revo in Wisconsin is now underway, and we believe that evolving consumer expectations and heightened interest in innovative tobacco products will draw attention to Revo. Now let's turn to the discussion of our quarterly results at our operating companies. 
At R.J. Reynolds, fourth quarter earnings and operating margins were substantially higher on increased pricing and the favorable impact from the completion of the federal tobacco quota buyout. And I'm pleased to say that the moderation in cigarette volume decline continued in the fourth quarter as lower gas prices and an improved employment benefited discretionary consumer spending. 
R.J. Reynolds total cigarette market share for the year was quite stable, down  0.1 of a percentage point from the prior year at 26.5%. R.J. Reynolds growth brands, Camel and Pall Mall, continued to perform well and now make up almost 3/4 of the companies total cigarette market share. 
The combined fourth quarter share for these 2 brands grew 0.2 of a percentage point to 19.7%. Camel's quarterly market share was 10.3%, which was up by 0.3 tenths of a percentage point, which was a fitting end to a great year for Camel, an iconic and innovative brand and the company's largest and fastest-growing brand. Next month, Camel will launch the Premium Camel White style in 21 Western states. Available in mellow and menthol, these styles offer an instant filter that provide adult smokers with a unique look and smooth smoking experience. It puts a new unique twist on Camel's rich bold flavor. 
R.J. Reynolds continues to balance Pall Mall's market share and profitability in the value category. And in that context, the brand has done very well and remains by far the nation's #1 value brand. Pall Mall's full year market share of 9.4% was in line with the prior year period. Pall Mall has a distinct and appealing brand and product proposition, and the company is investing in consumer-driven opportunities to expand awareness of Pall Mall's unique brand proposition, genuinely more. 
As you know, Pall Mall's packaging was upgraded in the fourth quarter. All of our companies stay on top of consumer insights and continue to evolve their brands so that they stay fresh, contemporary and exciting to adult smokers. 
Turning to American Snuff. The moist-snuff market remains highly competitive and the company's bottom line was impacted in the fourth quarter by increased promotional spending and a modest decline in volume. This resulted in slightly lower earnings while the operating margin remained very strong. American stuff continues to strike a balance between market share and profit growth for its flagship Grizzly brand. As a result, Grizzly's fourth quarter market share of 31.3% was in line with the prior year quarter and up 0.5 of a percentage point for the full year. American Snuff continues to invest in equity-building initiative to further enhance the brand. For example, Grizzly dark wintergreen is being expanded nationally and has received very positive results in Indiana. Dark wintergreen offers a differentiated darker and richer wintergreen flavor. 
At Santa Fe, performance was very strong once again. Higher pricing in the fourth quarter coupled with higher volume delivered operating income growth of almost 25%. Santa Fe's super premium Natural American Spirit brand added another at 0.3 of a percentage point in market share to 1.8%, making it one of the top 10 cigarette brands in the U.S. 
Natural American Spirit's packaging was also recently upgraded contributing to the growth of its additive-free tobacco style, including those made with organic tobacco. I hope you'll agree with me that RAI and its operating companies posted a successful fourth quarter and a very strong full year. And before I hand the call to Tom for more details, I'd like to say a few words about this upcoming retirement. This will be Tom's last earnings call. He will be succeeded as CFO by Andrew Gilchrist next month. Tom will stay on as Executive Vice President until later this year to ensure a smooth transition and to provide oversight on completion of the transaction and the initial integration process. Tom, you have been an outstanding member of the RAI leadership team, and I thank you for your invaluable contributions to the company's success. And now I'll turn the call over to Tom."

It's good to know that I'll be leaving the business in strong hands. I would like to thank everyone on the call for your interest over these many years, and I wish you well. 
Now let's take a look at the financials. RAI finished the year in strong from, Increasing fourth quarter adjusted EPS by 13% from the prior year quarter to $0.87. Once again, higher pricing with a significant factor and completion of the Federal tobacco quota buyout had a positive impact as well. These major items more than offset lower cigarette volumes and the investments behind VUSE and our company's key brands. These adjusted results exclude a charge of $0.51 per share pensions and postretirement mark to market adjustments, which were mainly due to updated actuarial assumptions on mortality rates. A charge of $0.06 per share for transaction-related and financing costs and a charge of $0.02 per share for Engle Progeny lawsuits. 
On a reported basis, fourth quarter EPS was $0.28, down 48% from the prior year quarter. For the full year, adjusted EPS was $3.42, up 7.2% from the prior year period. This also excludes the items I just mentioned as well as the onetime benefit from the NPM partial settlement, a gain on discontinued operations and charges for implementation costs. 
On a reported basis, full year EPS was $2.75. RAI, again, improved adjusted operating margin. For the fourth quarter, margin was up by 1.2 percentage points from the prior year quarter to 36.6%. And for the full year, it was up 0.1 point at 36.7%. 
Now I'll turn to our operating company's performance, where I'll focus on adjusted results. Please refer to the schedules at the end of our earnings release for reconciliations from our GAAP to adjusted results. 
R.J. Reynolds had another strong run in the fourth quarter with adjusted operating income increasing by almost 14% to $676 million. And for the full year, the company's adjusted operating income was up by more than 8% at $2.7 billion. The company's adjusted operating margin continued to widen in the quarter, increasing 4.4 percentage points to 40.5%, and that brought the full year to 39.6%. As Susan mentioned, the decline in industry cigarette volumes continued to moderate. R.J. Reynolds fourth quarter cigarette shipments declined 4.9% from the prior year quarter while industry volume was down about 2%. 
Wholesale inventory levels for the industry were approximately 6.5 billion units at the end of the fourth quarter, down about 700 million from the prior year quarter while R.J. Reynolds inventory of approximately 1.6 trillion were down about 200 million. At American Snuff, fourth quarter adjusted operating income of $113 million was down 3.2% from the prior quarter. But for the full year, it rose by almost 4% to $442 million. 
The company's operating margin remains strong at 56.4% for the year. As we predicted in our last call, higher promotional sport levels continued in the fourth quarter and because of the highly competitive moist-snuff market, American Snuff saw a 1% decline in volume. Moist-snuff industry volumes was up about 1% in the quarter. American Snuff's flagship Grizzly brand delivered volume growth of 3.5% for the year. 
Now I'll turn to Santa Fe, where higher pricing and volume drove  the bottom line higher. As the company increased fourth quarter operating income by more than 24% to $90 million. That brought full year operating income to $337 million, which was up 20.5%. Santa Fe's fourth quarter operating margin rose 2.6 percentage points from the prior year quarter to 51.7%, bringing the full year to 51.2%. Natural American Spirit's market share gain of 0.3 of a percent that Susan mentioned was on volume growth of 14%. 
Now I'll turn to some other items before opening up the Q&A session. As we reported previously, Reynolds American expanded its revolving credit facility from $1.3 billion to $2 billion in the quarter, and the company ended the quarter with cash balances of $1 billion. Our pension plans remained well-funded on a PBO basis although no additional funding is required this year, I would note that we plan to add just over $100 million to the pension plans. With our companies expected to continue the growth momentum this year, RAI is issuing 2015 adjusted earnings guidance in the range of $3.65 to $3.80 per share. I would note that this guidance excludes any impact from the completion of our proposed transaction, but it does reflect continued investment on VUSE, as well as initiatives to build the equity of our operating company's key brands. Thank you, all. Now I'll turn to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, would you remind our callers how to get in the queue?"

We are very focused on balancing Pall Mall's market share and profitability and this is a very competitive environment but that packaging upgrade didn't cause disruption so we will continue to see Pall Mall playing that role in our value portfolio but we are actually very happy with that performance. Secondly on the smokeless side site I think there's been discussion about the slowdown in growth of the overall category and we're pleased with Grizzly's purple. It's a very competitive environment in the smokeless a relapse. Grizzly over the year picked up have a share point where it was basically flat quarter-over-quarter. The slowdown and the sector, there are some thoughts about that in the context of -- as you know, there are about 8 million vapors and about 5 million of those are users. So in the fourth quarter, did they switch to cigarettes? I think we'll have to see how this plays out. We are confident that the category will continue to grow but we're not sure if it's going to be in the 2% or in the 3% to 4%  growth this year. But again, Grizzly's performed very well, and we will continue to heavily compete in that space."

Reynolds American reported another great quarter overall in what can only be characterized as a fantastic year. With our continued earnings growth momentum and excellent returns to our shareholders in 2014, I'm hopeful that our investors are as pleased as we are with the year's results. Our companies made substantial progress in many areas, but I'd like to call out a few of our key achievements over the past year. 
Our companies strengthened the profitability of their core cigarette and moist-snuff operations through smart business strategies and execution, and the tight focus on efficiency and productivity. And they also continue to invest in the equity of their powerful key brands, growing market share and profitability. 
The marketplace is quite competitive, so that kind of brand performance is a tribute to the company's engaged and expert consumer and trade marketing team. And in keeping with our commitment well investors, our  companies outstanding performance yielded excellent value for shareholders. Total shareholder return, which included a dividend increase of more than 6% was just under 35% for the year, again, significantly outpacing the S&P 500. 
Before I get into more details on the quarter, I want to give you a quick update on our proposed acquisition of Lorillard and the divestiture of certain assets to Imperial. 
As you know, the shareholders of RAI, Lorillard and Imperial Tobacco approved the transaction last month, which was an important milestone. And RAI has substantially complied with the second request for information from the Federal Trade Commission. We do not know the exact timing of an FTC decision, and I can only reiterate that the process continues to proceed as expected, and I remain confident that the deal will close in the first half of this year. 
Before I turn to our review of our company's performance, let me reemphasize the important role that innovation plays as a driving force in our strategy to transform the tobacco industry. Our companies are committed to providing superior products to meet emerging consumer preferences. In 2014, VUSE digital vapor products were rolled out across the country after a highly successful performance in Colorado and Utah. VUSE is now available in about 100,000 outlets, primarily in convenience gas and VUSE is already the top-selling e-cigarette in that channel overall. 
VUSE is truly satisfying. It's simple and it's convenient to use. And importantly, VUSE is earning the trust and credibility of skeptical vapor users because of its proprietary digital vapor technology and its American assembly. These are meaningful points of difference for other consumers and providing them with distinctive products like VUSE is key to gaining a competitive advantage. 
To build on the brand's market-leading position and growth momentum, VUSE added 4 more styles to the Colorado and Utah markets in the December. Rich mint, crema, and mint. Adult smokers and vapor users have shown a high degree of interest in these styles. And although it's still early days, we expect these styles with brother and VUSE appeal to adult smokers and vapors. Another innovation case in point is Niconovum Zonnic NRT gum, which began its national expansion late in the third quarter, following a positive reception from retailers and consumers in Iowa. 
Zonnic also added fruit and cinnamon flavors to its portfolio last year. This roll out is going very well, and the brand is now in about 18,000 outlets, primarily convenience gas and as well as some drug and grocery chains. 
Finally on the subject of innovative products. In the fourth quarter, we announced expansion plans for Revo, which uses proprietary heat not burn technology developed by R.J. Reynolds. R.J. Reynolds expansion of Revo in Wisconsin is now underway, and we believe that evolving consumer expectations and heightened interest in innovative tobacco products will draw attention to Revo. Now let's turn to the discussion of our quarterly results at our operating companies. 
At R.J. Reynolds, fourth quarter earnings and operating margins were substantially higher on increased pricing and the favorable impact from the completion of the federal tobacco quota buyout. And I'm pleased to say that the moderation in cigarette volume decline continued in the fourth quarter as lower gas prices and an improved employment benefited discretionary consumer spending. 
R.J. Reynolds total cigarette market share for the year was quite stable, down  0.1 of a percentage point from the prior year at 26.5%. R.J. Reynolds growth brands, Camel and Pall Mall, continued to perform well and now make up almost 3/4 of the companies total cigarette market share. 
The combined fourth quarter share for these 2 brands grew 0.2 of a percentage point to 19.7%. Camel's quarterly market share was 10.3%, which was up by 0.3 tenths of a percentage point, which was a fitting end to a great year for Camel, an iconic and innovative brand and the company's largest and fastest-growing brand. Next month, Camel will launch the Premium Camel White style in 21 Western states. Available in mellow and menthol, these styles offer an instant filter that provide adult smokers with a unique look and smooth smoking experience. It puts a new unique twist on Camel's rich bold flavor. 
R.J. Reynolds continues to balance Pall Mall's market share and profitability in the value category. And in that context, the brand has done very well and remains by far the nation's #1 value brand. Pall Mall's full year market share of 9.4% was in line with the prior year period. Pall Mall has a distinct and appealing brand and product proposition, and the company is investing in consumer-driven opportunities to expand awareness of Pall Mall's unique brand proposition, genuinely more. 
As you know, Pall Mall's packaging was upgraded in the fourth quarter. All of our companies stay on top of consumer insights and continue to evolve their brands so that they stay fresh, contemporary and exciting to adult smokers. 
Turning to American Snuff. The moist-snuff market remains highly competitive and the company's bottom line was impacted in the fourth quarter by increased promotional spending and a modest decline in volume. This resulted in slightly lower earnings while the operating margin remained very strong. American stuff continues to strike a balance between market share and profit growth for its flagship Grizzly brand. As a result, Grizzly's fourth quarter market share of 31.3% was in line with the prior year quarter and up 0.5 of a percentage point for the full year. American Snuff continues to invest in equity-building initiative to further enhance the brand. For example, Grizzly dark wintergreen is being expanded nationally and has received very positive results in Indiana. Dark wintergreen offers a differentiated darker and richer wintergreen flavor. 
At Santa Fe, performance was very strong once again. Higher pricing in the fourth quarter coupled with higher volume delivered operating income growth of almost 25%. Santa Fe's super premium Natural American Spirit brand added another at 0.3 of a percentage point in market share to 1.8%, making it one of the top 10 cigarette brands in the U.S. 
Natural American Spirit's packaging was also recently upgraded contributing to the growth of its additive-free tobacco style, including those made with organic tobacco. I hope you'll agree with me that RAI and its operating companies posted a successful fourth quarter and a very strong full year. And before I hand the call to Tom for more details, I'd like to say a few words about this upcoming retirement. This will be Tom's last earnings call. He will be succeeded as CFO by Andrew Gilchrist next month. Tom will stay on as Executive Vice President until later this year to ensure a smooth transition and to provide oversight on completion of the transaction and the initial integration process. Tom, you have been an outstanding member of the RAI leadership team, and I thank you for your invaluable contributions to the company's success. And now I'll turn the call over to Tom."

It's good to know that I'll be leaving the business in strong hands. I would like to thank everyone on the call for your interest over these many years, and I wish you well. 
Now let's take a look at the financials. RAI finished the year in strong from, Increasing fourth quarter adjusted EPS by 13% from the prior year quarter to $0.87. Once again, higher pricing with a significant factor and completion of the Federal tobacco quota buyout had a positive impact as well. These major items more than offset lower cigarette volumes and the investments behind VUSE and our company's key brands. These adjusted results exclude a charge of $0.51 per share pensions and postretirement mark to market adjustments, which were mainly due to updated actuarial assumptions on mortality rates. A charge of $0.06 per share for transaction-related and financing costs and a charge of $0.02 per share for Engle Progeny lawsuits. 
On a reported basis, fourth quarter EPS was $0.28, down 48% from the prior year quarter. For the full year, adjusted EPS was $3.42, up 7.2% from the prior year period. This also excludes the items I just mentioned as well as the onetime benefit from the NPM partial settlement, a gain on discontinued operations and charges for implementation costs. 
On a reported basis, full year EPS was $2.75. RAI, again, improved adjusted operating margin. For the fourth quarter, margin was up by 1.2 percentage points from the prior year quarter to 36.6%. And for the full year, it was up 0.1 point at 36.7%. 
Now I'll turn to our operating company's performance, where I'll focus on adjusted results. Please refer to the schedules at the end of our earnings release for reconciliations from our GAAP to adjusted results. 
R.J. Reynolds had another strong run in the fourth quarter with adjusted operating income increasing by almost 14% to $676 million. And for the full year, the company's adjusted operating income was up by more than 8% at $2.7 billion. The company's adjusted operating margin continued to widen in the quarter, increasing 4.4 percentage points to 40.5%, and that brought the full year to 39.6%. As Susan mentioned, the decline in industry cigarette volumes continued to moderate. R.J. Reynolds fourth quarter cigarette shipments declined 4.9% from the prior year quarter while industry volume was down about 2%. 
Wholesale inventory levels for the industry were approximately 6.5 billion units at the end of the fourth quarter, down about 700 million from the prior year quarter while R.J. Reynolds inventory of approximately 1.6 trillion were down about 200 million. At American Snuff, fourth quarter adjusted operating income of $113 million was down 3.2% from the prior quarter. But for the full year, it rose by almost 4% to $442 million. 
The company's operating margin remains strong at 56.4% for the year. As we predicted in our last call, higher promotional sport levels continued in the fourth quarter and because of the highly competitive moist-snuff market, American Snuff saw a 1% decline in volume. Moist-snuff industry volumes was up about 1% in the quarter. American Snuff's flagship Grizzly brand delivered volume growth of 3.5% for the year. 
Now I'll turn to Santa Fe, where higher pricing and volume drove  the bottom line higher. As the company increased fourth quarter operating income by more than 24% to $90 million. That brought full year operating income to $337 million, which was up 20.5%. Santa Fe's fourth quarter operating margin rose 2.6 percentage points from the prior year quarter to 51.7%, bringing the full year to 51.2%. Natural American Spirit's market share gain of 0.3 of a percent that Susan mentioned was on volume growth of 14%. 
Now I'll turn to some other items before opening up the Q&A session. As we reported previously, Reynolds American expanded its revolving credit facility from $1.3 billion to $2 billion in the quarter, and the company ended the quarter with cash balances of $1 billion. Our pension plans remained well-funded on a PBO basis although no additional funding is required this year, I would note that we plan to add just over $100 million to the pension plans. With our companies expected to continue the growth momentum this year, RAI is issuing 2015 adjusted earnings guidance in the range of $3.65 to $3.80 per share. I would note that this guidance excludes any impact from the completion of our proposed transaction, but it does reflect continued investment on VUSE, as well as initiatives to build the equity of our operating company's key brands. Thank you, all. Now I'll turn to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, would you remind our callers how to get in the queue?"

Secondly on the smokeless side site I think there's been discussion about the slowdown in growth of the overall category and we're pleased with Grizzly's purple. It's a very competitive environment in the smokeless a relapse. Grizzly over the year picked up have a share point where it was basically flat quarter-over-quarter. The slowdown and the sector, there are some thoughts about that in the context of -- as you know, there are about 8 million vapors and about 5 million of those are users. So in the fourth quarter, did they switch to cigarettes? I think we'll have to see how this plays out. We are confident that the category will continue to grow but we're not sure if it's going to be in the 2% or in the 3% to 4%  growth this year. But again, Grizzly's performed very well, and we will continue to heavily compete in that space."

Reynolds American reported another great quarter overall in what can only be characterized as a fantastic year. With our continued earnings growth momentum and excellent returns to our shareholders in 2014, I'm hopeful that our investors are as pleased as we are with the year's results. Our companies made substantial progress in many areas, but I'd like to call out a few of our key achievements over the past year.
Our companies strengthened the profitability of their core cigarette and moist snuff operations through smart business strategies and execution and a tight focus on efficiency and productivity. And they also continued to invest in the equity of their powerful key brands, growing market share and profitability.
The marketplace is quite competitive, so that kind of brand performance is a tribute to our companies' highly engaged and expert consumer and trade marketing teams. And in keeping with our commitment to our investors, our companies' outstanding performance yielded excellent value for shareholders. Total shareholder return, which included a dividend increase of more than 6%, was just under 35% for the year, again, significantly outpacing the S&P 500.
Before I get into more details on the quarter, I want to give you a quick update on our proposed acquisition of Lorillard and the divestiture of certain assets to Imperial.
As you know, the shareholders of RAI, Lorillard and Imperial Tobacco approved the transaction last month, which was an important milestone. And RAI has substantially complied with the second request for information from the Federal Trade Commission. We do not know the exact timing of an FTC decision, and I can only reiterate that the process continues to proceed as expected. And I remain confident that the deal will close in the first half of this year.
Before I turn to a review of our companies' performance, let me reemphasize the important role that innovation plays as a driving force in our strategy to transform the tobacco industry. Our companies are committed to providing superior products to meet emerging consumer preferences. In 2014, VUSE digital vapor products were rolled out across the country after a highly successful performance in Colorado and Utah. VUSE is now available in about 100,000 outlets, primarily in convenience gas. And VUSE is already the top-selling e-cigarette in that channel overall.
VUSE is truly satisfying. It's simple and it's convenient to use. And importantly, VUSE is earning the trust and credibility of skeptical vapor users because of its proprietary digital vapor technology and its American assembly. These are meaningful points of difference for adult consumers and providing them with distinctive products like VUSE is key to gaining a competitive advantage.
To build on the brand's market-leading position and growth momentum, VUSE added 4 more styles to the Colorado and Utah markets in December: rich mint, crema, chai and mint. Adult smokers and vapor users have shown a high degree of interest in these styles. And although it's still early days, we expect these styles will broaden VUSE's appeal to adult smokers and vapors. Another innovation case in point is Niconovum Zonnic NRT Gum, which began its national expansion late in the third quarter, following a positive reception from retailers and consumers in Iowa.
Zonnic also added fruit and cinnamon flavors to its portfolio last year. This rollout is going very well, and the brand is now in about 18,000 outlets, primarily convenience gas as well as some drug and grocery chains.
Finally on the subject of innovative products. In the fourth quarter, we announced expansion plans for Revo, which uses proprietary heat-not-burn technology developed by R.J. Reynolds. R.J. Reynolds' expansion of Revo in Wisconsin is now underway. And we believe that evolving consumer expectations and heightened interest in innovative tobacco products will draw attention to Revo.
Now let's turn to the discussion of our quarterly results at our operating companies.
At R.J. Reynolds, fourth quarter earnings and operating margins were substantially higher on increased pricing and the favorable impact from the completion of the federal tobacco quota buyout. And I'm pleased to say that the moderation in cigarette volume decline continued in the fourth quarter as lower gas prices and an improved employment rate benefited discretionary consumer spending.
R.J. Reynolds' total cigarette market share for the year was quite stable, down 0.1 percentage point from the prior year at 26.5%. R.J. Reynolds' growth brands, Camel and Pall Mall, continued to perform well and now make up almost 3/4 of the company's total cigarette market share.
The combined fourth quarter share for these 2 brands grew 0.2 percentage point to 19.7%. Camel's quarterly market share was 10.3%, which was up by 0.3 percentage point, which was a fitting end to a great year for Camel, an iconic and innovative brand and the company's largest and fastest-growing brand. Next month, Camel will launch the Premium Camel White style in 21 Western states. Available in mellow and menthol, these styles offer an inset filter that provides adult smokers with a unique look and a smooth smoking experience. It puts a new unique twist on Camel's rich bold flavor.
R.J. Reynolds continues to balance Pall Mall's market share and profitability in the value category. And in that context, the brand has done very well and remains by far the nation's #1 value brand. Pall Mall's full year market share of 9.4% was in line with the prior year period. Pall Mall has a distinct and appealing brand and product proposition. And the company is investing in consumer-driven opportunities to expand awareness of Pall Mall's unique brand proposition, genuinely more.
As you know, Pall Mall's packaging was upgraded in the fourth quarter. All of our companies stay on top of consumer insights and continue to evolve their brands so that they stay fresh, contemporary and exciting to adult smokers.
Turning to American Snuff. The moist snuff market remained highly competitive. And the company's bottom line was impacted in the fourth quarter by increased promotional spending and a modest decline in volume. This resulted in slightly lower earnings while the operating margin remained very strong. American Snuff continues to strike a balance between market share and profit growth for its flagship Grizzly brand. As a result, Grizzly's fourth quarter market share of 31.3% was in line with the prior year quarter and up 0.5 percentage point for the full year. American Snuff continues to invest in equity-building initiatives to further enhance the brand. For example, Grizzly Dark Wintergreen is being expanded nationally and has received very positive results in Indiana. Dark Wintergreen offers a differentiated, darker and richer wintergreen flavor.
At Santa Fe, performance was very strong once again. Higher pricing in the fourth quarter coupled with higher volume delivered operating income growth of almost 25%. Santa Fe's super premium Natural American Spirit brand added another 0.3 percentage point in market share to 1.8%, making it one of the top 10 cigarette brands in the U.S.
Natural American Spirit's packaging was also recently upgraded, contributing to the growth of its additive-free tobacco styles, including those made with organic tobacco. I hope you'll agree with me that RAI and its operating companies posted a successful fourth quarter and a very strong full year. And before I hand the call to Tom for more details, I'd like to say a few words about this upcoming retirement. This will be Tom's last earnings call. He will be succeeded as CFO by Andrew Gilchrist next month. Tom will stay on as Executive Vice President until later this year to ensure a smooth transition and to provide oversight on completion of the transaction and the initial integration process. Tom, you have been an outstanding member of the RAI leadership team, and I thank you for your invaluable contributions to the company's success.
And now I'll turn the call over to Tom."

I must say it's been a great experience over the years, and I'm proud of the results we have achieved. It's good to know that I'll be leaving the business in strong hands.

It's good to know that I'll be leaving the business in strong hands. I would like to thank everyone on the call for your interest over these many years, and I wish you well.
Now let's take a look at the financials. RAI finished the year in strong from, increasing fourth quarter adjusted EPS by 13% from the prior year quarter to $0.87. Once again, higher pricing was a significant factor and the completion of the federal tobacco quota buyout had a positive impact as well. These major items more than offset lower cigarette volumes and the investments behind VUSE and our company's key brands. These adjusted results exclude a charge of $0.51 per share pensions and postretirement mark-to-market adjustments, which were mainly due to updated actuarial assumptions on mortality rates. A charge of $0.06 per share for transaction-related and financing costs and a charge of $0.02 per share for Engle progeny lawsuits.
On a reported basis, fourth quarter EPS was $0.28, down just over 48% from the prior year quarter. For the full year, adjusted EPS was $3.42, up 7.2% from the prior year period. This also excludes the items I just mentioned as well as the onetime benefit from the NPM Partial Settlement, a gain on discontinued operations and charges for implementation costs.
On a reported basis, full year EPS was $2.75. RAI, again, improved adjusted operating margin. For the fourth quarter, margin was up by 1.2 percentage points from the prior year quarter to 36.6%. And for the full year, it was up 0.1 point at 36.7%.
Now I'll turn to our operating company's performance, where I'll focus on adjusted results. Please refer to the schedules at the end of our earnings release for reconciliations from our GAAP to adjusted results. 
R.J. Reynolds had another strong run in the fourth quarter with adjusted operating income increasing by almost 14% to $676 million. And for the full year, the company's adjusted operating income was up by more than 8% at $2.7 billion. The company's adjusted operating margin continued to widen in the quarter, increasing 4.4 percentage points to 40.5%, and that brought the full year to 39.6%. As Susan mentioned, the decline in industry cigarette volumes continued to moderate. R.J. Reynolds' fourth quarter cigarette shipments declined 4.9% from the prior year quarter, while industry volume was down about 2%.
Wholesale inventory levels for the industry were approximately 6.5 billion units at the end of the fourth quarter, down about 700 million from the prior year quarter, while R.J. Reynolds' inventories of approximately 1.6 billion were down about 200 million. At American Snuff, fourth quarter adjusted operating income of $113 million was down 3.2% from the prior quarter. But for the full year, it rose by almost 4% to $442 million.
The company's operating margin remained strong at 56.4% for the year. As we predicted in our last call, higher promotional sport levels continued in the fourth quarter and because of the highly competitive moist snuff market, American Snuff saw a 1% decline in volume. Moist snuff industry volume was up about 1% in the quarter. American Snuff's flagship Grizzly brand delivered volume growth of 3.5% for the year.
Now I'll turn to Santa Fe, where higher pricing and volume drove the bottom line higher. The company increased fourth quarter operating income by more than 24% to $90 million. That brought full year operating income to $337 million, which was up 20.5%. Santa Fe's fourth quarter operating margin rose 2.6 percentage points from the prior year quarter to 51.7%, bringing the full year to 51.2%. Natural American Spirit's market share gain of 0.3% that Susan mentioned was on volume growth of 14%.
Now I'll turn to some other items before opening up the Q&A session. As we reported previously, Reynolds American expanded its revolving credit facility from $1.3 billion to $2 billion in the quarter, and the company ended the quarter with cash balances of $1 billion. Our pension plans remain well funded on a PBO basis. Although no additional funding is required this year, I would note that we plan to add just over $100 million to the pension plans. With our companies expected to continue their growth momentum this year, RAI is issuing 2015 adjusted earnings guidance in the range of $3.65 to $3.80 per share. I would note that this guidance excludes any impact from the completion of our proposed transaction, but it does reflect continued investment on VUSE, as well as initiatives to build the equity of our operating company's key brands.
Thank you, all. Now we'll turn to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, would you remind our callers how to get in the queue?"

We are very focused on balancing Pall Mall's market share and profitability, and this is a very competitive environment. But the packaging upgrade didn't cause disruption. So we would continue to see Pall Mall playing that role in our value portfolio, but we are actually very happy with that performance. Secondly, on the smokeless side, I think there's been discussion about the slowdown in growth of the overall category, and we're pleased with Grizzly's performance. It's a very competitive environment in the smokeless arena. Grizzly, over the year, picked up half a share point, while it was basically flat quarter-over-quarter. The slowdown in the sector, there are some thoughts about that in the context of -- as you know, there are about 8 million dippers and they -- about 5 million of those are dual users. So in the fourth quarter, did they switch to cigarettes? I think we'll have to see how this plays out. We are confident that the category will continue to grow, but we're not sure if it's going to be in the 2% or the 3% to 4% growth this year. But again, Grizzly's performed very well, and we will continue to heavily compete in that space."

Reynolds American reported another great quarter overall in what can only be characterized as a fantastic year. With our continued earnings growth momentum and excellent returns to our shareholders in 2014, I'm hopeful that our investors are as pleased as we are with the year's results. Our companies made substantial progress in many areas, but I'd like to call out a few of our key achievements over the past year.
Our companies strengthened the profitability of their core cigarette and moist snuff operations through smart business strategies and execution and a tight focus on efficiency and productivity. And they also continued to invest in the equity of their powerful key brands, growing market share and profitability.
The marketplace is quite competitive, so that kind of brand performance is a tribute to our companies' highly engaged and expert consumer and trade marketing teams. And in keeping with our commitment to our investors, our companies' outstanding performance yielded excellent value for shareholders. Total shareholder return, which included a dividend increase of more than 6%, was just under 35% for the year, again, significantly outpacing the S&P 500.
Before I get into more details on the quarter, I want to give you a quick update on our proposed acquisition of Lorillard and the divestiture of certain assets to Imperial.
As you know, the shareholders of RAI, Lorillard and Imperial Tobacco approved the transaction last month, which was an important milestone. And RAI has substantially complied with the second request for information from the Federal Trade Commission. We do not know the exact timing of an FTC decision, and I can only reiterate that the process continues to proceed as expected. And I remain confident that the deal will close in the first half of this year.
Before I turn to a review of our companies' performance, let me reemphasize the important role that innovation plays as a driving force in our strategy to transform the tobacco industry. Our companies are committed to providing superior products to meet emerging consumer preferences. In 2014, VUSE digital vapor products were rolled out across the country after a highly successful performance in Colorado and Utah. VUSE is now available in about 100,000 outlets, primarily in convenience gas. And VUSE is already the top-selling e-cigarette in that channel overall.
VUSE is truly satisfying. It's simple and it's convenient to use. And importantly, VUSE is earning the trust and credibility of skeptical vapor users because of its proprietary digital vapor technology and its American assembly. These are meaningful points of difference for adult consumers and providing them with distinctive products like VUSE is key to gaining a competitive advantage.
To build on the brand's market-leading position and growth momentum, VUSE added 4 more styles to the Colorado and Utah markets in mid-December: rich mint, crema, chai and mint. Adult smokers and vapor users have shown a high degree of interest in these styles. And although it's still early days, we expect these styles will broaden VUSE's appeal to adult smokers and vapors. Another innovation case in point is Niconovum Zonnic NRT Gum, which began its national expansion late in the third quarter, following a positive reception from retailers and consumers in Iowa.
Zonnic also added fruit and cinnamon flavors to its portfolio last year. This rollout is going very well, and the brand is now in about 18,000 outlets, primarily convenience gas as well as some drug and grocery chains.
Finally on the subject of innovative products, in the fourth quarter, we announced expansion plans for Revo, which uses proprietary heat-not-burn technology developed by R.J. Reynolds. R.J. Reynolds' expansion of Revo in Wisconsin is now underway. And we believe that evolving consumer expectations and heightened interest in innovative tobacco products will draw attention to Revo.
Now let's turn to the discussion of our quarterly results at our operating companies.
At R.J. Reynolds, fourth quarter earnings and operating margins were substantially higher on increased pricing and the favorable impact from the completion of the federal tobacco quota buyout. And I'm pleased to say that the moderation in cigarette volume decline continued in the fourth quarter as lower gas prices and an improved employment rate benefited discretionary consumer spending.
R.J. Reynolds' total cigarette market share for the year was quite stable, down 0.1 percentage point from the prior year at 26.5%. R.J. Reynolds' growth brands, Camel and Pall Mall, continued to perform well and now make up almost 3/4 of the company's total cigarette market share.
The combined fourth quarter share for these 2 brands grew 0.2 percentage point to 19.7%. Camel's quarterly market share was 10.3%, which was up by 0.3 percentage point, which was a fitting end to a great year for Camel, an iconic and innovative brand and the company's largest and fastest-growing brand. Next month, Camel will launch the Premium Camel White style in 21 Western states. Available in mellow and menthol, these styles offer an inset filter that provides adult smokers with a unique look and a smooth smoking experience. It puts a new unique twist on Camel's rich bold flavor.
R.J. Reynolds continues to balance Pall Mall's market share and profitability in the value category. And in that context, the brand has done very well and remains by far the nation's #1 value brand. Pall Mall's full year market share of 9.4% was in line with the prior year period. Pall Mall has a distinct and appealing brand and product proposition. And the company is investing in consumer-driven opportunities to expand awareness of Pall Mall's unique brand proposition, genuinely more.
As you know, Pall Mall's packaging was upgraded in the fourth quarter. All of our companies stay on top of consumer insights and continue to evolve their brands so that they stay fresh, contemporary and exciting to adult smokers.
Turning to American Snuff. The moist snuff market remains highly competitive and the company's bottom line was impacted in the fourth quarter by increased promotional spending and a modest decline in volume. This resulted in slightly lower earnings while the operating margin remained very strong. American Snuff continues to strike a balance between market share and profit growth for its flagship Grizzly brand. As a result, Grizzly's fourth quarter market share of 31.3% was in line with the prior year quarter and up 0.5 percentage point for the full year. American Snuff continues to invest in equity-building initiatives to further enhance the brand. For example, Grizzly Dark Wintergreen is being expanded nationally and has received very positive results in Indiana. Dark Wintergreen offers a differentiated, darker and richer wintergreen flavor.
At Santa Fe, performance was very strong once again. Higher pricing in the fourth quarter coupled with higher volume delivered operating income growth of almost 25%. Santa Fe's super premium Natural American Spirit brand added another 0.3 percentage point in market share to 1.8%, making it 1 of the top 10 cigarette brands in the U.S.
Natural American Spirit's packaging was also recently upgraded, contributing to the growth of its additive-free tobacco styles, including those made with organic tobacco. 
I hope you'll agree with me that RAI and its operating companies posted a successful fourth quarter and a very strong full year. And before I hand the call to Tom for more details, I'd like to say a few words about his upcoming retirement. This will be Tom's last earnings call. He will be succeeded as CFO by Andrew Gilchrist next month. Tom will stay on as Executive Vice President until later this year to ensure a smooth transition and to provide oversight on completion of the transaction and the initial integration process. Tom, you have been an outstanding member of the RAI leadership team, and I thank you for your invaluable contributions to the company's success.
And now I'll turn the call over to Tom."

It's good to know that I'll be leaving the business in strong hands. I would like to thank everyone on the call for your interest over these many years, and I wish you well.
Now let's take a look at the financials. RAI finished the year in strong form, increasing fourth quarter adjusted EPS by 13% from the prior year quarter to $0.87. Once again, higher pricing was a significant factor and the completion of the federal tobacco quota buyout had a positive impact as well. These major items more than offset lower cigarette volumes and the investments behind VUSE and our company's key brands. These adjusted results exclude a charge of $0.51 per share pensions and postretirement mark-to-market adjustments, which were mainly due to updated actuarial assumptions on mortality rates; a charge of $0.06 per share for transaction-related and financing costs; and a charge of $0.02 per share for Engle progeny lawsuits.
On a reported basis, fourth quarter EPS was $0.28, down just over 48% from the prior year quarter. For the full year, adjusted EPS was $3.42, up 7.2% from the prior year period. This also excludes the items I just mentioned as well as the onetime benefit from the NPM Partial Settlement, a gain on discontinued operations and charges for implementation costs.
On a reported basis, full year EPS was $2.75. RAI, again, improved adjusted operating margin. For the fourth quarter, margin was up by 1.2 percentage points from the prior year quarter to 36.6%. And for the full year, it was up 0.1 point at 36.7%.
Now I'll turn to our operating company's performance, where I'll focus on adjusted results. Please refer to the schedules at the end of our earnings release for reconciliations from our GAAP to adjusted results. 
R.J. Reynolds had another strong run in the fourth quarter with adjusted operating income increasing by almost 14% to $676 million. And for the full year, the company's adjusted operating income was up by more than 8% at $2.7 billion. The company's adjusted operating margin continued to widen in the quarter, increasing 4.4 percentage points to 40.5%, and that brought the full year to 39.6%. As Susan mentioned, the decline in industry cigarette volumes continued to moderate. R.J. Reynolds' fourth quarter cigarette shipments declined 4.9% from the prior year quarter, while industry volume was down about 2%.
Wholesale inventory levels for the industry were approximately 6.5 billion units at the end of the fourth quarter, down about 700 million from the prior year quarter, while R.J. Reynolds' inventories of approximately 1.6 billion were down about 200 million. At American Snuff, fourth quarter adjusted operating income of $113 million was down 3.2% from the prior year quarter. But for the full year, it rose by almost 4% to $442 million.
The company's operating margin remained strong at 56.4% for the year. As we predicted in our last call, higher promotional support levels continued in the fourth quarter and because of the highly competitive moist snuff market, American Snuff saw a 1% decline in volume. Moist snuff industry volume was up about 1% in the quarter. American Snuff's flagship Grizzly brand delivered volume growth of 3.5% for the year.
Now I'll turn to Santa Fe, where higher pricing and volume drove the bottom line higher. The company increased fourth quarter operating income by more than 24% to $90 million. That brought full year operating income to $337 million, which was up 20.5%. Santa Fe's fourth quarter operating margin rose 2.6 percentage points from the prior year quarter to 51.7%, bringing the full year to 51.2%. Natural American Spirit's market share gain of 0.3% that Susan mentioned was on volume growth of 14%.
Now I'll turn to some other items before opening up the Q&A session. As we reported previously, Reynolds American expanded its revolving credit facility from $1.3 billion to $2 billion in the quarter, and the company ended the quarter with cash balances of $1 billion. Our pension plans remain well funded on a PBO basis. Although no additional funding is required this year, I would note that we plan to add just over $100 million to the pension plans. With our companies expected to continue their growth momentum this year, RAI is issuing 2015 adjusted earnings guidance in the range of $3.65 to $3.80 per share. I would note that this guidance excludes any impact from the completion of our proposed transaction, but it does reflect continued investment on VUSE, as well as initiatives to build the equity of our operating company's key brands.
Thank you, all. Now we'll turn to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, would you remind our callers how to get in the queue?"

We are very focused on balancing Pall Mall's market share and profitability, and this is a very competitive environment. But the packaging upgrade didn't cause disruption. So we would continue to see Pall Mall playing that role in our value portfolio, but we are actually very happy with that performance. Secondly, on the smokeless side, I think there's been discussion about the slowdown in growth of the overall category, and we're pleased with Grizzly's performance. It's a very competitive environment in the smokeless arena. Grizzly, over the year, picked up half a share point, while it was basically flat quarter-over-quarter. The slowdown in the sector, there are some thoughts about that in the context of -- as you know, there are about 8 million dippers and they -- about 5 million of those are dual users. So in the fourth quarter, did they switch to cigarettes? I think we'll have to see how this plays out. We are confident that the category will continue to grow, but we're not sure if it's going to be in the 2% or the 3% to 4% growth this year. But again, Grizzly's performed very well, and we will continue to heavily compete in that space."

Reynolds American reported another great quarter overall in what can only be characterized as a fantastic year. With our continued earnings growth momentum and excellent returns to our shareholders in 2014, I'm hopeful that our investors are as pleased as we are with the year's results. Our companies made substantial progress in many areas, but I'd like to call out a few of our key achievements over the past year.
Our companies strengthened the profitability of their core cigarette and moist snuff operations through smart business strategies and execution and a tight focus on efficiency and productivity. And they also continued to invest in the equity of their powerful key brands, growing market share and profitability.
The marketplace is quite competitive, so that kind of brand performance is a tribute to our companies' highly engaged and expert consumer and trade marketing teams. And in keeping with our commitment to our investors, our companies' outstanding performance yielded excellent value for shareholders. Total shareholder return, which included a dividend increase of more than 6%, was just under 35% for the year, again, significantly outpacing the S&P 500.
Before I get into more details on the quarter, I want to give you a quick update on our proposed acquisition of Lorillard and the divestiture of certain assets to Imperial.
As you know, the shareholders of RAI, Lorillard and Imperial Tobacco approved the transaction last month, which was an important milestone. And RAI has substantially complied with the second request for information from the Federal Trade Commission. We do not know the exact timing of an FTC decision, and I can only reiterate that the process continues to proceed as expected. And I remain confident that the deal will close in the first half of this year.
Before I turn to a review of our companies' performance, let me reemphasize the important role that innovation plays as a driving force in our strategy to transform the tobacco industry. Our companies are committed to providing superior products to meet emerging consumer preferences. In 2014, VUSE digital vapor products were rolled out across the country after a highly successful performance in Colorado and Utah. VUSE is now available in about 100,000 outlets, primarily in convenience gas. And VUSE is already the top-selling e-cigarette in that channel overall.
VUSE is truly satisfying. It's simple and it's convenient to use. And importantly, VUSE is earning the trust and credibility of skeptical vapor users because of its proprietary digital vapor technology and its American assembly. These are meaningful points of difference for adult consumers and providing them with distinctive products like VUSE is key to gaining a competitive advantage.
To build on the brand's market-leading position and growth momentum, VUSE added 4 more styles to the Colorado and Utah markets in mid-December: rich mint, crema, chai and mint. Adult smokers and vapor users have shown a high degree of interest in these styles. And although it's still early days, we expect these styles will broaden VUSE's appeal to adult smokers and vapors. Another innovation case in point is Niconovum Zonnic NRT Gum, which began its national expansion late in the third quarter, following a positive reception from retailers and consumers in Iowa.
Zonnic also added fruit and cinnamon flavors to its portfolio last year. This rollout is going very well, and the brand is now in about 18,000 outlets, primarily convenience gas as well as some drug and grocery chains.
Finally on the subject of innovative products, in the fourth quarter, we announced expansion plans for Revo, which uses proprietary heat-not-burn technology developed by R.J. Reynolds. R.J. Reynolds' expansion of Revo in Wisconsin is now underway. And we believe that evolving consumer expectations and heightened interest in innovative tobacco products will draw attention to Revo.
Now let's turn to the discussion of our quarterly results at our operating companies.
At R.J. Reynolds, fourth quarter earnings and operating margins were substantially higher on increased pricing and the favorable impact from the completion of the federal tobacco quota buyout. And I'm pleased to say that the moderation in cigarette volume decline continued in the fourth quarter as lower gas prices and an improved employment rate benefited discretionary consumer spending.
R.J. Reynolds' total cigarette market share for the year was quite stable, down 0.1 percentage point from the prior year at 26.5%. R.J. Reynolds' growth brands, Camel and Pall Mall, continued to perform well and now make up almost 3/4 of the company's total cigarette market share.
The combined fourth quarter share for these 2 brands grew 0.2 percentage point to 19.7%. Camel's quarterly market share was 10.3%, which was up by 0.3 percentage point, which was a fitting end to a great year for Camel, an iconic and innovative brand and the company's largest and fastest-growing brand. Next month, Camel will launch the Premium Camel White style in 21 Western states. Available in mellow and menthol, these styles offer an inset filter that provides adult smokers with a unique look and a smooth smoking experience. It puts a new unique twist on Camel's rich bold flavor.
R.J. Reynolds continues to balance Pall Mall's market share and profitability in the value category. And in that context, the brand has done very well and remains by far the nation's #1 value brand. Pall Mall's full year market share of 9.4% was in line with the prior year period. Pall Mall has a distinct and appealing brand and product proposition. And the company is investing in consumer-driven opportunities to expand awareness of Pall Mall's unique brand proposition, genuinely more.
As you know, Pall Mall's packaging was upgraded in the fourth quarter. All of our companies stay on top of consumer insights and continue to evolve their brands so that they stay fresh, contemporary and exciting to adult smokers.
Turning to American Snuff. The moist snuff market remains highly competitive and the company's bottom line was impacted in the fourth quarter by increased promotional spending and a modest decline in volume. This resulted in slightly lower earnings while the operating margin remained very strong. American Snuff continues to strike a balance between market share and profit growth for its flagship Grizzly brand. As a result, Grizzly's fourth quarter market share of 31.3% was in line with the prior year quarter and up 0.5 percentage point for the full year. American Snuff continues to invest in equity-building initiatives to further enhance the brand. For example, Grizzly Dark Wintergreen is being expanded nationally and has received very positive results in Indiana. Dark Wintergreen offers a differentiated, darker and richer wintergreen flavor.
At Santa Fe, performance was very strong once again. Higher pricing in the fourth quarter coupled with higher volume delivered operating income growth of almost 25%. Santa Fe's super premium Natural American Spirit brand added another 0.3 percentage point in market share to 1.8%, making it 1 of the top 10 cigarette brands in the U.S.
Natural American Spirit's packaging was also recently upgraded, contributing to the growth of its additive-free tobacco styles, including those made with organic tobacco. 
I hope you'll agree with me that RAI and its operating companies posted a successful fourth quarter and a very strong full year. And before I hand the call to Tom for more details, I'd like to say a few words about his upcoming retirement. This will be Tom's last earnings call. He will be succeeded as CFO by Andrew Gilchrist next month. Tom will stay on as Executive Vice President until later this year to ensure a smooth transition and to provide oversight on completion of the transaction and the initial integration process. Tom, you have been an outstanding member of the RAI leadership team, and I thank you for your invaluable contributions to the company's success.
And now I'll turn the call over to Tom."

I must say it's been a great experience over the years, and I'm proud of the results we have achieved. It's good to know that I'll be leaving the business in strong hands.

It's good to know that I'll be leaving the business in strong hands. I would like to thank everyone on the call for your interest over these many years, and I wish you well.
Now let's take a look at the financials. RAI finished the year in strong form, increasing fourth quarter adjusted EPS by 13% from the prior year quarter to $0.87. Once again, higher pricing was a significant factor and the completion of the federal tobacco quota buyout had a positive impact as well. These major items more than offset lower cigarette volumes and the investments behind VUSE and our company's key brands. These adjusted results exclude a charge of $0.51 per share pensions and postretirement mark-to-market adjustments, which were mainly due to updated actuarial assumptions on mortality rates; a charge of $0.06 per share for transaction-related and financing costs; and a charge of $0.02 per share for Engle progeny lawsuits.
On a reported basis, fourth quarter EPS was $0.28, down just over 48% from the prior year quarter. For the full year, adjusted EPS was $3.42, up 7.2% from the prior year period. This also excludes the items I just mentioned as well as the onetime benefit from the NPM Partial Settlement, a gain on discontinued operations and charges for implementation costs.
On a reported basis, full year EPS was $2.75. RAI, again, improved adjusted operating margin. For the fourth quarter, margin was up by 1.2 percentage points from the prior year quarter to 36.6%. And for the full year, it was up 0.1 point at 36.7%.
Now I'll turn to our operating company's performance, where I'll focus on adjusted results. Please refer to the schedules at the end of our earnings release for reconciliations from our GAAP to adjusted results. 
R.J. Reynolds had another strong run in the fourth quarter with adjusted operating income increasing by almost 14% to $676 million. And for the full year, the company's adjusted operating income was up by more than 8% at $2.7 billion. The company's adjusted operating margin continued to widen in the quarter, increasing 4.4 percentage points to 40.5%, and that brought the full year to 39.6%. As Susan mentioned, the decline in industry cigarette volumes continued to moderate. R.J. Reynolds' fourth quarter cigarette shipments declined 4.9% from the prior year quarter, while industry volume was down about 2%.
Wholesale inventory levels for the industry were approximately 6.5 billion units at the end of the fourth quarter, down about 700 million from the prior year quarter, while R.J. Reynolds' inventories of approximately 1.6 billion were down about 200 million. At American Snuff, fourth quarter adjusted operating income of $113 million was down 3.2% from the prior year quarter. But for the full year, it rose by almost 4% to $442 million.
The company's operating margin remained strong at 56.4% for the year. As we predicted in our last call, higher promotional support levels continued in the fourth quarter and because of the highly competitive moist snuff market, American Snuff saw a 1% decline in volume. Moist snuff industry volume was up about 1% in the quarter. American Snuff's flagship Grizzly brand delivered volume growth of 3.5% for the year.
Now I'll turn to Santa Fe, where higher pricing and volume drove the bottom line higher. The company increased fourth quarter operating income by more than 24% to $90 million. That brought full year operating income to $337 million, which was up 20.5%. Santa Fe's fourth quarter operating margin rose 2.6 percentage points from the prior year quarter to 51.7%, bringing the full year to 51.2%. Natural American Spirit's market share gain of 0.3% that Susan mentioned was on volume growth of 14%.
Now I'll turn to some other items before opening up the Q&A session. As we reported previously, Reynolds American expanded its revolving credit facility from $1.3 billion to $2 billion in the quarter, and the company ended the quarter with cash balances of $1 billion. Our pension plans remain well funded on a PBO basis. Although no additional funding is required this year, I would note that we plan to add just over $100 million to the pension plans. With our companies expected to continue their growth momentum this year, RAI is issuing 2015 adjusted earnings guidance in the range of $3.65 to $3.80 per share. I would note that this guidance excludes any impact from the completion of our proposed transaction, but it does reflect continued investment on VUSE, as well as initiatives to build the equity of our operating company's key brands.
Thank you, all. Now we'll turn to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, would you remind our callers how to get in the queue?"

We are very focused on balancing Pall Mall's market share and profitability, and this is a very competitive environment. But the packaging upgrade didn't cause disruption. So we would continue to see Pall Mall playing that role in our value portfolio, but we are actually very happy with that performance. Secondly, on the smokeless side, I think there's been discussion about the slowdown in growth of the overall category, and we're pleased with Grizzly's performance. It's a very competitive environment in the smokeless arena. Grizzly, over the year, picked up half a share point, while it was basically flat quarter-over-quarter. The slowdown in the sector, there are some thoughts about that in the context of -- as you know, there are about 8 million dippers and they -- about 5 million of those are dual users. So in the fourth quarter, did they switch to cigarettes? I think we'll have to see how this plays out. We are confident that the category will continue to grow, but we're not sure if it's going to be in the 2% or the 3% to 4% growth this year. But again, Grizzly's performed very well, and we will continue to heavily compete in that space."

Is that something that we can expect to see in the numbers in terms of the development of that product as well?"

As you read in today's report, Reynolds American got off to an excellent start this year with sharply higher earnings and operating margin in the first quarter. I'd like to highlight the main reason for these",1080,"Thank you, Morris, and good morning, everyone. As you read in today's report, Reynolds American got off to an excellent start this year with sharply higher earnings and operating margin in the first quarter. I'd like to highlight the main reason for these strong results. First, is the continued strong performance by our operating companies and continued momentum in their powerful key brands. All of our reportable business segments, again, increased profit and operating margins, and they remain focused on strategic initiative to enhance their key brands in the competitive marketplace. 
Our company's results also benefited from higher pricing across the board and the end of the federal tobacco quote buyout late last year. 
In addition, cigarette volumes performed better than the historical decline rate. The decline in shipments continued to moderate, and we believe this was largely driven by improved economic factors, including lower gas prices as well as favorable comparison with the prior year quarter. 
One other development that favorably impacted our bottom line in the first quarter was the one-time benefit from the 2003 NPM adjustment claim. And Andrew will give you more details on that shortly. In addition, I would note R.J. Reynolds' announcement in February that the company, together with Philip Morris and Lorillard, has negotiated an agreement to resolve hundreds of Engle progeny lawsuits that are pending and not yet tried in the Florida federal court. This resolution was a unique opportunity to essentially close out of federal Engle progeny docket, although the agreement still has to be finalized. 
As part of our transforming tobacco strategy, our companies also make additional progress in positioning their innovative product platforms for long-term growth. As you know, RJR vapors
VUSE digital vapor cigarette completed its national expansion in the first quarter, and the brand is now available in about 100,000 outlets, namely convenience and gas stores. 
VUSE, a highly distinctive and superior vapor product continues to perform well, and the brand retained the #1 position in convenience gas outlets. VUSE added 4 more styles in Colorado and Utah late last year and as we expected, these are attracting the interest of adult smokers in vapors. 
Good progress is also being made with the national expansion of Nicotine's, Zonnic and Arteaga, and the brand will be in about 27,000 outlets, primarily convenience gas by the end of this month. 
In February, R.J. Reynolds expanded Revo heat-not-burn cigarettes in Wisconsin. Revo, which uses proprietary technology, is in nearly all contracted retail outlets in that state. Revo is getting strong support from point-of-sales signage and engagement with age-verified adult tobacco consumers as well as direct mail and e-mail for those adults who have registered to receive such information. 
Revo is still in very early days, and the focus remains on building brand awareness. So more to come on this as we get more data. 
So that's a quick update on our company's most recent achievements. I'd like to address one final item before we discuss our companies' performance in more detail. I know that you are all waiting for more news on our proposed acquisition of Lorillard. But all I can say at this point is that the regulatory approval process is still underway, and we remain confident that the transaction will close by the middle of this year. 
So now let's turn to the discussion of our quarterly results at our operating companies. R.J. Reynolds had a very strong quarter, with earnings and margin substantially higher on increased cigarette pricing and the favorable impact from the completion of the federal tobacco quota buyout. As I referenced earlier, the company's cigarette volume decline continued to moderate in the first quarter. 
R.J. Reynolds' total cigarette market share was down 5/10 [ph] of a percentage point from the prior year quarter at just over 26%. R.J. Reynolds' growth brands, Camel and Pall Mall, reflected solid market performance, and now make up about 3/4 of the company's total cigarette market share. Their combined first quarter share of 19.4% was in line with the prior year quarter. 
Camel's market share increased from the prior year quarter to 10.1%, and Camel continues to enhance its brand equity with the expansion of Camel White to 21 Western states in late March. This style, available in mellow and menthol, offers an in-set filter and premium tobacco that provides adult smokers with the perfect draw and smooth taste. 
Pall Mall, the nation's #1 value brand, continued to demonstrate solid performance in that category, and first quarter market share of 9.3% was down only slightly. Pall Mall is a longer-lasting, high-quality product at an affordable price, a true value proposition. And the focus remains on building awareness and trial. 
Now turning to American Snuff, which also generated strong financial performance in the first quarter. The moist snuff market continues to be highly competitive. The company increased its operating income by double-digits. And American Snuff's operating margin remains very strong. The company's overall moist snuff market share declined 2/10 [ph] of a percentage point to 34.5%. And the market share for its flagship Grizzly brand was in line with the prior year quarter at 31.6%. 
In late March, Grizzly expanded its Dark Wintergreen style nationally, a bold product offering that has a differentiated and richer flavor. Grizzly has led the growing Wintergreen segment since 2008, and Grizzly Dark Wintergreen is expected to continue the brand's momentum and further solidify its leadership position. 
I think it's fair to say that the star of the quarter was Santa Fe, where both financial and marketplace performance was outstanding. The company grew operating income by more than 40%. And that, of course, was driven by higher pricing and volume. Santa Fe's super-premium brand, Natural American Spirit, continues to go from strength to strength, and it increased first quarter market share by 3/10 [ph] of a percentage point to 1.8%. 
To put that in perspective, the NAS share increase was the biggest quarter-on-quarter increase in its history. And the brand shipped 1 billion cigarettes in the first quarter. 
Santa Fe is doing a really great job with Natural American Spirit, its expanding consumer franchise and the appeal of the brand's distinctive additive free tobacco style, including those made with organic tobacco continue to deliver impressive results. 
So that's a wrap of a very successful quarter, and I'm delighted with the progress our companies are making on all fronts. 
So now I'll turn the call over to Andrew, and welcome, Andrew, to your first earnings call."

RAI began the year in strong form. The quarter benefited from higher pricing in the completion of the federal tobacco quota buyout, and we increased adjusted EPS by almost 19.5% from the prior year quarter to",617,"Thank you, Susan, and good morning, everyone. RAI began the year in strong form. The quarter benefited from higher pricing in the completion of the federal tobacco quota buyout, and we increased adjusted EPS by almost 19.5% from the prior year quarter to $0.86. These adjusted results exclude a one-time benefit of $0.08 per share from the 2003 NPM adjustment claim. Pennsylvania and Missouri are no longer challenging the findings of non-diligence entered against them by the arbitration panel in connection with this claim. So part of the potential recovery from these 2 states is now certain and can be estimated. As a result, R.J. Reynolds' expenses for the MSA were reduce by $70 million for the first quarter. 
Our adjusted results also exclude a charge of $0.06 per share per transaction-related in financing cost in connection with the proposed Lorillard acquisition, $0.02 per share for tobacco-related and other litigation and the charge of $0.13 per share for Engle progeny lawsuits, including the proposed settlement for the federal cases. 
On a reported basis, first quarter EPS was $0.73, up 9% from the prior year quarter. RAI's adjusted operating margin continued to strengthen, coming in at 37.2% for the quarter. 
Now I'll turn to our operating companies performance, where I'll focus on the adjusted results. Please refer to the schedules at the end of our earnings release for reconciliations from our GAAP to adjusted results. 
R.J. Reynolds performed extremely well, with adjusted operating income increasing by more than 16% to $645 million. The company also increased adjusted operating margin by 4.6 percentage points to just over 40%. 
As Susan said, the company's cigarette volumes continued to moderate and were down 2.4% from the prior year quarter. Industry volume was up about 0.5%. Wholesale inventory levels for the industry were approximately 6.5 billion units at the end of the first quarter, down to [ph] about 200 million from the prior year quarter. While R.J. Reynolds inventories of approximately 1.6 billion were down about 100 million. 
Now I'll turn to American Snuff.  Higher pricing and volume benefited first quarter operating income, which increased 16.7% to $118 million. The company's operating margin rose 3.8% to 58.9%. 
In addition to remaining very competitive, the moist snuff industry is clearly seeing an impact from the shift by adult tobacco consumers between various tobacco and vapor product. Industry volume was up just over 1% in the quarter, and American Snuff's volume increased 0.5%. 
As Susan said, Santa Fe continued to build on its strength and delivered outstanding results in the first quarter. The company increased operating income by nearly 42% to $92 million, and operating margin grew by 5.6 percentage points to almost 54%. These results were driven by the very strong performance of Natural American Spirit, which delivered volume growth of more than 23%. 
Now there are a couple of other items I want to mention before I open up the Q&A session. The company ended the quarter with cash balances of $1.6 billion, and I also want to confirm that R.J. Reynolds made its MSA payment of $1.4 billion in April, which included $429 million that was paid into the NPM disputed funds of Camel. 
Lastly, our outlook. As you can see from today's report, RAI and its operating companies had a great first quarter, and we are reaffirming our full year adjusted earnings guidance in the range of $3.65 to $3.80 per share. Please note that this guidance excludes any impact from our proposed transactions, and we will reassess our guidance after the proposed transactions close.  Thank you, all. 
Now we'll turn to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, would you remind our callers how to get into the queue."

If you think about that and look back to last year, when we saw what everybody was worried about was it was going away very quickly. And we talked about the inventory dollar being spent on vapor and vapor launches in the c-gas space, and that was taking away from inventory dollars in cigarettes. And I think that is proving to be true. So as the year unfolds, of course, this -- the volume will continue to be at this pace. We've always talked about a 3% to 4% decline sort of a long-term measure. Our guess is that this year, it will be on the low end of that. Call it 2 83[ph], 3 2 [ph] something like that. We'll continue to watch and see how that unfolds, but it was a very strong first quarter in volume terms. The other thing I would say about that in the context of the consumer, while there are technical inventory reasons, we also saw good premium mix in the first quarter with lower gas prices, and so we feel that, that has also impacted this -- the volume results. When we think about vapor, I think it's important to say that it's -- as you look at the dynamics of the segment at the moment, it looks like it's kind of flattened out. Now one of the reasons for that is we are lapping at again, huge numbers of launches. And of course, there's been a lot of consumer trial, and consumers are, perhaps, waiting for the next innovation, and we're still looking to get brand awareness and trial on VUSE. VUSE just went really achieve national distribution in the first quarter of this year, and so we certainly are spending to increase brand awareness in trial. As you know, we believe it's a superior vapor product that delivers real satisfaction. And therefore, we continue to invest in that trial. So certainly, as you said in the first quarter, it looks like we spent a fair amount of money, and we did because we're really driving for trial. And we would reiterate that in the medium term, we certainly expect to have very strong margins and profitability on VUSE. Whether that exactly occurs in the second half remains to be seen, because this is still a very volatile and dynamic category. Thanks, Owen."

We've always seen the trial of SNUS, a lot of that came from our moist users. And so they are more experimental.

What we do know is there's been tremendous trial vapor across cigarette smokers. And the conversion has not been as high as we would have liked to see. And yet there is continued use. And so what that would say to us is that people aren't finding the complete satisfaction either from a convenience or from a satisfaction perspective in the vapor space as of today. Now we still believe there's a lot of upside for VUSE because we do know when we get that into the hands of cigarette smokers or people who have already moved to vaping that it is satisfying. So I think we would expect to see is there will be more trial, and we will continue to drive trial on VUSE specifically. But then are consumers who are waiting for something that isn't out there yet. And they're looking for perhaps satisfaction and convenience that's not available as they know it today. So I think that also there is an impact of your second point, which is the contradictory information in the media about the relative less harm of e-cigarettes. And I believe the conversion to e-cigarettes has the potential to be good for public health, and I believe that's still what the data imply. But there is a lot of contradictory arguments. And this is making consumers question whether or not they should be in the vapor category. So I think that it is very important that we continue to see public entities and lawmakers provide consumers with accurate information on the potential for harm reduction across the continuum. And we would -- we continue to be proponents of that. So I think we're just in the timeframe when everything is scrambling, but hopefully, there will be more clarity and there will be more science and more people who have the capacity and the credibility to talk about that science."

399584,290967046,790223,"Reynolds American Inc., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 17, 2015",2015-04-17,"Earnings Calls","Reynolds American Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Morris, and good morning, everyone. As you read in today's report, Reynolds American got off to an excellent start this year, with sharply higher earnings and operating margin in the first quarter. I'd like to highlight the main reason for thes",1075,"Thank you, Morris, and good morning, everyone. As you read in today's report, Reynolds American got off to an excellent start this year, with sharply higher earnings and operating margin in the first quarter. I'd like to highlight the main reason for these strong results. First is the continued strong performance by our operating companies and continued momentum in their powerful key brands. All of our reportable business segments, again, increased profit and operating margins, and they remain focused on strategic initiative to enhance their key brands in the competitive marketplace. 
Our company's results also benefited from higher pricing across the board and the end of the federal tobacco quote buyout late last year. In addition, cigarette volumes performed better than the historical decline rate. The decline in shipments continued to moderate, and we believe this was largely driven by improved economic factors, including lower gas prices as well as favorable comparison with the prior year quarter. 
One other development that favorably impacted our bottom line in the first quarter was the onetime benefit from the 2003 NPM adjustment claim. And Andrew will give you more details on that shortly. In addition, I would note R.J. Reynolds' announcement in February that the company, together with Philip Morris and Lorillard, has negotiated an agreement to resolve hundreds of Engle progeny lawsuits that are pending and not yet tried in the Florida federal court. This resolution was a unique opportunity to essentially close out the federal Engle progeny docket, although the agreement still has to be finalized. 
As part of our transforming tobacco strategy, our company's also made additional progress in positioning their innovative product platform for long-term growth. As you know, RJR 
VUSE digital vapor cigarette completed its national expansion in the first quarter, and the brand is now available in about 100,000 outlets, mainly convenience and gas stores. 
VUSE, a highly distinctive and superior vapor product, continues to perform well, and the brand retained the #1 position in convenience gas outlets. VUSE added 4 more styles in Colorado and Utah late last year and, as we expected, these are attracting the interest of adult smokers in vapors. Good progress is also being made with the national expansion of Niconovum's Zonnic NRT gum, and the brand will be in about 27,000 outlets, primarily convenience gas, by the end of this month. 
In February, R.J. Reynolds expanded Revo heat-not-burn cigarettes in Wisconsin. Revo, which uses proprietary technology, is in nearly all contracted retail outlets in that state. Revo is getting strong support from point-of-sales signage and engagement with age-verified adult tobacco consumers as well as direct mail and e-mail for those adults who have registered to receive such information 
Revo is still in very early days, and the focus remains on building brand awareness. So more to come on this as we get more data. 
So that's a quick update on our company's most recent achievements. I'd like to address one final item before we discuss our companies' performance in more detail. I know that you are all waiting for more news on our proposed acquisition of Lorillard. But all I can say at this point is that the regulatory approval process is still underway, and we remain confident that the transaction will close by the middle of this year. 
So now let's turn to the discussion of our quarterly results at our operating companies. R.J. Reynolds had a very strong quarter, with earnings and margin substantially higher on increased cigarette pricing and the favorable impact from the completion of the federal tobacco-quota buyout. As I referenced earlier, the company's cigarette volume decline continued to moderate in the first quarter. 
R.J. Reynolds' total cigarette market share was down 0.5 of a percentage point from the prior year quarter at just over 26%. R.J. Reynolds' growth brands, Camel and Pall Mall, reflected solid market performance, and now make up about 3/4 of the company's total cigarette market share. Their combined first quarter share of 19.4% was in line with the prior year quarter. 
Camel's market share increased from the prior year quarter to 10.1%, and Camel continues to enhance its brand equity with the expansion of Camel White to 21 Western states in late March. This style, available in mellow and menthol, offers an inset filter and premium tobacco that provides adult smokers with the perfect draw and smooth taste. 
Pall Mall, the nation's #1 value brand, continue to demonstrate solid performance in that category, and first quarter market share of 9.3% was down only slightly. Pall Mall is a longer-lasting, high-quality product at an affordable price, a true value proposition. And the focus remains on building awareness and trial. 
Now turning to American Snuff, which also generated strong financial performance in the first quarter. The moist snuff market continues to be highly competitive, but the company increased its operating income by double-digits. And American Snuff's operating margin remains very strong. The company's overall moist snuff market share declined 0.2 of a percentage point to 34.5%. And the market share for its flagship Grizzly brand was in line with the prior year quarter at 31.6%. 
In late March, Grizzly expanded its Dark Wintergreen style nationally, a bold product offering that has a differentiated and richer flavor. Grizzly has led the growing Wintergreen segment since 2008, and Grizzly Dark Wintergreen is expected to continue the brand's momentum and further solidify its leadership position. 
I think it's fair to say that the star of the quarter was Santa Fe, where both financial and marketplace performance was outstanding. The company grew operating income by more than 40%. And that, of course, was driven by higher pricing and volume. Santa Fe's super-premium brand, Natural American Spirit, continues to go from strength to strength, and it increased first quarter market share by 0.3 of a percentage point to 1.8%. 
To put that in perspective, the NAS share increase was the biggest quarter-on-quarter increase in its history. And the brand shipped 1 billion cigarettes in the first quarter. 
Santa Fe is doing a really great job with Natural American Spirit, its expanding consumer franchise and the appeal of the brand's distinctive additive-free tobacco style, including those made with organic tobacco, continue to deliver impressive results. 
So that's a wrap of a very successful quarter, and I'm delighted with the progress our companies are making on all fronts. So now I'll turn the call over to Andrew, and welcome, Andrew, to your first earnings call."
399584,290967046,790223,"Reynolds American Inc., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 17, 2015",2015-04-17,"Earnings Calls","Reynolds American Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Susan, and good morning, everyone. RAI began the year in strong form. The quarter benefited from higher pricing and the completion of the federal tobacco-quota buyout, and we increased adjusted EPS by almost 19.5% from the prior year quarter to",614,"Thank you, Susan, and good morning, everyone. RAI began the year in strong form. The quarter benefited from higher pricing and the completion of the federal tobacco-quota buyout, and we increased adjusted EPS by almost 19.5% from the prior year quarter to $0.86. These adjusted results exclude a one-time benefit of $0.08 per share from the 2003 NPM adjustment claim. Pennsylvania and Missouri are no longer challenging the findings of non-diligence entered against them by the arbitration panel in connection with this claim. So part of the potential recovery from these 2 states is now certain and can be estimated. As a result, R.J. Reynolds' expenses for the MSA were reduce by $70 million for the first quarter. 
Our adjusted results also exclude a charge of $0.06 per share per transaction-related in financing cost in connection with the proposed Lorillard acquisition, $0.02 per share for tobacco-related and other litigations and the charge of $0.13 per share for Engle progeny lawsuits, including the proposed settlement for the federal cases. 
On a reported basis, first quarter EPS was $0.73, up 9% from the prior year quarter. RAI's adjusted operating margin continued to strengthen, coming in at 37.2% for the quarter. 
Now I'll turn to our operating companies' performance, where I'll focus on the adjusted results. Please refer to the schedules at the end of our earnings release for reconciliations from our GAAP to adjusted results. R.J. Reynolds performed extremely well, with adjusted operating income increasing by more than 16% to $645 million. The company also increased adjusted operating margin by 4.6 percentage points to just over 40%. 
As Susan said, the company's cigarette volumes continued to moderate and were down 2.4% from the prior year quarter. Industry volume was up about 0.5%. Wholesale inventory levels for the industry were approximately 6.5 billion units at the end of the first quarter, down to about 200 million from the prior year quarter. While R.J. Reynolds' inventories of approximately 1.6 billion were down about 100 million. 
Now I'll turn to American Snuff.  Higher pricing and volume benefited first quarter operating income, which increased 16.7% to $118 million. The company's operating margin rose 3.8% to 58.9%. In addition to remaining very competitive, the moist snuff industry is clearly seeing an impact from the shift by adult tobacco consumers between various tobacco and vapor product. Industry volume was up just over 1% in the quarter, and American Snuff's volume increased 0.5%. 
As Susan said, Santa Fe continued to build on its strength and delivered outstanding results in the first quarter. The company increased operating income by nearly 42% to $92 million, and operating margin grew by 5.6 percentage points to almost 54%. These results were driven by the very strong performance of Natural American Spirit, which delivered volume growth of more than 23%. 
Now there are a couple of other items I want to mention before I open up the Q&A session. The company ended the quarter with cash balances of $1.6 billion, and I also want to confirm that R.J. Reynolds made its MSA payment of $1.4 billion in April, which included $429 million that was paid into the NPM disputed funds account. 
Lastly, our outlook. As you can see from today's report, RAI and its operating companies had a great first quarter, and we are reaffirming our full year adjusted earnings guidance in the range of $3.65 to $3.80 per share. Please note that this guidance excludes any impact from our proposed transactions, and we will reassess our guidance after the proposed transactions close.  Thank you, all. 
Now we'll turn to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, would you remind our callers how to get into the queue."

And I think that is proving to be true. So as the year unfolds, of course, this -- the volume will continue to be at this pace. We've always talked about a 3% to 4% decline in sort of a long-term measure. Our guess is that this year it will be on the low end of that, call it 2.8%, 3%, 3.2%, something like that. We'll continue to watch and see how that unfolds. But it was a very strong first quarter in volume terms. The other thing I would say about that in the context of the consumer, while there are technical inventory reasons, we also saw good premium mix in the first quarter with lower gas prices, and so we feel that, that has also impacted this -- the volume results. When we think about vapor, I think it's important to say that it's -- as you look at the dynamics of the segment at the moment, it looks like it's kind of flattened out. Now one of the reason for that is we are lapping at, again, huge numbers of launches. And of course, there's been a lot of consumer trial, and consumers are, perhaps, waiting for the next innovation. And we're still looking to get brand awareness and trial on VUSE. VUSE just went really -- achieve national distribution in the first quarter of this year, and so we certainly are spending to increase brand awareness in trial. As you know, we believe it's a superior vapor product that delivers real satisfaction. And therefore, we continue to invest in that trial. So certainly, as you said in the first quarter, it looks like we spent a fair amount of money, and we did because we're really driving for trial. And we would reiterate that in the medium term, we certainly expect to have very strong margins and profitability on VUSE. Whether that exactly occurs in the second half remains to be seen, because this is still a very volatile and dynamic category. Thanks, Owen."

Although the broad vapor market is still growing quite a bit, the growth seems to have moderated. And a couple of concerns I have include when the performance of existing products in the market still isn't strong enough for greater conversion from combustible cigs.

As I said, I think we've also seen, and I think your report on that was absolutely right that we're seeing flattening in the space. Of course, there's continued growth of the tanks and the mods and the liquids and how does that affect the cig-alike market, and it's still very, very dynamic. What we do know is there's been tremendous trial of vapor across cigarette smokers. And the conversion has not been as high as we would have liked to see, and yet there is continued use. And so what that would say to us is that people aren't finding the complete satisfaction, either from a convenience or from a satisfaction perspective, in the vapor space as of today. Now we still believe there's a lot of upside for VUSE because we do know when we get that into the hands of cigarette smokers or people who've already moved to vaping that it is satisfying. So I think we would expect to see is there will be more trial, and we will continue to drive trial on VUSE specifically. But then there are consumers who are waiting for something that isn't out there yet. And they're looking for, perhaps, satisfaction and convenience that's not available as they know it today. So I think that also -- there is an impact of your second point, which is the contradictory information in the media about the relative less harm of e-cigarettes. And I believe the conversion to e-cigarettes has the potential to be good for public health, and I believe that's still what the data imply. But there is a lot of contradictory arguments. And this is making consumers question whether or not they should be in the vapor category. So I think that it is very important that we continue to see public entities and lawmakers provide consumers with accurate information on the potential for harm reduction across the continuum. And we would -- we continue to be proponents of that. So I think we're just in the timeframe when everything is scrambling. But hopefully, there will be more clarity and there will be more science and more people who have the capacity and the credibility to talk about that science."

Today, we'll review Reynolds American's result for the first quarter and our outlook for the full year. As usual, our discussion will focus on adjusted results as management believes this provides better perspective on our underlying business performance. A reconciliation of reported to adjusted earnings is in our press release, which is available on our website at reynoldsamerican.com. Joining me this morning are RAI's President and CEO, Susan Cameron; and Andrew Gilchrist, our CFO.
The information we're about to discuss includes forward-looking statements. When we talk about future results or events, a number of factors could generate results that are materially different from our projections today. These factors include, but are not limited to, items detailed in our press release and SEC filings. Except as provided by federal securities laws, we are not required to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement. 
And now I'll turn the call over to Susan."
399584,290967046,790251,"Reynolds American Inc., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 17, 2015",2015-04-17,"Earnings Calls","Reynolds American Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Morris, and good morning, everyone. As you read in today's report, Reynolds American got off to an excellent start this year, with sharply higher earnings and operating margin in the first quarter. I'd like to highlight the main reason for thes",1075,"Thank you, Morris, and good morning, everyone. As you read in today's report, Reynolds American got off to an excellent start this year, with sharply higher earnings and operating margin in the first quarter. I'd like to highlight the main reason for these strong results. First is the continued strong performance by our operating companies and continued momentum in their powerful key brands. All of our reportable business segments again increased profit and operating margins, and they remain focused on strategic initiative to enhance their key brands in the competitive marketplace. 
Our company's results also benefited from higher pricing across the board and the end of the federal tobacco-quota buyout late last year. In addition, cigarette volumes performed better than the historical decline rate. The decline in shipments continued to moderate, and we believe this was largely driven by improved economic factors, including lower gas prices as well as favorable comparison with the prior year quarter. 
One other development that favorably impacted our bottom line in the first quarter was the onetime benefit from the 2003 NPM adjustment claim. And Andrew will give you more details on that shortly. In addition, I would note R.J. Reynolds' announcement in February that the company, together with Philip Morris and Lorillard, has negotiated an agreement to resolve hundreds of Engle progeny lawsuits that are pending and not yet tried in the Florida federal court. This resolution was a unique opportunity to essentially close out the federal Engle progeny docket, although the agreement still has to be finalized. 
As part of our transforming tobacco strategy, our companies also made additional progress in positioning their innovative product platforms for long-term growth. As you know, RJR vapors,
VUSE, digital vapor cigarette, completed its national expansion in the first quarter, and the brand is now available in about 100,000 outlets, mainly convenience and gas stores. 
VUSE, a highly distinctive and superior vapor product, continues to perform well, and the brand retains the #1 position in convenience gas outlets. VUSE added 4 more styles in Colorado and Utah late last year and, as we expected, these are attracting the interest of adult smokers in vapors. Good progress is also being made with the national expansion of Niconovum's Zonnic NRT gum, and the brand will be in about 27,000 outlets, primarily convenience gas, by the end of this month. 
In February, R.J. Reynolds expanded Revo heat-not-burn cigarettes in Wisconsin. Revo, which uses proprietary technology, is in nearly all contracted retail outlets in that state. Revo is getting strong support from point-of-sales signage and engagement with age-verified adult tobacco consumers as well as direct mail and e-mail for those adults who have registered to receive such information. 
Revo is still in very early days, and the focus remains on building brand awareness. So more to come on this as we get more data. 
So that's a quick update on our company's most recent achievements. I'd like to address one final item before we discuss our company's performance in more detail. I know that you are all waiting for more news on our proposed acquisition of Lorillard. But all I can say at this point is that the regulatory approval process is still underway, and we remain confident that the transaction will close by the middle of this year. 
So now let's turn to the discussion of our quarterly results at our operating companies. R.J. Reynolds had a very strong quarter, with earnings and margin substantially higher on increased cigarette pricing and the favorable impact from the completion of the federal tobacco-quota buyout. As I referenced earlier, the company's cigarette volume decline continued to moderate in the first quarter. 
R.J. Reynolds' total cigarette market share was down 0.5 of a percentage point from the prior year quarter at just over 26%. R.J. Reynolds' growth brands, Camel and Pall Mall, reflected solid market performance, and now make up about 3/4 of the company's total cigarette market share. Their combined first quarter share of 19.4% was in line with the prior year quarter. 
Camel's market share increased from the prior year quarter to 10.1%, and Camel continues to enhance its brand equity with the expansion of Camel White to 21 Western states in late March. This style, available in mellow and menthol, offers an inset filter and premium tobacco that provides adult smokers with the perfect draw and smooth taste. 
Pall Mall, the nation's #1 value brand, continued to demonstrate solid performance in that category, and first quarter market share of 9.3% was down only slightly. Pall Mall is a longer-lasting, high-quality product at an affordable price, a true value proposition. And the focus remains on building awareness and trial. 
Now turning to American Snuff, which also generated strong financial performance in the first quarter. The moist snuff market continues to be highly competitive, but the company increased its operating income by double-digits. And American Snuff's operating margin remained very strong. The company's overall moist snuff market share declined 0.2 of a percentage point to 34.5%. And the market share for its flagship Grizzly brand was in line with the prior year quarter at 31.6%. 
In late March, Grizzly expanded its Dark Wintergreen style nationally, a bold product offering that has a differentiated and richer flavor. Grizzly has led the growing Wintergreen segment since 2008, and Grizzly Dark Wintergreen is expected to continue the brand's momentum and further solidify its leadership position. 
I think it's fair to say that the star of the quarter was Santa Fe, where both financial and marketplace performance was outstanding. The company grew operating income by more than 40%. And that, of course, was driven by higher pricing and volume. Santa Fe's super-premium brand, Natural American Spirit, continues to go from strength to strength, and it increased first quarter market share by 0.3 of a percentage point to 1.8%. 
To put that in perspective, the NAS share increase was the biggest quarter-on-quarter increase in its history. And the brand shipped 1 billion cigarettes in the first quarter. 
Santa Fe is doing a really great job with Natural American Spirit. Its expanding consumer franchise and the appeal of the brand's distinctive additive-free tobacco style, including those made with organic tobacco, continue to deliver impressive results. 
So that's a wrap of a very successful quarter, and I'm delighted with the progress our companies are making on all fronts. So now I'll turn the call over to Andrew, and welcome, Andrew, to your first earnings call."
399584,290967046,790251,"Reynolds American Inc., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 17, 2015",2015-04-17,"Earnings Calls","Reynolds American Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Susan, and good morning, everyone. RAI began the year in strong form. The quarter benefited from higher pricing and the completion of the federal tobacco-quota buyout, and we increased adjusted EPS by almost 19.5% from the prior year quarter to",614,"Thank you, Susan, and good morning, everyone. RAI began the year in strong form. The quarter benefited from higher pricing and the completion of the federal tobacco-quota buyout, and we increased adjusted EPS by almost 19.5% from the prior year quarter to $0.86. These adjusted results excluded a one-time benefit of $0.08 per share from the 2003 NPM adjustment claim. Pennsylvania and Missouri are no longer challenging the findings of non-diligence entered against them by the arbitration panel in connection with this claim. So part of the potential recovery from these 2 states is now certain and can be estimated. As a result, R.J. Reynolds' expenses for the MSA were reduced by $70 million for the first quarter. 
Our adjusted results also exclude a charge of $0.06 per share for transaction-related and financing costs in connection with the proposed Lorillard acquisition, $0.02 per share for tobacco-related and other litigation and the charge of $0.13 per share for Engle progeny lawsuits, including the proposed settlement for the federal cases. 
On a reported basis, first quarter EPS was $0.73, up 9% from the prior year quarter. RAI's adjusted operating margin continued to strengthen, coming in at 37.2% for the quarter. 
Now I'll turn to our operating companies' performance, where I'll focus on adjusted results. Please refer to the schedules at the end of our earnings release for reconciliations from our GAAP to adjusted results. R.J. Reynolds performed extremely well, with adjusted operating income increasing by more than 16% to $645 million. The company also increased adjusted operating margin by 4.6 percentage points to just over 40%. 
As Susan said, the company's cigarette volumes continued to moderate and were down 2.4% from the prior year quarter. Industry volume was up about 0.5%. Wholesale inventory levels for the industry were approximately 6.5 billion units at the end of the first quarter, down 2 -- about 200 million from the prior year quarter, while R.J. Reynolds' inventories of approximately 1.6 billion were down about 100 million. 
Now I'll turn to American Snuff. Higher pricing and volume benefited first quarter operating income, which increased 16.7% to $118 million. The company's operating margin rose 3.8% to 58.9%. In addition to remaining very competitive, the moist snuff industry is clearly seeing an impact from the shift by adult tobacco consumers between various tobacco and vapor product. Industry volume was up just over 1% in the quarter, and American Snuff's volume increased 0.5%. 
As Susan said, Santa Fe continued to build on its strength and delivered outstanding results in the first quarter. The company increased operating income by nearly 42% to $92 million, and operating margin grew by 5.6 percentage points to almost 54%. These results were driven by the very strong performance of Natural American Spirit, which delivered volume growth of more than 23%. 
Now there are a couple of other items I want to mention before I open up the Q&A session. The company ended the quarter with cash balances of $1.6 billion, and I also want to confirm that R.J. Reynolds made its MSA payment of $1.4 billion in April, which included $429 million that was paid into the NPM disputed funds account. 
Lastly, our outlook. As you can see from today's report, RAI and its operating companies had a great first quarter, and we are reaffirming our full year adjusted earnings guidance in the range of $3.65 to $3.80 per share. Please note that this guidance excludes any impact from our proposed transactions, and we will reassess our guidance after the proposed transactions close.  Thank you, all. 
Now we'll turn to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, would you remind our callers how to get into the queue."

If you think about that and look back to last year when we saw, what everybody was worried about, was it was going away very quickly. And we talked about the inventory dollars being spent on vapor and vapor launches in the C-GAS space and that, that was taking away from inventory dollars in cigarettes. And I think that is proving to be true. So as the year unfolds, of course, this -- the volume will continue to be at this pace. We've always talked about a 3% to 4% decline as sort of a long-term measure. Our guess is that this year it will be on the low end of that, call it 2.8%, 3%, 3.2%, something like that. We'll continue to watch and see how that unfolds. But it was a very strong first quarter in volume terms. The other thing I would say about that in the context of the consumer, while there are technical inventory reasons, we also saw good premium mix in the first quarter with lower gas prices, and so we feel that, that has also impacted this -- the volume results. When we think about vapor, I think it's important to say that it's -- as you look at the dynamics of the segment at the moment, it looks like it's kind of flattened out. Now one of the reasons for that is we are lapping it, again, huge numbers of launches. And of course, there's been a lot of consumer trial, and consumers are perhaps waiting for the next innovation. And we're still looking to get brand awareness and trial on VUSE. VUSE just went really -- achieved national distribution in the first quarter of this year, and so we certainly are spending to increase brand awareness in trial. As you know, we believe it's a superior vapor product that delivers real satisfaction. And therefore, we continue to invest in that trial. So certainly, as you said in the first quarter, it looks like we spent a fair amount of money, and we did because we're really driving for trial. And we would reiterate that in the medium term, we certainly expect to have very strong margins and profitability on VUSE. Whether that exactly occurs in the second half remains to be seen, because this is still a very volatile and dynamic category. Thanks, Owen."

One, certainly, is your hypothesis that as the consumers are feeling better and they have a choice between cigarettes and moist, and they want to have a cigarette. That is happening. Second of all, of course, moist users seem to be the most promiscuous, if you will, across the new alternatives. So we see a lot of trial in vapor amongst moist users. We've always seen the trial of SNUS, a lot of that came from our moist users. And so they are more experimental. And so correspondingly, we see, I think it was 1% or so growth in that moist category in the first quarter. We're very pleased with Grizzly's performance, strong financial performance in a very competitive environment. The share, year-over-year, relatively flat. But we continue to lead the Wintergreen category and our pouch, which is also the -- one of the fastest-growing category, is also the fastest growing.

As I said, I think we've also seen, and I think your report on that was absolutely right that we're seeing flattening in the space. Of course, there's continued growth of the tanks and the mods and the liquids and how does that affect the cig-alike market, and it's still very, very dynamic. What we do know is there's been tremendous trial of vapor across cigarette smokers. And the conversion has not been as high as we would have liked to see, and yet there is continued use. And so what that would say to us is that people aren't finding the complete satisfaction, either from a convenience or from a satisfaction perspective, in the vapor space as of today. Now we still believe there's a lot of upside for VUSE because we do know when we get that into the hands of cigarette smokers or people who have already moved to vaping, that it is satisfying. So I think what we would expect to see is there will be more trial, and we will continue to drive trial on VUSE specifically. But that then there are consumers who are waiting for something that isn't out there yet. And they're looking for, perhaps, satisfaction and convenience that's not available as they know it today. So I think that also -- there is an impact of your second point, which is the contradictory information in the media about the relative less harm of e-cigarettes. And I believe that conversion to e-cigarettes has the potential to be good for public health, and I believe that's still what the data implies. But there is a lot of contradictory arguments. And this is making consumers question whether or not they should be in the vapor category. So I think that it is very important that we continue to see public entities and lawmakers provide consumers with accurate information on the potential for harm reduction across the continuum. And we would -- we continue to be proponents of that. So I think we're just in the timeframe when everything is scrambling. But hopefully, there will be more clarity and there will be more science and more people who have the capacity and the credibility to talk about that science."

As our report today makes clear, we accomplished a great deal during the second quarter, making further progress in our continuing transformation journey. In mid-June, of course, we successfully completed RAI",1567,"Thank you, Morris, and good morning, everyone. As our report today makes clear, we accomplished a great deal during the second quarter, making further progress in our continuing transformation journey. In mid-June, of course, we successfully completed RAI's purchase of Lorillard and the related divestiture to ITG Brands. And I'm pleased to say that the integration of the Newport brand is going very well. Our employees have done a fantastic job in managing the initial transition. In fact, RAI had an excellent quarter, reporting substantially higher earnings and operating margin, and that wrapped up a very successful first half. These results reflected strong financial performance at all of our operating companies and continued momentum behind their distinctive brands. Of course, I would note that given the timing of the closing in mid-June, second quarter results versus last year are not directly comparable. 
So it was a strong second quarter in first half, marked by higher pricing across the board and strong volumes. And now we're poised for new growth following the acquisition. As we settle along, the addition of the Newport brand will give R.J. Reynolds increased scale and improved operational efficiencies, as well as higher sales volumes, resulting from the complementary nature of the Newport and the rest of R.J. Reynolds's cigarette portfolio. The result will be a significantly more profitable business that will continue to reward shareholders and fuel the continued research development and innovation that our companies need for long term sustainability in a changing environment. 
Our transition is still far from complete and here, I would remind you that the manufacturing of Newport will continue under a reciprocal agreement until production is fully transferred to the tobacco bill manufacturing facility later next year. 
A good deal of work remains to be done, but we have a great track record in executing these kinds of combinations and I'm confident that the process will continue to run smoothly. The second quarter's strong business performance has reinforced our confidence in the continuing strength of our operating companies, so we're making several important announcements this morning. We are increasing our quarterly cash dividend by 7.5%. This is our 12th dividend increase since RAI was formed in 2004. We're also implementing a 2-for-1 stock split, which will be our third stock split since 2004. In addition, we have increased our adjusted earnings growth projection for the year to a range of 11% to 17% over last year's adjusted results. That compares with our previous 2015 guidance of 6.7% to 11% growth. I think you'll agree that these actions clearly demonstrate a high level of conviction for our businesses, as well as our commitment to returning value to our shareholders. And Andrew will be giving you some more details shortly. 
Before I move on to the discuss our operating performance, I'd like to give you a quick update on our progress with other key aspects of our transforming tobacco strategy. I'm pleased to report that RJR Vapor's VUSE digital vapor cigarette continued to perform well in the second quarter. VUSE, which uses digital technology to deliver a superior vaping experience, has been a consistent category leader. VUSE is now in national distribution in more than 100,000 retail outlets and has solidified its position as the top-selling electronic cigarette in the C-store channel. VUSE's success is based not just on its strong and distinctive product qualities, the brand also offers retailers best-in-class support, with high-impact national and local marketing campaign. We continue to see great promise in the vapor category, and we will continue to innovate and invest to keep VUSE as the leading, most advanced product in the marketplace. 
Good progress also continues to be made with the national expansion of Niconovum, Zonnic, NRT Gum, and the brand is now in about 25,000 outlets. Zonnic is the leading NRT in the convenience gas channel, and we expect its phased expansion to continue into next year. Also, as you know, R.J. Reynolds expanded Revo, heat-not-burn cigarette, into Wisconsin in February, to gain learning on consumer interest and heat-not-burn products. Revo has seen consumer interest and trial, but actual adoption rates of the product have not met our expectations. As a result, R.J. Reynolds has decided to discontinue marketing support for Revo in Wisconsin. However, we do remain optimistic about the long term potential for heat-not-burn, and continue to work to improve this technology. 
So that great quick review of the quarter's main headlines. Before I turn to discussion of results at our operating companies, I would just note here that we have refreshed our corporate branding and redesigned our website to reflect the new brand portfolio, and there will be more news on that in early August. 
I'd also note that we changed the method of measuring our operating companies, cigarettes and moist snuff retail market share, to more accurately reflect marketplace performance across all channels. While absolute retail market share levels may differ from previously reported data, the overall trends are not materially different. 
Now let's start the discussion with traditional cigarettes, which we refer to as combustible. Total RAI operating companies domestic cigarette volumes increased 5.6% in the second quarter and 2.4% for the first 6 months of 2015. This compares to cigarette industry gains of 1.9% and 1.2% during the same periods. However, on an inventory adjusted basis, industry cigarette volumes were down slightly for both periods. Total RAI operating companies domestic retail market share increased 0.2 of a percentage point to 33.6% in the second quarter and 0.1 of a percentage point to 33.8% for the first half of 2015. 
R.J. Reynolds' turned in another strong quarter, supported by higher cigarette pricing and the completion of the federal tobacco-quota buyout. In addition, the company's cigarette shipments increased in the second quarter, benefiting from the addition of 2 weeks of Newport. R.J. Reynolds's cigarette volumes therefore increased by almost 4.5%. I also need to note that R.J. Reynolds's retail market share is presented on a pro forma basis, which reflects share information from the company's new brand portfolio, following the Lorillard acquisition and the related divestiture. As a result, R.J. Reynolds's total cigarette retail market share was down slightly from the prior year quarter at 31.8%. 
R.J. Reynolds's new portfolio of growth brands, Newport, Camel and Pall Mall, performed well in the second quarter, and now make up more than 90% of the company's total cigarette market share. Their combined second quarter share was 29.2%, and that was up 0.2 of a percentage point from the prior year quarter. 
Newport continued to advance in the second quarter, with share of retail shipments increasing 0.4 of a percentage point from the prior year quarter to 13.2%. Newport's gains were driven by its strength in menthol and R.J. Reynolds's strategy going forward will be to energize and reinforce this powerful brand. 
Camel also continued to benefit from its menthol styles that use capsule technology. And the brand's total cigarette retail market share was in line with the prior year quarter at 8.2%. 
R.J. Reynolds's Pall Mall value brand is playing in an essential role in the company's portfolio strategy by providing the right balance between market share and profitability. As a result, Pall Mall's second quarter retail market share of 7.8% was down 0.3 of a percentage point from the prior year quarter. This true value proposition is expected to benefit from additional brand equity building efforts going forward, resulting in increased trial and conversion. 
At Santa Fe, performance continues to exceed even our own high expectation. The company increased second quarter operating income by almost 50% and reported a significant quarterly jump in operating margin. The Santa Fe team is really executing wonderfully, and of course, the Natural American Spirit brand is the driving force. This undiscounted super-premium brand ended the quarter with a retail market share of 1.8% on volume growth of just over 25%. 
Natural American Spirit has a loyal and growing franchise, and the brand's strength is based on its distinctive additive-free tobacco style, including those made with organic tobacco. 
Now turning to moist snuff. In American Snuff strong performance. Higher pricing and volume came through for the company in the second quarter and operating income again grew by double digits. Moist snuff industry volumes continued to be impacted by consumer shift between various tobacco products, and the industry remains very competitive. Even so, American Snuff's second quarter moist snuff volume increased by 6%, almost double the moist industry volume growth. 
The company's moist snuff retail market share increased 1.1 percentage points to 33.8% in the second quarter. American Snuff flagship brands Grizzly, performed very well in the second quarter, with its retail market share increasing 1.3 percentage points to 31.1%, as this was on volume growth of just over 7%. 
Grizzly's momentum is being driven by its popular pouch style, which is the fastest-growing stye of moist snuff and represents about 18% of the total category. The brand's Dark Wintergreen style, which was expanded nationally in March, is also performing well and contributing to Grizzly's growth. 
So as you can see, it's been a really terrific quarter for our company. And as I said earlier, there's a lot of work still to be done with the integration of Newport, but this kind of performance bodes very well for the rest of the year and beyond. 
And now I'll turn the call over to Andrew."

RAI had a stellar second quarter and first half over and above our completion of the acquisition of Lorillard and the related divestiture. 
RAI increased second quarter adjusted EPS by 14.6% from the prior year quarter to $1.02, supported by higher pricing across the board, as well as the benefit from the completion of the federal tobacco-quota buyout in 2014. I would note that the completion of the Lorillard acquisition does not affect our adjusted EPS in the second quarter. 
As a reminder, our shares outstanding increased by million to 715 million shares post-close. These adjusted results exclude a charge of $0.09 per share for transaction-related and financing cost, a charge of $0.12 per share for integration and implementation costs, and a gain of $2.57 per share for the divestiture. On a reported basis, second quarter EPS was $3.38, up more than 267% from the prior year quarter, driven by the gain on the divestiture to ITG Brands. 
First half adjusted EPS was $1.88, which was up 17.5% from the prior year period. These adjusted results exclude the previously mentioned items, as well as a benefit of $0.08 per share from the 2003 NPM Adjustment claim, a charge of $0.13 per share for Engle Progeny lawsuits and a charge of $0.02 per share for tobacco-related and other litigation. 
On a reported basis, first half EPS was $4.20, up over 164%, driven by the gain on the divestiture to ITG Brands. RAI's adjusted operating margin, also came in very strong again, increasing 4.7 percentage points to 42.1% for the quarter. 
Now I'll turn to our operating companies' performance where I'll focus on adjusted results. Please refer to the schedules at the end of our earnings release for reconciliations from our GAAP to adjusted results. R.J. Reynolds performed very well, reflecting about 2 weeks of Newport's results. The company's second quarter adjusted operating income increased by more than 19% to $832 million. That brought first half adjusted operating income to $1.5 billion. And the company's second quarter adjusted operating margin rose by 4.2 percentage points to 44.4%. 
With a moderation in cigarette industry volume declines in the first half of this year, the company's second quarter cigarette volumes were up 4.4% from the prior year quarter. This compares to cigarette industry volumes, which were up 1.9%. Wholesale inventory levels for the industry were approximately 7.6 billion units at the end of second quarter, up about 1.6 billion from the prior year quarter, while R.J. Reynolds's inventories of approximately 2.4 billion were up about 800 million, reflecting the impact of additional Newport inventory resulting from the acquisition. 
When adjusting for these wholesale inventory changes, cigarette industry volumes declined approximately 0.8 of a percentage point in the second quarter. 
Santa Fe did another incredible job in the quarter, driving operating income up by 48.9% to $125 million, and that brought its first half to $217 million. The company's second quarter operating margin jumped by 7.6 percentage points to 57.2%. 
Now I'll turn to American Snuff. The company benefited from higher volume in addition to higher pricing and the second quarter operating income increased almost 18% to $130 million. That brought first half operating income to $248 million. The company's operating margin rose 3.1 percentage points from the prior year quarter to 59.4%. 
Before I open up the Q&A session, I'd like to cover some other financial items. Earlier this month, RAI successfully concluded the private offers to exchange the outstanding senior notes originally issued by Lorillard for newly issued notes of RAI. Together with our successful bond offering related to the acquisition itself, the company's long-term debt now stands at $17.6 billion. Our debt portfolio carries an average interest rate of 4.5% and an average maturity of 12.4 years. I do want to emphasize here that our near term focus is to deleverage as efficiently and quickly as possible while maintaining appropriate financial flexibility. 
The company ended the quarter with cash balances of $4 billion, and that reflects the $1.4 billion MSA payment in April. Finally, I'd like to add some details to the important announcements that we made this morning. RAI's board approved a 2-for-1 stock split, which will be payable on August 31 to shareholders of record on August 17. And the 7.5% dividend increase will bring our annualized split-adjusted dividend to $1.44 or $0.36 on a quarterly basis. This reflects our commitment to our 75% dividend payout ratio following the Lorillard acquisition. 
Now that we've completed our acquisition of Lorillard, along with a very successful first half, RAI's increasing its full year adjusted earnings guidance to a range of $1.90 to $2 per share. This of course reflects the pending stock split. We expect to narrow this 2015 guidance range when we report third quarter results as we gain more insights into the dynamics of the new product portfolio, any potential impacts to industry's competitive environment, and the pace of our anticipated cost synergies. Please note that this adjusted earnings guidance excludes all of the items I mentioned at the beginning of my discussion. Thank you.

And we'll also take a look -- some of you read through the asset purchase agreements and the surrounding terms, but we are in sort of a standstill period at retail with ITG Brands. And that will evolve over the next 6 months. And we'll explain some of those things, as I said, as the week goes on. But suffice it to say that we are getting to know the Newport consumer. We've picked up 50,000 additional retail contracts, many new customers and a significant database of those customers, and so we are working on our strategies to optimize our performance.

We are physically moving the machines that made Newport from Greensboro into our factory in Tobaccoville, and this absolutely ensures that we will meet the FDA requirements to produce exactly the same specification. And so we are moving the machine every couple of weeks, but it takes time to move those machines, and then we have complexes that are moving to Greensboro to produce Winston-Salem and Kool. And so that has all been lined up. The volume will fold in here. So it doesn't -- it won't come exactly smoothly, and we'll be prepared, as Andrew said, I think, that the back of the third quarter will be able to give you a little more information about that. But we have allowed the right amount of time to ensure that we can exactly reproduce. And so in that interim, we have a reciprocal manufacturing agreement with ITG Brands. We are making Winston, Salem and Kool for them, and they are making Newport for us. And once that volume all gets into Tobaccoville, of course, we will recognize quite a significant operational efficiency and cost base."

And it was interesting because we closed that transaction on June 12 and we took orders on the Monday [ph]. So we managed the transition very well. But we moved, for instance, from a one day to a 3-day delivery, so we have wholesalers ordering more product upfront. We also probably had wholesalers that were worried that it wouldn't work so they ordered a lot up front. And then there are a couple of estates where there were tax increases where there was no floor tax, and they ordered a lot up front. So we are very confident in the manufacturing agreement and all volumes are intact. It's just that they're finding their way to the right places in this early stage."

These factors include, but are not limited to, items detailed in our press release and SEC filings. Except as provided by Federal Securities Laws, we are not required to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement. 
And now I'll turn the call over to Susan."
399584,306716128,839830,"Reynolds American Inc., Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2015",2015-07-28,"Earnings Calls","Reynolds American Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Morris, and good morning, everyone. As our report today makes clear, we accomplished a great deal during the second quarter, making further progress in our continuing transformation journey. In mid-June, of course, we successfully completed RAI",1553,"Thank you, Morris, and good morning, everyone. As our report today makes clear, we accomplished a great deal during the second quarter, making further progress in our continuing transformation journey. In mid-June, of course, we successfully completed RAI's purchase of Lorillard and the related divestiture to ITG Brands. And I'm pleased to say that the integration of the Newport brand is going very well. Our employees have done a fantastic job in managing the initial transition. In fact, RAI had an excellent quarter, reporting substantially higher earnings and operating margin, and that wrapped up a very successful first half. These results reflected strong financial performance at all of our operating companies and continued momentum behind their distinctive brands. Of course, I would note that given the timing of the closing in mid-June, second quarter results versus last year are not directly comparable. 
So it was a strong second quarter in first half, marked by higher pricing across the board and strong volumes. And now we're poised for new growth following the acquisition. As we said all along, the addition of the Newport brand will give R.J. Reynolds increased scale and improved operational efficiencies, as well as higher sales volumes, resulting from the complementary nature of Newport and the rest of R.J. Reynolds's cigarette portfolio. The result will be a significantly more profitable business that will continue to reward shareholders and fuel the continued research development and innovation that our companies need for long-term sustainability in a changing environment. 
Our transition is still far from complete and here, I would remind you that the manufacturing of Newport will continue under a reciprocal agreement until production is fully transferred to the Tobaccoville manufacturing facility later next year. 
A good deal of work remains to be done, but we have a great track record in executing these kinds of combinations and I'm confident that the process will continue to run smoothly. The second quarter's strong business performance has reinforced our confidence in the continuing strength of our operating companies, so we're making several important announcements this morning. We are increasing our quarterly cash dividend by 7.5%. This is our 12th dividend increase since RAI was formed in 2004. We're also implementing a 2-for-1 stock split, which will be our third stock split since 2004. 
In addition, we have increased our adjusted earnings growth projection for the year to a range of 11% to 17% over last year's adjusted results. That compares with our previous 2015 guidance of 6.7% to 11% growth. I think you'll agree that these actions clearly demonstrate a high level of conviction for our businesses as well as our commitment to returning value to our shareholders. And Andrew will be giving you some more details shortly. 
Before I move on to discuss our operating performance, I'd like to give you a quick update on our progress with other key aspects of our transforming tobacco strategy. I'm pleased to report that RJR Vapor's VUSE digital vapor cigarette continued to perform well in the second quarter. VUSE, which uses digital technology to deliver a superior vaping experience, has been a consistent category leader. VUSE is now in national distribution in more than 100,000 retail outlets and has solidified its position as the top-selling electronic cigarette in the C-store channel. VUSE's success is based not just on its strong and distinctive product qualities, the brand also offers retailers best-in-class support, with high-impact national and local marketing campaign. We continue to see great promise in the vapor category, and we will continue to innovate and invest to keep VUSE as the leading, most advanced product in the marketplace. 
Good progress also continues to be made with the national expansion of Niconovum, Zonnic, NRT Gum, and the brand is now in about 25,000 outlets. Zonnic is the leading NRT in the convenience gas channel, and we expect its phased expansion to continue into next year. Also, as you know, R.J. Reynolds expanded Revo, heat-not-burn cigarette, into Wisconsin in February, to gain learning on consumer interest in heat-not-burn products. Revo has seen consumer interest and trial but actual adoption rates of the product have not met our expectations. As a result, R.J. Reynolds has decided to discontinue marketing support for Revo in Wisconsin. However, we do remain optimistic about the long-term potential for heat-not-burn, and we continue to work to improve this technology. 
So that's a quick review of the quarter's main headlines. Before I turn to discussion of the results at our operating companies, I would just note here that we have refreshed our corporate branding and redesigned our website to reflect the new brand portfolio, and there'll be more news on that in early August. 
I'd also note that we've changed the method of measuring our operating companies, cigarettes and moist snuff retail market share, to more accurately reflect marketplace performance across all channels. While absolute retail market share levels may differ from previously reported data, the overall trends are not materially different. 
Now let's start the discussion with traditional cigarettes, which we refer to as combustible. Total RAI operating companies domestic cigarette volumes increased 5.6% in the second quarter and 2.4% for the first 6 months of 2015. This compares to cigarette industry gains of 1.9% and 1.2% during the same periods. However, on an inventory adjusted basis, industry cigarette volumes were down slightly for both periods. Total RAI operating companies domestic retail market share increased 0.2 percentage points to 33.6% in the second quarter and 0.1 percentage point to 33.8% for the first half of 2015. 
R.J. Reynolds turned in another strong quarter, supported by higher cigarette pricing and the completion of the federal tobacco-quota buyout. In addition, the company's cigarette shipments increased in the second quarter, benefiting from the addition of 2 weeks of Newport. R.J. Reynolds's cigarette volumes therefore increased by almost 4.5%. I also need to note that R.J. Reynolds's retail market share is presented on a pro forma basis, which reflects share information from the company's new brand portfolio, following the Lorillard acquisition and the related divestiture. As a result, R.J. Reynolds's total cigarette retail market share was down slightly from the prior year quarter at 31.8%. 
R.J. Reynolds's new portfolio of growth brands, Newport, Camel and Pall Mall, performed well in the second quarter, and now make up more than 90% of the company's total cigarette market share. Their combined second quarter share was 29.2%, and that was up 0.2 percentage point from the prior year quarter. 
Newport continued to advance in the second quarter, with share of retail shipments increasing 0.4 percentage points from the prior year quarter to 13.2%. Newport's gains were driven by its strength in menthol, and R.J. Reynolds's strategy going forward will be to energize and reinforce this powerful brand. 
Camel also continued to benefit from its menthol styles that use capsule technology. And the brand's total cigarette retail market share was in line with the prior year quarter at 8.2%. 
R.J. Reynolds's Pall Mall value brand is playing an essential role in the company's portfolio strategy by providing the right balance between market share and profitability. As a result, Pall Mall's second quarter retail market share of 7.8% was down 0.3 percentage points from the prior year quarter. This true value proposition is expected to benefit from additional brand equity building efforts going forward, resulting in increased trial and conversion. 
At Santa Fe, performance continues to exceed even our own high expectation. The company increased second quarter operating income by almost 50% and reported a significant quarterly jump in operating margin. The Santa Fe team is really executing wonderfully, and of course, the Natural American Spirit brand is the driving force. This undiscounted super-premium brand ended the quarter with a retail market share of 1.8% on volume growth of just over 25%. 
Natural American Spirit has a loyal and growing franchise, and the brand's strength is based on its distinctive additive-free tobacco style, including those made with organic tobacco. 
Now turning to moist snuff, an American Snuff strong performance. Higher pricing and volume came through for the company in the second quarter, and operating income again grew by double digits. Moist snuff industry volumes continued to be impacted by consumer shift between various tobacco products, and the industry remains very competitive. Even so, American Snuff's second quarter moist snuff volume increased by 6%, almost double the moist industry volume growth. 
The company's moist snuff retail market share increased 1.1 percentage points to 33.8% in the second quarter. American Snuff flagship brand Grizzly, performed very well in the second quarter, with its retail market share increasing 1.3 percentage points to 31.1%, as this was on volume growth of just over 7%. 
Grizzly's momentum is being driven by its popular pouch style, which is the fastest-growing style of moist snuff and represents about 18% of the total category. The brand's Dark Wintergreen style, which was expanded nationally in March, is also performing well and contributing to Grizzly's growth. 
So as you can see, it's been a really terrific quarter for our companies. And as I said earlier, there's a lot of work still to be done with the integration of Newport, but this kind of performance bodes very well for the rest of the year and beyond. 
And now I'll turn the call over to Andrew."
399584,306716128,839830,"Reynolds American Inc., Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2015",2015-07-28,"Earnings Calls","Reynolds American Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Susan, and good morning, everyone. RAI had a stellar second quarter and first half over and above our completion of the acquisition of Lorillard and the related divestiture. RAI increased second quarter adjusted EPS by 14.6% from the prior ye",873,"Thank you, Susan, and good morning, everyone. RAI had a stellar second quarter and first half over and above our completion of the acquisition of Lorillard and the related divestiture. 
RAI increased second quarter adjusted EPS by 14.6% from the prior year quarter to $1.02, supported by higher pricing across the board as well as the benefit from the completion of the federal tobacco-quota buyout in 2014. I would note that the completion of the Lorillard acquisition did not affect our adjusted EPS in the second quarter. 
As a reminder, our shares outstanding increased by 183 million to 715 million shares post-close. These adjusted results exclude a charge of $0.09 per share for transaction-related and financing cost, a charge of $0.12 per share for integration and implementation costs, and a gain of $2.57 per share for the divestiture. On a reported basis, second quarter EPS was $3.38, up more than 267% from the prior year quarter, driven by the gain on the divestiture to ITG Brands. 
First half adjusted EPS was $1.88, which was up 17.5% from the prior year period. These adjusted results exclude the previously mentioned items as well as a benefit of $0.08 per share from the 2003 NPM Adjustment claim, a charge of $0.13 per share for Engle Progeny lawsuit and a charge of $0.02 per share for tobacco-related and other litigation. 
On a reported basis, first half EPS was $4.20, up over 164%, driven by the gain on the divestiture to ITG Brands. RAI's adjusted operating margin, also came in very strong again, increasing 4.7 percentage points to 42.1% for the quarter. 
Now I'll turn to our operating companies' performance where I'll focus on adjusted results. Please refer to the schedules at the end of our earnings release for reconciliations from our GAAP to adjusted results. R.J. Reynolds performed very well, reflecting about 2 weeks of Newport's results. The company's second quarter adjusted operating income increased by more than 19% to $832 million. That brought first half adjusted operating income to $1.5 billion. And the company's second quarter adjusted operating margin rose by 4.2 percentage points to 44.4%. 
With a moderation in cigarette industry volume declines in the first half of this year, the company's second quarter cigarette volumes were up 4.4% from the prior year quarter. This compares to cigarette industry volumes, which were up 1.9%. Wholesale inventory levels for the industry were approximately 7.6 billion units at the end of second quarter, up about 1.6 billion from the prior year quarter, while R.J. Reynolds's inventories of approximately 2.4 billion were up about 800 million, reflecting the impact of additional Newport inventory resulting from the acquisition. 
When adjusting for these wholesale inventory changes, cigarette industry volumes declined approximately 0.8 percentage points in the second quarter. 
Santa Fe did another incredible job in the quarter, driving operating income up by 48.9% to $125 million, and that brought its first half to $217 million. The company's second quarter operating margin jumped by 7.6 percentage points to 57.2%. 
Now I'll turn to American Snuff. The company benefited from higher volume in addition to higher pricing and the second quarter operating income increased almost 18% to $130 million. That brought first half operating income to $248 million. The company's operating margin rose 3.1 percentage points from the prior year quarter to 59.4%. 
Before I open up the Q&A session, I'd like to cover some other financial items. Earlier this month, RAI successfully concluded the private offers to exchange the outstanding senior notes originally issued by Lorillard for newly issued notes of RAI. Together with our successful bond offering related to the acquisition itself, the company's long-term debt now stands at $17.6 billion. Our debt portfolio carries an average interest rate of 4.5% and an average maturity of 12.4 years. I do want to emphasize here that our near-term focus is to deleverage as efficiently and quickly as possible while maintaining appropriate financial flexibility. 
The company ended the quarter with cash balances of $4 billion, and that reflects the $1.4 billion MSA payment in April. Finally, I'd like to add some details to the important announcements that we made this morning. RAI's board approved a 2-for-1 stock split, which will be payable on August 31 to shareholders of record on August 17, and the 7.5% dividend increase will bring our annualized split-adjusted dividend to $1.44 or $0.36 on a quarterly basis. This reflects our commitment to our 75% dividend payout ratio following the Lorillard acquisition. 
Now that we've completed our acquisition of Lorillard, along with a very successful first half, RAI is increasing its full year adjusted earnings guidance to a range of $1.90 to $2 per share. This of course reflects the pending stock split. We expect to narrow this 2015 guidance range when we report third quarter results as we gain more insights into the dynamics of the new product portfolio, any potential impacts to industry's competitive environment, and the pace of our anticipated cost synergies. Please note that this adjusted earnings guidance excludes all of the items I mentioned at the beginning of my discussion. Thank you. 
Now I'll turn to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, would you remind our callers how to get into the queue?"

And certainly, when we do research amongst consumers, if they knew about that proposition, they would choose Pall Mall. And so we will do some investment as we have done but we will do some investment to increase that proposition awareness. The other thing you need to think about, because Pall Mall did lose some market share year-over-year, we were also focused on ensuring that Winston, Salem and Kool were -- met the asset purchase agreement arrangement. And so we were spending to make sure that those market shares came through. And of course, that did, in effect, we pulled back a little bit on Pall Mall.

But we moved, for instance, from a 1-day to a 3-day delivery, so we had wholesalers ordering more product upfront. We also probably had wholesalers that were worried it wouldn't work, so they ordered a lot of product upfront. And then there were a couple of states where there were tax increases where there was no floor tax, and they ordered a lot upfront.

And we'll talk again a little bit more about that on this upcoming webcast and in the meetings that we're going to hold Friday and Monday. But NAS continues to go from strength to strength. It's gaining market share in every state.

As our report today makes clear, we accomplished a great deal during the second quarter, making further progress in our continuing transformation journey. In mid-June, of course, we successfully completed RAI",1553,"Thank you, Morris, and good morning, everyone. As our report today makes clear, we accomplished a great deal during the second quarter, making further progress in our continuing transformation journey. In mid-June, of course, we successfully completed RAI's purchase of Lorillard and the related divestiture to ITG Brands. And I'm pleased to say that the integration of the Newport brand is going very well. Our employees have done a fantastic job in managing the initial transition. In fact, RAI had an excellent quarter, reporting substantially higher earnings and operating margin, and that wrapped up a very successful first half. These results reflected strong financial performance at all of our operating companies and continued momentum behind their distinctive brands. Of course, I would note that given the timing of the closing in mid-June, second quarter results versus last year are not directly comparable. 
So it was a strong second quarter in first half, marked by higher pricing across the board and strong volumes. And now we're poised for new growth following the acquisition. As we said all along, the addition of the Newport brand will give R.J. Reynolds increased scale and improved operational efficiencies, as well as higher sales volumes, resulting from the complementary nature of Newport and the rest of R.J. Reynolds's cigarette portfolio. The result will be a significantly more profitable business that will continue to reward shareholders and fuel the continued research development and innovation that our companies need for long-term sustainability in a changing environment. 
Our transition is still far from complete and here, I would remind you that the manufacturing of Newport will continue under a reciprocal agreement until production is fully transferred to the Tobaccoville manufacturing facility later next year. 
A good deal of work remains to be done, but we have a great track record in executing these kinds of combinations and I'm confident that the process will continue to run smoothly. The second quarter's strong business performance has reinforced our confidence in the continuing strength of our operating companies, so we're making several important announcements this morning. We are increasing our quarterly cash dividend by 7.5%. This is our 12th dividend increase since RAI was formed in 2004. We're also implementing a 2-for-1 stock split, which will be our third stock split since 2004. 
In addition, we have increased our adjusted earnings growth projection for the year to a range of 11% to 17% over last year's adjusted results. That compares with our previous 2015 guidance of 6.7% to 11% growth. I think you'll agree that these actions clearly demonstrate a high level of conviction for our businesses as well as our commitment to returning value to our shareholders. And Andrew will be giving you some more details shortly. 
Before I move on to discuss our operating performance, I'd like to give you a quick update on our progress with other key aspects of our transforming tobacco strategy. I'm pleased to report that RJR Vapor's VUSE digital vapor cigarette continued to perform well in the second quarter. VUSE, which uses digital technology to deliver a superior vaping experience, has been a consistent category leader. VUSE is now in national distribution in more than 100,000 retail outlets and has solidified its position as the top-selling electronic cigarette in the C-store channel. VUSE's success is based not just on its strong and distinctive product qualities, the brand also offers retailers best-in-class support, with high-impact national and local marketing campaign. We continue to see great promise in the vapor category, and we will continue to innovate and invest to keep VUSE as the leading, most advanced product in the marketplace. 
Good progress also continues to be made with the national expansion of Niconovum, Zonnic, NRT Gum, and the brand is now in about 25,000 outlets. Zonnic is the leading NRT in the convenience gas channel, and we expect its phased expansion to continue into next year. Also, as you know, R.J. Reynolds expanded Revo, heat-not-burn cigarette, into Wisconsin in February, to gain learning on consumer interest in heat-not-burn products. Revo has seen consumer interest and trial but actual adoption rates of the product have not met our expectations. As a result, R.J. Reynolds has decided to discontinue marketing support for Revo in Wisconsin. However, we do remain optimistic about the long-term potential for heat-not-burn, and we continue to work to improve this technology. 
So that's a quick review of the quarter's main headlines. Before I turn to discussion of the results at our operating companies, I would just note here that we have refreshed our corporate branding and redesigned our website to reflect the new brand portfolio, and there'll be more news on that in early August. 
I'd also note that we've changed the method of measuring our operating companies, cigarettes and moist snuff retail market share, to more accurately reflect marketplace performance across all channels. While absolute retail market share levels may differ from previously reported data, the overall trends are not materially different. 
Now let's start the discussion with traditional cigarettes, which we refer to as combustible. Total RAI operating companies’ domestic cigarette volumes increased 5.6% in the second quarter and 2.4% for the first 6 months of 2015. This compares to cigarette industry gains of 1.9% and 1.2% during the same periods. However, on an inventory adjusted basis, industry cigarette volumes were down slightly for both periods. Total RAI operating companies domestic retail market share increased 0.2 percentage points to 33.6% in the second quarter and 0.1 percentage point to 33.8% for the first half of 2015. 
R.J. Reynolds turned in another strong quarter, supported by higher cigarette pricing and the completion of the federal tobacco-quota buyout. In addition, the company's cigarette shipments increased in the second quarter, benefiting from the addition of 2 weeks of Newport. R.J. Reynolds's cigarette volumes therefore increased by almost 4.5%. I also need to note that R.J. Reynolds's retail market share is presented on a pro forma basis, which reflects share information from the company's new brand portfolio, following the Lorillard acquisition and the related divestiture. As a result, R.J. Reynolds's total cigarette retail market share was down slightly from the prior year quarter at 31.8%. 
R.J. Reynolds's new portfolio of growth brands, Newport, Camel and Pall Mall, performed well in the second quarter, and now make up more than 90% of the company's total cigarette market share. Their combined second quarter share was 29.2%, and that was up 0.2 percentage point from the prior year quarter. 
Newport continued to advance in the second quarter, with share of retail shipments increasing 0.4 percentage points from the prior year quarter to 13.2%. Newport's gains were driven by its strength in menthol, and R.J. Reynolds's strategy going forward will be to energize and reinforce this powerful brand. 
Camel also continued to benefit from its menthol styles that use capsule technology. And the brand's total cigarette retail market share was in line with the prior year quarter at 8.2%. 
R.J. Reynolds's Pall Mall value brand is playing an essential role in the company's portfolio strategy by providing the right balance between market share and profitability. As a result, Pall Mall's second quarter retail market share of 7.8% was down 0.3 percentage points from the prior year quarter. This true value proposition is expected to benefit from additional brand equity building efforts going forward, resulting in increased trial and conversion. 
At Santa Fe, performance continues to exceed even our own high expectation. The company increased second quarter operating income by almost 50% and reported a significant quarterly jump in operating margin. The Santa Fe team is really executing wonderfully, and of course, the Natural American Spirit brand is the driving force. This undiscounted super-premium brand ended the quarter with a retail market share of 1.8% on volume growth of just over 25%. 
Natural American Spirit has a loyal and growing franchise, and the brand's strength is based on its distinctive additive-free tobacco style, including those made with organic tobacco. 
Now turning to moist snuff, an American Snuff strong performance. Higher pricing and volume came through for the company in the second quarter, and operating income again grew by double digits. Moist snuff industry volumes continued to be impacted by consumer shift between various tobacco products, and the industry remains very competitive. Even so, American Snuff's second quarter moist snuff volume increased by 6%, almost double the moist industry volume growth. 
The company's moist snuff retail market share increased 1.1 percentage points to 33.8% in the second quarter. American Snuff flagship brand Grizzly, performed very well in the second quarter, with its retail market share increasing 1.3 percentage points to 31.1%, and this was on volume growth of just over 7%. 
Grizzly's momentum is being driven by its popular pouch style, which is the fastest-growing style of moist snuff and represents about 18% of the total category. The brand's Dark Wintergreen style, which was expanded nationally in March, is also performing well and contributing to Grizzly's growth. 
So as you can see, it's been a really terrific quarter for our company. And as I said earlier, there's a lot of work still to be done with the integration of Newport, but this kind of performance bodes very well for the rest of the year and beyond. 
And now I'll turn the call over to Andrew."

RAI increased second quarter adjusted EPS by 14.6% from the prior ye",874,"Thank you, Susan, and good morning, everyone. RAI had a stellar second quarter and first half over and above our completion of the acquisition of Lorillard and the related divestiture. 
RAI increased second quarter adjusted EPS by 14.6% from the prior year quarter to $1.02, supported by higher pricing across the board as well as the benefit from the completion of the federal tobacco-quota buyout in 2014. I would note that the completion of the Lorillard acquisition did not affect our adjusted EPS in the second quarter. 
As a reminder, our shares outstanding increased by 183 million to 715 million shares post-close. These adjusted results exclude a charge of $0.09 per share for transaction-related and financing cost, a charge of $0.12 per share for integration and implementation costs, and a gain of $2.57 per share for the divestiture. On a reported basis, second quarter EPS was $3.38, up more than 267% from the prior year quarter, driven by the gain on the divestiture to ITG Brands. 
First half adjusted EPS was $1.88, which was up 17.5% from the prior year period. These adjusted results exclude the previously mentioned items as well as a benefit of $0.08 per share from the 2003 NPM Adjustment claim, a charge of $0.13 per share for Engle Progeny lawsuit and a charge of $0.02 per share for tobacco-related and other litigation. 
On a reported basis, first half EPS was $4.20, up over 164%, driven by the gain on the divestiture to ITG Brands. RAI's adjusted operating margin also came in very strong again, increasing 4.7 percentage points to 42.1% for the quarter. 
Now I'll turn to our operating companies' performance where I'll focus on adjusted results. Please refer to the schedules at the end of our earnings release for reconciliations from our GAAP to adjusted results. R.J. Reynolds performed very well, reflecting about 2 weeks of Newport's results. The company's second quarter adjusted operating income increased by more than 19% to $832 million. That brought first half adjusted operating income to $1.5 billion. And the company's second quarter adjusted operating margin rose by 4.2 percentage points to 44.4%. 
With a moderation in cigarette industry volume declines in the first half of this year, the company's second quarter cigarette volumes were up 4.4% from the prior year quarter. This compares to cigarette industry volumes, which were up 1.9%. Wholesale inventory levels for the industry were approximately 7.6 billion units at the end of second quarter, up about 1.6 billion from the prior year quarter, while R.J. Reynolds's inventories of approximately 2.4 billion were up about 800 million, reflecting the impact of additional Newport inventory resulting from the acquisition. 
When adjusting for these wholesale inventory changes, cigarette industry volumes declined approximately 0.8 percentage points in the second quarter. 
Santa Fe did another incredible job in the quarter, driving operating income up by 48.9% to $125 million, and that brought its first half to $217 million. The company's second quarter operating margin jumped by 7.6 percentage points to 57.2%. 
Now I'll turn to American Snuff. The company benefited from higher volume in addition to higher pricing and the second quarter operating income increased almost 18% to $130 million. That brought first half operating income to $248 million. The company's operating margin rose 3.1 percentage points from the prior year quarter to 59.4%. 
Before I open up the Q&A session, I'd like to cover some other financial items. Earlier this month, RAI successfully concluded the private offers to exchange the outstanding senior notes originally issued by Lorillard for newly issued notes of RAI. Together with our successful bond offering related to the acquisition itself, the company's long-term debt now stands at $17.6 billion. Our debt portfolio carries an average interest rate of 4.5% and an average maturity of 12.4 years. I do want to emphasize here that our near-term focus is to deleverage as efficiently and quickly as possible while maintaining appropriate financial flexibility. 
The company ended the quarter with cash balances of $4 billion, and that reflects the $1.4 billion MSA payment in April. Finally, I'd like to add some details to the important announcements that we made this morning. RAI's board approved a 2-for-1 stock split, which will be payable on August 31 to shareholders of record on August 17, and the 7.5% dividend increase will bring our annualized split-adjusted dividend to $1.44 or $0.36 on a quarterly basis. This reflects our commitment to our 75% dividend payout ratio following the Lorillard acquisition. 
Now that we've completed our acquisition of Lorillard, along with a very successful first half, RAI is increasing its full year adjusted earnings guidance to a range of $1.90 to $2 per share. This of course reflects the pending stock split. We expect to narrow this 2015 guidance range when we report third quarter results as we gain more insights into the dynamics of the new product portfolio, any potential impacts to the industry's competitive environment, and the pace of our anticipated cost synergies. Please note that this adjusted earnings guidance excludes all of the items I mentioned at the beginning of my discussion. Thank you. 
Now I'll turn to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, would you remind our callers how to get into the queue?"

And certainly, when we do research amongst consumers, if they knew about that proposition, they would choose Pall Mall. And so we will do some investment as we have done but we will do some investment to increase that proposition awareness. The other thing you need to think about, because Pall Mall did lose some market share year-over-year, we were also focused on ensuring that Winston, Salem and Kool were -- met the asset purchase agreement arrangement. And so we were spending to make sure that those market shares came through. And of course, that did, in effect, we pulled back a little bit on Pall Mall.

And it was interesting because we closed that transaction on June 12 and we took orders on the Monday. So we managed that transition very well. But we moved, for instance, from a 1-day to a 3-day delivery, so we had wholesalers ordering more product upfront. We also probably had wholesalers that were worried it wouldn't work, so they ordered a lot of product upfront. And then there were a couple of states where there were tax increases where there was no floor tax, and they ordered a lot upfront. So we are very confident in the manufacturing agreement and all volumes are intact, it's just that they're finding their way to the right places in this early stage."

As you know, it was a very busy quarter for us, and I'd like to start today with Reynolds American's results, which wrapped up a very strong first 9 months. Our net sales, earnings and margins were all significantly higher in the third quarter, driven by excellent performance at our operating companies and the impact of Newport's addition to the R.J. Reynolds portfolio. 
Adjusted industry cigarette volumes declined by 0.8% in the quarter, with continued growth in the premium cigarette category. 
In the moist snuff category, the environment remains competitive, and adult consumers continue to move back and forth between the various tobacco categories, modestly impacting the growth in moist snuff volume. As I've said before, our operating companies have a key advantage in offering a diversified product portfolio across tobacco categories with a range of distinctive brands at different price points. And this broad portfolio is also aligned with the key consumer macro trends that are driving brand choice. 
In addition, our company's strategy is to maximize the performance of the entire portfolio, with each of their key brand playing a distinctive role. Our company is successfully managing this dynamic interplay between categories and between their key brands, and RAI is benefiting greatly from it. 
Of course, a major highlight of the quarter was the significant momentum on the Newport brand and its significant contribution to R.J. Reynolds' profitability. the integration of Newport, which was acquired in June, continues to go very well. The reciprocal contract manufacturing with ITG will continue until later next year, but the transfer of equipment to the Tobaccoville facility is well underway. 
Under the route-to-market agreement, no changes can be made to existing retail contract until the middle of next month, but R.J. Reynolds is currently selling in new retail contracts and we're confident that Newport's expanded presence will drive further growth on the brand. 
The company's marketing and sales teams are also very focused on doing the necessary consumer research on Newport and identifying additional revenue opportunities for the brand, as well as for the company's other growth brands, Camel and Pall Mall. 
Our employees are doing a great job with Newport's integration, and we're very happy with the way things are progressing. 
Before I give you more details on our operating performance, I'd like to update you on VUSE's e-cigarettes, and then I'll cover a number of other recent developments. RJR Vapor's VUSE digital vapor cigarette continue to perform well in the third quarter and increased its #1 share position in the C-store channel. At the end of last month, 4 additional styles of VUSE cartridges were made available nationally. The brand now offers crema, mint, berry and Chai, in addition to the existing original and menthol styles. Adult smokers have told our company's consumer engagement team that they are interested in having more options in addition to the traditional tobacco flavor because they say that this could help them to switch to a smoke-free alternative like VUSE. 
Offering adult vapor a variety of options to consider is very much in line with our company's commitment to driving innovation, which is a key part of our transforming tobacco strategy. VUSE continues to invest in the development of a robust pipeline of innovation, and we'll be giving you more details on that at our Investor Day presentation in London and New York in November. 
As we announced late last month, manufacturing operations for VUSE has been consolidated at R.J. Reynolds' Tobaccoville facility, in line with the services agreement between R.J. Reynolds and RJR Vapor, and this will increase efficiencies as the vapor category and VUSE continue to develop. 
Moving onto some of the other headlines. In September, we announced the proposed sale of the Natural American Spirit business outside the U.S. to the JT Group for $5 billion. We believe it's a great deal. It will allow our companies to focus on brand growth here at home while the strength of JT Group's international capabilities will support the tremendous growth potential for Natural American Spirit overseas. I should note that this transaction still has to be approved by regulatory authorities in a number of countries, but that's expected to happen by early next year and the transaction should close shortly thereafter. 
Another development was the signing of a technology-sharing term sheet between R.J. Reynolds and British American Tobacco, which provides a framework for collaboration and mutual cross-licensing of vapor product technologies through 2022. The companies are still negotiating specifics of the agreement, and they expect to reach a definitive contract by the end of this year. 
In addition, R.J. Reynolds and Santa Fe reached a settlement last week with the state of New York on the NPM disputed payments. The settlement resolved NPM adjusted claims encompassing 11 years and puts in place a new method of determining future adjustments from 2015 forward. We are very pleased to have reached a resolution on this long-standing dispute with New York, and as a result, the companies will receive significant value for the impact to their brands resulting from manufacturers who were not subject to the obligations of the master settlement agreement. 
R.J. Reynolds and Santa Fe will continue to pursue resolution of their NPM disputed payment claims against the remaining 27 states and other jurisdictions that have not yet settled with the company. 
As you know, there have also been developments in the regulatory front. In response to the FDA ruling that 4 of R.J. Reynolds cigarette styles are not substantially equivalent to their respective predicate products, the company immediately stopped sales and notified trade partners of appropriate steps to stop further distribution, marketing and promotion of those products. R.J. Reynolds took the same action on Camel White style because the products have the same characteristics as the Pall Mall style impacted by the ruling. 
I remind you that these cigarette styles represent a very small portion of R.J. Reynolds business, and we believe R.J. Reynolds brand will capture the majority of the volume from the discontinued style. Let me reiterate that the company strongly disagrees with FDA's ruling and is still examining all of its options. 
Now let's start the rest of our quarterly discussion, beginning with traditional cigarettes. Total RAI company's domestic cigarette volumes increased 29.5% in the third quarter, significantly benefiting from the addition of Newport. Overall cigarette industry volume decline 2.2% for the quarter. When adjusted for wholesale inventory changes, industry shipments were down about 0.8%. Total RAI operating company's domestic retail market share also increased in the quarter by 0.3 percentage points to almost 34%. 
Focusing for a minute on R.J. Reynolds, I'm very pleased to report that the third quarter was very strong for the company. Adjusted operating income and margin were significantly higher, driven by an increase of over 30% in the company's cigarette shipments. I'd note that R.J. Reynolds retail market share is presented on a pro forma basis, which reflects share information from the company's new brand portfolio following the acquisition and the related divestiture. 
Reflecting these factors, R.J. Reynolds total cigarette retail market share was down slightly from the prior year quarter at 32%. However, the company's expanded portfolio of growth brands, Newport, Camel and Pall Mall, added 0.2 percentage point in combined retail market share to 29.4% for the quarter. These brands now make up about 92% of the company's total cigarette market share. 
Even with the standstill in restrictions that I mentioned earlier, Newport is showing excellent momentum, with third quarter share of retail shipments increasing 0.5 percentage point from the prior year quarter to 13.3%. Camel's retail market share performance held steady in the quarter at 8.3%, and the company remains focused on initiatives to build the brand equity. 
Performance of R.J. Reynolds' Pall Mall value brand reflected the company's continued balance between share and profitability. The brand's retail market share was down 0.3 percentage point at 7.8% in the third quarter and was flat sequentially. 
As I'm sure you noticed in today's release, Santa Fe drove performance to new heights in the third quarter, with double-digit growth and volume and operating income. The company's highly profitable Natural American Spirit brand is successfully broadening awareness and trial beyond its traditional strong market in the Western U.S., and the brand reported retail market share of 1.9% for the quarter. That was up 0.3 percentage point from the prior year quarter. And Natural American Spirit distinctive natural tobacco style grew volume by almost 20%. 
Now turning to moist snuff and American Snuff continued solid performance in a competitive market. The company, again, increased operating income with its flagship Grizzly brand, delivering higher volume and retail market share. American Snuff grew total moist snuff volume by 4.4%, which again, outpaced industry growth of about 2.5% for the quarter. As a result, the company's moist snuff retail market share was up 1.3 percentage points from the prior year quarter at 33.7%. Grizzly delivered third quarter retail market share growth of 1.4 percentage points to almost 31%, and that was on volume growth of 4.6%. I'm pleased to say that Grizzly's reputation for offering innovative products continues. The brand's dark Wintergreen style, which was expanded nationally in March, is performing very well. 
So all in all, RAI's third quarter and 9 months have gone extremely well, and we continue to deliver excellent total shareholder return. And I'm especially pleased with the way that Newport's integration is progressing. So now I'll turn the call over to Andrew."

Reynolds American and its operating companies had a great quarter, which included Newport's first full quarterly contribution earnings, and this resulted in a very successful first 9 months. RAI increased third quarter reported EPS by 4.5% from the prior year quarter to $0.46. On an adjusted basis, third quarter EPS was $0.55, up 17% from the prior year quarter. These results were supported by higher pricing and volumes across the board, the expiration of the federal tobacco quota buyout, as well as continuous productivity improvements. 
Adjusted EPS excludes a charge of $0.04 per share for implementation cost and a charge of $0.05 per share for asset impairment and exit costs related to the consolidation of VUSE's manufacturing operations. 
RAI's 9-month reported EPS was $2.45, about double the prior year period. On an adjusted basis, 9 months EPS was $1.50, up more than 18%. Adjusted EPS excludes the items I've just mentioned, as well as the gain on the divestiture, a benefit from the 2003 NPM adjustment claim, charges for transaction-related and financing costs, Engle progeny cases and tobacco-related and other litigation. RAI's third quarter adjusted operating margin jumped by 6.4 percentage points to almost 44.5%. 
Now I'll turn to our operating company's performance, where I'll discuss adjusted results where applicable. Please refer to the schedules at the end of our earnings release for reconciliations from our GAAP to adjusted results. 
As Susan said, R.J. Reynolds performed very well in the third quarter, with higher cigarette pricing and the expiration of the federal tobacco-quota buyout benefiting the bottom line, in addition to Newport's contribution. The company's reported operating income was $1.1 billion. Adjusted operating income increased by 64.6% from the prior year quarter to $1.2 billion. For the 9 months, R.J. Reynolds reported operating income was $2.4 billion. 9 months adjusted operating income increased by more than 35% to $2.7 billion. The company's third quarter operating margin grew by 5.1 percentage points to 46.7%. And as Susan mentioned, the company's third quarter cigarette shipments were up 30.2% from the prior year quarter. 
Wholesale inventory levels for the industry were approximately 7.6 billion units at the end of the third quarter, up about 600 million from the prior year quarter. R.J. Reynolds inventory of approximately $2.3 million were in line with the2  preceding quarter, reflecting the normalized level of the new cigarette portfolio. 
Before I move onto Santa Fe, I'd like to highlight the favorable impact from the settlement between the participating manufacturers and the state of New York on the NPM disputed payments. As a result of the settlement, R.J. Reynolds and Santa Fe will receive credits currently estimated to be approximately $290 million that will applied to the company's MSA payments over the next 4 years for its adjusted claims relating to the years 2004 through 2014. Additionally, the company may also receive credits based on a sliding scale key to the volume of non-state excise tax paid sales in New York during the relevant market year. 
I'd note that since 2012, R.J. Reynolds has reached settlements in 24 jurisdictions on NPM Adjustment claims related to the company's master settlement agreement payments. 
Now moving onto Santa Fe. Higher pricing and volume also boosted Santa Fe's earnings, and the company increased operating income by more than 23% from the prior year quarter to $120 million. That brought 9-month operating income to $337 million, which was up almost 37%. Santa Fe's third quarter operating margin also rose by 0.7 percentage points to more than 55%. It's worth noting that for the 9 months, the company's reported operating margin of 55.5%. 
Now let's turn to American Snuff. The company increased third quarter operating income 3.4% to $121 million, as higher pricing and volume more than offset the timing of marketing support activity. For the first 9 months, operating income rose almost 12.5% to $369 million. American Snuff's operating margin remained strong at 57.5% for the quarter. 
Before I turn to the Q&A, there are some other important items I want to mention. In line with the company's commitment to deleverage as quickly as possible while maintaining financial flexibility, we plan to pay down $450 million in debt that matures on Friday. At the end of the third quarter, our total long-term debt was $17 billion. 
I'd note again that we have a very manageable debt portfolio, which carries an average interest rate of 4.5% with an average maturity of 12.1 years. The company ended the quarter with cash balances of $2.9 billion. 
We remain deeply committed to returning value to our shareholders. And in that vein, I'd remind you of our 2-for-1 stock split in August, as well as the most recent 7.5% dividend increase. So that finishes up our highly successful year-to-date. And as a result, we're tightening our full year adjusted earnings guidance to a range of $1.94 per share to $2 per share. Please note that this adjusted earnings guidance excludes all the items I mentioned at the beginning of my discussion. Thank you. Now we'll turn to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, would you remind our callers how to get into the queue?"

The vast majority of volume that is used by underage is bought for them by adults. So the outcome of the 21 versus 18, I don't think we can see anything yet with that. There are better ways to address it. But having said that, that's the state's call. But we will be following that, and obviously, we'll be following if there's any other momentum as we go forward."

As you know, it was a very busy quarter for us, and I'd like to start today with Reynolds American's result, which wrapped up a very strong first 9 months. Our net sales, earnings and margins were all significantly higher in the third quarter, driven by excellent performance at our operating companies and the impact of Newport's addition to the R.J. Reynolds' portfolio. 
Adjusted industry cigarette volumes declined by 0.8% in the quarter, with continued growth in the premium cigarette category. In the moist snuff category, the environment remains competitive, and adult consumers continue to move back and forth between the various tobacco categories, modestly impacting the growth in moist snuff volume. As I've said before, our operating companies have a key advantage in offering a diversified product portfolio across tobacco categories with a range of distinctive brands at different price points. And this broad portfolio is also aligned with the key consumer macro trends that are driving brand choice. 
In addition, our company's strategy is to maximize the performance of the entire portfolio, with each of their key brand playing a distinctive role. Our companies are successfully managing this dynamic interplay between categories and between their key brands, and RAI is benefiting greatly from it. 
Of course, a major highlight of the quarter was the significant momentum on the Newport brand and its significant contribution to R.J. Reynolds' profitability. The integration of Newport, which was acquired in June, continues to go very well. The reciprocal contract manufacturing with ITG will continue until later next year, but the transfer of equipment to the Tobaccoville facility is well underway. 
Under the route-to-market agreement, no changes can be made to existing retail contract until the middle of next month, but R.J. Reynolds is currently selling in new retail contracts. And we're confident that Newport's expanded presence will drive further growth on the brand. 
The company's marketing and sales teams are also very focused on doing the necessary consumer research on Newport and identifying additional revenue opportunities for the brand as well as for the company's other growth brands, Camel and Pall Mall. Our employees are doing a great job with Newport's integration, and we're very happy with the way things are progressing. 
Before I give you more details on our operating performance, I'd like to update you on VUSE e-cigarettes, and then I'll cover a number of other recent developments. RJR Vapor's VUSE digital vapor cigarette continued to perform well in the third quarter and increased its #1 share position in the c-store channel. At the end of last month, 4 additional styles of VUSE cartridges were made available nationally. The brand now offers Crema, Mint, Berry and Chai, in addition to the existing original and menthol styles. Adult smokers have told our company's consumer engagement team that they are interested in having more options in addition to the traditional tobacco flavors, because they say that this could help them to switch to a smoke-free alternative like VUSE. 
Offering adult vapor a variety of options to consider is very much in line with our company's commitment to driving innovation, which is a key part of our transforming tobacco strategy. VUSE continues to invest in the development of a robust pipeline of innovation, and we'll be giving you more details on that at our Investor Day presentation in London and New York in November. 
As we announced late last month, manufacturing operations for VUSE have been consolidated at R.J. Reynolds' Tobaccoville facility, in line with the services agreement between R.J. Reynolds and RJR Vapor. And this will increase efficiencies as the vapor category and VUSE continue to develop. 
Moving onto some of the other headlines. In September, we announced the proposed sale of the Natural American Spirit business outside the U.S. to the JT Group for $5 billion. We believe it's a great deal. It will allow our companies to focus on brand growth here at home while the strength of JT Group's international capabilities will support the tremendous growth potential for Natural American Spirit overseas. I should note that this transaction still has to be approved by regulatory authorities in a number of countries, but that's expected to happen by early next year. And the transaction should close shortly thereafter. 
Another development was the signing of a technology-sharing term sheet between R.J. Reynolds and British American Tobacco, which provides a framework for collaboration and mutual cross-licensing of vapor product technologies through 2022. The companies are still negotiating specifics of the agreement, and they expect to reach a definitive contract by the end of this year. 
In addition, R.J. Reynolds and Santa Fe reached a settlement last week with the state of New York on the NPM disputed payments. The settlement resolved NPM adjustment claims encompassing 11 years and puts in place a new method of determining future adjustments from 2015 forward. We are very pleased to have reached a resolution on this long-standing dispute with New York. And as a result, the companies will receive significant value for the impact to their brands resulting from manufacturers who were not subject to the obligations of the master settlement agreement. R.J. Reynolds and Santa Fe will continue to pursue resolution of their NPM disputed payment claims against the remaining 27 states and other jurisdictions that have not yet settled with the company. 
As you know, there have also been developments on the regulatory front. In response to the FDA ruling that 4 of R.J. Reynolds' cigarette styles are not substantially equivalent to their respective predicate products, the company immediately stopped sales and notified trade partners of appropriate steps to stop further distribution, marketing and promotion of those products. R.J. Reynolds took the same action on Camel White style, because the products have the same characteristics as the Pall Mall style impacted by the ruling. 
I remind you that these cigarette styles represent a very small portion of R.J. Reynolds' business, and we believe R.J. Reynolds' brand will capture the majority of volume from the discontinued style. Let me reiterate that the company strongly disagrees with the FDA's ruling and is still examining all of its options. 
Now let's start the rest of our quarterly discussion, beginning with traditional cigarettes. Total RAI company's domestic cigarette volumes increased to 29.5% in the third quarter, significantly benefiting from the addition of Newport. Overall cigarette industry volume declined 2.2% for the quarter. When adjusted for wholesale inventory changes, industry shipments were down about 0.8%. Total RAI operating company's domestic retail market share also increased in the quarter by 0.3 percentage point to almost 34%. 
Focusing for a minute on R.J. Reynolds, I'm very pleased to report that the third quarter was very strong for the company. Adjusted operating income and margin were significantly higher, driven by an increase of over 30% in the company's cigarette shipments. I'd note that R.J. Reynolds' retail market share is presented on a pro forma basis, which reflects share information from the company's new brand portfolio, following the acquisition and the related divestiture. 
Reflecting these factors, R.J. Reynolds' total cigarette retail market share was down slightly from the prior year quarter at 32%. However, the company's expanded portfolio of growth brands, Newport, Camel and Pall Mall, added 0.2 percentage point in combined retail market share to 29.4% for the quarter. These brands now make up about 92% of the company's total cigarette market share. 
Even with the standstill in restrictions that I mentioned earlier, Newport is showing excellent momentum, with third quarter share of retail shipments increasing 0.5 percentage point from the prior year quarter to 13.3%. Camel's retail market share performance held steady in the quarter at 8.3%, and the company remains focused on initiatives to build the brand equity. 
Performance of R.J. Reynolds' Pall Mall value brand reflected the company's continued balance between share and profitability. The brand's retail market share was down 0.3 percentage point at 7.8% in the third quarter and was flat sequentially. 
As I'm sure you noticed in today's release, Santa Fe drove performance to new heights in the third quarter, with double-digit growth in volume and operating income. The company's highly profitable Natural American Spirit brand is successfully broadening awareness and trial beyond its traditional strong market in the Western U.S. And the brand reported retail market share of 1.9% for the quarter. That was up 0.3 percentage point from the prior year quarter. And Natural American Spirit's distinctive natural tobacco style grew volume by almost 20%. 
Now turning to moist snuff and American Snuff continued solid performance in a competitive market. The company, again, increased operating income with its flagship Grizzly brand, delivering higher volume and retail market share. American Snuff grew total moist snuff volume by 4.4%, which, again, outpaced industry growth of about 2.5% for the quarter. As a result, the company's moist snuff retail market share was up 1.3 percentage points from the prior year quarter at 33.7%. 
Grizzly delivered third quarter retail market share growth of 1.4 percentage points to almost 31%, and that was on volume growth of 4.6%. I'm pleased to say that Grizzly's reputation for offering innovative products continues. The brand's dark Wintergreen style, which was expanded nationally in March, is performing very well. 
So all in all, RAI's third quarter and 9 months have gone extremely well, and we continued to deliver excellent total shareholder return. And I'm especially pleased with the way that Newport's integration is progressing. 
So now I'll turn the call over to Andrew."

Reynolds American and its operating companies had a great quarter, which included Newport's first full quarterly contribution earnings, and this resulted in a very successful first 9 months. RAI increased third quarter reported EPS by 4.5% from the prior year quarter to $0.46. On an adjusted basis, third quarter EPS was $0.55, up 17% from the prior year quarter. These results were supported by higher pricing and volumes across the board, the expiration of the federal tobacco quota buyout as well as continuous productivity improvements. 
Adjusted EPS excludes a charge of $0.04 per share for implementation costs and a charge of $0.05 per share for asset impairment and exit costs related to the consolidation of VUSE's manufacturing operations. 
RAI's 9-month reported EPS was $2.45, about double the prior year period. On an adjusted basis, 9-month EPS was $1.50, up more than 18%. Adjusted EPS excludes the items I've just mentioned as well as the gain on the divestiture, a benefit from the 2003 NPM adjustment claim, charges for transaction-related and financing costs, Engle progeny cases and tobacco-related and other litigation. RAI's third quarter adjusted operating margin jumped by 6.4 percentage points to almost 44.5%. 
Now I'll turn to our operating company's performance, where I'll discuss adjusted results where applicable. Please refer to the schedules at the end of our earnings release for reconciliations from our GAAP to adjusted results. 
As Susan said, R.J. Reynolds performed very well in the third quarter, with higher cigarette pricing and the expiration of the federal tobacco-quota buyout benefiting the bottom line, in addition to Newport's contribution. The company's reported operating income was $1.1 billion. Adjusted operating income increased by 64.6% from the prior year quarter to $1.2 billion. For the 9 months, R.J. Reynolds' reported operating income was $2.4 billion. 9 months adjusted operating income increased by more than 35% to $2.7 billion. The company's third quarter operating margin grew by 5.1 percentage points to 46.7%. And as Susan mentioned, the company's third quarter cigarette shipments were up 30.2% from the prior year quarter. 
Wholesale inventory levels for the industry were approximately 7.6 billion units at the end of the third quarter, up about 600 million from the prior year quarter. R.J. Reynolds' inventory of approximately $2.3 million were in line with the preceding quarter, reflecting the normalized level of the new cigarette portfolio. 
Before I move onto Santa Fe, I'd like to highlight the favorable impact from the settlement between the participating manufacturers and the state of New York on the NPM disputed payments. As a result of the settlement, R.J. Reynolds and Santa Fe will receive credits currently estimated to be approximately $290 million that will applied to the company's MSA payments over the next 4 years for its adjusted claims relating to the years 2004 through 2014. Additionally, the company may also receive credits based on a sliding scale keyed to the volume of non-state-excise-tax paid tribal sales in New York during the relevant market year. I'd note that since 2012, R.J. Reynolds has reached settlements in 24 jurisdictions on NPM adjustment claims related to the company's master settlement agreement payments. 
Now moving onto Santa Fe. Higher pricing and volume also boosted Santa Fe's earnings, and the company increased operating income by more than 23% from the prior year quarter to $120 million. That brought 9-month operating income to $337 million, which was up almost 37%. Santa Fe's third quarter operating margin also rose by 0.7 percentage point to more than 55%. It's worth noting that for the 9 months, the company reported operating margin of 55.5%. 
Now let's turn to American Snuff. The company increased third quarter operating income 3.4% to $121 million as higher pricing and volume more than offset the timing of marketing support activity. For the first 9 months, operating income rose almost 12.5% to $369 million. American Snuff's operating margin remained strong at 57.5% for the quarter. 
Before I turn to the Q&A, there are some other important items I want to mention. In line with the company's commitment to deleverage as quickly as possible while maintaining financial flexibility, we plan to pay down $450 million in debt that matures on Friday. At the end of the third quarter, our total long-term debt was $17 billion. 
I'd note again that we have a very manageable debt portfolio, which carries an average interest rate of 4.5% with an average maturity of 12.1 years. The company ended the quarter with cash balances of $2.9 billion. 
We remain deeply committed to returning value to our shareholders. And in that vein, I'd remind you of our 2-for-1 stock split in August as well as the most recent 7.5% dividend increase. 
So that finishes up our highly successful year-to-date. And as a result, we're tightening our full year adjusted earnings guidance to a range of $1.94 per share to $2 per share. Please note that this adjusted earnings guidance excludes all the items I mentioned at the beginning of my discussion. Thank you. 
Now we'll turn to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, would you remind our callers how to get into the queue?"

But probably, the average of this 2% to 4% decline rate is where we should look as we go forward. And obviously, we report on that every quarter. We don't -- we have not yet been able to dissect Hawaii. As you know, it's a very small state, and we'll certainly look at those results. What's interesting and the perspective on that is that we have worked with the states for years to reduce underage smoking. And we've been very successful getting laws in place. The vast majority of volume that is used by underage is bought for them by adults. So the outcome of the 21 versus 18, I don't think we can see anything yet with that. There are better ways to address it. But having said that, that's the state's call. But we will be following that. And obviously, we'll be following if there's any other momentum as we go forward."

And so as consumers have traded up to premium, and of course, we benefit significantly now with Newport as well as NAS and Camel in the portfolio. So we feel that Pall Mall is playing its role. We're happy with its market share performance. It's important to have a strong value property, because the economics can change and people can start down-trading to a value brand. But we are very happy with Pall Mall. And we do believe, actually, that as we expand these EDLP contracts, these merchandising contracts, beginning next month, the Pall Mall will benefit from that, because it will be the everyday low-priced brand in more stores. And so we will obviously update that as we go through the first quarter. But we don't expect Pall Mall to continue to decline. But of course, we also like the premiumization of the category.

As you know, it was a very busy quarter for us, and I'd like to start today with Reynolds American's result, which wrapped up a very strong first 9 months. Our net sales, earnings and margins were all significantly higher in the third quarter, driven by excellent performance at our operating companies and the impact of Newport's addition to the R.J. Reynolds' portfolio. 
Adjusted industry cigarette volumes declined by 0.8% in the quarter, with continued growth in the premium cigarette category. In the moist snuff category, the environment remains competitive, and adult consumers continue to move back and forth between the various tobacco categories, modestly impacting the growth in moist snuff volume. As I've said before, our operating companies have a key advantage in offering a diversified product portfolio across tobacco categories with a range of distinctive brands at different price points. And this broad portfolio is also aligned with the key consumer macro trends that are driving brand choice. 
In addition, our company's strategy is to maximize the performance of the entire portfolio, with each of their key brand playing a distinctive role. Our companies are successfully managing this dynamic interplay between categories and between their key brands, and RAI is benefiting greatly from it. 
Of course, a major highlight of the quarter was the significant momentum on the Newport brand and its significant contribution to R.J. Reynolds' profitability. The integration of Newport, which was acquired in June, continues to go very well. The reciprocal contract manufacturing with ITG will continue until later next year, but the transfer of equipment to the Tobaccoville facility is well underway. 
Under the route-to-market agreement, no changes can be made to existing retail contract until the middle of next month, but R.J. Reynolds is currently selling in new retail contracts. And we're confident that Newport's expanded presence will drive further growth on the brand. 
The company's marketing and sales teams are also very focused on doing the necessary consumer research on Newport and identifying additional revenue opportunities for the brand as well as for the company's other growth brands, Camel and Pall Mall. Our employees are doing a great job with Newport's integration, and we're very happy with the way things are progressing. 
Before I give you more details on our operating performance, I'd like to update you on VUSE e-cigarettes, and then I'll cover a number of other recent developments. RJR Vapor's VUSE digital vapor cigarette continued to perform well in the third quarter and increased its #1 share position in the c-store channel. At the end of last month, 4 additional styles of VUSE cartridges were made available nationally. The brand now offers Crema, Mint, Berry and Chai, in addition to the existing original and menthol styles. Adult smokers have told our company's consumer engagement team that they are interested in having more options in addition to the traditional tobacco flavors, because they say that this could help them to switch to a smoke-free alternative like VUSE. 
Offering adult vapor a variety of options to consider is very much in line with our company's commitment to driving innovation, which is a key part of our transforming tobacco strategy. VUSE continues to invest in the development of a robust pipeline of innovation, and we'll be giving you more details on that at our Investor Day presentation in London and New York in November. 
As we announced late last month, manufacturing operations for VUSE have been consolidated at R.J. Reynolds' Tobaccoville facility, in line with the services agreement between R.J. Reynolds and RJR Vapor. And this will increase efficiencies as the vapor category and VUSE continue to develop. 
Moving onto some of the other headlines. In September, we announced the proposed sale of the Natural American Spirit business outside the U.S. to the JT Group for $5 billion. We believe it's a great deal. It will allow our companies to focus on brand growth here at home while the strength of JT Group's international capabilities will support the tremendous growth potential for Natural American Spirit overseas. I should note that this transaction still has to be approved by regulatory authorities in a number of countries, but that's expected to happen by early next year. And the transaction should close shortly thereafter. 
Another development was the signing of a technology-sharing term sheet between R.J. Reynolds and British American Tobacco, which provides a framework for collaboration and mutual cross-licensing of vapor product technologies through 2022. The companies are still negotiating specifics of the agreement, and they expect to reach a definitive contract by the end of this year. 
In addition, R.J. Reynolds and Santa Fe reached a settlement last week with the state of New York on the NPM disputed payments. The settlement resolved NPM adjustment claims encompassing 11 years and puts in place a new method of determining future adjustments from 2015 forward. We are very pleased to have reached a resolution on this long-standing dispute with New York. And as a result, the companies will receive significant value for the impact to their brands resulting from manufacturers who were not subject to the obligations of the master settlement agreement. R.J. Reynolds and Santa Fe will continue to pursue resolution of their NPM disputed payment claims against the remaining 27 states and other jurisdictions that have not yet settled with the company. 
As you know, there have also been developments on the regulatory front. In response to the FDA ruling that 4 of R.J. Reynolds' cigarette styles are not substantially equivalent to their respective predicate products, the company immediately stopped sales and notified trade partners of appropriate steps to stop further distribution, marketing and promotion of those products. R.J. Reynolds took the same action on Camel White style, because the products have the same characteristics as the Pall Mall style impacted by the ruling. 
I remind you that these cigarette styles represent a very small portion of R.J. Reynolds' business, and we believe R.J. Reynolds' brand will capture the majority of volume from the discontinued style. Let me reiterate that the company strongly disagrees with the FDA's ruling and is still examining all of its options. 
Now let's start the rest of our quarterly discussion, beginning with traditional cigarettes. Total RAI company's domestic cigarette volumes increased to 29.5% in the third quarter, significantly benefiting from the addition of Newport. Overall cigarette industry volume declined 2.2% for the quarter. When adjusted for wholesale inventory changes, industry shipments were down about 0.8%. Total RAI operating company's domestic retail market share also increased in the quarter by 0.3 percentage point to almost 34%. 
Focusing for a minute on R.J. Reynolds, I'm very pleased to report that the third quarter was very strong for the company. Adjusted operating income and margin were significantly higher, driven by an increase of over 30% in the company's cigarette shipments. I'd note that R.J. Reynolds' retail market share is presented on a pro forma basis, which reflects share information from the company's new brand portfolio, following the acquisition and the related divestiture. 
Reflecting these factors, R.J. Reynolds' total cigarette retail market share was down slightly from the prior year quarter at 32%. However, the company's expanded portfolio of growth brands, Newport, Camel and Pall Mall, added 0.2 percentage point in combined retail market share to 29.4% for the quarter. These brands now make up about 92% of the company's total cigarette market share. 
Even with the standstill in restrictions that I mentioned earlier, Newport is showing excellent momentum, with third quarter share of retail shipments increasing 0.5 percentage point from the prior year quarter to 13.3%. Camel's retail market share performance held steady in the quarter at 8.3%, and the company remains focused on initiatives to build the brand equity. 
Performance of R.J. Reynolds' Pall Mall value brand reflected the company's continued balance between share and profitability. The brand's retail market share was down 0.3 percentage point at 7.8% in the third quarter and was flat sequentially. 
As I'm sure you noticed in today's release, Santa Fe drove performance to new heights in the third quarter, with double-digit growth in volume and operating income. The company's highly profitable Natural American Spirit brand is successfully broadening awareness and trial beyond its traditional strong market in the Western U.S. And the brand reported retail market share of 1.9% for the quarter. That was up 0.3 percentage point from the prior year quarter. And Natural American Spirit's distinctive natural tobacco style grew volume by almost 20%. 
Now turning to moist snuff and American Snuff continued solid performance in a competitive market. The company, again, increased operating income with its flagship Grizzly brand, delivering higher volume and retail market share. American Snuff grew total moist snuff volume by 4.4%, which, again, outpaced industry growth of about 2.5% for the quarter. As a result, the company's moist snuff retail market share was up 1.3 percentage points from the prior year quarter at 33.7%. 
Grizzly delivered third quarter retail market share growth of 1.4 percentage points to almost 31%, and that was on volume growth of 4.6%. I'm pleased to say that Grizzly's reputation for offering innovative products continues. The brand's dark Wintergreen style, which was expanded nationally in March, is performing very well. 
So all in all, RAI's third quarter and 9 months have gone extremely well, and we continued to deliver excellent total shareholder return. And I'm especially pleased with the way that Newport's integration is progressing. 
So now I'll turn the call over to Andrew."

Reynolds American and its operating companies had a great quarter, which included Newport's first full quarterly contribution earnings, and this resulted in a very successful first 9 months. RAI increased third quarter reported EPS by 4.5% from the prior year quarter to $0.46. On an adjusted basis, third quarter EPS was $0.55, up 17% from the prior year quarter. These results were supported by higher pricing and volumes across the board, the expiration of the federal tobacco quota buyout as well as continuous productivity improvements. 
Adjusted EPS excludes a charge of $0.04 per share for implementation costs and a charge of $0.05 per share for asset impairment and exit costs related to the consolidation of VUSE's manufacturing operations. 
RAI's 9-month reported EPS was $2.45, about double the prior year period. On an adjusted basis, 9-month EPS was $1.50, up more than 18%. Adjusted EPS excludes the items I've just mentioned as well as the gain on the divestiture, a benefit from the 2003 NPM adjustment claim, charges for transaction-related and financing costs, Engle progeny cases and tobacco-related and other litigation. RAI's third quarter adjusted operating margin jumped by 6.4 percentage points to almost 44.5%. 
Now I'll turn to our operating company's performance, where I'll discuss adjusted results where applicable. Please refer to the schedules at the end of our earnings release for reconciliations from our GAAP to adjusted results. 
As Susan said, R.J. Reynolds performed very well in the third quarter, with higher cigarette pricing and the expiration of the federal tobacco-quota buyout benefiting the bottom line, in addition to Newport's contribution. The company's reported operating income was $1.1 billion. Adjusted operating income increased by 64.6% from the prior year quarter to $1.2 billion. For the 9 months, R.J. Reynolds' reported operating income was $2.4 billion. 9 months adjusted operating income increased by more than 35% to $2.7 billion. The company's third quarter operating margin grew by 5.1 percentage points to 46.7%. And as Susan mentioned, the company's third quarter cigarette shipments were up 30.2% from the prior year quarter. 
Wholesale inventory levels for the industry were approximately 7.6 billion units at the end of the third quarter, up about 600 million from the prior year quarter. R.J. Reynolds' inventory of approximately $2.3 billion were in line with the preceding quarter, reflecting the normalized level of the new cigarette portfolio. 
Before I move onto Santa Fe, I'd like to highlight the favorable impact from the settlement between the participating manufacturers and the state of New York on the NPM disputed payments. As a result of the settlement, R.J. Reynolds and Santa Fe will receive credits currently estimated to be approximately $290 million that will applied to the company's MSA payments over the next 4 years for its adjusted claims relating to the years 2004 through 2014. Additionally, the company may also receive credits based on a sliding scale keyed to the volume of non-state-excise-tax paid tribal sales in New York during the relevant market year. I'd note that since 2012, R.J. Reynolds has reached settlements in 24 jurisdictions on NPM adjustment claims related to the company's master settlement agreement payments. 
Now moving onto Santa Fe. Higher pricing and volume also boosted Santa Fe's earnings, and the company increased operating income by more than 23% from the prior year quarter to $120 million. That brought 9-month operating income to $337 million, which was up almost 37%. Santa Fe's third quarter operating margin also rose by 0.7 percentage point to more than 55%. It's worth noting that for the 9 months, the company reported operating margin of 55.5%. 
Now let's turn to American Snuff. The company increased third quarter operating income 3.4% to $121 million as higher pricing and volume more than offset the timing of marketing support activity. For the first 9 months, operating income rose almost 12.5% to $369 million. American Snuff's operating margin remained strong at 57.5% for the quarter. 
Before I turn to the Q&A, there are some other important items I want to mention. In line with the company's commitment to deleverage as quickly as possible while maintaining financial flexibility, we plan to pay down $450 million in debt that matures on Friday. At the end of the third quarter, our total long-term debt was $17 billion. 
I'd note again that we have a very manageable debt portfolio, which carries an average interest rate of 4.5% with an average maturity of 12.1 years. The company ended the quarter with cash balances of $2.9 billion. 
We remain deeply committed to returning value to our shareholders. And in that vein, I'd remind you of our 2-for-1 stock split in August as well as the most recent 7.5% dividend increase. 
So that finishes up our highly successful year-to-date. And as a result, we're tightening our full year adjusted earnings guidance to a range of $1.94 per share to $2 per share. Please note that this adjusted earnings guidance excludes all the items I mentioned at the beginning of my discussion. Thank you. 
Now we'll turn to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, would you remind our callers how to get into the queue?"

And as I stated, we do expect that we will recapture most of that volume with other styles in the family."

And in the really strong years, we've seen, like this year, it's been particularly strong, where the economy -- we've had very good economic tailwinds for our consumers. But probably, the average of this 2% to 4% decline rate is where we should look as we go forward. And obviously, we report on that every quarter. We don't -- we have not yet been able to dissect Hawaii. As you know, it's a very small state, and we'll certainly look at those results. What's interesting and the perspective on that is that we have worked with the states for years to reduce underage smoking. And we've been very successful getting laws in place. The vast majority of volume that is used by underage is bought for them by adults. So the outcome of the 21 versus 18, I don't think we can see anything yet with that. There are better ways to address it. But having said that, that's the state's call. But we will be following that. And obviously, we'll be following if there's any other momentum as we go forward."

But once the new retail contracts are in place, I assume you're going to tell me that both Newport and Camel should benefit from that. What I'm trying to get a sense of is, is one benefiting more than the other? You have the sort of new customers or new accounts that, perhaps, Camel could benefit from in the East Coast, and likewise, Newport could benefit from Camel -- contracts of Camel. Is there one that benefits more than the other? Or one maybe don't want to change too much like those existing Newport customers, perhaps you won't see much change there?"

Now Newport, in absolute terms, is a bigger brand where it is big. And so -- but I really am excited as we've shown you the map, where we get a very balanced national market share, although it is made up of different parts of our portfolio. And therefore, the merchandising opportunity to give Camel some space in the Northeast and give Newport some more space in the West, they will both benefit from that in their strongholds. In the middle of the country, perhaps, where neither of them -- there may not be as much benefit, because they're both sort of there. But I do believe on the coast, that both brands will benefit. And from retail presence, from merchandising, from the display and where that display is located, I think there's quite a bit of opportunity. And our -- I know our trade marketing guys can't wait to get started resetting the racks, and so we look forward to that unfolding over the next few months."
