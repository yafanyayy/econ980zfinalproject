I suspect you're more than referencing a few data points that have come out with regard to frequency. And let me just start by saying no matter what frequencies are reported, they're all samples from an overall population and even if we do frequency by channel, we're going to have slightly different numbers. I think what you're more likely focused on is what would be a fairly dramatic difference that suggests we've also had reported recently in Progressive. I'm not going to even attempt to try to explain these differences, but let me give you a fair amount of colors to where I see things going. We spend a reasonable amount of time looking at our frequency and severity, but I'll focus is on frequency for now because that's your question. 
Relative to PCI data, and while we don't lay on top of PCI directly, and right now, are little more favorable, i.e., frequency a lower, were a lot more comparable to the PCI data than we were, for example, Allstate. The can happen. I mean, you sample any population, you're going to have different outcomes. So it's not a question on what's right and wrong, but to explain mixed differences and mixed differences can occur through urban concentrations, concentrations, different states. So to recognize of these data points really to be broken down. You referenced miles driven. One of the advantages that Progressive has suggested to investors before is that we had an early look system at miles driven. Again, it's a sample of a very large population while without Snapshot, population being sizable, we're very comfortable that we're actually getting sort of on a daily, weekly, whatever we choose to examine basis any real detection of miles driven changes. 
I'm not going to sort of become a free data source and give you the specifics, but I will tell you, in July, there was an uptick in miles driven. We have seen an uptick all year, but it has been reasonably constant and then July, on July over July basis, more significant uptick. Again, what's more important there is what kind of miles are being driven, and we're analyzing that from a point of view. So I'll just give you 1 break that we use and that is miles -- or trips, single continuous trips over the 15 miles. We're actually seeing that become a higher percentage of miles driven. So again, frequency will track with the top of miles and we're seeing longer trips, different frequency for longer trips and are trips. We simply are observing our frequencies. We report them as they are. Obviously, very favorable right now. I don't know that you should assume that Progressive is in getting know there's a large player. So our frequencies maybe reflective of the environment. They may change. Whenever we see another data point that's inconsistent with our own, clearly, it puts our attention to make sure that we're not perhaps overlooking a future trend to that data point. Clearly, what we measure is what we measure. The real issue is which direction is it going. So we are seeing miles driven up. We are seeing a certain type of miles driven up. We believe that, that could result in higher frequencies. But so far, we're not betting on a dramatic change in the frequency and are very comfortable only have. All of that should be translated into pricing. It's really not a matter of whether frequency is comments whether or not you price for the frequency and price for the security. And right now, we're comfortable that we've actually previously seen opportunities to take our rates up, believing that frequencies would rise. and we're in a very comfortable position as we see it right now. We have mechanisms inside of our rates, whereby we keep those rates moving up a small amount. And hopefully, we will match frequency and severity for a period of time when we simply get out of match. That's when we take more dramatic or quantum rate changes, 1%, 2%, whatever is necessary. Did that answer your question?"

So that is the size of the book, but not all those customers have an active chip because once that actually gone through the first 6 months, we will actually have them give the chip back and we'll recycle it. While you can always make an assessment that more data is better, there's also cost more data, so it's really a question of marginal cost versus marginal return of new information. But we're looking at something in the order of 1 million trips a day. So think about it as not so much how many vehicles, but what we're really getting from it. Cumulatively, we're well over 13 or probably posting 15 billion miles driven and 1 million trips a day is a big number relative to sort of sample statistics. So we're very comfortable that we've got that inside look and while it may not have been the primary driving force behind snapshot, clearly it wasn't, it's an awfully good side effect."

I get your point on rate, but rate is a top line -- or I'm sorry, rate is more function of topline rest frequency to be more margin related.

So for the most part, we can assume that both numbers are right. Why there so disparate from the same population? I don't have a great answer for you. I certainly can give you lots of pieces why they will never be the same. In fact, 30 years of being in the business, I often have trouble reconciling between channels and other carriers, but this is a pretty big difference and I've not seen that on very many occasions. So I don't have a good information. If I had to speculate, I would say mix is probably a good chunk of that. I mentioned in sort of the urban and rural kind of environment, I don't have the ability, I don't think anyone does, to be able to dissect the mix of the business to see if it could be an explanatory variable. That one's a tough one. I think the key thing for us and maybe this is just part of my nature is I get more paranoid when things going well. So you can be sure that if someone else is seeing something, we'll be looking, but it's not something that we're worried about missing. I mean, we know how many claims are coming on a daily basis. We know how to count those claims and if we see any sort of upticks, be sure we'll be adjusting for it. Regard seeing it right now."

It's us together, which I find to be the most exciting thing that we've done. In a long time. and I said there to be limited the distribution, I'll come back and comment on that. You talked about costs and start up. Definitely will be some sort of cost but most of those will be just a reallocation of cost that we have in the marketplace. So were not necessarily hiring new people or someone so forth. they'll be some incremental cost but probably not one that will flow through to a degree that you would see them. On the other hand, the commission cost, we absolutely are prepared to pay more commission and we'll do so for these platinum agents if they provide us with the exact content of bundled product that we're looking for. So that should reflect -- there'll be a little hard to see. I'll be more than willing to take those sort of questions after another quarter, 6 months, but you may have trouble seeing that flow through in the expense ratio because of it will be relatively small. Why are we doing limited distribution? Frankly, we really want to get out of class and I tried to note this a little bit in my letter, at class of customer that, for the most part, in a separate here just a very often but I will for now, Progressive and ASI, but more preferred customer and that's why we've always wanted them, we've always had a product that had not been the sweet spot for us in agency channel. And this gives us opportunity to little data set of those customers and understand if there is truly a different pure premium that they represent versus perhaps a more mass distributed product. And obviously, we're making a very -- thinking intelligent and informed. But to be fair, imperfect of this point in time to termination of that pure premium will be lower and support a higher commission and as we get more of that data, which we're excited to start having come in, we will be able to, A, confirm that or, as I hope is possible, recognize that this possibly even more there is the address this pure premium segment that we really haven't seen before both bundled and a class of customers that a group of agents have access to that we previously have not captured. So a little bit up on commission cost but that will probably be very small and aggregate. But to help you with that, I'm more than willing to give you some data on that as we have future calls like this. Our internal expenses, while we're allocating sales resources and rollout expenses, I wouldn't worry about that too much."

And over time, we will certainly internally look at the percentage of ne w business that are coming with proof of prior from Allstate so an so forth. But we do the other the focus of business anyway. We have seen starting at about May, John, correct me if I'm wrong there, that the Page 6 from Allstate and even insurers to a degree, have actually gone down very significantly. We tracked those sort of things. So that comments pulling back on advertising certainly we've seen that in the page search area, which is easiest 1 for us to get a clean hand along, which is great from our perspective. Obviously, we're not doing that. In fact, our spend has been strengthened just a little bit. So this is a time where as long as we're very comfortable with their rate level and we talked about some of the macro trends of miles driven frequency, these are all the things that we spent, that's basically what we do. We spend our time back to make sure that those in balance. As long as we think we've got good balance, this was actually good time for us. But I would also tell you, building on my prior comment of being paranoid, when you grow fast, the book changes. And while we're big and no matter how much do business it doesn't change dramatically, we've got to be very cautious of new business effects. So to the extent that your business comes in with prior insurance, that is actually better for us than those that have no prior insurance. Is it an opportunity? Absolutely. But were going to make sure that we do I gel and that were worry too much about what others are doing. and right now, we're positioned in a really nice way.

So I think 3, 4 points a year, we are down below that right now. And we think that is due to some improvements in our claims handling. So we think it's a good problem to have, doesn't mean that will dial everything down quickly good experience. But Gary is certainly watching that closely and we'll adjust as appropriate. We're seeing the improvement across business lines. So that's another indication that there may be a handling the improvement. That we are seeing within our claims organization because our class organization handles all lines within the same quarter. So we feel great about the BI severity transfixing. And we'll take adjustments as we see fit. On the property side, we have taken some adjustments there as well. It's been little more in terms of percentage losses than on the vehicle side.

We try the price all pieces of our business. We call them's CMT doesn't really matter, just market years, commercial marketeers. So we're looking for the same kind of margin in each segment.

The probably the biggest things you've done. we get you an updated IR meeting. Be up but in the marketplace, the terminology internally we use is 3.0, don't worry too much about that and we put it in concert with the most recent overall personal lines product design and that's out there now 5, 68 [ph]  something like that. In the 4 states that I have received data on and weed look at, there are couple of the points that are notable. The increase in usage of Snapshot by the agents has gone up pretty significantly, but still low level. So that's important. Absolutely, we achieved something that we were setting out to achieve until we get to a level that it would say approximate to the recommend, no. So think of that as a more in the 10% range in terms of usage by agents, whereas with regard to direct, think about it a little bit more in the 30% to 40% range. Were not going to give absolute estimates on that, but I give you those ranges and you can assume that they're very accurate. One of the things as important to us in Snapshot is that if you take the customers that are specifically now indirect, that are using our multiproduct quoting mechanism, actually, the numbers are considerably higher. So those who intend to buy multiproduct from us are quoting and buying at rates closer to 45%, 50% using Snapshot. So we're actually very good about that. So it's been we we have used in the discussions in may and sort of the future Robinsons modestly value services with the future Robinsons, those that are transitioning, that group issuing a high propensity to consider Snapshot. So when I say Diane's, it could be we directors product to be those are become this early Robinsons. So it's feeling a niche that's very useful to us. When you start getting into those numbers, while we can continue to say there are parts of the population that are just still saying, no, I don't want that level of intrusion in my vehicle, whatever their reasons are for that. So we're not expecting 100% by any stretch of imagination. But it's a pretty good part of the marketplace that we actually want and expect to be a big part of the destination area. There are those are buying were traditionally nonstandard, which we clearly, clearly, clearly continue to want to offer. Always interested in having quite that level of active involvement in their insurance and may or may not keep it very long. But those that we want sort of the with us the best recover actually showing very high take rates. So comfortable with that. I gave you some information on the mileage driven. In terms of our discounts, we're comfortable that and renewal, were seeing something around and 60 plus percent of people actually getting the renewal quotes, which gives them at least the discount we advanced to them at Point-of-Sale. Now there's still another percentage, but actually getting a discount but maybe not quite as much as we advanced at the point-of-sale. So that general 70-30 we're showing you in the past, is suggesting that there is still sort of 70 percentage, possibly  a little more, a little less dependent on the state are benefiting from the Snapshot. So the greater good theory here is clearly working in our favor. There are a percent of those are not exposed a significant increase and then frankly, there are those that use it is proportionate amount of the loss cost and we are applying a search this new model. And we recognize that, that will be, for those individuals, either a nonrenewal or a reluctant renewal, whatever that might be. However, as long as the numbers are as favorable as we see them, we're comfortable that we've got a good design outlook in the marketplace that can sustain and match lost cost whether with individual."

I'll try, I don't remember a specific reference, they may be me. for let me just sort of suggest to you as far as I'm concerned, we think in terms of accident year. Most of a time. Calendar year is just sort of an adjustment for the quality defects reserving a previous way in a previous way, in the previous period. So accident year for me is almost exclusively the way we like to look at the business. Clearly, we all understand of those adjustments are made from an accounting perspective but the accident year is probably a better way to look at the economics us the accounting. I thought try to give with this, maybe I wasn't clear. Degradation in the loss ratio under certain circumstances might be a really bad situation. If on the other hand, the loss ratio was lower than your previously this on target, then it might be perfectly acceptable to move towards your target. Clearly not acceptable to go beyond your target. If and when market conditions are such that you're willing to give up a point of loss ratio and get what you consider to be proportionate volume or does the city of the market is willing to give a 2, then those are trade-off that not only do you make comments or of the heart and soul of what we say is the guiding principle of the Progressive and that is the attempt to make a 4% underwriting profit, if and when we do, we try to go as fast as possible. And it's very much that sequence and we are quite comfortable right now seeing that the market will give us some growth and we want to be priced as close to our target as we can. So hopefully, that clarifies it. But I think accident year is by far more of the economic of the company. the calendar year is the accounting."

We give you in the queue, the average premium, the rate of increase of average premium. You can see that's recently healthy, which is also going to affect the loss ratio as long as that average premium is going up faster than the rate of increase in the fuel premium. So just a factor all those things in, there are a lot of moving parts. This is more a informational comment one of the things that we do is we track all rate revisions done on a monthly basis that's usually for us to attract about 200 to 400 rate revisions. I think 50 state, many carriers. We're seeing, on average, of unlike lesser lastly the points is quite a variable function. I'm seeing the market rate of increase  at about 2.6, give or take, and there's a give or take to that. and we give you an average premium of increase of 4% in our personal lines business. So we're at least sort of keeping up with that or perhaps are pricing ahead of that and others are now perhaps catching up. We also have some mechanisms in our REIT in many states, we're actually continuously taking just a little bit. It doesn't account for a great deal but it means that each time, we can soft in the discrete event of having to adjust for rates.

I suspect you're more than referencing a few data points that have come out with regard to frequency. And let me just sort of start by saying, no matter what frequencies are reported, they're all samples from an overall population. And even if",710,"Sure, Amit. I suspect you're more than referencing a few data points that have come out with regard to frequency. And let me just sort of start by saying, no matter what frequencies are reported, they're all samples from an overall population. And even if we do frequency by channel, we're going to have slightly different numbers. I think what you're more likely focused on is what would be a fairly dramatic difference that suggests with Allstate having reported recently and Progressive. I'm not going to even attempt to try to explain those differences, but let me give you a fair amount of color as to where I see things going. We spend a reasonable amount of time looking at our frequency and severity, but I'll focus just on frequency for now because I think that's what your question.
Relative to PCI data, and while we don't lay on top of PCI directly, and right now are little more favorable, i.e., our frequency is a little lower, we're a lot more comparable to the PCI data than we were, for example, Allstate. That can happen. I mean, you sample any population, you're going to have different outcomes. So it's not a question of what's right and wrong, but starting to explain mix differences. And mix differences can occur through urban concentrations, rural concentrations, different states. So recognize all of these data points really need to be broken down. You referenced miles driven. One of the advantages that Progressive has suggested to investors before is that we have an early look system at miles driven. Again, it's a sample of a very large population, where with our Snapshot population being sizable, we're very comfortable that we're actually getting sort of on a daily, weekly, whatever we choose to examine basis any real detection of miles driven changes.
I'm not going to sort of become a free data source and give you the specifics, but I will tell you, in July, there was an uptick in miles driven. We had seen an uptick all year, but it has been reasonably constant. And then in July, on July-over-July basis, a more significant uptick. Again, what's more important there is what kind of miles are being driven, and we're analyzing that from a point of view. So I'll just give you one break that we use, and that is miles -- or trips, single continuous trips over 15 miles. We're actually seeing that become a higher percentage of miles driven. So again, frequency will track with the type of miles, and we're seeing longer trips. There's a different frequency for longer trips than there are for shorter trips. We simply are observing our frequencies. We report them as they are. Obviously, very favorable right now. I don't know that you should assume that Progressive is anything other than a large player. So our frequencies may be reflective of the environment. They may change. Whenever we see another data point that's inconsistent with our own, clearly, it puts our attention to make sure that we're not perhaps overlooking a future trend to that data point. Clearly, what we measure is what we measure. The real issue is which direction is it going. So we are seeing miles driven up. We are seeing a certain type of miles driven up. We believe that, that could result in higher frequencies. But so far, we're not betting on a dramatic change in the frequencies and we're very comfortable with what we have. All of that should be translated into pricing. It's really not a matter of what the frequency is, it's whether or not you price for that frequency and price for that severity. And right now, we are very comfortable that we have actually previously seen opportunities to take our rates up, believing that frequencies would rise. And we're in a very comfortable position as we see it right now. We have mechanisms inside of our rates whereby we keep those rates moving up a small amount. And hopefully, we will match frequency and severity for a period of time. When we simply get out of match, that's when we take more dramatic or quantum rate changes, 1%, 2%, whatever is necessary. Did that answer your question?"

So that is the size of the book, but not all those customers have an active chip because once they're actually gone through the first 6 months, we will actually have them give the chip back and we'll recycle it. While you can always make the assessment that more data is better, there's also a cost to more data. So it's really a question of the marginal cost versus the marginal return of new information. But we're looking at something in the order of 1 million trips a day. So think about it as not so much how many vehicles, but what we're really getting from it. Cumulatively, we're well over 13 billion or probably approaching 15 billion miles driven. And 1 million trips a day is a big number relative to sort of sample statistics. So we're very comfortable that we've got that inside look. And while it may not have been the primary driving force behind Snapshot, clearly, it wasn't, it's an awfully good side effect."

I certainly can give you lots of pieces why they will never be the same. In fact, in 30 years of being in the business, I often have trouble reconciling between channels and other carriers. But this is a pretty big difference, and I've not seen that on very many occasions. Though I don't have a good explanation, if I had to speculate, I would say mix is probably a good chunk of that. I mentioned sort of the urban and rural kind of environment. I don't have the ability -- don't think anyone does -- to be able to dissect the mix of the business to see if it could be an explanatory variable. That one's a tough one. I think the key thing for us, and maybe this is just part of my nature is, I get more paranoid when things are going well. So you can be sure that if someone else is seeing something, we'll be looking, but it's not something that we're worried about missing. I mean, we know how many claims are coming in on a daily basis. We know how to count those claims. And if we see any sort of upticks, you can be sure we'll be adjusting for it. But we're not seeing any."

Because Platinum, think about our relationship with ASI in its current form of being 1 quarter in and we've gotten within that first 90 days, we're out in the marketplace with a product that basically is just us, not one or the other or 2 together. It's us together, which I find to be the most exciting thing that we have done in a long time. And I said in there, it will be a limited distribution. I'll come back and comment on that. You talked about costs and startup. There will definitely be some startup cost, but most of those will be just a reallocation of cost that we have in the marketplace. So we're not necessarily hiring new people or so on and so forth. There'll be some incremental cost, but probably not ones that will flow through to any degree that you would see them. On the other hand, the commission cost, we absolutely are prepared to pay more commission, and we'll do so for these Platinum agents if they provide us with the exact intent, the bundled product that we're looking for. So that should reflect -- it will be a little hard to see. I'll be more than willing to take those sort of questions after another quarter, 6 months, but you may have trouble seeing that flow through in the expense ratio because it will be relatively small. Why are we doing limited distribution? Frankly, we really want to get out of class. And I tried to note this a little bit in my letter, a class of customer that, for the most part, and I'll separate here just -- not very often, but I will for now, Progressive and ASI. The more preferred customer that while we've always wanted them, we've always had a product, had not been the sweet spot for us in the agency channel. And this gives us an opportunity to literally get a data set of those customers and understand if there is truly a different pure premium that they represent versus perhaps a more mass distributed product. And obviously, we're making a very -- we think an intelligent and informed, but to be fair, imperfect at this point in time determination that, that pure premium will be lower and support a higher commission. And as we get more of that data, which we're excited to start having come in, we will be able to, A, confirm that or as I hope is possible, recognize that there's possibly even more there as we address this pure premium segment that we really haven't seen before of both bundled and a class of customers that a group of agents have access to that we previously have not captured. So a little bit up on commission cost, but that will probably be very small in the aggregate. But to help you with that, I'm more than willing to give you some data on that as we have future calls like this. Our internal expenses, while we're allocating sales resources and rollout expenses, I wouldn't worry about that too much."

And if you think about the percentage of new business that we get when people switch were obviously one of those considerations. So calibrating that good news is we report monthly. You'll get to see. And over time, we will certainly internally look at the percentage of new business that are coming with proof of prior from Allstate so on and so forth, but we do that in the natural course of business anyway. We have seen starting at about May -- John, correct me if I'm wrong there -- that the paid search from Allstate and even insurance to a degree have actually gone down very significantly. We track those sort of things. So their comment of pulling back on advertising, certainly, we have seen that in the paid search area, which is the easiest one for us to get a clean handle on, which is great from our perspective. Obviously, we're not doing that. In fact, our ad spend has been strengthened just a little bit. So this is a time where as long as we're very comfortable with our rate level -- and we've talked about some of the macro trends of miles driven and frequency -- these are all the things that we spend -- that's basically what we do. We spend our time trying to make sure we've got those in balance. As long as we think we've got them in balance, this is actually a good time for us. But I would also tell you, building on my prior comment of being paranoid, when you grow fast, the book changes. And while we're big and no matter how much new business, it doesn't change dramatically, we've got to be very conscious of new business effects. So to the extent that new business comes in with prior insurance, that is actually better for us than those that have no prior insurance. Is it an opportunity? Absolutely. But we've got to make sure that we do our job and not worry too much about what others are doing. And right now, we're positioned in a really nice way. So I feel great about the marketplace. I feel great about our pricing. And we'll take our wins there."

So to me, I don't think about a deterioration in loss ratio is necessarily a positive or a negative. I'm much more focused on the target that we're trying to achieve under the different market conditions. So if we get out ahead, and we've done that, we actually end up with wider margins.

So we're just -- I'll just hit some top line issues, won't go into all the details. But if I'm an agent producing, I will absolutely get an immediate recognition of more commission. Certainly, from the Progressive side, it will be additive to what I would have otherwise got. Then there is a level at which you can attain different compensation overrides later based on certain levels of production. And while I know that, I couldn't explain them all to you right this second. We're very comfortable that, that level of commission puts us in a competitive situation, not necessarily overly competitive, but agents certainly will not be able to say, ""Gee, I'd love to use you, but your commission isn't quite what I might get from another carrier."" It's in that ballpark. And those that actually use us very well can even expect more than that. We've made what I would call not a concession, just a marketing approach. It will be a very small percentage of our policies in-force, but we'll also try to coordinate policy periods so that those who are truly committed to that destination type of situation that we've been talking to you about can have an annual policy and an auto -- and a home policy with concurrent or simultaneous renewal dates. And those sorts of things are changes. We know the pluses and minuses of doing those sorts of things, but they've been very well received by agents so far. I can't give you a great deal of insight as to Platinum's receptivity. We've been in the market in Texas about 40 days as of the end of the quarter. Indiana, I think, snuck in just in the quarter, if I remember correctly. I don't know if we wrote a policy in the quarter, but we're in there. And we'll continue to roll that out. I will tell you that the initial receptivity from sales folks -- and our sales folks tend to have a way of being more excited than sometimes I am -- is very, very positive. So I'd be disappointed if that wasn't the case. But I can't give you a really good feel right now about sort of incremental volume over the offerings that the agent already had. We are certainly of the belief that it's incremental. We just don't have a good sizing on that, that we'd feel comfortable giving to you at this point time."

Our commercial business in general -- and we gave you this in the Q -- is average premiums are actually up period across the board. Is that on all segments? Yes. But is it more dramatic in some segments? Also yes. So the mix shift towards for hire business, transportation and specialty lines with the higher average premiums, absolutely, that's part of it. Your question, the second part of the question was, so should we expect erosion on the combined ratio because of that? The answer is not by design in any way, shape or form. We try the price all pieces of our business. We call them CMT. It doesn't really matter, just marketeers, commercial marketeers. So we're looking for the same kind of margin in each segment. Why we've been able to get rate and have a good loss results is in large part reflective of the market really hardened in those segments and there are less availability of carriers. So we're benefiting from that. We're happy to do that. We don't think that will last forever. But -- and you also use 96%. In some cases, we don't price every segment to 96%. Our clear explanation in the annual report is all -- the amalgam of all of our products comes to 96%. So in places where we believe there are higher risks -- and there are higher risks in commercial simply because you have lower unit numbers and lower losses to deal with. So our -- what we will call indications, always have a little bit more volatility to them. So we include volatility in part of our targets. So a lot in there, but no, you shouldn't assume that because we have a slight mix change to the for hire segment, which is driving average premium, that necessarily that should drive loss costs.

The -- probably the bigger things we've done, we gave you an update at the IR meeting. We've brought it into the marketplace. The terminology internally we use is 3.0. Don't worry too much about that. And we put it in concert with the most recent overall personal lines product design. And that's out there now 5, 6 states, something like that. In the 4 states that I have received data on and looked at, here are a couple of the points that are notable. The increase in usage of Snapshot by the agents has gone up fairly significantly, but still at a low level. So that's important. Absolutely, we achieved something that we were setting out to achieve. Can we get to a level that we would say approximates the direct? No. So think of that as more in the 10% range in terms of usage by agents, whereas with regard to direct, think about it a little bit more in the 30% to 40% range. We're not going to give absolute estimates on that, but I'll give you those ranges, and you can assume that they're very accurate. One of the things that is important to us in Snapshot is that if you take the customers that are -- and specifically are now indirect that are using a multiproduct quoting mechanism, actually, the numbers are considerably higher. So those who intend to buy multiproduct from us are quoting and buying at rates closer to 45%, 50% using Snapshot. So we're actually very excited about that. So a term that we may have used in the discussions in May is sort of the future Robinsons. Obviously, we use Robinsons. But the future Robinsons, those Dianes that are transitioning, that group is showing a high propensity to consider Snapshot. So when I say Dianes, it could be with a renter's product or it could be those that have become just early Robinsons. So it's filling a niche that's very useful to us. And when you start getting into those numbers, while we can continue to say, there are parts of the population that are just still saying, ""No, I don't want that level of intrusion in my vehicle,"" whatever their reasons are for that. So we're not expecting 100% by any stretch of the imagination, but it's a pretty good part of the marketplace that we actually want and expect to be a big part of our destination area. There are those that are buying more traditionally nonstandard, which we clearly, clearly, clearly continue to want to offer. They are not always interested in having quite that level of active involvement in their insurance and may or may not keep it very long. But those that we want to sort of be with us at the best rate are actually showing very high take rates. So comfortable with that. I gave you some information on the mileage driven. In terms of our discounts, we're comfortable that at renewal, we're seeing something around -- 60-plus percent of people actually getting their renewal quote, which gives them at least the discount we advanced to them at point-of-sale. Now there's still another percentage that are actually getting a discount, but maybe not quite as much as we advanced at the point-of-sale. So that general 70-30 we're showing you in the past, is suggesting that there are still sort of 70%-ish, possibly a little more, a little less depending on the state, that are benefiting from the Snapshot. So the greater good theory here is clearly working in our favor. There are a percent of those that are not exposed to a significant increase. And then frankly, there are those that use a disproportionate amount of the loss costs and we are applying a surcharge with this new model. And we recognize that, that will be, for those individuals, either a nonrenewal or a reluctant renewal, whatever that might be. However, as long as the numbers are as favorable as we see them, we're comfortable that we've got a good design out in the marketplace that can sustain and match lost costs better with the individual."

For what it's worth, our research has shown that over the last few years, you've done a pretty good job of your pricing and loss trends tracking each other, within a couple of points, of course. Who knows if that's correct.

In response to questions from Meyer, I believe you said that your focus is on the accident year, more so than the calendar year. And so number one, I want to make sure I understood that right. Maybe there were 2 separate issues being discussed. And then the secondarily and part of that was, it does appear as Ian was saying that the reserve releases remain strong, but the underlying loss ratio continues to be higher. I don't know if that should be cause for concern or if that should be cause for future optimism that the -- that those 2 -- that the reserve releases may, in fact, be a leading indicator of an eventual improvement in the underlying loss ratio.

Let me just sort of suggest to you, as far as I'm concerned, we think in terms of accident year, most of the time. Calendar year is just sort of an adjustment for the quality defects in reserving in a previous way -- in a previous period. So accident year for me is almost exclusively the way we like to look at the business. Clearly, we all understand that those adjustments are made from an accounting perspective, but accident year is probably a better way to look at the economics versus the accounting. I thought I tried to get this with Ian's question, maybe I wasn't clear. Degradation in the loss ratio under certain circumstances might be a really bad situation. If on the other hand, the loss ratio was lower than your previously designed target, then it might be perfectly acceptable to move towards your target. Clearly, not acceptable to go beyond your target. If and when market conditions are such that you're willing to give up 1 point of loss ratio and get what you considered to be proportionate volume or the elasticity of the market is willing to give it to you, then those are trade-offs that not only do we make, it's sort of the heart and soul of what we say is the guiding principles of Progressive. And that is, we attempt to make a 4% underwriting profit. If and when we do, we try to grow as fast as possible. And it's very much that sequence and we are quite comfortable right now seeing that the market will give us some growth, and we want to be priced as close to our target as we can. So hopefully, that clarifies it. But I think accident year is by far more of the economics of the company, the calendar year is the accounting."

We give you in the Q the average premium, the rate of increase of average premium. You can see that's recently healthy, which is also going to affect the loss ratio as long as that average premium is going up faster than the rate of increase in the pure premium. So just factor all those things in, there are a lot of moving parts. This is more a informational comment. One of the things that we do is we track all rate revisions done on a monthly basis. That's usually for us that we track about 200 to 400 rate revisions. So think 50 states, many carriers. We're seeing, on average, and as I cluster the last data points, it's quite a variable function. If I cluster the last data points, I'm seeing a market rate of increase at about 2.6% give or take. And there's a give or take to that. And we gave you an average premium increase of 4% in our personal lines business. So we're at least sort of keeping up with that or perhaps our pricing got ahead of that and others are now perhaps catching up. We also have some mechanisms in our rates in many states where we're actually continuously taking just a little bit. It doesn't account for a great deal, but it means that each time, we can soften the discrete event of having to adjust for rates. So don't be surprised that you'll see over time a little bit of closure, even in the situation that you're recognizing other than our pricing targets, which is the biggest one, but you will see premiums change at a slightly different rate than pure premiums and in some part, that's by design."

I suspect you're more than referencing a few data points that have come out with regard to frequency. And let me just sort of start by saying, no matter what frequencies are reported, they're all samples from an overall population. And even if",711,"Sure, Amit. I suspect you're more than referencing a few data points that have come out with regard to frequency. And let me just sort of start by saying, no matter what frequencies are reported, they're all samples from an overall population. And even if we do frequency by channel, we're going to have slightly different numbers. I think what you're more likely focused on is what would be a fairly dramatic difference that suggests with Allstate having reported recently and Progressive. I'm not going to even attempt to try to explain those differences, but let me give you a fair amount of color as to where I see things going. We spend a reasonable amount of time looking at our frequency and severity, but I'll focus just on frequency for now because I think that's what your question.
Relative to PCI data, and while we don't lay on top of PCI directly, and right now are little more favorable, i.e., our frequency is a little lower, we're a lot more comparable to the PCI data than we were, for example, Allstate. That can happen. I mean, you sample any population, you're going to have different outcomes. So it's not a question of what's right and wrong, but starting to explain mix differences. And mix differences can occur through urban concentrations, rural concentrations, different states. So recognize all of these data points really need to be broken down. You referenced miles driven. One of the advantages that Progressive has suggested to investors before is that we have an early look system at miles driven. Again, it's a sample of a very large population, but with our Snapshot population being sizable, we're very comfortable that we're actually getting sort of on a daily, weekly, whatever we choose to examine basis any real detection of miles driven changes.
I'm not going to sort of become a free data source and give you the specifics, but I will tell you, in July, there was an uptick in miles driven. We had seen an uptick all year, but it has been reasonably constant. And then in July, on July-over-July basis, a more significant uptick. Again, what's more important there is what kind of miles are being driven, and we're analyzing that from a point of view. So I'll just give you one break that we use, and that is miles -- or trips, single continuous trips over 15 miles. We're actually seeing that become a higher percentage of miles driven. So again, frequency will track with the type of miles, and we're seeing longer trips. There's a different frequency for longer trips than there are for shorter trips. We simply are observing our frequencies. We report them as they are. Obviously, very favorable right now. I don't know that you should assume that Progressive is anything other than a large player. So our frequencies may be reflective of the environment. They may change. Whenever we see another data point that's inconsistent with our own, clearly, it puts our attention to make sure that we're not perhaps overlooking a future trend to that data point. Clearly, what we measure is what we measure. The real issue is which direction is it going. So we are seeing miles driven up. We are seeing a certain type of miles driven up. We believe that, that could result in higher frequencies. But so far, we're not betting on a dramatic change in the frequencies and we're very comfortable with what we have. All of that should be translated into pricing. It's really not a matter of what the frequency is, it's whether or not you price for that frequency and price for that severity. And right now, we are very comfortable that we have actually previously seen opportunities to take our rates up, believing that frequencies would rise. And we're in a very comfortable position as we see it right now. We have mechanisms inside of our rates whereby we keep those rates moving up a small amount. And hopefully, we will match frequency and severity for a period of time. When we simply get out of match, that's when we take more dramatic or quantum rate changes, 1%, 2%, whatever is necessary. Did that get at your question?"

So that is the size of the book, but not all those customers have an active chip because once they've actually gone through the first 6 months, we will actually have them give the chip back and we'll recycle it. While you can always make the assessment that more data is better, there's also a cost to more data. So it's really a question of the marginal cost versus the marginal return of new information. But we're looking at something in the order of 1 million trips a day. So think about it as not so much how many vehicles, but what we're really getting from it. Cumulatively, we're well over 13 billion or probably approaching 15 billion miles driven. And 1 million trips a day is a big number relative to sort of sample statistics. So we're very comfortable that we've got that inside look. And while it may not have been the primary driving force behind Snapshot, clearly, it wasn't, it's an awfully good side effect."

I certainly can give you lots of pieces why they will never be the same. In fact, in 30 years of being in the business, I often have trouble reconciling between channels and other carriers. But this is a pretty big difference, and I've not seen that on very many occasions. Though I don't have a good explanation, if I had to speculate, I would say mix is probably a good chunk of that. I mentioned sort of the urban and rural kind of environment. I don't have the ability -- don't think anyone does -- to be able to dissect the mix of the business to see if it could be an explanatory variable. That one's a tough one. I think the key thing for us, and maybe this is just part of my nature is, I get more paranoid when things are going well. So you can be sure that if someone else is seeing something, we'll be looking, but it's not something that we're worried about missing. I mean, we know how many claims are coming in on a daily basis. We know how to count those claims. And if we see any sort of upticks, you can be sure we'll be adjusting for it. But we're not seeing any."

Because Platinum, think about our relationship with ASI in its current form of being 1 quarter in and we've gotten within that first 90 days, we're out in the marketplace with a product that basically is just us, not one or the other or 2 together. It's us together, which I find to be the most exciting thing that we have done in a long time. And I said in there, it will be a limited distribution. I'll come back and comment on that. You talked about costs and startup. There will definitely be some startup costs, but most of those will be just a reallocation of cost that we have in the marketplace. So we're not necessarily hiring new people or so on and so forth. There'll be some incremental cost, but probably not ones that will flow through to any degree that you would see them. On the other hand, the commission costs, we absolutely are prepared to pay more commission, and we'll do so for these Platinum agents if they provide us with the exact intent, the bundled product that we're looking for. So that should reflect -- it will be a little hard to see. I'll be more than willing to take those sort of questions after another quarter, 6 months, but you may have trouble seeing that flow through in the expense ratio because it will be relatively small. Why are we doing limited distribution? Frankly, we really want to get out of class. And I tried to note this a little bit in my letter, a class of customer that, for the most part, and I'll separate here just -- not very often, but I will for now, Progressive and ASI. The more preferred customer that while we've always wanted them, we've always had a product, had not been the sweet spot for us in the agency channel. And this gives us an opportunity to literally get a data set of those customers and understand if there is truly a different pure premium that they represent versus perhaps a more mass distributed product. And obviously, we're making a very -- we think an intelligent and informed, but to be fair, imperfect at this point in time determination that, that pure premium will be lower and support a higher commission. And as we get more of that data, which we're excited to start having come in, we will be able to, A, confirm that or as I hope is possible, recognize that there's possibly even more there as we address this pure premium segment that we really haven't seen before of both bundled and a class of customers that a group of agents have access to that we previously have not captured. So a little bit up on commission costs, but that will probably be very small in the aggregate. But to help you with that, I'm more than willing to give you some data on that as we have future calls like this. Our internal expenses, while we're allocating sales resources and rollout expenses, I wouldn't worry about that too much."

And if you think about the percentage of new business that we get when people switch were obviously one of those considerations. So calibrating that good news is we report monthly. You'll get to see. And over time, we will certainly internally look at the percentage of new business that are coming with proof of prior from Allstate so on and so forth, but we do that in the natural course of business anyway. We have seen starting at about May -- John, correct me if I'm wrong there -- that the paid search from Allstate and even Esurance to a degree have actually gone down very significantly. We track those sort of things. So their comment of pulling back on advertising, certainly, we have seen that in the paid search area, which is the easiest one for us to get a clean handle on, which is great from our perspective. Obviously, we're not doing that. In fact, our ad spend has been strengthened just a little bit. So this is a time where as long as we're very comfortable with our rate level -- and we've talked about some of the macro trends of miles driven frequency -- these are all the things that we spend -- that's basically what we do. We spend our time trying to make sure we've got those in balance. As long as we think we've got them in balance, this is actually a good time for us. But I would also tell you, building on my prior comment of being paranoid, when you grow fast, the book changes. And while we're big and no matter how much new business, it doesn't change dramatically, we've got to be very conscious of new business effects. So to the extent that new business comes in with prior insurance, that is actually better for us than those that have no prior insurance. Is it an opportunity? Absolutely. But we've got to make sure that we do our job and not worry too much about what others are doing. And right now, we're positioned in a really nice way. So I feel great about the marketplace. I feel great about our pricing. And we'll take our wins there."

This doesn't mean that we'll dial everything down quickly to the new experience, but Gary is certainly watching that closely and we'll adjust as appropriate. We're seeing the improvement across business lines.

So we're just -- I'll just hit some top line issues, won't go into all the details. But if I'm an agent producing, I will absolutely get an immediate recognition of more commission. Certainly, from the Progressive side, it will be additive to what I would have otherwise got. Then there is a level at which you can attain different compensation overrides later based on certain levels of production. And while I know that, I couldn't explain them all to you right this second. We're very comfortable that, that level of commission puts us in a competitive situation, not necessarily overly competitive, but agents certainly will not be able to say, ""Gee, I'd love to use you, but your commission isn't quite what I might get from another carrier."" It's in that ballpark. And those that actually use us very well can even expect more than that. We've made what I would call not a concession, just a marketing approach. It will be a very small percentage of our policies in-force, but we'll also try to coordinate policy periods so that those who are truly committed to that destination type of situation that we've been talking to you about can have an annual policy and an auto -- and a home policy with concurrent or simultaneous renewal dates. And those sorts of things are changes. We know the pluses and minuses of doing those sorts of things, but they've been very well received by agents so far. I can't give you a great deal of insight as to Platinum's receptivity. We've been in the market in Texas about 40 days as of the end of the quarter. Indiana, I think, snuck in just in the quarter, if I remember correctly. I don't know if we wrote a policy in the quarter, but we're in there. And we'll continue to roll that out. I will tell you that the initial receptivity from sales folks -- and our sales folks tend to have a way of being more excited than sometimes I am -- is very, very positive. So I'd be disappointed if that wasn't the case. But I can't give you a really good feel right now about sort of incremental volume over the offerings that the agent already had. We are certainly of the belief that it's incremental. We just don't have a good sizing on that, that we'd feel comfortable giving to you at this point time."

Our commercial business in general -- and we gave you this in the Q -- is average premiums are actually up period across the board. Is that on all segments? Yes. But is it more dramatic in some segments? Also yes. So the mix shift towards for hire business, transportation and specialty lines with the higher average premiums, absolutely, that's part of it. Your question, the second part of the question was, so should we expect erosion on the combined ratio because of that? The answer is not by design in any way, shape or form. We try to price all pieces of our business. We call them CMT. It doesn't really matter, just marketeers, commercial marketeers. So we're looking for the same kind of margin in each segment. While we've been able to get rate and have a good loss results is in large part reflective of the market really hardened in those segments and there are less availability of carriers. So we're benefiting from that. We're happy to do that. We don't think that will last forever. But -- and you also use 96%. In some cases, we don't price every segment to a 96%. Our clear explanation in the annual report is all -- the amalgam of all of our products comes to 96%. So in places where we believe there are higher risks -- and there are higher risks in commercial simply because you have lower unit numbers and lower losses to deal with. So our -- what we will call indications, always have a little bit more volatility to them. So we include volatility in part of our targets. So a lot in there, but no, you shouldn't assume that because we have a slight mix change to the for hire segments, which is driving average premium, that necessarily that should drive loss costs.

The -- probably the biggest things we've done, we gave you an update at the IR meeting. We've brought it into the marketplace. The terminology internally we use is 3.0. Don't worry too much about that. And we put it in concert with the most recent overall personal lines product design. And that's out now 5, 6 states, something like that. In the 4 states that I have received data on and looked at, here are a couple of the points that are notable. The increase in usage of Snapshot by the agents has gone up fairly significantly, but still at a low level. So that's important. Absolutely, we achieved something that we were setting out to achieve. Did we get to a level that we would say approximates the direct? No. So think of that as more in the 10% range in terms of usage by agents, whereas with regard to direct, think about it a little bit more in the 30% to 40% range. We're not going to give absolute estimates on that, but I'll give you those ranges, and you can assume that they're very accurate. One of the things that is important to us in Snapshot is that if you take the customers that are -- and specifically are now indirect that are using a multiproduct quoting mechanism, actually, the numbers are considerably higher. So those who intend to buy multiproduct from us are quoting and buying at rates closer to 45%, 50% using Snapshot. So we're actually very excited about that. So a term that we may have used in the discussions in May is sort of the future Robinsons. Obviously, we use Robinsons. But the future Robinsons, those Dianes that are transitioning, that group is showing a high propensity to consider Snapshot. So when I say Dianes, it could be with a renter's product or it could be those that have become just early Robinsons. So it's filling a niche that's very useful to us. And when you start getting into those numbers, while we can continue to say, there are parts of the population that are just still saying, ""No, I don't want that level of intrusion in my vehicle,"" whatever their reasons are for that. So we're not expecting 100% by any stretch of the imagination, but it's a pretty good part of the marketplace that we actually want and expect to be a big part of our destination area. There are those that are buying more traditionally nonstandard, which we clearly, clearly, clearly continue to want to offer. They are not always interested in having quite that level of active involvement in their insurance and may or may not keep it very long. But those that we want to sort of be with us at the best rate are actually showing very high take rates. So comfortable with that. I gave you some information on the mileage driven. In terms of our discounts, we're comfortable that at renewal, we're seeing something around -- 60-plus percent of people actually getting their renewal quote, which gives them at least the discount we advanced to them at point-of-sale. Now there's still another percentage that are actually getting a discount, but maybe not quite as much as we advanced at the point-of-sale. So that general 70-30 we're showing you in the past, is suggesting that there are still sort of 70%-ish, possibly a little more, a little less depending on the state, that are benefiting from the Snapshot. So the greater good theory here is clearly working in our favor. There are a percent of those that are not exposed to a significant increase. And then frankly, there are those that use a disproportionate amount of the loss costs and we are applying a surcharge with this new model. And we recognize that, that will be, for those individuals, either a nonrenewal or a reluctant renewal, whatever that might be. However, as long as the numbers are as favorable as we see them, we're comfortable that we've got a good design out in the marketplace that can sustain and match lost costs better with the individual."

For what it's worth, our research has shown that over the last few years, you've done a pretty good job of your pricing and loss trends tracking each other, within a couple of points, of course. Who knows if that's correct. But knowing what you know about your pricing and monitoring systems, if you went for a period where your pricing was more or less tracking your loss trends, would that have an ancillary effect of maintaining your portfolio homogeneity? In other words, your risks would be more or less as you expected. Or are those quite independent? In other words, could your account pricing track loss trend well, but you could still have pretty large shifts in homogeneity? And that's all I have."

In response to questions from Ian, you all spoke about the importance of looking at the overall calendar year combined ratio. In response to questions from Meyer, I believe you said that your focus is on the accident year, more so than the calendar year. And so number one, I want to make sure I understood that right. Maybe there were 2 separate issues being discussed. And then the secondarily and part of that was, it does appear as Ian was saying that the reserve releases remain strong, but the underlying loss ratio continues to be higher. I don't know if that should be cause for concern or if that should be cause for future optimism that the -- that those 2 -- that the reserve releases may, in fact, be a leading indicator of an eventual improvement in the underlying loss ratio. So I wonder if you could respond to those 2 issues."

Let me just sort of suggest to you, as far as I'm concerned, we think in terms of accident year, most of the time. Calendar year is just sort of an adjustment for the quality defects in reserving in a previous way -- in a previous period. So accident year for me is almost exclusively the way we like to look at the business. Clearly, we all understand that those adjustments are made from an accounting perspective, but accident year is probably a better way to look at the economics versus the accounting. I thought I tried to get at this with Ian's question, maybe I wasn't clear. Degradation in the loss ratio under certain circumstances might be a really bad situation. If on the other hand, the loss ratio was lower than your previously designed target, then it might be perfectly acceptable to move towards your target. Clearly, not acceptable to go beyond your target. If and when market conditions are such that you're willing to give up 1 point of loss ratio and get what you considered to be proportionate volume or the elasticity of the market is willing to give it to you, then those are trade-offs that not only do we make, it's sort of the heart and soul of what we say is the guiding principles of Progressive. And that is, we attempt to make a 4% underwriting profit. If and when we do, we try to grow as fast as possible. And it's very much that sequence and we are quite comfortable right now seeing that the market will give us some growth, and we want to be priced as close to our target as we can. So hopefully, that clarifies it. But I think accident year is by far more of the economics of the company, the calendar year is the accounting."

We are pricing to the lifetime combined ratio by segment, but we are also managing the company to that 96% or better calendar year constantly.

We give you in the Q the average premium, the rate of increase of average premium. You can see that's recently healthy, which is also going to affect the loss ratio as long as that average premium is going up faster than the rate of increase in the pure premium. So just factor all those things in, there are a lot of moving parts. This is more a informational comment. One of the things that we do is we track all rate revisions done on a monthly basis. That's usually for us that we track about 200 to 400 rate revisions. So think 50 states, many carriers. We're seeing, on average, and as I cluster the last data points, it's quite a variable function. If I cluster the last data points, I'm seeing a market rate of increase at about 2.6% give or take. And there's a give or take to that. And we gave you an average premium increase of 4% in our personal lines business. So we're at least sort of keeping up with that or perhaps our pricing got ahead of that and others are now perhaps catching up. We also have some mechanisms in our rates in many states where we're actually continuously taking just a little bit. It doesn't account for a great deal, but it means that each time, we can soften the discrete event of having to adjust for rates. So don't be surprised that you'll see over time a little bit of closure, even in the situation that you're recognizing other than our pricing targets, which is the biggest one, but you will see premiums change at a slightly different rate than pure premiums and in some part, that's by design."

I suspect you're more than referencing a few data points that have come out with regard to frequency. And let me just sort of start by saying, no matter what frequencies are reported, they're all samples from an overall population. And even if",713,"Sure, Amit. I suspect you're more than referencing a few data points that have come out with regard to frequency. And let me just sort of start by saying, no matter what frequencies are reported, they're all samples from an overall population. And even if we do frequency by channel, we're going to have slightly different numbers. I think what you're more likely focused on is what would be a fairly dramatic difference that suggests with Allstate having reported recently and Progressive. I'm not going to even attempt to try to explain those differences, but let me give you a fair amount of color as to where I see things going. We spend a reasonable amount of time looking at our frequency and severity, but I'll focus just on frequency for now because I think that's the guts of your question.
Relative to PCI data, and while we don't lay on top of PCI directly, and right now are little more favorable, i.e., our frequency is a little lower, we're a lot more comparable to the PCI data than we were, for example, Allstate. That can happen. I mean, you sample any population, you're going to have different outcomes. So it's not a question of what's right and wrong, but starting to explain mix differences. And mix differences can occur through urban concentrations, rural concentrations, different states. So recognize all of these data points really need to be broken down. You referenced miles driven. One of the advantages that Progressive has suggested to investors before is that we have an early look system at miles driven. Again, it's a sample of a very large population, but with our Snapshot population being sizable, we're very comfortable that we're actually getting sort of on a daily, weekly, whatever we choose to examine basis any real detection of miles driven changes.
I'm not going to sort of become a free data source and give you the specifics, but I will tell you, in July, there was an uptick in miles driven. We had seen an uptick all year, but it has been reasonably constant. And then in July, on July-over-July basis, a more significant uptick. Again, what's more important there is what kind of miles are being driven, and we're analyzing that from a point of view. So I'll just give you one break that we use, and that is miles -- or trips, single continuous trips over 15 miles. We're actually seeing that become a higher percentage of miles driven. So again, frequency will track with the type of miles, and we're seeing longer trips. There's a different frequency for longer trips than there are for shorter trips. We simply are observing our frequencies. We report them as they are. Obviously, very favorable right now. I don't know that you should assume that Progressive is anything other than a large player. So our frequencies may be reflective of the environment. They may change. Whenever we see another data point that's inconsistent with our own, clearly, it puts our attention to make sure that we're not perhaps overlooking a future trend to that data point. Clearly, what we measure is what we measure. The real issue is which direction is it going. So we are seeing miles driven up. We are seeing a certain type of miles driven up. We believe that, that could result in higher frequencies. But so far, we're not betting on a dramatic change in the frequencies and we're very comfortable with what we have. All of that should be translated into pricing. It's really not a matter of what the frequency is, it's whether or not you price for that frequency and price for that severity. And right now, we are very comfortable that we have actually previously seen opportunities to take our rates up, believing that frequencies would rise. And we're in a very comfortable position as we see it right now. We have mechanisms inside of our rates whereby we keep those rates moving up a small amount. And hopefully, we will match frequency and severity for a period of time. When we simply get out of match, that's when we take more dramatic or quantum rate changes, 1%, 2%, whatever is necessary. Did that get at your question?"

Cumulatively, we're well over 13 billion or probably approaching 15 billion miles driven. And 1 million trips a day is a big number relative to sort of sample statistics. So we're very comfortable that we've got that inside look. And while it may not have been the primary driving force behind Snapshot, clearly, it wasn't, it's an awfully good side effect."

I certainly can give you lots of pieces why they will never be the same. In fact, in 30 years of being in the business, I often have trouble reconciling between channels and other carriers. But this is a pretty big difference, and I've not seen that on very many occasions. Though I don't have a good explanation, if I had to speculate, I would say mix is probably a good chunk of that. I mentioned sort of the urban and rural kind of environment. I don't have the ability -- don't think anyone does -- to be able to dissect the mix of the business to see if it could be an explanatory variable. That one's a tough one. I think the key thing for us, and maybe this is just part of my nature is, I get more paranoid when things are going well. So you can be sure that if someone else is seeing something, we'll be looking, but it's not something that we're worried about missing. I mean, we know how many claims are coming in on a daily basis. We know how to count those claims. And if we see any sort of upticks, you can be sure we'll be adjusting for it. But we're not seeing any."

Because Platinum, think about our relationship with ASI in its current form of being 1 quarter in and we've gotten within that first 90 days, we're out in the marketplace with a product that basically is just us, not one or the other or 2 together. It's us together, which I find to be the most exciting thing that we have done in a long time. And I said in there, it will be a limited distribution. I'll come back and comment on that. You talked about costs and startup. There will definitely be some startup costs, but most of those will be just a reallocation of cost that we have in the marketplace. So we're not necessarily hiring new people or so on and so forth. There'll be some incremental cost, but probably not ones that will flow through to any degree that you would see them. On the other hand, the commission costs, we absolutely are prepared to pay more commission, and we'll do so for these Platinum agents if they provide us with the exact intent, the bundled product that we're looking for. So that should reflect -- it will be a little hard to see. I'll be more than willing to take those sort of questions after another quarter, 6 months, but you may have trouble seeing that flow through in the expense ratio because it will be relatively small. Why are we doing limited distribution? Frankly, we really want to get out of class. And I tried to note this a little bit in my letter, a class of customer that, for the most part, and I'll separate here just -- not very often, but I will for now, Progressive and ASI. The more preferred customer that while we've always wanted them, we've always had a product, had not been the sweet spot for us in the agency channel. And this gives us an opportunity to literally get a data set of those customers and understand if there is truly a different pure premium that they represent versus perhaps a more mass distributed product. And obviously, we're making a very -- we think an intelligent and informed, but to be fair, imperfect at this point in time determination that, that pure premium will be lower and support a higher commission. And as we get more of that data, which we're excited to start having come in, we will be able to, A, confirm that or as I hope is possible, recognize that there's possibly even more there as we address this pure premium segment that we really haven't seen before of both bundled and a class of customers that a group of agents have access to that we previously have not captured. So a little bit up on commission costs, but that will probably be very small in the aggregate. But to help you with that, I'm more than willing to give you some data on that as we have future calls like this. Our internal expenses, while we're allocating sales resources and rollout expenses, I wouldn't worry about that too much."

And if you think about the percentage of new business that we get when people switch were obviously one of those considerations. So calibrating that good news is we report monthly. You'll get to see. And over time, we will certainly internally look at the percentage of new business that are coming with proof of prior from Allstate so on and so forth, but we do that in the natural course of business anyway. We have seen starting at about May -- John, correct me if I'm wrong there -- that the paid search from Allstate and even Esurance to a degree have actually gone down very significantly. We track those sort of things. So their comment of pulling back on advertising, certainly, we have seen that in the paid search area, which is the easiest one for us to get a clean handle on, which is great from our perspective. Obviously, we're not doing that. In fact, our ad spend has been strengthened just a little bit. So this is a time where as long as we're very comfortable with our rate level -- and we've talked about some of the macro trends of miles driven frequency -- these are all the things that we spend -- that's basically what we do. We spend our time trying to make sure we've got those in balance. As long as we think we've got them in balance, this is actually a good time for us. But I would also tell you, building on my prior comment of being paranoid, when you grow fast, the book changes. And while we're big and no matter how much new business, it doesn't change dramatically, we've got to be very conscious of new business effects. So to the extent that new business comes in with prior insurance, that is actually better for us than those that have no prior insurance. Is it an opportunity? Absolutely. But we've got to make sure that we do our job and not worry too much about what others are doing. And right now, we're positioned in a really nice way. So I feel great about the marketplace. I feel great about our pricing. And we'll take our wins there."

So to me, I don't think about a deterioration in loss ratio is necessarily a positive or a negative. I'm much more focused on the target that we're trying to achieve under the different market conditions. So if we get out ahead, and we've done that, we actually end up with wider margins. This is a time I don't think we're out ahead. I think we can bring in a good volume of new business at -- and our renewals with it at our objective target.

This doesn't mean that we'll dial everything down quickly to the new experience, but Gary is certainly watching that closely and we'll adjust as appropriate.

So we're just -- I'll just hit some top line issues, won't go into all the details. But if I'm an agent producing, I will absolutely get an immediate recognition of more commission. Certainly, from the Progressive side, it will be additive to what I would have otherwise got. Then there is a level at which you can attain different compensation overrides later based on certain levels of production. And while I know that, I couldn't explain them all to you right this second. We're very comfortable that, that level of commission puts us in a competitive situation, not necessarily overly competitive, but agents certainly will not be able to say, ""Gee, I'd love to use you, but your commission isn't quite what I might get from another carrier."" It's in that ballpark. And those that actually use us very well can even expect more than that. We've made what I would call not a concession, just a marketing approach. It will be a very small percentage of our policies in-force, but we'll also try to coordinate policy periods so that those who are truly committed to that destination type of situation that we've been talking to you about can have an annual policy and an auto -- and a home policy with concurrent or simultaneous renewal dates. And those sorts of things are changes. We know the pluses and minuses of doing those sorts of things, but they've been very well received by agents so far. I can't give you a great deal of insight as to Platinum's receptivity. We've been in the market in Texas about 40 days as of the end of the quarter. Indiana, I think, snuck in just in the quarter, if I remember correctly. I don't know if we wrote a policy in the quarter, but we're in there. And we'll continue to roll that out. I will tell you that the initial receptivity from sales folks -- and our sales folks tend to have a way of being more excited than sometimes I am -- is very, very positive. So I'd be disappointed if that wasn't the case. But I can't give you a really good feel right now about sort of incremental volume over the offerings that the agent already had. We are certainly of the belief that it's incremental. We just don't have a good sizing on that, that we'd feel comfortable giving to you at this point time."

Our commercial business in general -- and we gave you this in the Q -- is average premiums are actually up period across the board. Is that on all segments? Yes. But is it more dramatic in some segments? Also yes. So the mix shift towards for hire business, transportation and specialty lines with the higher average premiums, absolutely, that's part of it. Your question, the second part of the question was, so should we expect erosion on the combined ratio because of that? The answer is not by design in any way, shape or form. We try to price all pieces of our business. We call them CMT. It doesn't really matter, just market tiers, commercial market tiers. So we're looking for the same kind of margin in each segment. While we've been able to get rate and have a good loss results is in large part reflective of the market really hardened in those segments and there are less availability of carriers. So we're benefiting from that. We're happy to do that. We don't think that will last forever. But -- and you also use 96%. In some cases, we don't price every segment to a 96%. Our clear explanation in the annual report is all -- the amalgam of all of our products comes to 96%. So in places where we believe there are higher risks -- and there are higher risks in commercial simply because you have lower unit numbers and lower losses to deal with. So our -- what we will call indications, always have a little bit more volatility to them. So we include volatility in part of our targets. So a lot in there, but no, you shouldn't assume that because we have a slight mix change to the for hire segments, which is driving average premium, that necessarily that should drive loss costs.

The -- probably the biggest things we've done, we gave you an update at the IR meeting. We've brought it into the marketplace. The terminology internally we use is 3.0. Don't worry too much about that. And we put it in concert with the most recent overall personal lines product design. And that's out now 5, 6 states, something like that. In the 4 states that I have received data on and looked at, here are a couple of the points that are notable. The increase in usage of Snapshot by the agents has gone up fairly significantly, but still at a low level. So that's important. Absolutely, we achieved something that we were setting out to achieve. Did we get to a level that we would say approximates the direct? No. So think of that as more in the 10% range in terms of usage by agents, whereas with regard to direct, think about it a little bit more in the 30% to 40% range. We're not going to give absolute estimates on that, but I'll give you those ranges, and you can assume that they're very accurate. One of the things that is important to us in Snapshot is that if you take the customers that are -- and specifically are now indirect that are using a multiproduct quoting mechanism, actually, the numbers are considerably higher. So those who intend to buy multiproduct from us are quoting and buying at rates closer to 45%, 50% using Snapshot. So we're actually very excited about that. So a term that we may have used in the discussions in May is sort of the future Robinsons. Obviously, we use Robinsons. But the future Robinsons, those Dianes that are transitioning, that group is showing a high propensity to consider Snapshot. So when I say Dianes, it could be with a renter's product or it could be those that have become just early Robinsons. So it's filling a niche that's very useful to us. And when you start getting into those numbers, while we can continue to say, there are parts of the population that are just still saying, ""No, I don't want that level of intrusion in my vehicle,"" whatever their reasons are for that. So we're not expecting 100% by any stretch of the imagination, but it's a pretty good part of the marketplace that we actually want and expect to be a big part of our destination era. There are those that are buying more traditionally nonstandard, which we clearly, clearly, clearly continue to want to offer. They are not always interested in having quite that level of active involvement in their insurance and may or may not keep it very long. But those that we want to sort of be with us at the best rate are actually showing very high take rates. So comfortable with that. I gave you some information on the mileage driven. In terms of our discounts, we're comfortable that at renewal, we're seeing something around -- 60-plus percent of people actually getting their renewal quote, which gives them at least the discount we advanced to them at point-of-sale. Now there's still another percentage that are actually getting a discount, but maybe not quite as much as we advanced at the point-of-sale. So that general 70-30 we're showing you in the past, is suggesting that there are still sort of 70%-ish, possibly a little more, a little less depending on the state, that are benefiting from the Snapshot. So the greater good theory here is clearly working in our favor. There are a percent of those that are not exposed to a significant increase. And then frankly, there are those that use a disproportionate amount of the loss costs and we are applying a surcharge with this new model. And we recognize that, that will be, for those individuals, either a nonrenewal or a reluctant renewal, whatever that might be. However, as long as the numbers are as favorable as we see them, we're comfortable that we've got a good design out in the marketplace that can sustain and match loss costs better with the individual."

For what it's worth, our research has shown that over the last few years, you've done a pretty good job of your pricing and loss trends tracking each other, within a couple of points, of course. Who knows if that's correct. But knowing what you know about your pricing and monitoring systems, if you went for a period where your pricing was more or less tracking your loss trends, would that have an ancillary effect of maintaining your portfolio homogeneity? In other words, your risks would be more or less as you expected. Or are those quite independent? In other words, could your account pricing track loss trend well, but you could still have pretty large shifts in homogeneity? And that's all I have."

In response to questions from Ian, you all spoke about the importance of looking at the overall calendar year combined ratio. In response to questions from Meyer, I believe you said that your focus is on the accident year, more so than the calendar year. And so number one, I want to make sure I understood that right. Maybe there were 2 separate issues being discussed. And then the secondarily and part of that was, it does appear as Ian was saying that the reserve releases remain strong, but the underlying loss ratio continues to be higher. I don't know if that should be cause for concern or if that should be cause for future optimism that the -- that those 2 -- that the reserve releases may, in fact, be a leading indicator of an eventual improvement in the underlying loss ratio.

Let me just sort of suggest to you, as far as I'm concerned, we think in terms of accident year, most of the time. Calendar year is just sort of an adjustment for the quality defects in reserving in a previous way -- in a previous period. So accident year for me is almost exclusively the way we like to look at the business. Clearly, we all understand that those adjustments are made from an accounting perspective, but accident year is probably a better way to look at the economics versus the accounting. I thought I tried to get at this with Ian's question, maybe I wasn't clear. Degradation in the loss ratio under certain circumstances might be a really bad situation. If on the other hand, the loss ratio was lower than your previously designed target, then it might be perfectly acceptable to move towards your target. Clearly, not acceptable to go beyond your target. If and when market conditions are such that you're willing to give up 1 point of loss ratio and get what you considered to be proportionate volume or the elasticity of the market is willing to give it to you, then those are trade-offs that not only do we make, it's sort of the heart and soul of what we say is the guiding principles of Progressive. And that is, we attempt to make a 4% underwriting profit. If and when we do, we try to grow as fast as possible. And it's very much that sequence and we are quite comfortable right now seeing that the market will give us some growth, and we want to be priced as close to our target as we can. So hopefully, that clarifies it. But I think accident year is by far more of the economics of the company, the calendar year is the accounting."

We give you in the Q the average premium, the rate of increase of average premium. You can see that's reasonably healthy, which is also going to affect the loss ratio as long as that average premium is going up faster than the rate of increase in the pure premium. So just factor all those things in, there are a lot of moving parts. This is more a informational comment. One of the things that we do is we track all rate revisions done on a monthly basis. That's usually for us that we track about 200 to 400 rate revisions. So think 50 states, many carriers. We're seeing, on average, and as I cluster the last data points, it's quite a variable function. If I cluster the last data points, I'm seeing a market rate of increase at about 2.6% give or take. And there's a give or take to that. And we gave you an average premium increase of 4% in our personal lines business. So we're at least sort of keeping up with that or perhaps our pricing got ahead of that and others are now perhaps catching up. We also have some mechanisms in our rates in many states where we're actually continuously taking just a little bit. It doesn't account for a great deal, but it means that each time, we can soften the discrete event of having to adjust for rates. So don't be surprised that you'll see over time a little bit of closure, even in the situation that you're recognizing other than our pricing targets, which is the biggest one, but you will see premiums change at a slightly different rate than pure premiums and in some part, that's by design."

I don't understand why there'll be a topic. So let's try to give us much color as possible, tell me if I'm being responsive to your questions. If I look at frequency, the one thing I would tell you, at least I would encourage you, look at time",913,"Yes, sure. I don't understand why there'll be a topic. So let's try to give us much color as possible, tell me if I'm being responsive to your questions. If I look at frequency, the one thing I would tell you, at least I would encourage you, look at time sequence of frequency because individual data points can be sort of interesting, but all over the map. So if we look at through the second quarter, we were right in line with the industry. And so nothing particularly notable there on frequency. And we did have, and I'm sure it's been a story, obviously a couple of companies, big companies, very credible companies reported frequency that was considerably higher than the industry. This quarter, we're reporting frequency up and not dramatically so. So I will break that down a little bit and try to give you how with -- or our thinking around that is. So BMI PD are sort of in the 4 range. And frankly, from my perspective, if you remember, this time a year ago, we're a negative. So recognize, this is change over a prior data points important as well. But 3 to 5, I would tell you, my expectations of any reasonable period of time, maybe be not a single data point or quarter, 3 to 5 on bodily injury tells me so that we're in reasonable norm range. So we're not seeing anything on frequency that is shocking or different down or inconsistent with our expectations for the future. And I say expectations for the future because that's what it all comes down to is how you price for June of next year, not necessarily tomorrow. So the one place on frequency that I would say is a bit more of a callout is the clue. Collision is up around 6%. And while it hasn't necessarily been a data point consistent with prior data points, it's not a inconsistent with what we would see is the macro economic forces. We reported and others have reported, I think we can do it in a little bit more quick manner that mileage on a month over month over month basis is up about 4%. So miles driven definitely are up, we measure that through our Snapshot. I have the most recent month, and that seems to be consistent with the annual trend. We have 1 or 2 spikes, Labor Day weekend, those sorts of things. But for the most part, think of mileage being up 4% year-over-year. That's clearly consistent with the trend on gasoline consumption, but again, we've had too many factors to go into there with gas efficiencies and so on and so forth. So we know that, that's a driver. I would say, as you think about the effective frequency you also factor in of course, severity. And we are in a very nice position with severity management, specifically on our bodily injury claims. So ICC has severity there, almost offsetting the frequency. That's a string I don't expect to last forever. We're always trying to improve our claims processes. And you know that they're certainly ones we're very, very proud of, but we found ways that we think we can even improve that. That's been an ongoing initiative inside of claims. So we have a nice offset for now. But frequency will be the to watch. But we are not shocked that it's in that sort of longer-term, normal range or I call it normal range 3 to 5. Collision has both a frequency uptick and a severity up tick. That would be something that while it doesn't cause us headaches from a reserving perspective as much as a bodily injury or UMPD might, that's certainly something that, as you would detect hopefully from my letter, don't get behind on pricing. Make sure that we don't assume that today's prices last forever. And the key for us, and hopefully I tried to give a little color on this, you can take all of these factors, little bit of a change in frequency, definitely some moving parts and severity, try to see what the real norms are, try to project the future and make sure that we take that pricing in increment that doesn't disturb our momentum and doesn't shock our customers and certainly doesn't get us behind the eightball. That's clearly a very complex set of destinations, but that's the real issue for now. And I don't see any signs of either frequency or severity that are unmanageable in the light of being able to also be able to be very nimble and quick and adjusting our pricing. And I'll come back to a statement that we made, because all of this can be summarized with a rather pity phrase we made at our IR meeting that said 3 1s are better than 1 3. And what we meant there was that recognizing all of these changes happen next month's single order points will be different. It's really just matching that trend over time. And the single biggest macro driver, frequency, I would agree with most of the other comments in the industry, mileages there. I noted last time, you also need to be very conscious of mileage and how it's being used. So trips over 15 miles, that is the place we're actually seeing mileage increasing versus the commuting to work more often. That clearly doesn't happen. Does that hit most of your requests?"

For our close observer, you will notice that direct, which is growing very, very well, we'll have at least on an accident year basis, a little bit of pressure on it relative to that 96. It's a complicated message to say we'll never sacrifice the 96. But can I expect that with a higher and very satisfactory inflow of new business, indirect, that I will be more comfortable operating an accident year aggregate for that part of the business, higher than a 96? You bet you. Because we know how that business runs up. We have high confidence. We're not betting on the future. That's a simple bet. And if we can take on the new business where we think that's appropriate, we're going to do that. So don't expect us to be moving in directions of cutting back or our advertising. We think we got been momentum. We're going to keep that momentum. We're just going to keep a little bit of rate coming along so that our rates stay and keep us on the crest of that way. And frankly, these are market conditions that are extraordinary for us. And it's up to us to make sure that we ride them out as best we possibly can."

Clearly, there's no perfect number, but we do a lot of work on elasticity of the consumer relative to the size of rate change that they can absorb. And also, you have to sort of factor in the competitive environment. So right now we're seeing a lot of rate actions, greater rate actions than we ever needed to take this year, in all channels, but certainly the agency channel. And as a result, we're competitive in that channel and it's shown by our new apps. Can we sustain a gradual rate increase to match our future expectations of trends?

And those are ways to keep all changes relatively low, so we don't shock the consumer. We don't want to do that. But at the same time, keep up with trends. So to answer your question is, how we almost certainly will have to take some rate in all channels over a reasonable period of time. This is not an industry where rates yet are systemically going down. So we'll do that.

The property side is still, while new to us for sure, it's still very small. And we continued to power the approach that ASI had when we took a majority interest in the company, which is to only have a maximum of 10% of surplus at risk in any given store. So you can see from statutory filings, they used reinsurance extensively and protect capital pretty, pretty well. And again, relative to the total Progressive capital, it's pretty small. So there may be some diversification benefit there. We obviously consider the premium-to-surplus ratios. Their growth rate Latorre required by the line of coverage, maybe required is a strong word, but generally looked to. Obviously, the rating agencies as well. So dear's greater capital requirements in property, where we were very comfortable at auto at a 3:1 property. You can think you probably have that, and we consider that into our capital models. And ensure that we continue to have plenty of contingency capital. And to the other question around dividends and capital deployment, we are very much comfortable we call it our balanced range. So we're doing modestly different things in terms of capital management given ASI. But again, it's a pretty small piece of our business now, pretty conservatively managed with reinsurance.

But I think it's coming, and I would just say, give me another quarter to confirm that. And I'll confirm it or guide you exactly what's going on. I had thought that we would probably would be able to do a more positive statement about agency retention in the third quarter. When you can't do it, don't do it. With regard to Platinum, recognize Platinum for now is going to be a very small part of the business. So that's going to be hard to see blend into the entire retention trend. That's probably something we'll start to call out for you more deliberately because you just simply won't be able to pull that out of the macro numbers. And that's fine, we'll be happy to sort of give you at least color as to our expectations on Platinum. But we can start with a very clear subject that I have given. Part of the reason why ASI and Progressive are working the way they're working together is that we had no doubt from our first work in PHA that when customers bundle, they have highly retentive behavior. And there is nothing that has adjusted to us that, that is not going to play out in the scenarios that we have in place on the direct side and now on the Platinum side. So Platinum's pretty exciting for us and for the agency. So we look at it as a source of growth for the agency. We look at it as a source of new customer mix. And we certainly look at it as a source of customer mix that will show different retention, behaviors, longer than we have typically experienced. So all positives on that one."

So that's new business mix. That takes a while to move into the book to affect overall retention levels. But while we're seeing our current book getting a little more stable and improving in terms of retention, we're getting new business in that we think will retain longer as well.

So the same states will have each of those. And I reported previously both disappointment with uptake in Snapchat by the agency channel and the new product model offering a discount Upfront have actually moved the needle on that. We'd be far away from suggesting it's guiding to the direct levels, it hasn't. But it has gone in the range of double what it was. So a new Snapshot model also leads to what we expect will be longer retention, simply because those who get the right rates are likely to stay in the marketplace and they won't be able to necessarily shop for a better rate than that. Having said all of that, we've also told you that there will be the opportunity for a smaller percentage of the book to get rate increases to some of those people will be more inclined to leave. We'll try over the next year to give a very clear picture of the moving parts that involve in retention, but we would -- sitting here today, we would be disappointed if we didn't see the agency retention start to track on a nice upward path.

Obviously, Snapshot work is trying to find people live we believe us a group will be lower for currency and bring them into the book, welcome them in at a rate level that is good. And for those that have what we considered to be high frequency likely behaviors, they may not join us as rapidly. So there is some adverse election. We hope it's actually not adverse to us. We will -- it's almost impossible to answer your question specifically. We have to do our indications based on forward-looking estimates of frequency, severity. We've combined them we call a pure premium. And that's going on, on a daily basis, and I mean daily. We will make estimates, and we have estimates. They are probably a little bit tamer than the single data point at the last quarter. And if that data point continues to start to suggest it's a little bit more of a time sequence, we will adjust very quickly for that. The point that I've been trying -- hopefully I have been making is we will take what we see now in small increments. So even if we get higher frequency or higher severity in the future, we can -- we're already on path to have prized that in. We just don't want to get behind the curve on doing that. And if we saw something, it's not a single rate revision. We don't take rates across the country on a single day. We're taking rates all the time. It's a very dynamic structure. We spent a lot of time and money making sure our systems can allow us to take rate changes relatively quickly. And that's the key. If you've got some uncertainty, take a half a point, take a point. We're not ever trying to do that in a sense that the consumer is having to bear the brunt, but it's absolutely in the best long-term interest of the consumer that we can take a point now, maybe a point in 6 months, maybe a point somewhere else. That is a stylized representation of what actually happens at individual states and in individual factors and individual geographies within the state. So it's much more complex than when we talk about it in generalities. But to your more specific question, if we -- even if though really think the long-term frequency trend will be negative. If we see on wrought, certain conditions, mileage so on and so forth that start to push it up a little bit, we will be very active in changing our longer-term estimates. And when mean need longer-term here, I don't mean that the very long term. I mean the life of the price point that will exist in the marketplace. Another advantage that we have is we try to leave those price points in the marketplace as limited a time as possible. So it might be that we change them 3 or 4 times a in a year. And the higher number of times we change them, we're more able to adapt to the estimates that we see as we look to price for that future period. So keeping the trend period as short as possible often works to our advantage."

This has not been in the marketplace a good great deal of time. So we are seeing the uptake at the agency point of distribution to be considerably improved. And I have little doubt that there are some customers that take a discount and maybe aren't exactly the right people. And we'll determine that in the first 6 months and their renewal rate will go up. That absolutely is a scenario that can and will happen. It is, however, the smaller part of the population. And agents, I think, are now starting to seei the benefit of Snapshot for the larger group of customers that they have. We're seeing, and these early numbers, we're seeing midterm retention i.e., in the first period actually increased and not much yet notable, which wouldn't be surprising because we haven't been for the marketplace with this product for that long for an update of what I'll call that first point of truth of the 7 month over the 6 month, that point of retention, which is clearly very important, and that's what people are getting loaded either the rate that they guide as an initial discount, maybe even better, maybe slightly worse than the initial discount, but it will be the rate that they can expect going forward. And there will be a number, 30% or less, that will actually get that discount taken away. And those are obviously people who are going to react differently armored renewal. But for the most part, this is attracting more new customers of the right time. And that's certainly is an indication we can give earlier than getting retention estimates. We're seeing the kind of right credit mix, the right age and vehicle mix. So that mix of customers that are opting for Snapshot is actually meeting expectations in that regard, maybe even better. And just for 1 slight correction to your question. This product exists both in the agency and the direct channel, so it's available to both. So we really do have a lot of experience at much higher levels of acceptance on the direct channel. About 1/3 of our sales are being made with Snapshot, so we have a really lot of data. And while there will almost surely as there is in every part of our business, be some aberrant behavior, some fraud, whatever it might be, the greater good here is out par outweighing any concerns that we have about individuals."

And as we see individual data points that trick change that trend, is it instantaneously or long term, we will adjust that future trends. But the future trend is not going to be nearly as volatile as a single data point or a single quarter. As I said, if we go back a year from now, we were reporting negative frequency, and so we're reporting a positive frequency over a negative frequency last year. The longer term trend might be quite different. If you sort of 2 or 3 and don't do my math on that one. I'm just give you an example. So we do feel comfortable about our rates. Because we're never stable. It's not like rate levels was, a, at the beginning of the year hasn't changed. If you take a look at the market in general from a premium waded perspective and there's going to be a standard deviation that is higher than normal or what I would consider normal. But when we look at rate that has changed for most competitors somewhere between 2 to 3.5, maybe get a little closer, cluster in 3, 2.5, 3.5 in more recent times, we would be at the lower end but in that range. So we're continuing to take our rates up. And that's the point I'm making with comp. Our rate trend has approximated our pure premium trend. My comments that says I'm always, always concerned and we as an organization always concerned, if that future trends changes, then we need to just dial up our rate trend to meet it. But it's not a major right-hand turn. If we were at -- and I'll just make this number up, I'm just making it up. [indiscernible] a 2.4 on an annualized rate take and that was matching with trend, future trend, all coverages in. And we see that go to 2.6, so 2.8, then we'd dial up the rate trend and take it in small increments. So yes, there are data points that tell you and tell me watch out. It's probably not staying constant. No news there for us. Probably even though we believe long term, things will go down, now may not be the time. Why? We don't we don't know the macroeconomic influences of the mileage driven. And frankly, I tell you if you break it down, which we must do, bodily injury, human TD, human PI, human they're not doing it thing to me that sort of outside the norm of what I've seen for my career, and most others in Progressive. PIP, frankly, is a highly variable coverage, and we've had many discussions in this setting about PIP frequency and severity. And that 1 just you'll must just have to stay on it for the moment and be able to price for it as quickly as possible. But those PIP and collision, NPD are shorter payout coverages. So we can actually adjust our pricing for those quickly, and it doesn't have the same carryover that a severity change in BI might do our reserves. So long answer, but last quarter, I felt that we had our you sure pricing trends compatible with our expectations of future frequency and severity. We just reported to you that we have to have some positive trends, positive in the sense that they are very attractive trends on severity of management of our battle bodily injury. We have to put those together. We also were reporting that we've seen a slight uptick in frequency. The offset of one to the other is important. And we just need to make sure that we're getting that future pricing trend to match our expectation of the future costs. But frankly, this is not -- and I want to be clear here, to us, this is a pretty nice position to be in. I don't want the marketplace to be totally static. We think we've got an advantage when it's moving around because we are nimble and we can take rate changes and adjust up or down, much more likely to be up then down as we be to keep that matching going. And we can match to small recommences we can."

So we think that is a systemic change, meaning we see why bodily injury severity is down. We think it's as a result of actions we take in our claims department to be more accurate in our settlements. We have more initiatives in the works to ensure that we continue to be as accurate as possible in injury settlements. So while we can't project where that severity line is going to go with tremendous accuracy, obviously that's what we're charged with doing in our pricing group and our reserving group, we feel pretty good where our reserves sit today and again, can see the source of those changes. And in aggregate, accident year basis, we are below that 96. And think how that we'll manage it going forward."

Frequency is what it is. We're not living on a isolated island from our competitors. So while there will always be statistically different numbers reported, they will come from the same ecosystem of roads, drivers and vehicles. However, that's now true when we all have different mixes in different states and different types of drivers, rural, urban. It really does get quite tricky. And I try to put a small note in my letter that really suggests that we do a lot of work to try to do to make sure that we understand frequency at a level that we can at least reconcile with all the data point in the marketplace. But I would tell you that managing frequency better than anyone else is something I'm not sure that we're going to put a hand in the year and say we can take credit for that. It is what it is. If everybody measures it the same way, it should be a representative for example of the overall industry, especially for larger players. Having said that, that point I'd make, and I would just use -- don't play up and use, that Geico mix in New York is very different from our mix in New York. So as frequency in New York is different in another state, that will show up, and you need to be very careful to draw conclusions about whether frequency is up or frequency in a specific place is up. I did mention before that Snapshot has a long-term benefit, we believe, of attracting a lower frequency drivers and in some sense, making sure attracting them simply because we offer them the great that we believe is best appropriate for their level of driving or their diligence and their driving behavior. That's what we've always said about Snapshot. It really is the first significant variable that is more causal than correlated. So most of the data that we deal with is correlated. Snapshot is causal. And to the extent that attracts lower frequency drivers because of the lower pricing, then the long-term effect of that will be very interesting. That is awfully hard even for us to make a meaningful estimate of how we're managing frequency for our book versus the competitors. But that's one example of managing frequency. I would tell you, most of our effort is around managing severity and making sure our claims are paid the correct way and very fair but the exact right way. We see through segregation and other influences that there are high variances in claims, competency throughout the industry or I wouldn't say competency as much as claims practices. And we trace to make sure that our claims practices are absolutely fair and absolutely have the best loss cost management so that we can pass that on to the consumer in long-term pricing. So that's -- I can't say much more about managing frequency than our Snapshot. Overall, it will sort of work the way it works, except for mix differences."

So let's try to give us much color as possible. Tell me if I'm being responsive to your questions. If I look at frequency, the one thing I would tell you, at least I would encourage you, look at the time sequence of frequency because individual data points can be sort of interesting, but all over the map. So if we look at sort of through the second quarter, we were right in line with the industry. And so nothing particularly notable there on frequency. And we did have, and I'm sure it's been a story, obviously, a couple of companies, big companies, very credible companies reported frequency that was considerably higher than the industry. This quarter, we're reporting frequency up and not dramatically so. So I don't break that down a little bit and try to give you a sense of how with -- or our thinking around that is. So BI and PD are sort of in the 4 range. And frankly, from my perspective, if you remember, this time a year ago, we're negative. So recognize percentage change over a prior data point is important as well. But 3 to 5, I would tell you, my expectations of any reasonable period of time, maybe not a single data point or a quarter, 3 to 5 on bodily injury tells me, so that we're in reasonable normal range. So we're not seeing anything on frequency that is shocking or different than or inconsistent with our expectations for the future. And I say expectations for the future because that's what it all comes down to is how are you priced for June of next year, not necessarily tomorrow. So the one place on frequency that I would say is a bit more of a call-out is the collision. Collision is up around 6%. And while it hasn't necessarily been a data point consistent with prior data points, it's not inconsistent with what we would see as the macro economic forces. Wave [ph] reported and others have reported. I think we can do it in a little bit more quick manner that mileage on a ""month over month over month"" basis is up about 4%. So miles driven definitely are up. We measure that through our Snapshot. I have the most recent month, and that seems to be consistent with the annual trend. We have 1 or 2 spikes, Labor Day weekend, those sorts of things. But for the most part, I think of mileage being up 4% year-over-year. That's really consistent with the trend on gasoline consumption, but again, we've got too many factors to go into there with gas efficiencies and so on and so forth. So we know that, that's a driver. I would say, as you think about the effective frequency, you also factor in, of course, severity. And we are in a very nice position with our severity management, specifically on our bodily injury claims. So you actually see our severity there almost offsetting the frequency. That's a string I don't expect to last forever. We're always trying to improve our claims processes. And you know that they're certainly ones we're very, very proud of, but we've found ways that we think we can even improve that. That's been an ongoing initiative inside of claims. So we have a nice offset for now, but frequency will be the thing to watch. But we are not shocked that it's in that sort of longer-term, normal range, or I call it normal range, 3 to 5. Collision has both a frequency uptick and a severity uptick. That would be something that while it doesn't cause us headaches from a reserving perspective as much as a bodily injury or UMPD might, that's certainly something that, as you would detect hopefully from my letter, don't get behind on pricing. Make sure that we don't assume that today's prices last forever. And the key for us, and I -- hopefully, I tried to give a little color on this, if you can take all of these factors, a little bit of a change in frequency, definitely some moving parts in severity, try to see what the real norms are, try to project the future and make sure that we take that pricing in increments that doesn't disturb our momentum and doesn't shock our customers and certainly doesn't get us behind the eight ball. That's clearly a very complex set of estimations, but that's the real issue for now. And I don't see any signs of either frequency or severity that are unmanageable in the light of being able to also be able to be very nimble and quick and adjusting our pricing. And I'll come back to a statement that we made, because all of this can be summarized with a rather pithy phrase we made at our IR meeting that said 3 1s are better than 1 3. And what we meant there was recognizing all these changes happen, next month's single-quarter points will be different. It's really just matching that trend over time. And the single biggest macro driver, frequency, I would agree with most of the other comments in the industry, mileages there. I noted last time, you also need to be very conscious of mileage and how it's being used. So trips over 15 miles, that is the place we're actually seeing mileage increasing versus the commuting to work more often. That clearly doesn't happen. Does that hit most of your request?"

I'm not going to give you our indications, but I -- probably more than I've ever done before. We'd tell you instantaneously, our indications are not positive. So that's a good place to be. The real issue is taking a little bit of rate to stay on the crest of the breaking wave and not go over it. That is the challenge, and that's the challenge I outlined. I don't think, a, I am willing and nor do I think it is necessary for us to sacrifice our #1 commitment to shareholders, and that is to produce an aggregate 96 for our products. For a close observer, you will notice that Direct, which is growing very, very well, will have, at least on an accident year basis, a little bit of pressure on it relative to that 96. It's a complicated message to say we'll never sacrifice the 96. But can I expect that with a higher and very satisfactory inflow of new business in Direct, that I would be more comfortable operating an accident year aggregate for that part of the business, higher than a 96? You bet you. Because we know how that business runs up. We have high confidence. We're not betting on the future. That's a simple bet. And if we can take on the new business where we think that's appropriate, we're going to do that. So don't expect us to be moving in directions of cutting back our advertising. We think we've got the momentum. We're going to keep that momentum. We're just going to keep a little bit of rate coming along so that our rates stay and keep us on the crest of that wave.

This is -- comes back to the same statement I just said, 3 1s better than 1 3. It's a question of how you take rate. We have certainly been on these calls and told you that we've taken rate in larger quantities. That was absolutely the right thing to do. We needed to do it. But it has an equal and opposite offset on affecting consumers and putting consumers into the shopping marketplace. Clearly, there's no perfect number, but we do a lot of work on elasticity of the consumer relative to the size of rate change that they can absorb. And also, you have to sort of factor in the competitive environment. So right now, we're seeing a lot of rate action, greater rate action than we ever needed to take this year in all channels, but certainly, the Agency channel. And as a result, we're competitive in that channel and it's shown by our new apps. Can we sustain a gradual rate increase to match our future expectations of trend? Yes, I think we absolutely can and shouldn't be assumed that it's quite as dramatic as a binary kind of take rate, therefore, growth comes up. We're really trying to signal. And my comment, well designed or not, about the paranoia that I have is exactly that. It's how can you just keep creeping your rate in. And for some close observers of Progressive, we actually have some things built in structurally to our rate order in many states where we actually have ways of matching continuous inflation or trend. And those are ways to keep all changes relatively low, so we don't shock the consumer, and we don't want to do that, but at the same time, keep up with trends. So the answer to your question is, we almost certainly will have to take some rate in all channels over a reasonable period of time. This is not an industry where rates yet are systemically going down. So we'll do that. The real question and the only question I think is on the table for the continued momentum of Progressive, can we match that in small increments and stay right with inflation, and we have a perfect opportunity to be able to do that."

For sure is we're writing higher-limit business there but not materially higher than the Personal Auto. The property side is still, while new to us for sure, it's still very small. And we continue to follow the approach that ASI had when we took a majority interest in the company, which is to only have a maximum of 10% of surplus at risk in any given [indiscernible]. So you can see from the statutory filings, they used reinsurance extensively and protect capital pretty, pretty well. And again, relative to the total Progressive capital, it's pretty small. So there may be some diversification benefit there. We, obviously, consider the premium-to-surplus ratios. The regulators require by line of coverage, maybe require is a strong word, but generally look to. Obviously, the rating agencies as well. So there's greater capital requirements in property, where we're very comfortable with auto at a 3:1 property. You can think of probably half that, and we consider that into our capital models and ensure that we continue to have plenty of contingency capital. And to the other question around dividends and capital deployment, we are very much comfortable or call it our balanced range. So we're doing modestly different things in terms of capital management, given ASI. But again, it's a pretty small piece of our business now, pretty conservatively managed with reinsurance, so not a big deal at the total balance sheet level."

I had thought that we probably would be able to do a more positive statement about Agency retention in the third quarter. When you can't do it, don't do it. With regard to Platinum, recognize Platinum for now is going to be a very small part of the business. So that's going to be hard to see blend in to the entire retention trend.

We'll be happy to sort of give you, at least, color as to our expectation on Platinum. But we can start with a very clear assumption that I have given. Part of the reason why ASI and Progressive are working the way they're working together is that we had no doubt from our first work in PHA that when customers bundle, they have highly retentive behavior. And there is nothing that has suggested to us that, that is not going to play out in the scenarios that we have in place on the Direct side and now on the Platinum side. So Platinum's pretty exciting for us and for the Agency. So we look at it as a source of growth in the Agency. We look at it as a source of new customer mix, and we certainly look at it as a source of customer mix that will show different retention behaviors longer than we have typically experienced, so all positives on that one."

So that's new business mix. That takes a while to move into the book to affect overall retention levels. But while we're seeing our current book getting a little more stable and improving in terms of retention, we're getting new business in that we think will retain longer as well.

Those are the same states. There's just a slight delay. And then you've also heard us talk about the new model for Snapshot. That's really all part of 8.3 as well. So the same states will have each of those. And I reported previously both disappointment with uptake in Snapchat by the Agency channel and the new product model offering a discount upfront has actually moved the needle on that. I would be far away from suggesting it's gotten to the Direct levels. It Hasn't, but it has gone in the range of double what it was. So a new Snapshot model also leads to what we fully expect there's longer retention, simply because those who get the right rates are likely to stay in the marketplace and they won't be able to necessarily shop for a better rate than that. Having said all of that, we've also told you that there will be the opportunity for a smaller percentage of the book to get rate increases, though some of those people will be more inclined to leave. So we'll try over the next year to give you a very clear picture of the moving parts that involve in retention, but we would -- sitting here today, we would be disappointed if we didn't see the Agency retention start to track on a nice upward path.

Actually, your point on adverse selection is not a bad one either. Obviously, Snapshot work is trying to find people with what we believe, as a group, will be lower frequency and bring them into the book, welcome them in at a rate level that is good. And for those that have what we consider to be high frequency likely behaviors, they may not join us as rapidly. So there is some adverse selection. We hope it's actually not adverse to us. We will -- it's almost impossible to answer your question specifically. We have to do our indications based on forward-looking estimates of frequency and severity. We combine them. We call it pure premium. And that's going on, on a daily basis, and I mean daily. We will make estimates, and we have estimates. They are probably a little bit tamer than the single data point at the last quarter. And if that data point continues to start to suggest it's a little bit more of a time sequence, we will adjust very quickly for that. The point that I've been trying -- I, hopefully, have been making is we will take what we see now in small increments. So even if we get higher frequency or higher severity in the future, we can -- we're already on path to have placed that in. We just don't want to get behind the curve on doing that. And if we saw something -- it's not a single rate revision. We don't take rates across the country on a single day. We're taking rates all the time. It's a very dynamic structure. We've spent a lot of time and money making sure our systems can allow us to take rate changes relatively quickly, and that's the key. If you've got some uncertainty, take a half a point, take a point. We're not ever trying to do that in the sense that the consumer is having to bear the brunt, but it's absolutely in the best long-term interest of the consumer that we can take a point now, maybe a point in 6 months, maybe a point somewhere else. That is a stylized representation of what actually happens at individual states and in individual factors and individual geographies within the state. So it's much more complex than when we talk about it in generalities. But to your more specific question, if we -- even if though we think the long-term frequency trend will be negative, if we see on route, certain conditions, mileage so on and so forth, that start to push it up a little bit, we will be very active in changing our longer-term estimates. And when I mean longer-term here, I don't mean the very long term. I mean, the life of the price point that will exist in the marketplace. Another advantage that we have is we try to leave those price points in the marketplace as limited a time as possible. So it might be that we change them 3 or 4 times in a year. And the higher number of times we change them, we're more able to adapt to the estimates that we see as we look to price for that future period.

And then it sounds like you introduced an iteration of Snapshot in the Agency channel, where it's sort of a discount upfront. But it seems like just psychologically that, that's a different value proposition, is -- the consumer may not feel like they're a great driver. Maybe they'll get a discount during that first year. And then if they're not a good driver, they'll just not renew once you guys figure that out. Have you seen -- has any of that manifested? That may be way off base, so I don't really know. But maybe have you been doing this long enough to see in the Agency channel to see whether retention trends are different there than in the Direct channel?"

We don't have a ton of data. This has not been in the marketplace a great deal of time. So we are seeing the uptake at the Agency point of distribution to be considerably improved. And I have little doubt that there are some customers that take a discount and maybe aren't exactly the right people, and we'll determine that in the first 6 months and their renewal rate will go up. That absolutely is a scenario that can and will happen. It is, however, the smaller part of the population. And agents, I think, are now starting to see the benefit of Snapshot for the larger group of customers that they have. We're seeing, and these are early numbers, we're seeing midterm retention, i.e. in the first period actually increased and not much yet notable, which wouldn't be surprising because we haven't been in the marketplace with this product that long for an update for what I'll call that first point of truth of the 7 month over the 6 month, that point of retention, which is clearly very important. And that's where people are getting quoted either the rate that they got as an initial discount, maybe even better, maybe slightly worse than the initial discount, but it will be the rate that they can expect going forward. And there will be a number, 30% or less, that will actually get the discount taken away. And those are, obviously, people who are going to react differently on renewal. But for the most part, this is attracting more new customers of the right time, and that certainly is an indication we can give earlier than getting retention estimates. We're seeing the kind of right credit mix, the right age and vehicle mix. So the mix of customers that are opting for Snapshot is actually meeting expectations in that regard, maybe even better. And just for one slight correction to your question, this product exists both in the Agency and the Direct channel, so it's available to both. So we really do have a lot of experience at much higher levels of acceptance on the Direct channel. About 1/3 of our sales are being made with Snapshot, so we have a really lot of data. And while there will almost certainly, as there is in every part of our business, be some aberrant behavior, some fraud, whatever it might be, the greater good here is far outweighing any concerns that we have about the individuals."

The time series that we think is more reflective of future trends. So we take 2 things into consideration, historic trend and future trend. We're always making that estimate. And as we see individual data points that change that trend, instantaneously or long term, we will adjust that future trend. But the future trend is not going to be nearly as volatile as a single data point or a single quarter. As I said, if we go back a year from now, we were reporting negative frequency, and so we're reporting a positive frequency over a negative frequency last year. The longer-term trend might be quite different, if you sort do 2 or 3 and don't do my math on that one. I'm just giving you an example. So we do feel comfortable with our rates because we're never stable. It's not like rate level was, a, at the beginning of the year hasn't changed. If you take a look at the market in general from a premium weighted perspective and there's going to be a standard deviation that is higher than normal or what I would consider normal. But you're going to look at rate that has changed for most competitors somewhere between 2 to 3.5, maybe get a little closer, clustering [ph] 3 -- 2.5, 3.5 of more recent times. We would be at the lower end but in that range, so we're continuing to take our rates up. And that's the point I'm making with comp. Our rate trend has approximated our pure premium trend. My comment that says I'm always, always concerned and we as an organization are always concerned, if that future trends change, then we need to just dial up our rate trend to meet it. But it's not a major right-hand turn. If we were at -- and I'll just make this number up, I'm just making it up. [indiscernible] at 2.4 on an annualized rate take and that was matching with trend, future trend, all coverages in, and we see that go to 2.6 or a 2.8, then we'll dial up our rate trend and take it in small increments. So yes, there are data points that tell you and tell me watch out. It's probably not staying constant. No news there for us. Probably even though we believe long term, things will go down, now may not be the time. Why? We don't know the macroeconomic influences of mileage driven. And frankly, I'd tell you, if you break it down, which we must do, bodily injury, PD or human BI and PD, they're not doing anything to me that is sort of outside the norm of what I've seen through my career and most us in Progressive. PIP, frankly, is a highly variable coverage, and we've had many discussions in this setting about PIP frequency and severity. And that one just -- you almost just have to stay on it for the moment and be able to price for it as quickly as possible. But those PIP and collision and PD are shorter payout coverages. So we can actually adjust our pricing for those quickly, and it doesn't have the same carryover that a severity change in BI might to our reserves. So a long answer, but last quarter, I felt that we had our future pricing trends compatible with our expectations of future frequency and severity. We've just reported to you that we actually have some positive trend, positive in the sense of very attractive trends on severity of management of our bodily injury. We have to put those together. We're also -- we were reporting that we've seen a slight uptick in frequency. The offset of one to the other is important, and we just need to make sure that we're getting that future pricing trend to match our expectation of the future costs. But frankly, this is not a -- and I want to be clear here, to us, this is a pretty nice position to be in. I don't want the marketplace to be totally static. We think we've got an advantage when it's moving around because we are nimble and we can take rate changes and adjust up or down, much more likely to be up than down, as need be to keep that matching going. And we match in the small increments as we can."

If I take frequency and severity together, I kind of have 5% in trends. And so if I'm getting 4% in premium, does that mean that it's a simple math, there's a little bit more potential for margin compression. But obviously, things could bump around. So is that the right way to think about it?"

That bodily injury trend that we discussed in terms of severity is what is driving the change in reserves and the positive development. So we think that is a systemic change, meaning we see why bodily injury severity is down. We think it's as a result of actions we take in our claims department to be more accurate in our settlements. We have more initiatives in the works to ensure that we continue to be as accurate as possible in injury settlements. So while we can't project where that severity line is going to go with tremendous accuracy, obviously, that's what we're charged with doing and our pricing group and our reserving group.

Frequency is what it is. We're not living on a isolated island from our competitors. So while there will always be statistically different numbers reported, they all come from the same ecosystem of roads, drivers and vehicles. However, that's not true when we all have different mixes in different states and different types of drivers, rural, urban. It really does get quite tricky. I try to put a small note in my cover letter that really suggests that we do a lot of work to try to make sure that we understand frequency at a level that we can at least reconcile with all the data points in the marketplace. But I would tell you that managing frequency better than anyone else is something I'm not sure that we're going to put our hand in the air and say, ""We can take credit for that."" It is what it is. If everybody measures it the same way, it should be a representative, for example, of the overall industry, especially for larger players. Having said that, the point I'd make, and I will just use -- don't bring it up and use a competitor, but Geico's mix in New York is very different than our mix in New York. So as frequency in New York is different than in other state, that will show up, and you need to be very careful to draw conclusions about whether frequency is up or frequency in a specific place is up. I did mention before that Snapshot has a long-term benefit, we believe, of attracting lower-frequency drivers and, in some sense, making sure attracting them simply because we offer them the rate that we believe is best appropriate for their level of driving or their diligence and their driving behavior. That's what we've always said about Snapshot. It really is the first significant variable that is more causal than correlated. So most of the data that we deal with is correlated. Snapshot is causal. And to the extent that attracts lower-frequency drivers because of the lower pricing, then the long-term effect of that will be very interesting. That is awfully hard even for us to make a meaningful estimate of how we're managing frequency for our book versus the competitors. But that's one example of managing frequency. I would tell you, most of our effort is around managing severity and making sure our claims are paid the correct way and very fair but the exact right way. We see through segregation and other influences that there are high variances in claims, competency throughout the industry, or I won't say competency as much as claims practices. And we try to make sure our claims practices are absolutely fair and absolutely have the best loss cost management so that we can pass that on to the consumer in long-term pricing. So that's -- I can't say much more about managing frequency than our Snapshot. Overall, it will sort of work the way it works, except for mix differences."

So let's try to give as much color as possible. Tell me if I'm being responsive to your questions. If I look at frequency, the one thing I would tell you, at least I would encourage you, look at the time sequence of frequency because individual data points can be sort of interesting, but all over the map. So if we look at sort of through the second quarter, we were right in line with the industry. And so nothing particularly notable there on frequency. And we did have, and I'm sure it's been a story, obviously, a couple of companies, big companies, very credible companies reported frequency that was considerably higher than the industry. This quarter, we're reporting frequency up and not dramatically so. So I'm going to break that down a little bit and try to give you a sense of how with -- or our thinking around that is. So BI and PD are sort of in the 4 range. And frankly, from my perspective, if you remember, this time a year ago, we're at negative. So recognize percentage change over a prior data point is important as well. But 3 to 5, I would tell you, my expectations of any reasonable period of time, maybe not a single data point or a quarter, 3 to 5 on bodily injury tells me, sort of, we're in reasonable normal range. So we're not seeing anything on frequency that is shocking or different than or inconsistent with our expectations for the future. And I say expectations for the future because that's what it all comes down to is how are you priced for June of next year, not necessarily tomorrow. So the one place on frequency that I would say is a bit more of a call-out is the collision. Collision is up around 6%. And while it hasn't necessarily been a data point consistent with prior data points, it's not inconsistent with what we would see as the macroeconomic forces. We've reported and others have reported. I think we can do it in a little bit more quick manner that mileage on a ""month over month over month"" basis is up about 4%. So miles driven definitely are up. We measure that through our Snapshot. I have the most recent month, and that seems to be consistent with the annual trend. We have 1 or 2 spikes, Labor Day weekend, those sorts of things. But for the most part, I think of mileage being up 4% year-over-year. That's really consistent with the trend on gasoline consumption, but again, we've got too many factors to go into there with gas efficiencies and so on and so forth. So we know that, that's a driver. I would say, as you think about the effective frequency, you also factor in, of course, severity. And we are in a very nice position with our severity management, specifically on our bodily injury claims. So you actually see our severity there almost offsetting the frequency. That's a string I don't expect to last forever. We're always trying to improve our claims processes. And you know that they're certainly ones we're very, very proud of, but we've found ways that we think we can even improve that. That's been an ongoing initiative inside of claims. So we have a nice offset for now, but frequency will be the thing to watch. But we are not shocked that it's in that sort of longer-term, normal range, or I call it normal range, 3 to 5. Collision has both a frequency uptick and a severity uptick. That would be something that while it doesn't cause us headaches from a reserving perspective as much as a bodily injury or UMPD might, that's certainly something that, as you would detect hopefully from my letter, don't get behind on pricing. Make sure that we don't assume that today's prices last forever. And the key for us, and I -- hopefully, I tried to give a little color on this, if you take all of these factors, a little bit of a change in frequency, definitely some moving parts in severity, try to see what the real norms are, try to project the future and make sure that we take that pricing in increments that doesn't disturb our momentum and doesn't shock our customers and certainly doesn't get us behind the eight ball. That's clearly a very complex set of estimations, but that's the real issue for now. And I don't see any signs of either frequency or severity that are unmanageable in the light of being able to also be able to be very nimble and quick and adjusting our pricing. And I'll come back to a statement that we made, because all of this can be summarized with a rather pithy phrase we made at our IR meeting that said 3 1s are better than 1 3. And what we meant there was recognizing all these changes happen, next month's single-quarter points will be different. It's really just matching that trend over time. And the single biggest macro driver, frequency, I would agree with most of the other comments in the industry, mileages there. I noted last time, you also need to be very conscious of mileage and how it's being used. So trips over 15 miles, that is the place we're actually seeing mileage increasing versus the commuting to work more often. That clearly doesn't happen. Does that hit most of your request?"

I'm not going to give you our indications, but I -- probably more than I've ever done before. We'd tell you instantaneously, our indications are not positive. So that's a good place to be. The real issue is taking a little bit of rate to stay on the crest of the breaking wave and not go over it. That is the challenge, and that's the challenge I outlined. I don't think, a, I am willing and nor do I think it is necessary for us to sacrifice our #1 commitment to shareholders, and that is to produce an aggregate 96 for our products. For a close observer, you will notice that Direct, which is growing very, very well, will have, at least on an accident year basis, a little bit of pressure on it relative to that 96. It's a complicated message to say we'll never sacrifice the 96. But can I expect that with a higher and very satisfactory inflow of new business in Direct, that I would be more comfortable operating an accident year aggregate for that part of the business, higher than a 96? You bet you. Because we know how that business runs up. We have high confidence. We're not betting on the future. That's a simple bet. And if we can take on the new business where we think that's appropriate, we're going to do that. So don't expect us to be moving in directions of cutting back our advertising. We think we've got the momentum. We're going to keep that momentum. We're just going to keep a little bit of rate coming along so that our rates stay and keep us on the crest of that wave. And frankly, these are market conditions that are extraordinary for us. And it's up to us to make sure that we ride them out as best we possibly can."

This is -- comes back to the same statement I just said, 3 1s better than 1 3. It's a question of how you take rate. We have certainly been on these calls and told you that we've taken rate in larger quantities. That was absolutely the right thing to do. We needed to do it. But it has an equal and opposite offset on affecting consumers and putting consumers into the shopping marketplace. Clearly, there's no perfect number, but we do a lot of work on elasticity of the consumer relative to the size of rate change that they can absorb. And also, you have to sort of factor in the competitive environment. So right now, we're seeing a lot of rate action, greater rate action than we ever needed to take this year in all channels, but certainly, the Agency channel. And as a result, we're competitive in that channel and it's shown by our new apps. Can we sustain a gradual rate increase to match our future expectations of trend? Yes, I think we absolutely can and shouldn't be assumed that it's quite as dramatic as a binary kind of take rate, therefore, growth comes up. We're really trying to signal. And my comment, while designed or not, about the paranoia that I have is exactly that. It's how can you just keep creeping your rate in. And for some close observers of Progressive, we actually have some things built in structurally to our rate order in many states where we actually have ways of matching continuous inflation or trend. And those are ways to keep all changes relatively low, so we don't shock the consumer, and we don't want to do that, but at the same time, keep up with trends. So the answer to your question is, we almost certainly will have to take some rate in all channels over a reasonable period of time. This is not an industry where rates yet are systemically going down. So we'll do that. The real question and the only question I think is on the table for the continued momentum of Progressive, can we match that in small increments and stay right with inflation, and we have a perfect opportunity to be able to do that."

We, obviously, consider the premium-to-surplus ratios the regulators require by line of coverage, maybe require is a strong word, but generally look to. Obviously, the rating agencies as well. So there's greater capital requirements in property. Where we're very comfortable with auto at a 3:1, property, you can think of probably half that, and we consider that into our capital models and ensure that we continue to have plenty of contingency capital. And to the other question around dividends and capital deployment, we are very much comfortable at call it our balanced range. So we're doing modestly different things in terms of capital management, given ASI. But again, it's a pretty small piece of our business now, pretty conservatively managed with reinsurance, so not a big deal at the total balance sheet level."

But I think it's coming, and I would just say, give me another quarter to confirm that. And I'll confirm it or tell you exactly what's going on. I had thought that we probably would be able to do a more positive statement about Agency retention in the third quarter. When you can't do it, don't do it. With regard to Platinum, recognize Platinum for now is going to be a very small part of the business. So that's going to be hard to see blend in to the entire retention trend. That probably will be more something we'll start to call out for you more deliberately because you just simply won't be able to pull it out of the macro numbers. And that's fine. We'll be happy to sort of give you, at least, color as to our expectation on Platinum. But we can start with a very clear assumption that I have given. Part of the reason why ASI and Progressive are working the way they're working together is that we had no doubt from our first work in PHA that when customers bundle, they have highly retentive behavior. And there is nothing that has suggested to us that, that is not going to play out in the scenarios that we have in place on the Direct side and now on the Platinum side. So Platinum's pretty exciting for us and for the Agency. So we look at it as a source of growth in the Agency. We look at it as a source of new customer mix, and we certainly look at it as a source of customer mix that will show different retention behaviors longer than we have typically experienced, so all positives on that one."

And what we're seeing with our latest product model is more mixed to multicar, which inherently retains longer, more mix towards full coverage, towards customers who have their insurance in place for a longer period. So that's new business mix. That takes a while to move into the book to affect overall retention levels. But while we're seeing our current book getting a little more stable and improving in terms of retention, we're getting new business in that we think will retain longer as well.

Those are the same states. There's just a slight bit of delay. And then you've also heard us talk about the new model for Snapshot. That's really all part of 8.3 as well. So the same states will have each of those. And I've reported previously both disappointment with uptake in Snapshot by the Agency channel and the new product model offering a discount upfront has actually moved the needle on that. I would be far away from suggesting it's gotten to the Direct levels. It hasn't, but it has gone in the range of double what it was. So a new Snapshot model also leads to what we fully expect is longer retention, simply because those who get the right rates are likely to stay in the marketplace and they won't be able to necessarily shop for a better rate than that. Having said all of that, we've also told you that there will be the opportunity for a smaller percentage of the book to get rate increases, though some of those people will be more inclined to leave. So we'll try over the next year to give you a very clear picture of the moving parts that involve in retention, but we would -- sitting here today, we would be disappointed if we didn't see the Agency retention start to track on a nice upward path.

Actually, your point on adverse selection is not a bad one either. Obviously, Snapshot work is trying to find people with what we believe, as a group, will be lower frequency and bring them into the book, welcome them in at a rate level that is good. And for those that have what we consider to be high frequency likely behaviors, they may not join us as rapidly. So there is some adverse selection. We hope it's actually not adverse to us. We will -- it's almost impossible to answer your question specifically. We have to do our indications based on forward-looking estimates of frequency and severity. We combine them. We call it pure premium. And that's going on, on a daily basis, and I mean daily. We will make estimates, and we have estimates. They are probably a little bit tamer than the single data point at the last quarter. And if that data point continues to start to suggest it's a little bit more of a time sequence, we will adjust very quickly for that. The point that I've been trying -- I, hopefully, have been making is we will take what we see now in small increments. So even if we get higher frequency or higher severity in the future, we can -- we're already on path to have placed that in. We just don't want to get behind the curve on doing that. And if we saw something -- it's not a single rate revision. We don't take rates across the country on a single day. We're taking rates all the time. It's a very dynamic structure. We've spent a lot of time and money making sure our systems can allow us to take rate changes relatively quickly, and that's the key. If you've got some uncertainty, take a half a point, take a point. We're not ever trying to do that in the sense that the consumer is having to bear the brunt, but it's absolutely in the best long-term interest of the consumer that we can take a point now, maybe a point in 6 months, maybe a point somewhere else. That is a stylized representation of what actually happens at individual states and in individual factors and individual geographies within the state. So it's much more complex than when we talk about it in generalities. But to your more specific question, if we can see -- even though we think the long-term frequency trend will be negative, if we see on route, certain conditions, mileage so on and so forth, that start to push it up a little bit, we will be very active in changing our longer-term estimates. And when I mean longer-term here, I don't mean the very long term. I mean the life of the price point that will exist in the marketplace. Another advantage that we have is we try to leave those price points in the marketplace as limited a time as possible. So it might be that we change them 3 or 4 times in a year. And the higher number of times we change them, we're more able to adapt to the estimates that we see as we look to price for that future period. So keeping the trend period as short as possible often works to our advantage."

But it seems like just psychologically that, that's a different value proposition, is -- the consumer may not feel like they're a great driver. Maybe they'll get a discount during that first year. And then if they're not a good driver, they'll just not renew once you guys figure that out. Have you seen -- has any of that manifested? That may be way off base, so I don't really know.

We don't have a ton of data. This has not been in the marketplace a great deal of time. So we are seeing the uptake at the Agency point of distribution to be considerably improved. And I have little doubt that there are some customers that take a discount and maybe aren't exactly the right people, and we'll determine that in the first 6 months and their renewal rate will go up. That absolutely is a scenario that can and will happen. It is, however, the smaller part of the population. And agents, I think, are now starting to see the benefit of Snapshot for the larger group of customers that they have. We're seeing, and these are early numbers, we're seeing midterm retention, i.e. in the first period actually increased and not much yet notable, which wouldn't be surprising because we haven't been in the marketplace with this product that long for an update for what I'll call that first point of truth of the 7 month over the 6 month, that point of retention, which is clearly very important. And that's where people are getting quoted either the rate that they got as an initial discount, maybe even better, maybe slightly worse than the initial discount, but it will be the rate that they can expect going forward. And there will be a number, 30% or less, that will actually get the discount taken away. And those are, obviously, people who are going to react differently on renewal. But for the most part, this is attracting more new customers of the right type, and that certainly is an indication we can give earlier than getting retention estimates. We're seeing the kind of right credit mix, the right age and vehicle mix. So the mix of customers that are opting for Snapshot is actually meeting expectations in that regard, maybe even better. And just for one slight correction to your question, this product exists both in the Agency and the Direct channel, so it's available to both. So we really do have a lot of experience at much higher levels of acceptance on the Direct channel. About 1/3 of our sales are being made with Snapshot, so we have a really lot of data. And while there will almost certainly, as there is in every part of our business, be some aberrant behavior, some fraud, whatever it might be, the greater good here is far outweighing any concerns that we have about the individuals."

The time series that we think is more reflective of future trends. So we take 2 things into consideration, historic trend and future trend. We're always making that estimate. And as we see individual data points that change that trend, either instantaneously or long term, we will adjust that future trend. But the future trend is not going to be nearly as volatile as a single data point or a single quarter. As I said, if we go back a year from now, we were reporting negative frequency, and so we're reporting a positive frequency over a negative frequency last year. The longer-term trend might be quite different, if you sort do 2 or 3, and don't do my math on that one. I'm just giving you an example. So we do feel comfortable with our rates because we're never stable. It's not like rate level was, a, at the beginning of the year hasn't changed. If you take a look at the market in general from a premium weighted perspective and there's going to be a standard deviation that is higher than normal or what I would consider normal. But you're going to look at rate that has changed for most competitors somewhere between 2 to 3.5, maybe get a little closer, clustering 3 -- 2.5, 3.5 of more recent times. We would be at the lower end but in that range, so we're continuing to take our rates up. And that's the point I'm making with comp. Our rate trend has approximated our pure premium trend. My comment that says I'm always, always concerned and we as an organization are always concerned, if that future trends change, then we need to just dial up our rate trend to meet it. But it's not a major right-hand turn. If we were at -- and I'll just make this number up, I'm just making it up. But if we were at 2.4 on an annualized rate take and that was matching with trend, future trend, all coverages in, and we see that go to 2.6 or a 2.8, then we'll dial up our rate trend and take it in small increments. So yes, there are data points that tell you and tell me watch out. It's probably not staying constant. No news there for us. Probably even though we believe long term, things will go down, now may not be the time. Why? We don't know the macroeconomic influences of mileage driven. And frankly, I'd tell you, if you break it down, which we must do, bodily injury, PD or human BI and PD, they're not doing anything to me that is sort of outside the norm of what I've seen through my career and most us in Progressive. PIP, frankly, is a highly variable coverage, and we've had many discussions in this setting about PIP frequency and severity. And that one just -- you almost just have to stay on it for the moment and be able to price for it as quickly as possible. But those PIP and collision and PD are shorter payout coverages. So we can actually adjust our pricing for those quickly, and it doesn't have the same carryover that a severity change in BI might to our reserves. So a long answer, but last quarter, I felt that we had our future pricing trends compatible with our expectations of future frequency and severity. We've just reported to you that we actually have some positive trend, positive in the sense of very attractive trends on severity of management of our bodily injury. We have to put those together. We're also -- we were reporting that we've seen a slight uptick in frequency. The offset of one to the other is important, and we just need to make sure that we're getting that future pricing trend to match our expectation of the future costs. But frankly, this is not a -- and I want to be clear here, for us, this is a pretty nice position to be in. I don't want the marketplace to be totally static. We think we've got an advantage when it's moving around because we are nimble and we can take rate changes and adjust up or down, much more likely to be up than down, as need be to keep that matching going. And we match into smaller increments as we can."

And so if I'm getting 4% in premium, does that mean, kind of just simple math, there's a little bit more potential for margin compression. But obviously, things could bump around. So is that the right way to think about it?"

Pure premium is the product of frequency and severity. And yes, we try to project that out. So future trend is what we talk about. We're trying to predict the product frequency and severity out through the course of the period in which our rates will be in effect, plus our cost structure. Cost structure obviously is very competitive. Both expense ratio and LAE, they're not the lowest in the marketplace. They are sort of top 3-ish in both categories. So we project those out to create the rates. And yes, we're trying to keep up with that pure premium trend. So the math you're doing, while it's -- we give you, obviously, pretty high-level numbers there, is the math we do to set the rates. And again, that average premium, if you look over time, as reflected in the combined ratios, kept up with trend."

You can correct me if I'm wrong on that. So our accident year, loss and LAE is around 74. You add in our expense ratio, and you come to a number that is comfortably below 96. So we're approaching that 96, and we're cognizant of that, and appropriately taking rate as needed. That bodily injury trend that we discussed in terms of severity is what is driving the change in reserves and the positive development. So we think that is a systemic change, meaning we see why bodily injury severity is down. We think it's as a result of actions we take in our claims department to be more accurate in our settlements. We have more initiatives in the works to ensure that we continue to be as accurate as possible in injury settlements. So while we can't project where that severity line is going to go with tremendous accuracy, obviously, that's what we're charged with doing in our pricing group and our reserving group. We feel pretty good about where our reserves sit today and, again, can see the source of those changes. And in aggregate accident year basis, we are below that 96 and thinking of that well managed going forward."

Frequency is what it is. We're not living on a isolated island from our competitors. So while there will always be statistically different numbers reported, they all come from the same ecosystem of roads, drivers and vehicles. However, that's not true when we all have different mixes in different states and different types of drivers, rural, urban. It really does get quite tricky. I tried to put a small note in my cover letter that really suggests that we do a lot of work to try to make sure that we understand frequency at a level that we can at least reconcile with all the data points in the marketplace. But I would tell you that managing frequency better than anyone else is something I'm not sure that we're going to put our hand in the air and say, ""We can take credit for that."" It is what it is. If everybody measures it the same way, it should be a representative, for example, of the overall industry, especially for larger players. Having said that, the point I'd make, and I will just use -- don't bring it up and use a competitor, but Geico's mix in New York is very different than our mix in New York. So as frequency in New York is different than in other state, that will show up, and you need to be very careful to draw conclusions about whether frequency is up or frequency in a specific place is up. I did mention before that Snapshot has a long-term benefit, we believe, of attracting lower-frequency drivers and, in some sense, making sure attracting them simply because we offer them the rate that we believe is best appropriate for their level of driving or their diligence and their driving behavior. That's what we've always said about Snapshot. It really is the first significant variable that is more causal than correlated. So most of the data that we deal with is correlated. Snapshot is causal. And to the extent that attracts lower-frequency drivers because of the lower pricing, then the long-term effect of that will be very interesting. That is awfully hard even for us to make a meaningful estimate of how we're managing frequency for our book versus the competitors. But that's one example of managing frequency. I would tell you, most of our effort is around managing severity and making sure our claims are paid the correct way and very fair but the exact right way. We see through segregation and other influences that there are high variances in claims, competency throughout the industry, or I won't say competency as much as claims practices. And we try to make sure our claims practices are absolutely fair and absolutely have the best loss cost management so that we can pass that on to the consumer in long-term pricing. So that's -- I can't say much more about managing frequency than our Snapshot. Overall, it will sort of work the way it works, except for mix differences."
